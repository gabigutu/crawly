		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of all time... fighting that is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly... this is my favorite movie of all time. I'm a huge action fan and this movie remains to this day my favorite fighting movie... nay, favorite movie period, of all time. Granted, there is no good acting and there was no reason for all the splits the man performs, but damn it the tournament was the greatest in-movie fighting tournament I've ever seen. Never duplicated or improved upon. Yes, they did stereotype everyone in the world.... literally, but boy was it funny... and oh so entertaining to see how they put the fights together.Greatest fighting movie of all time... a perfect cult classic... and the ultimate treat for the Van Damm fan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Martial Arts Movie from the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had never seen a van Damme-movie before this one. And oh boy, I was surprised in a really positive way. The best thing about this movie is that it's from the 80's. That means really GREAT music, and in this movie, the music makes up a really magnificent atmosphere for the viewer through the whole film. Of course, the fighting is good. It's not just good, it's great. It was really exciting to see different fighting styles from all over the world. And Bolo Yeung did a really great job as the villain. He barely talks, but shows with his behavior that he is Mr. ruthless himself. The final fight with van Dammes trademark, the 360-kick, shown several times in slow motion, is a feast for the eye. Hong Kong is the location for the movie, and the city fits perfectly for it. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Dammes VS Bolo Yeung for the first time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie all about fighting,and the fact that it is based on a true story just makes it better. This is the first time Van Damme fights Bolo Yeung and it is a spectacular fight he also fights him in Double impact. Bolo is the perfect evil guy and his fighting style is one of a kind.They dont make movies like this anymore. Bad acting and story,but you gotto love it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'best martial arts film of the century'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is, and always will be, Van Damme's greatest display of his martial talent. While it seems to have a similar storyline to other martial arts films, this one differs in that it is based on the true events of Frank Dux, who also assisted the fighters for this movie.Anyone at all that doubts Van Damme's talent as a fighter, should see this film.Bolo Yeung also makes a spectacular appearance as the evil one in the tournament. He acts about as cruel and heartless as one can get, and he makes the perfect climax for the film.If you are after a good quality martial arts film, and you haven't seen Bloodsport, then this is the one for you. If you have seen it, then you will know why it deserves the title of 'best martial arts film of the century'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mother was on the verge of death a few years ago( boob cancer). In her hospital room there was TV and VCR, so i thought to bring her some movies. Well, I accidentally brought my copy of BloodSport-along with Fried Green Tomatoes. I left the videos with her, and when I returned the next day I was surprised to see her cheering along with Van Damme as he was beating the large Asian Man.A few days later, she was walking around and trying to perform some of the stunts she saw in her new favorite movie. I even saw the copy of Fried Green Tomatoes in the trash bin.The next week the Doctor came to me and said he witnessed a miracle. It seems my mother's cancer had disappeared.She checked out of the hospital and told me she had to meet the man who cured her of her wicked disease: Van Damme.So me and my mom set out in a beat up VW Bug and headed towards Hollywood. But that's a different story all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this man. His acting wasn't very good. (I do think though it improved over time... a little.) Bloodsport was inspiration for a whole generation to start learning martial arts. A Cult movie. I grew up some of my life in Asia and it amuses me to see those buff cliché white men jumping around through colourful, but grubby marketplaces/ back alleys. In fact the whole movie is simple and has even a nice tidy cliché structure: Man starts terribly, improves through tough training and develops into sexy fighting machine. Some people who commented on this movie said he is no Bruce Lee. But that is the beauty of it. He is somebody from a western country trying to measure up and fit into the eastern culture. Good stuff.</fullReview>

The movie takes you to a world of fighting where "only the strongest wins". Jean Claude van Damme as Frank Dux, a young, talented martial artist. This was THE movie for van Damme, beside Kickboxer, he has never preformed so well.Watch &amp; Enjoy !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best martial arts movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you look at the rating for this film it is only 5.8 percent at present that is a serious understatement of this films genius. This film deserves a much more higher rating. Okay its not an Oscar winner for acting, but who cares! its not about acting its about true martial arts and fighting on the big screen and Bloodsport brings this to you superbly. One of my favourite movies it also provides the Rocky pump, as in like Rocky it has the emotion both in action and through the films music and the fighting makes you want to get up and starting punching and kicking anything! and you don't get that sort of feeling with many films. Rocky had it and Bloodsport has it, and if a fighting film makes you get up and fight your living room wall then its a winner! Van Damme is excellent, his fighting manoeuvres are breathtaking, the range of different styles of fighters is great and well know martial artist Bolo Yeung's destruction of all opponents is wonderfully filmed, and as Van Dammes main contender we have a great adventure. All the fighters give great performances and the fighting scenes are superb. Great performance from big Donald Gibb as the hilarious Ray Jackson. His running punch on his first opponent is worth watching for that alone! Donald Gibb is excellent and brings humour to the role as well as some excellent and sometimes hilarious no nonsense fighting! The story too is superb, the kumite bringing the worlds greatest fighters together and by invitation only and the location also brilliant. Hiden in the depths of Hong Kong badlands. A winner in all departments. I remember watching this with friends and going out in the garden for some Bloodsport kicking and punching well not each other, thin air! but it makes you feel alive. Not many films do that. 10/10 for me. Fantastic film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gay Karate Guy" makes his best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge Van Damme fan, but I have seen (and commented on) several of his movies. When you watch Van Damme, you want to see bad acting, bad accents, decent action, and several slow motion kicks to the face. Bloodsport delivers like no other.Let's just start with the acting. Van Damme was not quite full of himself at this point in his career, having played "Gay Karate Guy" in 1984's Monaco Forever, so he's actually not as bad as usual. His main supporting actor is Donald Gibb, best known for playing Ogre in the Revenge of the Nerds movies. He basically plays Orge in this movie, too, although he doesn't shout "NERDS!" He should have, but he didn't. That is why this is 8 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10. Forest Whitaker is in this, too. Apparently, being a supporting actor in Platoon, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Color of Money, Stakeout and Good Morning Vietnam was not enough credit to land him the coveted role of the main military policeman that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme (!) in this film. Instead, the actor with the best film credits in the movie is the second-in-command military policeman who serves under the person that is constantly outsmarted by Van Damme. Either the casting director was racist, or he could see into the future and knew that Forest would eventually costar in Battlefield Earth and was thus deserving of punishment. Bolo Yeung, the Asian bad guy with the huge pecks, plays a suitably evil villain at the impressive age of 50.The soundtrack is pretty awesome, too. You have a nice blend of lame 80s music combined with a strange theme song that has the refrain "Ku-mite! Ku-mite!" The song is so good, it makes you wish Ah-Ha covered it.The plot of the movie is silly. To avenge the death of his Asian friend and make his mentor proud, the military-trained Van Damme sneaks off to Asia to compete in the Kumite. This is the world's most hard-core fighting tournament and it is ultra-secret. The military doesn't want Van Damme to fight, so two men are sent to Asia to get him. They fail frequently until they eventually decide to let him compete. There is a nosy reporter woman that wants to cover the Kumite. Naturally, her main purpose in the movie is to give us a reason to see Van Damme's ass. Van Damme and Ogre become friends after Van Damme beats him in a karate video game. Ogre (for reasons unbeknownst to me) identifies Van Damme's accent as American and the two become good friends. After a shot of Van Damme beating someone up is shown in slow-motion two or three times, Ogre stands up and shouts, "That's the fastest thing I ever saw!" You see, if he hadn't said that, the audience wouldn't have known it was fast; they would have had to rely on the timer above the ring that said "new world record." Obviously, Van Damme has to fight a number of people, most of whom have comically unique styles of fighting. Just as obviously, Van Damme has to fight Bolo in the end. Van Damme has several slow motion kicks to the face and seven different times where he does the splits. Van Damme doesn't get much better than this.By the way, this is based on a true story. HA!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a film watcher that looks for great acting, i surprised myself when i enjoyed this film.Being more a film fan than a martial arts fan i was expecting to be writing a bad review for this flick. No one can deny that van damme is a great martial artist, but his acting is so so the opposite.You have to look at it as a martial arts film (which it is) and accept the stunning fight sequences (especially the final fight scene which was very well choreographed) the film offers.Yes, people will talk about how bad his acting may be, but what people forget is that he is a martial artist more than an actor. Movies are just the way he can express his great skills to an audience.I recommend this film to any martial arts fan but not so much to anyone looking for a compelling dramatic, mystical thriller because you will be disappointed.On all it's a basic, pure, martial arts film that i feel is underrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodsport is a excellent fighting film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time. Minor SpoilersBloodsport is arguably Jean-Claude Van Damme`s best film next to Hard Target. It begins with such a cool intro with the fighters and cool music by Paul Hertzog. It has a few good songs too! It has very good fighting and it is a serious movie. Here is a brief look at the film`s best competitors that are most likely to win the Kumite.Bolo Yeung as Chong Li - Chong Li is the undefeated champion that holds many records and will do anything to win a match whether it is to break a man`s leg, knock him out or even kill his opponent. He has huge muscles and there is no telling how strong he is. Every fighter is in trouble when they step in the ring against him.Jean-Claude Van Damme as Frank Dux - Frank Dux is a great fighter taught by Tanaka. He a hansome,musclar,smart,and kind man that cares. He know just about it all when it come to fighting thanks to his great master. He really cares for his new friend Jackson. Paulo Tocha as Paco - There is one kickboxer type fighter named Paco. He is a great fighter but he doesn`t block well but he has two advantages. 1. Paco`s opponent`s should not trust him when he reaches out to shake hands because he is a cheater and 2. is when he grabs ahold of his opponent its all over with!Donald Gibb as Jackson - Jackson is a massive man with a bad attitude but is a good friend to Frank Dux. He is very tuff,strong, and is able to beat up anyone though he fools around too much and that`s his only mistake.Michel Qissi as Parades - Parades has big thick legs that hits his opponents hard but like Paco he is not a good blocker and that is his only flaw.Bloodsport has many other great figters but these are top ones in the Kumite. If you like Jean-Claude Van Damme and fighting films then be sure to check this awesome Jean-Claude Van Damme movie out soon because in MY opinion it is a classic!</fullReview>

The plot and acting isn`t this movie`s strongest point but the movie delivers many great and some spectacular fight-scenes.

		<fullReview>Although it has aged quite badly as most films of this type from the eighties have, Blood Sport is a favourite from my youth and is one of Van Damme's best early efforts. There are no strings and no CG here so the fights are all the more impressive, and it is always refreshing to return to those days. The plot and characters may be simple, some of the acting may be amateurish, and the music may be dodgy but Bloodsport remains an enjoyable no-brainer for fans of the star or genre.Van Damme stars as Frank Dux, a soldier in the US Army. He has been trained by Tanaka all his life in martial arts, and wishes to travel to the infamous Kumite tournament in Hong Kong to avenge his friend's death. The Kumite is a tournament which attracts the best and most vicious fighters from around the world, many of whom are seriously injured or killed while taking part. Dux breaks orders and travels to Hong Kong, but two soldiers follow him in an attempt to bring him back. There he meets Ray Jackson, a fellow fighter and Janice Kent, a reporter trying to get an inside scoop on the tournament. From there we see many fights as Dux progresses in the tournament whose defending Champion Chong Li (Bolo Leung) is a deadly killer. Naturally they meet in the final.Once the plot devices of revenge and honour are put in place all we have to do is sit back and watch the fights. They are well-staged, there is a fair amount of violence, some humour, and the main cast do as well as could be expected. This is a must for Van Damme fans, but there will be little for anyone who does not watch martial arts movies.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his film starring debut, Jean-Claude Van Damme portrays a martial arts expert who decides to compete in the Kumite, a no holds barred martial arts competition in Hong Kong. This film has plenty of the well staged fight scenes and martial arts sequences that would be evident in Van Damme's later films. A fair entry in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must for martial arts aficionados.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this early starring vehicle, Jean-Claude Van Damme plays the real-life Frank W. Dux (as in, "Put up your Dux!"). Frank's an American soldier who goes A.W.O.L. in order to travel to Hong Kong and participate in the Kumite, a brutal, full contact martial arts tournament. It's so brutal, in fact, that some who enter the contest don't make it out alive. While Frank is pursued by government agents (played by Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker) who mean to take him back to the U.S., he makes friends with amiable giant Jackson (Donald Gibb) and attempts to romance reporter Janice Kent (Leah Ayres).There isn't much in terms of story throughout this relatively brief movie (93 minutes all told), but devotees of the action genre will get what they aim to see. "Bloodsport" is deftly edited, adequately paced, effectively gory at times, and features enough intense fighting to make it suitable entertainment. Van Damme may not have been much of an actor at this point, but he was already displaying that easygoing charm that has served him well. Gibb, best known as Ogre in "Revenge of the Nerds", delivers a lively performance as his new buddy. Ms. Ayres ("The Burning") does a decent job as the requisite romantic interest and certainly is very easy on the eyes. Burton and Whitaker are good as the government guys just trying to do their jobs; it's fun to see them attend the final matches and actually start enjoying the spectacle. Genre legend Bolo Yeung is a perfect villain as Chong Li, the reigning champion of the Kumite who's developed an enormous ego. Roy Chiao (Bruce Lee's "Game of Death") as Frank's mentor Tanaka and Philip Chan ("Double Impact") as police captain Chen are excellent in support. By the time of the big confrontation / fight at the end, sufficient rooting interest has been generated.Just before the end credits, we get a summary of the accomplishments in the real Frank Dux's life.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of those rarities where everything just fits together. The best thing is that it is still an enjoyable view even after so many years. Every actor, while limited in his "acting" ability (as if that matters to this kind of film) performs wonderfully within his expected role. The hero is great (JCVD), the sidekick is unbelievably amusing (Jackson), and the bad guy. Well, I can only say that this is the best bad guy in recorded history. Seeing JCVD in the ring, is like looking at a dancer performing his routine, very reminiscent to Bruce Lee in "Fist of Fury" when he is in the ring with like 20 Japanese karate dudes. You know it ain't real, and that the moves worth nothing in real life, but you still enjoy it tremendously. Add to that the incredible music that backs the fights and you got yourself something that you can keep watching and never get tired of. As a boy, I totally loved the movie, and probably watched it at least 20 times. Roll forward 8 years, I watched this movie as a soldier and it was still unbelievably great. Roll forward present day: I accidentally watched bloodsport II and said to myself: "Boy, this is crap, the first one was way better", and just to prove the point I watched it again, this time with my wife!! Well, my wife didn't really approve, but she liked the Persian prince so I don't think her opinion counts..., but for me, it was still an amazing movie. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes martial arts films, and especially to the guys who are tired of all the stunts and computer "enhancement" that one can get in "modern" martial arts film. Enjoy!! I know I will next time I see it (Perhaps with my children...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the genre and one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ninjutsu trained American, Frank Dux, leaves home for Hong Kong in order to be a part of the controversial Martial-Arts Tournament called the Kumite. The Kumite is a freeform, illegal, and extremely dangerous underground fighting tournament that occasionally turns deadly. Bloodsport is supposedly based on true events from the actual Frank Dux's life. Bloodsport is considered by many to be Jean-Claude Van Damme's best film as well as the film that paved the way for his international fame and cult status among martial-arts and action film fans. The fight coordinator for the film was the actual Frank Dux himself, who even allegedly took the time to put Jean-Claude Van Damme through three months worth of training in order for him to be extra prepared for the role despite the fact that Van Damme was already a championed martial-artist. Bloodsport is considered one of the biggest cult classics of the 80s.It's no surprise to me why this film is hailed so much as a martial-arts classic. While I can't say that it is quite as spectacular as... say, for example, Enter the Dragon, I still cannot deny this film's magnificence. This really is an amazing action film. Granted, it is silly at times, but if you are looking for a raw, brutal, bloody, and intense fight film, this really is one of the best that there is. The fight scenes here are some of the tightest and most jaw dropping fight scenes of it's kind. Jean-Claude Van Damme himself is a sight to behold. His kicks and splits are simply out of this world. If you haven't seen them, you simply must. It's a necessity. I can easily say that it is easily one of his most charismatic and he does go all the way with it when the time comes. His screen presence is one of the most memorable things about this film, but just as amazing this time is Sammo Hung as Frank Dux's rivaling warrior. Hung is a real beast of a man in here, and what I was impressed by was how Van Damme was able to visually convey the same sort of power as he despite the fact that he looks smaller and skinnier than Sammo Hung. Again, it's the kicks and the splits that do it, though his body does look like it's in excellent shape. I think this helped me get even more involved in the more vicious fight scenes in the film.The screenplay here is actually not too bad, especially considering the genre. We have some fairly decently fleshed out characters here and some very quick, but efficient, character development. A lot of these moments feel a lot more genuine that most are probably expecting, and this only helps the film feel more realistic. At times, Bloodsport felt borderline documentary-like in it's look and in it's approach to the fight scenes. The film actually has a lot of ground to cover in telling the life story of Frank Dux, and the whole film flows beautifully. The setting, the characters, and the things that happen to the characters all feel realistic enough. You feel like you are there. The look of the film only adds to it. It's grainy, yet colorful. Ugly, yet bright. Dull, yet saturated. The music in this picture is phenomenal and it adds so much to the fight scenes. Also hats off to Van Damme for not only convincing studio executives to allow him to reedit the film, but also convincing them to actually release. It may not have made any money, and Newt Arnold may be passed away, but this film will carry on both he and Van Damme's legacy.It's not my favorite Van Damme film, believe it or not, but it is truly a masterpiece of it's genre. This film is amazing and it has everything that you want to see in a film like this. Bloodsport is entertaining from start to finish. I think what makes this one especially good is the fact that I can recommend it to anyone, even those who aren't fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The fight scenes are easily the best part. They are brutal and wonderfully pulled off. Van Damme gives a rather charismatic performance that only helped enhance my appreciation of this film. Bloodsport is a great film. Check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodsport delivers for Van Damme's Fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is a film that I saw when I was just a kid, and just like then, I still find this movie very entertaining and one of Van Damme's best films. The film also contains some great songs that keep the movie scenes going and provide good background music and are inspirational. The movie centers around Frank Dux, a young man who sets out to Hong Kong to honor his Shidoshi- Tanaka, by fighting in the famed Kumite. Along the way he meets and becomes friends with Ray Jackson (played by Donald Gibb), who coincidentally has also come to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite. The rest of the movie shows how brutal the Kumite can be-fighters can lose their teeth, their blood, and sometimes even their lives. Frank also meets Chong Li(played by Bolo Yeung), the man who holds the record for fastest knockout. Immedietly they don't get along, and Frank gets to see how cruel Chong Li can be on the fighting ring. When Frank's new pal Jackson gets beaten senseless and sent to the hospital by Chong Li during a fight, Frank realizes that he has two new reasons for fighting in the Kumite: for his Shidoshi, and for his friend Jackson. The final battle between Chong Li and Dux is monumental-the fighting scenes were well choreographed. Frank Dux is unaware that Chong Li has a trick up his sleeve, but the two fight to the end. I recommend Bloodsport to all, especially Jean Claude's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Film of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to say that I have not seen a better film than Bloodsport.In my lifetime of 20 odd years, I have seen plenty of films. The Martial Arts genre is unique, and one musn't compare it to other types of movies because they are like apples and oranges. Therefore, I will say it is the greatest martial arts film of all time, and in my mind, better than anything else I have seen, even though it is hard to compare it to non-m.a. films. This movie is more than just about fighting. It transcends the entertainment value it was made to provide. This story is about Dux's journey through life, and his struggle to bring honour to his Shidoshi. He is not in it for money, or bragging rights, but simply for honour. Now how many people in today's world care about honour? Not very many. This is one out of many reasons why I love and am inspired by this movie. Sometimes one must undergo great pain and sacrifice to honour and respect someone or something. And that is an important lesson.</fullReview>

That's proof that the acting was actually very, very well done.So sick of people saying the acting was bad when nobody could've played those roles any better.It's just like Stallone in Rambo.

		<fullReview>"Bloodsport," the 1988 debut vehicle of Belgian martial artist and "actor" Jean-Claude Van Damme, opens with one of the most impressive montages of fighters preparing for the Kumite, an illegal full-contact mixed martial arts tournament held in Hong Kong. It gets the audience ready for the bloodiest cultural display of martial arts combat in decades.We're told that there are three ways to win a match in the Kumite:1) You knock the guy out2) The opponent gives up and shouts "matte," which is like saying uncle3) You knock the other fighter right off the matEnter into the picture, clean-shaved United States military intelligence officer Frank Dux (Van Damme), of whom this film's story is supposedly based off of. Dux became the first Westerner to win the Kumite, after going AWOL from his post (and two officers including Norman Burton and an underused Forest Whitaker are dispatched to retrieve him), and used his superior combat training, indomitable spirit, and iron will to defeat the legions of vicious opponents sent his way. Dux (like, "put up your dukes") is first introduced as a teenager, coming under the tutelage of a venerable martial arts master who instructs the young man in a brutal regiment of non-stop combative training to prepare him for the Kumite.Once in Hong Kong, Dux befriends fellow American Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb), also a Kumite fighter, and the two prepare for combat. There is a lot of mystery surrounding this illegal martial arts tournament, which has its origins in ancient Chinese culture. No one will talk about it, especially to nosy reporters like Janice Kent (Leah Ayres), much less pick fights outside the ring, which would result in an automatic disqualification if a brawl took place outside the Kumite.When it comes time for the action of the great tournament, 40 or so fighters look over one another, eager in anticipation of jumping into the ring and duking it out. But Dux and Ray are prepared, but nothing can ready them for the hulking South Korean fighter and current Kumite champ Chong Li ("Enter the Dragon" Bolo Yeung), who has a reputation for fighting dirty and is rumored to have once killed one of his opponents.The validity of Dux's story and military background have come under intense scrutiny in recent years but I'm not paying any attention to it. All I can do is pay attention to what's in front of me. "Bloodsport" is a perfect star-making vehicle for the Muscles From Brussels, though some studio execs didn't think so. Van Damme had to fight like there was no tomorrow to get "Bloodsport" released and even then, the critics were still not impressed but who cares? It's no where near as bad as it was made out to be, it still made the man a star, and the basis for one of my favorite fighters from "Mortal Kombat," Johnny Cage.Director Newt Arnold keeps a fine pace but the only things that seem to hold it back are some cheesy moments of levity and Van Damme's acting (surprise, surprise). Again, who cares? "Bloodsport" is a martial arts movie, first and foremost - why a need for acting? When the combat begins (with action choreographed by the real-life Dux himself), blood flows as one fighter after the other is knocked out leaving a titanic duel between only-standing Dux to duke it out with the brutal Chong Li. In between, though, we see many great styles from all over the world including straight-up Chinese gong-fu, Karate, Hapkido (my own current style of training), Capoeira, Sumo, Monkey, Muay Thai, and some good old-fashioned American brawling.Even in recent years, "Bloodsport" is still a wholly decent affair that does get bogged down in some cheap Hollywood theatrics. Van Damme doesn't seem to be fairing well either in these times, but we still have this film and some of his good earlier works to appreciate.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorites, its a classic. Its based on a true story about Frank Dux a guy from America who has been trained by a dieing Japanese karate tribe and who wants to honor his master (dijistu?) by fighting in a ruthless hardcore competition that is called the kumete. All the while hes doing this hes got a lot of things going on. Its not like its a deep thought provoking movie like fight club, but its got some awesome fight scenes and The thing is this REALLY happened. It has some awesome jean claude van dam scenes (duh) in it and idk you have to watch it, its kickass. So just go and enjoy. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is good fun at its best. The storyline is average, the acting is okay, but I had a good time watching it, and that is what counts. As Frank Dux,Jean-Claude Van Damme , enters the Kumite, an illegal martial arts tournament. The police are after him, his competition is fierce and there is no mercy where he is heading. Each fighter has his own style of fighting. This is what makes this movie the most interesting. Being a martial arts film, this is probably one of the most famous ones, and for Jean-Claude Van Damme, his best movie. Well recommended if you are a fan of the genre, other wise you might be disappointed. This is Jean-Claude at his best!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Fun! Van Damme's Best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I revisited Bloodsport for the first time since my initial viewing at the theater in 1988. Surprisingly, the movie holds up well...far better than I was expecting...and probably better than the dubious history of real-life fighter(?) Fred Dux.Upon my initial viewing one of my problems with Bloodsport was the lack of flashy fighting sequences. But, in today's MMA world the fights look pretty darn good and with the exception of the bouncy-guy and the finale with the over-the-top acting, the rest of the fighting rings surprisingly realistic.Bloodsport was VanDamme's first movie and it still holds up as one of his best. I have a soft-spot in my heart for Timecop as well. If you're in the mood for a simple bubblegum movie on a Friday night, then this is a great flashback to the hey-day of 1980s action movies. The pod-cast Don and his Amazing Friend recently did an episode reviewing the movie which is worth listening to (www.donandhisamazingfriend.com).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bloodsport' certainly suffers from all of the problems any movie from this era and of this genre naturally would, but just as Frank Dux triumphs over Chong Li, so too does 'Bloodsport' conquer the cheese factor.Jean Claude Van Damme may not exactly be De Niro, but he has an easy, natural charisma that lifts everything around him. Combined with his impressive physical gifts--here at their absolute peak--and you have a star making turn.Filled with colorful characters, fun fights and a host of awesome 80s trappings, 'Bloodsport' is a genre essential, and a Van Damme classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably best Round Robin Martial Arts Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my notes on Bloodsport: 1. The film that launched JCVD. I shudder to think that out there in film land, there are legions of viewers who accidentally stumbled on some other of his 8 zillion films as their first "JCVD experience" and then, when that particular film had ended, turned to the nearest living person they could find and simply said one word ... WHY? Because you really really really need to see this JCVD film first, before any other of his films (except Timecop, which doesn't really count, because it was so different from his usual roles and his usual films) to grasp why this man became an overnight hit, and why the films he is currently producing -- films that look like they were shot on an iPhone and edited in the back of a Tesla -- still manage to find an audience. 2. A great film. An entertaining film. A well-acted film. A film you could see over and over. 3. Possibly the best (or at least top-tier) in the round-robin fight genre, where different contenders vie for a prize. What most fight film directors keep forgetting is that, for the formula to work, each fight must build on what came before. This is the template. They nailed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>VAN DAMME AT HIS VERY BEST. Even the Japanese version of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bolo Yeung, can't beat him.It's as a good a film like this can get. It's so damn 80's. The fight scenes are incredible (especially that black guy, who jumps around like a monkey. He's just amazing.).Don't judge the acting in this film. Even Forest Whitaker's acting is lazy. But if you enjoy bad acting this film will entertain you. Add some good one-liners and you have BLOODSPORT.So if you like action films, Van Damme and the 80's you have to see this film. It's one hell of a damn good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's definitely time we reviewed this classic! As you surely know, Frank Dux (Van Damme) is an "American" martial artist who has gone through rigorous training since he was a kid by his master Tanaka (Chiao). When Frank takes part in the most underground, no-holds-barred, to-the-death fighting tournament in the world, the Kumite, most people try to stop him. That includes love interest Janice Kent (Ayres), and Dux's army superiors Helmer (Burton) and Rawlins (Whitaker). But Dux becomes buddies with Ray Jackson (Gibb), a charismatic tough man, and they support each other. But will anyone have what it takes to defeat the sinister, murderous fighter Chong Li (Bolo)? Man, did Cannon really hit one out of the park this time. Not only did it set the careers of Van Damme and Forest Whitaker in motion, it almost singlehandedly set the mold for all the many Punchfighters to come. Of course, to the Bloodsport people, it's not just fighting, it's a "martial science". I guess martial arts are just too lowbrow for them. The Kumite has no weight divisions, so hulking brutes fight against skinny wimps without a second thought. Guys even have quirky, unique styles, and even the "knockoffs" are quality productions - look at Shootfighter (1992). And the "knockoff" even spawned a sequel! Such is the awesome power of Bloodsport. But they say the word "Kumite" many times, so that's this movie's version of Best of the Best 2 (1993)'s constant repetition of the word "Brakus". When these action movie people come up with a good word, they really don't let you forget it. JCVD never gets tired of showing us that he can spread his legs widely (and weirdly), and he has plenty of funny facial expressions. He's supposed to be American, but his accent is pretty thick - "Belglish" is a bit more like it. He and Ogre have good chemistry together. Sure, Gibb is great, and he brings the movie up, but what would it be like had the role been played by Jack S. Daniels? But Van Damme as the "spiritual warrior" and Gibb as the brash basher is a winning combo. It's colorful, it's fun, it's entertaining, and it's fast paced. It also has some great songs and Hong Kong locations. What more could you ask for? Also there are some first-generation tasers on display, as well as other cool 80's stuff like the Karate Champ arcade game. If you haven't yet, see the much-imitated but never duplicated charm of Bloodsport.</fullReview>

It was just master against master with no wires, tricks, or computer generated mastery.The acting is bad of course, but who watches a martial arts movie for the acting.....the fight scenes more than make up for it.It would be great if he could go back to making this type of movie rather than trying to take himself serious as a dramatic actor...Again, the fight scenes are awesome...just fast forward the rest..

		<fullReview>To think that this movie is well over twenty years old and that Van Dammes voice has become so low since then is amazing.Probably the only movie that could become a video game, Bloodsport is Van Dammes movie through and through, from a time when the star was already hailed as a superstar before their first proper movie was released (see Seagal: above the law).Riffing on Enter the Dragon and very loosely based on fact, this is by the numbers action. fighters from every culture and country join the 'Kumite', a tournament so special, it has a song about it.Van damme is a soldier who has gone AWOL to join the fight, in honour of his shodoshi. as the film and fights progress, he becomes friends with a hairy biker, becomes enemies with Bolo, and flashes his behind to a journalist.it's classic stuff, with cheesy one-liners, silly sub-plots and an amazingly awful electro soundtrack to back it up. but this is why it's loved by so many people, it doesn't take itself seriously, it's not art, it's the type of movie that after each fight sequence, you could go to the shop, come back and not have missed a thing.it's a showcase for Van Damme, and it does it's job.Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the first martial arts movie I've seen. I've watched it probably more than a hundred times and still didn't get tired of it. It's not only about fighting scenes, they were pretty good, though sometimes looked too fake,but still there was some nice moves and some bloody moments who were very impressive. But like I said, it's not only about martial arts, it's a great movie in other terms too. There was many touching moments, like that dialog between Frank Dux and Tanaka at his son's funeral or the last fighting scene. There was many other touching moments and I would like to write about it but I'm afraid, it may spoil the movie. The soundtrack was great, it really fit in this film. After Bloodsport, many similar movies were made, some of them had a better fighting scenes but still this is my favorite movie of this type and will always have a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloodsport. Oh the childhood memories of watching a bunch of dudes beating the absolute crap out of each other. Yeah, the story's a no-brainer; its the eighties after all and these films didn't have a deep plot to begin with which is acceptable. Back in those days, the fight scenes were much better compared nowadays with all the hyper-edited, attention deficit disorder fight scenes that todays movies have. It's a shame that most directors don't sit up and take notice of these past films and turn up much better product on their part. Can't say anymore about this film but its fight scenes are great despite being a little annoyed at seeing Van Damme doing the same kick over and over again. Good lord, is that his signature move? Shouldn't matter because it's made so long ago. And Forest Whitaker is in it!! It's a solid flick just to kick back to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the years go by and the world is more subjected to MMA, UFC and K-1 events in the mainstream, the one that started it all had to have been Bloodsport. Think about it, did anyone give a damn about K-1, MMA or anything like that in the early 1980's? Out comes this movie and 20 years later kickboxing has become more popular than regular boxing and wrestling.Based on true events, Bloodsport centers around a secret underground kickboxing tournement called the Kumite (pronounced Koo-Mitt-Tay) that has been around for thousands of years. Jean Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux (as in put up your dukes), an American of French decent who stumbles upon an old Chinese martial arts teacher who teaches him the way of the warrior so to speak. Many years later the teacher is near death and Frank pledges to win the Kumite in his honor. Standing in his way is Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) , the current champion along with Helmer and Rawlins (Forrest Whitaker), two American agents assigned to bring Dux back to the US unharmed since its revealed Dux is a captain in the US military and wasn't supposed to be in this thing.I say the actual Kumite scenes were done well in terms of the actual fighting but the transition and timing was downright awful. In one scene Chong Li snaps Suan Parades (Tong Po from Kickboxer) leg and then the next scene shows Dux fighting someone else with Parades sitting in the stands unharmed. I think the Parades/Chong fight was supposed to be one of the last but it fit better in the music montage so they jumped the gun with it. Later on the big sumo Pumala is visbily shown sitting behind Jackson and Lin, and while he's fighting Dux and Monkey Man you can clearly see him sitting in the same spot while he's supposed to be on the runway. Also, Dux and Chong Li looked to have fought about 10 guys between them in the first 2 days of the tournement yet Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) fights twice on the first day yet makes it to the last fight of the second day? One last thing, Dux beat his guy in 12 seconds to set the world record and later on I timed a fight where Chong Li beat a black guy in 6 seconds....wouldn't that mean he got his record back? The good news is the actual fighting and different styles more than made up for the clumsy editing and the story lines/sub plot fit well with the overall point. Donald Gibb was hilarious in his role, and its always nice to see Tong Po with hair. Bolo Yeung looks younger than Van Damme and was a short time away from his 50th birthday during the course of filming, I didn't even believe it until I checked the bio....hell he's pushing 75 now and I bet he could make a comeback in one more flick.I don't want to give away too much but if you want full contact bloodshed and Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds throwing people around one more time, this is the movie for you. Yes there is a love plot between Van Damme and Leah Ayers and if thats not your thing hit the fast forward button, otherwise sit back with your gi and enjoy the movie. The highlight of the movie is Ricardo Morria aka The Monkey Man, you'll know what I mean once you see the movie.7 out of 10 (3 points off for the bad editing)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say it right now, if you watch Bloodsport expecting the same kind of satisfaction you got from movies such as Crash, Ray or Brokeback Mountain (to name a recent few), you shall be very, very disappointed. However, if you watch it as it's meant to be watched, that is to say as a no questions asked, straightforward, martial arts tournament movie, then it is a truly great film.Based on an allegedly true story, there is no deep meaning to Bloodsport...but it isn't meant for one to be there. The acting is not mind-blowing, but once again, it's not meant to be. You know exactly what's going t happen in the end, but who cares? This is a movie you can watch again and again, just because it's not all about the story.All in all, Bloodsport is an entertaining flick, with a decent story, decent acting, great music by Paul Hertzog, and great fight scenes. A movie that will satisfy your martial art needs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this in the 80's as a kid and loving it. After it disappeared for a while I always had fond memories but grew out of these action films as I got older. Until its DVD release I'd forgotten that it was a half decent movie and got to relive old memories. In my opinion its probably the only good movie Van Dam stars in before he was considered an actor. The fight scenes are pretty spectacular for an 80's movie and the plot is predictable but isn't why one watches the film. Its for the villain Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and he is definitely the bad guy. Bolo Yeung's stage presence and impressive physique is the major standout of the film along with some very fast well camera captured spin kicks by Van Dam. No computer enhancement in those days and i wonder if anyone was hurt whilst filming?Anyway this is my favorite martial arts film of all time (which aren't many) and appears somewhat realistic. Its a short feel good film about the modest guy (Van Dam) who comes out on top, avenging his friend who gets a battering (which he deserved) and despite being handicapped by his opponent (won't give it away) comes out on top.A classic popcorn movie of the 80's that you watch for the fight scenes and something to own for old times sake.</fullReview>

However, each one of this three actors manage to bring their own styles to the table in their own original way.... and that JCVD does very well indeed in Bloodsport. This is the kind of movie people are still going to remember 100 years from now. The movie is about an American fighter who participates in a Japanese fighting tournament. There, the best fighters from around the world meet to decide who is the best. Although its not a great movie by any standards, it delivers great entertainment, some cool songs, and some great fights.

		<shortDescription>Why this didn't win an Oscar, i'll never know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Claude Van Damme is characterized as a superstar of "craptacular" films, and to be perfectly honest, he is. His list of films in 90's weren't very good: Universal Soldier, Double Team, Legionnaire. All those movie were forgettable. His real big movie that everyone seems to remember him from is Kickboxer, but honestly that movie should be banned from the United States because it is so bad. Yet Van Damme did have a decent film, and a movie not many know about simply because it was his first film. This movie is Bloosport, and compared to a regular film, it's decent maybe average at best. However, compared to other Van Damme movies, this is a slice of heaven. Not only does it have a decent plot based on a true story that is not wacky or corny in the slightest way (okay, it is corny in some parts, but not to the extent of Kickboxer), but the fighting scenes actually are the best of any American choreographed martial arts film out there. That list is not very prestigious, but for those who thought the Karate Kid was the best martial arts movie out there, prepared to be blown away. Thus, this movie is a "craptacular" masterpiece, and a film that needs to be recognized.Even though it is a decent movie, the acting still is horrible. And horrible is a nice word. Since this is Van Damme's first movie, this is him at his worst, and it's extremely hilarious. Throughout the movie, he butchers the mood and the music constantly with his bad acting, making what should be a serious moment and comic one. While his master does a decent job at acting, everybody else follows Van Damme's lead and is equally bad saying lines that don't even make any sense. "Dux my man!" Okay, was there a contest for Fruit Loops allowing 12 year old girls from Japan to write the script for this movie? Probably, since half the movie doesn't even use proper or understandable English. In addition, the king of bad actors has a role in this film as well: Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds 1, 2 and whatever other one they made after that. His acting alone should make audiences buy this movie, and I don't mean see it...I mean buy it.I may be a little sarcastic through this thing, but I can't help it. I can't take this movie seriously. It's awful. However, if one watches it with my attitude it will be a delight because amidst all the terrible features is a decent film that every father should watch with their kids, just so the kids know that there are people out there who are way tougher than their dads.</fullReview>

The film that consecrated Van Damme as an action star is also the one that had his best acting. Efficient and entertaining, "Bloodsport" gives us combat scenes filmed with extreme professionalism and realistic choreography, what may shock in some more violent scenes (there is a particularly explicit part, in which the villainous break his opponent's leg, and the bone comes out). The director Newt Arnold balances the adventure elements with the dramatic touches of the plot (and in this more serious moments, Van Damme demonstrates a surprising talent) what turns "Bloodsport" into an excellent show not only for those who admire martial arts, but also for those who enjoy a fast and interesting entertainment. The prominences go to the exceptional performances by Van Damme and Leah Ayres, and for the decisive fight between Van Damme's character and the Chinese champion (played by Bolo Yeung, in a terrific interpretation- his character, Chong Li, looks like a furious psychopath), an unforgettable and touching moment that summarizes all the experience and agility of Jean Claude Van Damme!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting kick-boxing movie in which Van Damme endeavors to win a deadly and outlaw competition called Kumite celebrated in Hong Kong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best Van Damme movies with overwhelming combats and spectacular scenes . The picture displays lots of violence, action filled, thrills and fierce combats. The breathtaking fights are magnificently choreographed . It deals with Frank Dux (Jean Claude Van Dame, at the time being a world-championship martial artist in his own right) has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka (Roy Chao) to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament . Frank learns about a sacred-fighting and martial arts from a Chinese wise man . Frank decides to go to Hong Kong , despite being banned by his superiors in the army that he can't because they need him ; however Frank flees and two officers (Norman Burton , Forest Whitaker) are sent to get him and the way leads to Hong Kong . There being also pursued by the officials but Frank eludes them . In Hong Kong takes place the secret contest where the world's greatest warriors fight in a battle to the death . And naturally , once Frank manages to get into the competition , his opponents are defeated . Frank befriends a tough and bouncing contestant (Donald Gibb) and falls in love with a journalist (Leah Ayres) . He must avenge the almost death of his friend and regain the Kumite prize . The movie is based on a book by Frank Dux and was touted as a true story. However, since then much doubt has arisen about the veracity of Dux's story and now the majority of martial-arts enthusiasts view his accounts of competing in secret tournaments as complete fiction, as well as his claims of military service and being an undercover CIA operative. Some have pointed out that he is the only source that these secret tournaments exist, and that nobody else has come forward to confirm his story or ell their own version.Entertaining film plenty of kick-boxing action , Full Contact and the sound of bones cracking . This is a colourful, Hong Kong set and enough budget movie ; leave no cliché untouched , though the fighting are well staged . Being based upon true events in the life of Frank Dux who founded the first American Ninjitsu system . The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this movie , when Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast, Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape, and put him through a 3-month training program. Van Damme called those three months "the hardest training of his life". Though Frank Dux's brick-breaking demonstration is purely fictional, the "Death Touch" is a legendary move fabled in Chinese martial arts folklore ; it is an accu-pressure attack where the attacker quickly strikes his opponent several times at various spots on his body. Striking an opponent in this method can result in broken bones, paralysis/painful muscle spasms or even instant death . Bolo Yeung is magnificent as a sadistic fighter ; the majority of Bolo Yeung's lines are similar to Bruce Lee's in ¨Enter the Dragon¨, in which Bolo appeared . Catching musical score composed in the 80s style and made by means synthesizer . The motion picture was professionally directed by Newton Arnold ; however , even after it was filmed, the movie was almost never released, but Jean-Claude Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be . The result is a strong entry for action buffs, though strictly for Jean Claude Van Damme fans . Followed by two sequels : ¨Bloodsport 2¨ The next Kumite¨(1995) by Alan Meherez with Daniel Bernhardt , Pat Morita and James Hong and ¨Bloodsport 3¨ with Daniel Berhhart , John Rhys Davies and James Hong .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that started it all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 1988 when I was 13 years old. I rented a copy in a local video store. Everyone was talking about it at the time especially about Jean-Claude Van Damme, who only did some small roles in movies like "No retreat, No surrender." This time he was the main character. Bloodsport tells the story of martial arts expert, Frank Dux (played by Jean Claude Van Damme), who travels to Hong Kong to participate in a dangerous underground competition known as the Kumite. Frank Dux was trained by Tanaka whose son recently died and was going to participate in the Kumite tournament. Frank decides to compete and represents the family name of his master, Tanaka. But Frank has a little problem, he is a special force for the US Army and getting hurt in the competition is not a luxury for the army. The army decides to send agents Helmet (played by Norman Burton) and Rawling (played by Oscar winner Forest Whitaker) and follow Frank all the way to Hong Kong.On his journey Frank meets a big roughneck American call Ray Jackson (played by Donald Gibb) who becomes his friend and is also participating in the tournament. Frank also meets an attractive young reporter Janice Kent (played by Leah Ayres) who wants to write an article of the underground competition. The competition is fearless with fighters from around the world and introduced different styles and disciplines of fighting. Frank toughest challenge is Chong Li (played by the legendary Bolo Yeung) a menacing and ruthless fighter who will stop at nothing. The movie has its cheesy part and the music, well it's the 80s, but our IMDb need to understand that BloodSport is a low budget movie and it launched the career of Van Damme as a mayor action star. It even inspired other movies like "Kickboxer", "Shootfighter", "American Samurai", and more, it also inspired video games like "Street Fighter" "Mortal Kombat" and "Fatal Fury". Years later the Ultimate Fighting Championship introduced us with real live fighters from around the world with the same format as the movie. These are some of the reasons "Bloodsport" should be consider as a classic. So, if you seen this movie, I invite you to rent it or buy it and travel the time machine of memories. Those who haven't seen it, I make the same invitation and see the movie that started it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>frank ducks is a name any of you in the karate profession (like myself) will know well. my judgement of the realism of this film can be acredited to the 20 years of karate and ninja and tied boxing and ludo fighting that i have done. also spending many a year in samurai training, i am pleased to see that like me, frank ducks never commits himself to one style. as this is the secret in truly destroying seemingly invincible opponents and crushing them into the ground. i also thought that this was rolo dungs best ever film and that he was the best one that were in it. the other cast members (trees whittaker and jackie chan) are also worth a mention. the comedy scene at the end where ducks is blinded by dungs evil stardust had me laughing out loud but i was later very moved by his farewell speech to his retarded friend in the home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kumite was an underground full contact sport where fighters of all varieties of skills and backgrounds, from all over the world, come together and compete to crown a heavyweight champion. The uniqueness of this tournament is that there are few to no rules, except that you can be a winner in three basic ways..throw your opponent from the platform, knock your opponent out, or make him submit. What can normally happen, however, is severe damage to the human anatomy or, quite possibly, death. That is what makes the current champ so lethal, he has no qualms finishing off his opposition, in fact, he seems to purposely go out of his way to injure and kill. This champ is Chong Li and he holds the record for fastest victory on the platform. He just might've met his match in American Frank Dux, representing his "shidoshi", the Tanaka family, having been taught/trained by him since he was a kid. Having escaped from a military base, agents are sent to Hong Kong, where the Kumite tourney is being held, to recapture Dux, who, come hell or high water, will compete and win in the honor of his dying "father".With Leah Ayers(The Burning)as a reporter who falls head over heels for Dux, Forest Whitaker and Norman Burton assigned to bring Dux back to America, and Roy Chiao as Tanaka, Dux' mentor and fatherly figure. "Bloodsport" was part of Van Damme's "glory period" where he become a popular fixture in action movies many of us watched as kids(..many of us are now in our 30's and 40's when we grew up with these movies that run successfully on cable providing us with ample opportunity to catch them on time and again).While it'd be easy to take shots at his abilities as an actor, when it comes to the physical work performed in the movie, I think he more than holds his own. To have Bolo Yeung as Chong Li is of major importance because I remember being quite spooked by his immense presence on screen, how intimidating he looks when he'd send off that cold, confident stare towards those in his trajectory.There were those of us, when we'd talk about "Bloodsport" as kids, who believed that Donald Gibbs' beer-swilling, rough-housing, fist-fighting brawler, Ray Jackson, had a chance to perhaps defeat Chong Li had he remained focused on the task at hand, instead of showing off his temporary advantage over the champ..if that'd have happened, however, his next opponent was Dux, and you know that wasn't gonna happen in this movie. Gibbs' rapport with Van Damme really adds a lot to the dramatic punch to the gut(..pun intended)needed when Dux squares off with Chong Li(..the head bandanna symbolizing a victory Dux wishes to avenge).Like "Kickboxer", "Bloodsport" opens with Dux training under Tanaka, a foreigner given a chance to learn "martial science" under a master. Many films carry this trait in the genre, where a white man is allowed to become a great martial artist under the tutelage of an expert. Obviously, this is attractive to a western audience which is probably why so many movies were made during the later 80's/early 90's, retaining this formula. American martial artists as heroes, I see the appeal since I was a kid who these movies where successfully marketed towards.Revisiting the movie, I realized that it isn't the "great" movie I remembered adoring as a youth, and the fights themselves aren't that long, for the exception of the finale(..I'm guessing the fights together total maybe fifteen or so minutes of the overall film), but seeing Van Damme and Bolo Yeung at the peak of their abilities, how impressive they perform for the audience, I enjoyed their dual very much, particularly the adjustment Dux must make when blinded by cocaine. The violence can be pretty unsettling, such as the poor fighter whose leg is broken(..a bone protruding), blood spitting off from battered faces, with snapped necks and pummeled torsos. There are numerous tricks in the film(..the coin trick and the death punch which explodes the bottom brick in a pile with the others above it still intact)to establish Dux as a superhero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:My favorite out of all of Van Damme's movies even the more highly acclaimed Hard Target. Based on the real life exploits of the real Frank Dux, this move contains the most fighting of all of his movies. The story, such as it is, never tarries long or induces boredom like Kickboxer or Double Impact. Bolo Yeung is the villain you love to hate as the sadistic monster Chong Li who revels in killing people as much as he does whipping up applause. This old classic features many different styles of fighting: Muay Thai, boxing, and this one guy who jumps about then Pearl Harbor's you from behind. Fat Boy thinks he is funny, laughs at him right before receiving one up side of the head. I love it for it delivers what action fans want: action without the acting scenes where Van Damme always has struggled. He shows off his incredible jumping ability, flexibility and spinning back kicks. He is at the top of his form here, after a very short buildup that explains his being trained as a surrogate son, after his master loses his real son, it moves right into Hong Kong and the brutal Kumite. His gigantic fellow American friend relies upon his massive size more than skill, which works for a while, then he runs into Chong Li, things don't go well. Leah Ayres is one hot babe, if you get bored in the story parts, do what I do: just stare at her. Van Damme's movies I always rank according to how much fighting versus boring dramatic narrative there is: please, if I wanted drama I wouldn't put Van Damme on. The movie shows the field of competitors whittling down with a tragedy I won't spoil for you. Suffice to say, it gives Dux extra motivation in going after Chong Li. There is the usual sub-story that is standard in all of Van Damme's movies (e.g. Lionheart) the usual he is being pursued by the government. It is a very small, irrelevant part of the movie but you get to see Forest Whitaker way back here. If you were looking for a drama try Hard Target this is a pure action movie. The final fight between Dux and Chong Li is the highlight but there are many good fights in this movie. Yes, in some of the preliminaries you will see the punches and kicks miss, here and there, but not in the big fights. As an action movie I only have one parameter: boring or not boring. Also, how much is not boring, here there is almost no story the entire movie is the Kumite. Even Enter The Dragon had much more of a plot than this does. For me that is a big plus, it really has the most watching over again attraction of all of his films. Action movies are defined by how good a villain they have, trust me, you will just hate Chong Li; in one scene he stomps on a guy's leg fracturing the bone clean out of the skin. A good rule of thumb: good villain-good action movie, crappy villain-crappy action movie. Yes, the bald dude in Kickboxer was good but that movie had way more story than this one. Of all of his movies, this is the one I watch over the most. A Classic Van Damme. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Halfway through "Bloodsport", I had to be reminded that this is a Cannon movie. Yeah, the movie's got their cheap fingerprints all over it, but very (very) few of their films are this entertaining. The story has the requisite themes of honor, dedication and friendship, but this is just an excuse to watch a wide array of different fighters beat the living hell out of hear other in the ring.You can throw in all of the gratuitous butt shots and Van Damme splits you want, but there is something about that score (Stan Bush for the win)that keeps things chugging along past the ridiculous one-liners and cut-rate acting. But I wouldn't even call this a "bad" movie; it's compulsively entertaining.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fighters from around the world are gathering in Hong Kong to compete in the full contact Kumite tournament. U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is going. After Senzo Tanaka's son Shingo's death, Frank was trained to take over the Tanaka legacy. He goes AWOL and the Army sends officers Helmer and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to retrieve him. Looming over everyone is the brutal Kumite champion Chong Li.The setup is banal. The acting is mostly poor to utterly embarrassing. None of that matters because the matches are so fun. The UFC would arrive years later. Van Damme's acting is horrible but his kicks are things of beauty. It's my first introduction to his splits and I was amazed. It's a simple movie with simple pleasures for the simple parts of my brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult classic best martial arts Van Damme Style movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take an action cult classic martial arts film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Bloodsport (1988) is my favorite action Van Damme movie. It was the first movie I ever saw about Van Damme that introduced me in to his movies. This is the film I grew up with it, I have first see it, when I was 8 years old! I love this movie to death! In my opinion is Van Damme's best martial arts film! Beside Hard Target, Bloodsport is one of his best movies till date. I Love it so much. Best martial arts movie, is never boring, is fast and entertaining and It is awesome seriously. And I still love it today, Bloodsport also introduced me in to martial arts. Jean Claude Van Damme's Bloodsport is still today it's best. After this movie there were a few copycat movies that copy the idea from this movie. Like were Bloodfight (1989) with Bolo Yeung returning, with the same name, but playing different character from the Bloodsport and Bloodfist (1989) with World Kickboxing champion Don "The Dragon" Wilson. I also love the music from this movie lately it helps me a lot the song "On My Own - Alone", I also love the song "Fight to Survive".This is my favorite tournament fighting film too. This film also inspired the video game Mortal Kombat and for that? This film is twice as awesome to me. This is a film where you see JCVD at his peak and this is my second favorite JCVD flick after Hard Target and Universal Soldier. It holds up really well to this day and it's a shame the film does not have a special edition on DVD and Blu Ray. The film does have a big cult following so it not getting any features to this day is lame. Great concept, great cast, charismatic characters, bad ass fights, and a kick ass soundtrack. This is definitely one of the best martial arts flicks ever made without a doubt for me. Fell in love with the film ever since I saw it on VHS when I was a kid.As for the Bloodsport sequels? For the most part? They all suck. They can't even hold a candle to this film. Bloodsport is a classic and a fight that is worth watching anytime, anywhere. I still own this movie on VHS and on Blu-ray. I don't have the DVD I don't need it. I am going to say it again I love this movie to death, it is my childhood JCVD film and I grew up with it. I have always enjoy it. It has a real bloody bad-ass fights. Van Damme and Yeung kicks fighters to the ground. Original this movie was almost never released, but Van Damme helped edit the film so that it could be released, this movie is praised and loved all over the World including Asia, USA and East Europe. The real Frank Dux was the fighting coordinator for this film. When Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast, Dux announced that Van Damme wasn't nearly in good enough shape, and put him through a 3-month training program. Van Damme called those three months "the hardest training of his life" - this despite being a world-championship martial artist in his own right.It does feel good to go re-watch films like this especially dealing with the very sad fact that films like this classic aren't made anymore and seeing Van Damme these days on film, he just seems to stone faced or depressed. I have enjoyed training sequences, flashback sequences on Frank Dux's earlier childhood life and a life of a young man. The chase sequences where Helmer and Rawlis are chasing Dux was hilarious and very entertaining. Chong Li, in my opinion, is one of the best non horror villains out there. My personal favorite JCVD villain and my favorite martial arts villain. Also, though it isn't the same character; almost like a bizarro world version, another Chong Li appears in a movie called Bloodfight (Bloodsport knockoff) played by Bolo Yeung. Van Damme maybe had some problems in his later years, but I always admired him for everything he did to make this movie well known back in '88, from re-editing the original cut to promoting the movie by putting posters of it himself in cinemas. This movie for me is a perfect 10, I don't care what anyone says.Bloodsport is a 1988 American martial arts film directed by Newt Arnold, and starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, and Bolo Yeung. The film is partly based on unverified claims made by martial artist Frank Dux.

		<shortDescription>#1 - Review of the 1st-Believable Martial Arts film after Bruce Lee's films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, background on Frank Dux, JCVD, and their Bloodsport relationshipLets clear up facts from ignorant fans since I"m an authority - not merely a fan who researched a tiny bit about Frank Dux who JCVD plays. Dux claimed -and still claims- to have been taught Ninjitsu as a CIA operative during service in a Top-Secret Full-Contact tournament somewhere on a island in Asia; -nobody can confirm because, again it's top secret; case &amp; point- back when Asian fighters only knew straight-path linear fight techniques but were unfamiliar of Western Boxing-circular techniques and especially the "Death Touch" (Dim Mak) as with coveted Japanese Ninjitsu Clan's (Not tribes). -they would fall for those moves. So it's no surprise Dux unexpectedly won the tournament in real life..."you can't get away with that now...everybody has seen those moves since the 80's martial Arts movement" - Frank Dux - Howard Stern Radio InterviewTalking to people who know Frank Dux personally, claim he's not a amazing fighter, and that Dux impossibly, prematurely, and suspiciously had risen through the Black Belt ranking system during "Bloodsport" with bowing devotees -one even living in Frank's house also quickly and suspiciously risen in many ranks; Is it true?.After Bloodsport JCVD and Dux battled in court, and nearly got in a fist fight after Dux shouted "That's a lie!". Dux argues JCVD cheated him based on the oral agreements of money due; Is it true?After Bruce Lee JCVD is the only REAL Martial Arts actor to launch his own career above any other and nobody since. Bolo said in the JCVD Documentary..."After Bruce Lee no one...look around where someone?...no one....why?...think"-(pointing to his head)...meaning JCVD is very clever. Also, JVCD was "Ivan" in "No Retreat, No Surrender" -a Bruce Lee themed impressive film- and that was a Lead role NOT "a small role" as one ignorant commenter mentioned and there was maybe just as much if not more to appreciated in "Karate Tiger"-(International title) than in "Bloodsport" because of the Jeet Kune Do training factor; that's a story line which, is why movies succeed or fail. Hollywoods steals and revamps instead of creating now days as with "Family Guy" non-sense instead of being original like the Simpsons although in the last several years the Simpsons have a family Guy writer infestation so....On to BloodSport itself: ******SPOILER ALERT****** There is no Vengeance for Mr. Tanaka's dead son as others have mistakenly commented . Bloodsport is about honoring Tanaka's son who was supposed to enter the tournament representing the Tanaka Clan (Masters Son -car accident) and your Shidoshi/Teachers family Clan BECAUSE the TANAKA Clan's ART "is past down from father to son...father to...son". "Father to SON" key word here. Although FRANK DUX was NOT Mr. Tanaka's lineage ,merely his son's training partner/"punching bag", as Dux argues "You always taught to always have a opened-mind!" So Mr. Tanaka NOT CONTRADICTING his own teachings- trains Frank for the "Kumite" tournament for the prized sword from the iconic sword makers clan. JCVD is the BEST martial artist to come along in Hollywood -especially in the 80's- after Bruce Lee- with only JCVD's "Lion Heart" coming in 2nd being very similar but having a family story line for general audiences to emotionally appeal to. -That's the thing about JCVD being smart. For all JCVD's quickness in delivering kicks, he moves just slow enough for average peoples minds to grasp, which was probably learned BTS from Bruce Lee's initial film making mistakes. Lastely, if you think BloodSport's SUPERB (Credit to the times) acting and sound track were merely bad or okay, you probably didn't catch that Bruce Lee slowed down his kicks because they were real, and should probably keep watching "Family Guy","Friends",and "BirdMan" and other shows intended for average slow-minded handicapped audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme kicks his way to international stardom in his starring debut.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many audiences either like Jean-Claude Van Damme or they dislike him. Either way, in the late 1980's and throughout the 1990's there was no bigger star than Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had appeared in a few small movies but in 1988 Bloodsport launched his career into super stardom by showcasing his spectacular martial arts abilities and athletic prowess. Although Bloodsport was not a critical success and it certainly did not set the world on fire with its acting, it has developed a reputation as a cult classic and also attracted a legion of loyal Van Damme fans.Jean-Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a US Army Captain who has gone AWOL to participate in an illegal martial arts tournament named the Kumite which is well known to be secretive yet brutal. Frank Dux participates to honour his master Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao) who took Frank under his wing as a child and taught him the ways of martial arts. Upon Frank's arrival in Hong Kong, he befriends fellow American competitor Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) and liaison/manager Victor Lin (Kenneth Siu). Frank also finds himself heading towards a collision course with the defending champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung), who is a vicious and remorseless fighter who has killed participants in past tournaments. At the same time, Frank finds himself romantically involved with US journalist Janice Kent (Leah Ayres) who has been assigned to investigate the Kumite, and Frank must also avoid being arrested by two Military Police CID officers Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker in an early role).Van Damme had a likable presence throughout his halcyon days and nowadays his star isn't as bright as it used to be as his career is stuck in the doldrums of endless forgettable direct-to-video movies. Here in Bloodsport, Jean-Claude Van Damme has a certain charisma about him along with his athletic prowess and that's what attracted many audiences to see Van Damme's movies.Don't listen to the nay sayers and forget the hokey acting, Bloodsport is still an enjoyable and entertaining martial arts movie years later. Bloodsport is definitely one of Jean-Claude Van Damme's most memorable movies in his starring debut and certainly one to remember as the movie that launched his career.Highly recommended for all Van Damme fans as well as fans of martial arts movies.7/10.</fullReview>

I think back to my childhood and i think of only a few films that stick in my head, this is top of the pile. Jean claude van damme sells his role very well, and Chong Li the villain in this film is really "believable" in that role, frightening man with probably the biggest pecks i have ever seen! Based on a true story makes the film even better. Anything with JCVD in from 80s and early 90s are absolute classics!! 10/10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.When i was 6-8 years old, "Bloodsport" (1988) was one of my favorite movies around. It was so good martial arts movie (and in general i didn't liked martial arts movies), but it was also just a very decent film overall.The fighting action scenes were awesome, characters were simple yet sharply drawn - it was easy to identify who is good who is bad, who fights dirty and who is just fun to watch at. It is probably still my favorite movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme, and it even had Forest Whitaker! (didn't new him for sure at the time). The training scenes i still can remember after 20 years now (this is how much time have past since i saw this movie last time).Overall, "Bloodsport" is not deep at ideas, but it was almost perfect for what it wanted to be - a Kick-Ass martial arts movie with characters we do care about. This is one of the very best (and probably my favorite one) of it's genre. And the last fight is simply unforgettable stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bloodsport" with B like one of the Best of B-movies ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You're not a Tanaka" "To honor you, Shidoshi" "Bricks don't hit back" "What does it change if Bruce Springsteen is his Shidoshi" "It hurts just looking at you" "Aren't you too young for the Kumite?" "Aren't you too old for video games?" "Go, USA!" "Say it, Say it" "Matte!" ? If I can recite so many lines from memory, then I guess it wouldn't be nice to give the film a bad rating, no matter how bad it is by objective and respectable cinematic standards.I know I'm a sentimental, I know that "Bloodsport" doesn't get everything right, but there's one thing it does get right : the fights? and that's enough even if the rest is pure 80's cheese? which still smells (and tastes) better than TODAY's cheese. Indeed, I'd take 10 "Bloodsport" over any of our current high-budgeted, CGI-driven and noisy blockbuster because "Bloodsport", like the competition it features, has no other pretension than thrills and entertainment. Of course, it's easy to laugh at some parts, yes, some quotes ring false or corny, but never the fight scenes.I can hear the objections coming everywhere, yes, you can see some parts coming, when the sidekick played by Donald Gibb -not a poor man's John Goodman but a poor man's Randall Tex Cobb- cockily threatens the villain Chong-Li that he'll be next on the floor, you can tell one mile away, that he's going to be to Frank Dux' Apollo Creed. But this is what the film is, it is to Rocky what the Death Wish series was to "Dirty Harry", a logical continuation driven by the popularity of Karate and exploitations movies in the 70's and the vulgarization of modern-day violence.The most emblematic figures of this period are the Cannon tandem of Golan and Globus, their legacy is made of flashiness, over-the-top violence, synthesized pop-song, contrived lines regurgitated with ominous music and long 'I mean business' silences- like Chong Li, who, by the way, has only one English line spoken, yet with a voice that I suspect belong to another guy, and an attitude that screams 'bad' in every frame. Thankfully, the fight scenes don't have that mechanical hit and hit back aspect but are rather well-choreographed with a music in total wavelength with the 80's, catchy. A succession of guilty pleasures, like good old Golan and Globus know how to make, nothing's been spared, not even the obligatory montage before the final fight.By the way, I don't know if it's their Israeli background that influenced the script but I wasn't even shocked that the most coward and stupid character was named Hussain. Good old Hussain, probably a nod to the late Saddam, a pretty blonde journalist comes to interview him, he wants her in the hotel room, Arabic fashion I guess, she refuses, he's about to slap her (she called him a name, so I guess she deserved it) but the providential help of Dux will fix the situation via a coin trick that takes several viewings to understand. Well, in all fairness, no stereotype was spared either, a redneck American, a Japanese sumo-tori, not to mention the scene-stealing African guy fighting monkey-style.There's one actor who deserves a honorable mention though, it's Forest Whitaker, his performance stands above the others, even as a comic relief, some of his priceless reactions as the offended rookie show the premises of a talent waiting to bloom. It's still Van Damme's movie, after "Karate Tiger", where he played the antagonist, this was the time for the Belgian icon to prove his value, and he did. A champion himself, he came to Globus-Golan, not asking for a job but telling them he was the one they were looking for, I guess his talent, his good looks and his guts convinced their business sense. As if not a good actor, Van Damme was a great actor in his success, and that deserves respect.This is why I'll always have a soft spot for "Bloodsport" and as the French title "no holds barred", and this is why I wonder why it took me so long to review a film so rooted in my childhood. I remember when my cousin brought us the VHS, we saw it together, I liked it, but he loved it, after watching this film (he was 12, 2 years younger than me) he started playing Karate and he made it till the brown bet. The film triggered a passion and his room was full of Van Damme and Bruce Lee posters, and that very year, we watched as many Van Damme movies as we could get from video stores, in fact, Van Damme became that actor I never missed one film.The JCVD mania lasted from 1992 to 1995. When my cousin saw Van Damme's pose as Guile in "Street Fighter" he was disgusted, he went on playing Karate, but the game was over with Van Damme, and "Time Cop" and "Street Fighter" became the last films I saw. My story with van Damme stopped as well. But rediscovering "Bloodsport" took me back to that sparkle on the eyes of my cousin, that enthusiasm when he talked about Karate, and when I told him I would start Karate again (I stopped after 3 months). I guess he was too young for "The Karate Kid" but "Bloodsport" did accomplish something a few movies do, inspiring, channeling a sort of positive energy.And in fact, when you look at Van Damme's story, inspiring is the word, before he'd make a fool of himself, most of it because of cocaine (what would you expect from a victim of fast success) Some say it's all made up, Frank Dux is controversial and there's no proof whatsoever on his accomplishments but nonetheless, Van Damme's accomplishments are real, inspirational and that doesn't need any proof, watching the film is enough.</fullReview>

The evil guy, Bolo really pulls off the bad guy perfectly. The fight scenes were not boring you can feel the hits. Can i say again, van damme in red briefs yummy. The faces they make are comical. You knew Jackson was going to get it to cocky. Great throwback movie. Awesome movie. No pretense. Just good martial arts. The simple story works. Its no masterpiece but it holds its own.

		<shortDescription>"Definitely One Of Van Damme's Best!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Roy Chiao, Norman Burton, Forest Whitaker and Bolo Yeung star in this 1988 drama based on true events. This is the story of Fran Dux (Van Damme), a soldier and martial artist who travels to Hong Kong to compete in an ancient tournament, The Kumite. Frank wants to fight for his ill mentor, Senzo Tanaka (Chiao) and himself. Gibb (Revenge of the Nerds) plays fighter, Ray Jackson who also competes and becomes Frank's friend, Ayres (The Burning) plays reporter, Janice Kent who is determined to get a story on the Kumite and finds romance with Frank, Burton and Whitaker play government agents, Helmer and Rawlins who try to get Frank back to his unit and Yeung (Double Impact) plays dangerous fighter, Chong Li who fights against Frank. I grew up watching this and it's definitely one of Van Damme's best with a good cast and great score by Paul Hertzog. I recommend this 80's classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Example of how to Make a Martial Arts Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is basically a martial arts fantasy. Its no-rules fighting tournament is right out of a comic book. The fighters, fights, and most of the fighting styles aren't realistic, but they look really good. The cinematography of the fight scenes is excellent, which is practically all you need in a martial arts movie. The tournament is presented as though you are a spectator sitting in the crowd. You get to see various fighters advance through only to get eliminated. Many come and go without once interacting with the main characters. Some of the fighters never utter a word. They're entertaining all the same. Each has a unique look, fighting style, and level of nastiness. Some of them get brutally injured. A lot of the fights don't necessarily add to the story, but they enhance the movie dramatically. The whole thing just works. So many movies have tried to copy the success of Bloodsport. With marginal acting and virtually no plot, it seems easy to top this movie. Only it's not. At its core, Bloodsport is a marital arts movie that does the martial arts scenes better than just about anything else out there. You can't top that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme roars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm curious why movies work, what power they hold over us. The acting here is bad, the dialogue goofy, the plot simple, the fighting average... and yet we still love it, well some of us do.Notice how the cinematic approach in the camera, the video game that two of the guys are playing (probably the first Street Fighter), and the actual fighting on the ring are all obsolete compared to what we have now and by the same degree. In each case we have much more refined sense of embodied space.We can know a lot about a film by just looking at how it embodies space. Here for example we have two scenes of memory. One starts with Van Damme visiting the house of his sensei as he is about to embark on the trip to the HK tournament, he sees a katana and that sends him back in memory; we get the entire backstory, 10 mins of it, and return to him staring at the sword! How old fashioned it seems now. And then the night before the all important final with the hated Chinese opponent, he wanders around Hong Kong and clear images of previous events seep back into his mind to form a clear 'recap' for us. Unnatural both of them.At the time the film played to and probably in large part helped cultivate the urban myth of secret underground tournaments to the death. There was a somewhat obscure tradition in Brazil (called Vale Tudo) and that is where the modern MMA world sprang from. In the film we have no Brazilians who would also dominate the MMA. The tournament is held under Chinese auspices so as to give it an air of oriental mystery and ancient mastery.Nevertheless the film was marketed as the 'real' memoirs of an underground fighter. He was a phony, in fact this obsessive fabrication of trophies and histories is a recurrent thing across the martial arts world. The last known debacle in these circles was the closing down of the Shaolin-Do school in the US, one that mixed helter skelter Japanese and Chinese forms and taught the invention as an ancient and pure practice.So by all accounts this is a silly film, made more so by us having moved ahead from it. And yet it has held up and we love it.The tournament format is simple and attractive enough. It is naive and doesn't mind. And Van Damme brings a wide-eyed dignity and naivety that seems honest, played without irony. The iconic last fight where Van Damme has dust blown in his eyes and has to fight blind is superb, and coasts on just this breakthrough.From harmless naivety to genuine rage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodsport is bloody bursting with badassery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, Dukes steps into the wrong Japanese sensei's suburban sanctuary. Little did he know that Mr. Tanaka was not only a martial arts master, but also a guy who loves to tie other guys up and literally stretch them to their limit. Thanks to an obligatory training montage, albeit an unusual one for lack of inspirational arena rock song, we see that Mr. Tanaka is so zentered that he can throw Dux to the ground just by looking at him. But it is Dukes' chance meeting with Tanaka that leads to his destiny's destination, the Kumite in Hong Kong. The Kumite is an underground martial arts competition where the world's best badasses compete for honor, glory and applause. Among the asskickers are a Muay Tai fighter, a bearded badass with a trucker's sex appeal and skinny African dude who hops around like a monkey. Yes, a monkey! No, there's nothing offensive about it! Shut up! And don't forget the worst of the worst, Chong Li. Chong is an uberchode with the scariest, most intimidating arsenal of facial expressions you will ever see. He also has the scariest tits in Hong Kong. Watch it, love it and remember, brick not hit back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme's athletic beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Claude Van Damme is known for his athletic and flexible abilities. But for some that may feel that they do not see enough, should see this movie for that reason alone. The physical look of Van Damme is just one marvel alone. There is no muscle line that isn't visible on his torso because it is so well toned. Also while fighting, Van Damme makes some crazy looking faces.Van Damme plays Frank Dux, a man with a background in martial arts and military combat. The character, Frank Dux, is actually a real person and amazingly enough, Dux was the man to train Van Damme and get him ready for his role in this movie! Dux's history is shown to us in the very beginning of the film where we see a boy who is taken under the wing of a martial artist. From there he trains with him until he is old enough to participate in the Kumite. The Kumite is a world tournament that has fighters come from all corners of the earth to compete in the ultimate competition to be called the world's greatest fighter.The hardest thing to deal with this tournament is that any possible way of winning the match is allowed. Some of the things done against opponents are can get the blood boiling because it shows how players are willing to do anything to win. It's the perfect reason why the title of this film is called "Bloodsport". However, because Dux is enlisted in the military, he is not allowed to par-take in such events; but this does not discourage him. Actors Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker play the two gentlemen, who try and catch him. But there is no point to having these characters in this story. It's not that they're obnoxious but they don't encourage the plot to move on. All they do is slow it down or completely stop it in its tracks.Fighting in the ring along with Van Damme's character is Ray Jackson, played by the husky and rather giant Donald Gibb. At first, in the beginning of the film, I was almost convinced that Jackson was going to be the main enemy but he turned out to be likable and reliable friend to Frank Dux. And although, Jackson is clumsy now and then, he still packs one heck of a punch. He knocked out an opponent with one knock on the head! That's tough!Another part I didn't understand why they didn't include this character enough was Janice Kent performed by Leah Ayres. Fine and dandy that she becomes Dux's love interest and spends one night with him. But after that she's left in the corner and never talked about again. Why? If she's going to play an important role, make it important, not just 3/4 of the way through the movie! The music, by Paul Hertzog was a good touch though. The tunes had a strong zen feel and at points where Dux was super focused, it almost felt like you're there with him too.Bloodsport contains the blood it promises and has impressive fighting matches. Now if only the crew could figure out what to do with the minor characters. But the rest is entertaining all the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy JCVD's karate, forget about the acting and the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Claude Van Damme was a little known body builder who starred as an extra in films like "No Retreat, No Surrender," before "Bloodsport" transformed him into a big star. The plot of "Bloodsport" is as basic as it gets. Frank Dux (JCVD) is the classic underdog who has the potential to be a great martial arts sensation. Dux gets to realize this potential in a competition among the world's best fighters, known as the Kumite. There are the obligatory scenes showing that Dux has some flashes of martial arts genius. Then comes the fight scenes which all end predictably right up to the big fight at the end. Along the way, this film also borrows the worn out formula of the Rocky IV movie in particular. Yet "Bloodsport," despite its simplicity and formulaic plot, is a fun kind of film. Van Damme is not a great actor, but he is an appealing one all the same. Moreover, the martial arts sequences are a lot of fun especially when accompanied by Paul Herzog's 1980s music soundtrack. Then there is the apologetically macho dialogue which is of course lame, but fortunately also unintentionally funny. Lines like "Very good, but brick no hit back," and "You break my record, now I break you like I broke your friend" are abound in this film. Lastly "Bloodsport" benefits from two surprisingly good actors. I have known my fair share of martial arts masters and Roy Chiao's performance as Senzo Tanaka is as authentic as they come. Unlike Miyagi, who often has a twinkle in his eye, Roy Chiao plays Tanaka with a straight face and shows only grudging admiration to his promising student, Dux. It's truly a fresh take on the Miyagi character. Another actor that brings a lot to this film is Bolo Yeung (playing Chong Li) who does not have a lot to say, but can communicate a great deal by how he reacts to Dux's surprising progress over the course of the Kumite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BloodSport is Jean Claude Van Damme's BEST movie and the BEST 'B' movie of all time!!! The sound track by Paul Hertzog is incredible. The sound track music is not well reproduced on VHS tape and you will need Blu Ray to hear this lovely and inspirational score. I have always loved Kung Fu (the television series) and BloodSport carries on this tradition of discipline and far eastern aesthetics and grace in beautifully choreographed fight sequences... especially in the final match against the defending Kumite world champion Chong Li.I never get tired of watching this film. I have watched it over fifty times and it is as fresh today as it was the day I first saw the film. BloodSport is widely regarded as a cult classic in the genre and will likely remain that way possibly for all time. This is not Titanic nor the Lord of the Rings trilogy... it simply holds it's own as one of the most inspirational movies of all time. There is Rocky I, II and III, the Shawshank Redemption and then there is BloodSport...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Van Dame's best movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not the biggest Jean Claude Van Dame fans in the world, but this one was actually rather good to me. Though the role is no stretch for Van Dame as he plays a guy in the military who is a martial arts master after being trained by a man whose son died so Frank (Van Dame) convinces him to train him instead. Using what he is taught he is off to this legendary underground tournament called the Kumita (not sure of the spelling of this one). For the most part it works though there is a subplot of some guys trying to get Frank out of the tournament because he is trained by the military and they do not want to see their investment ending up really hurt or worse because of the tournament. This subplot seems more like an add on to pad out the film a bit, but it does not really interfere with the plot to badly. The highlights of the film, come predictably enough from the tournament action as Frank quickly makes his mark by upstaging the reigning champions time of fastest knockout. There are many interesting fights in this one and the dude playing Ray Jackson was really good and funny in his role and added some nice comedy to this martial arts film. Though the ending fight was not exciting enough for my money and I really found it unnecessary for them to make the guy cheat, though it is a better fight than the one in the movie "Kick Boxer" as once the brother was saved the fight was over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. It is a fantastic movie from the 1980s displaying great martial arts and is one of van Damme's finest films in my opinion.The movie story-line is basic and not very complicated: Frank Dux has traveled to Hong Kong to compete in the Kumite-a full-contact fighting tournament while at the same time dodging two agents sent to bring him back to the United States at for abandoning the military. True, this film has the typical van Damme story-line: someone close to him has gotten hurt and he has to avenge his friends. Yet this film makes up for that by displaying wonderful fight sequences that are colorful and creative.The film has a great villain-Chong Li played to perfection by Bolo Yeung. The music adds to the film by carrying it along and adding excitement when it needs it and comedic flair when it is required. I feel that van Damme's fans will love this film-one of his first starring roles. The only complaint is that there are a few funny scenes in the film that perhaps were not meant to be funny but are. Other than that, Bloodsport is a great movie-worth your time because you'll be rewarded with fantastic martial arts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Claude Van Damme basically starts his American acting debut and stars in the cult hit Bloodsport directed by Newt Arnold. The material arts are intriguing to watch, and nonetheless accurately portrayed; the movie shows Van Damme's aerobic, and flexibility fitness along with his material arts combination to deliver a low-budget movie about revenge, friend-ship and belief. The acting I must admit is very poor, and I'm being generous; but the fighting sequences cap off well and make it overall a fun and entertaining movie to watch. As Van Damme is visually known around the world for his material arts, Bloodsport is among the favourite movie from Van Damme and is mine, too.</fullReview>

Possibly the first thing I taped in my young life. Sadly, the movie was at its end, and I was only able to tape some of the last fights. I watched the tape over and over. Being a kid, I had no money to buy the movie, and I had no idea who Van Damme was. Well, no one did, it was his first starring role. Several years later, I was given the opportunity to watch the movie as a whole. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. For a b-movie, the action and music were great. And they still are by todays standard. Although some of the acting, especially early on in the military base, is ridiculous. A great gem from the past. 9/10.</fullReview>

And a pre stardom Forest Whitaker shows up as a government agent.There was quite a bit of clever humor all over actually. I like the con game he ran on his first opponent in the bar. ("What is bet?")

Van Damme really wasn't hired on his acting ability back in 1986.....hell he could barely speak English....but the fight scenes are pretty foreskin' good! Nothing by now days standards with actors been taught how to "fight" for big-budget Hollywood films (Matrix,X-men etc.) but that's kinda what makes this film great. The fighting styles are realistic and the cast in this film aren't really actors but more so martial artists! No CGI involved in this film, kiddies! Thoughs kicks are real!!! Who needs a plot anyway? I mean, the films called "Bloodsport"! And if you went to see this movie based on a trailer you saw, you pretty much would have figured that this film wouldn't exactly have much in the way of a brilliant story! Even though this film is supposedly based on a true story.....it still didn't have much of a budget and almost didn't get released! Fortunetly it did due to Van damme's persistence, although there was pretty much no advertising for it! Anyway, the film still managed to becoming a martial arts cult classic and is still a must-see film for any Van Damme fan or martial arts enthusiast.....I wonder if Forrest Whitaker is proud of this film???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that "the plot" isn't something that you'll care to see; you will wait straight to see the fightings.I must agree that the storyline is fast paced or kinda forced(Accepted a Student, because of a school fight) No matter what the causes of Frank Dux(Van Damme)to battle,said have deserting the USA army and being pursued, or the fact that a fighter at the tournament(named Comitte) wants to kill you, because he just wants it, forget the reasons.Focus on the fights. Wide variety of styles, makes me wonder about present movies, that have no martial art style(standing only to street fighting,karate and kung fu styles)those who just shows fancy moves to impress the audience. It's difficult to say if those moves are computer-modified or the real deal.I'm not saying that Bloodsport impress as Hell, but you can easily recognize one art from another(Even by just seeing the person clothes) Although I'm not convinced that Dux(In real Life) made those victories and records in his life, the movie itself is no-plot, but battle-focused. Enough with the Van Damme Splits,thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fighting movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is the second movie with Jean-Claude Van Damme in a lead role. In this movie he is playing Frank Dux and its based on a true story. Frank Dux travels to hongkong to fight in the kumite even without permition from the U.S army. In hongkong Frank meets Ray Jackson, a American fighter who will fight in the kumite and he becomes friends with him. But to prove that he is a shidoshi, he has to show the judges the dim-mak also known as the death touch. This movie who is based on a true story has everything if you ask me. Jean-Claude Van Damme is brilliant as Frank Dux and we also see Forest Withtaker(who won a academy award prize 18 years later) in a small role as Rawlins. The music who is made by Paul Hertzog, Michael Bishop and 2 songs performed by Stan Bush is amazing. I give this movie 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still retains its cult status...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you'd expect, the acting is B-movie quality and the plot is primitive, but I'd go as far as to say that it's the quintessential domestic martial arts movie of the 80's. Decently choreographed fight scenes combined with the atmosphere and soundtrack really set the tone for this film. It may feel a bit outdated in comparison to martial art films now, but it holds well and still retains its cult status. I've seen this film a countless number of times and it is still very enjoyable to this day. Hollywood attempted to cash in on a sequential project (The Quest) also starring van damme but it couldn't capture the 'magic' nor achieve the same success. A must watch for all of you martial arts buff. The grand showcasing of the various fighting styles is truly the centerpiece. This is Van Damme at his absolute prime.</fullReview>

He really did "face" the fights that were displayed in the movie...and since it was made in the 80's, it was portrayed very well and almost down to the last detail...along with being blinded (which he was,) and defeating his enemy. Great movie! The main character of the movie was (at the time of adolescents,) was considered "semi-retarded" or "slow," in which they corporate. Training with that boy's father, and becoming physically, but most important mentally, trained were the keys that made this "young Einstein" inherit the brilliance of fighting, and ascended into the human psyche. This movie has inspired me in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloodsport marks Jean-Claude van Damme first starring role.it is possibly his best movie to date,as far as martial arts action goes.the fights in this scene are spectacular an very violent.Van Damme stars as Frank Dux, a man highly trained in the martial arts and also a caption in the U.S military.to honour his Shidosi,who lies on his death bed,Dux decides to enter the Kumite,a secret and brutal full contact fighting competition held in Hong Kong only once every 5 years.the best of the best from all around the world come to the event in hopes of becoming champion.Dux hopes to become the 1st westerner to win it all.but before the tournament even begins,Dux has a complication to contend with in the form of government agents Rawlins(Forest Whitaker)and Helmer(Norman Burton) whose job it is to stop Dux from participating.these 2 provide some comic relief in the film.if you haven't seen the movie i won't give any more of the plot away.this movie is very entertaining,fast paced and even has some comedy(see above)the violence as i mentioned is very graphic and there one particularly gruesome scene,so be warned.this movie is not about the acting,although it is actually not bad.it is all about the action.for a martial arts movie,this is easily in the top 10.a very strong 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One of Van Damme's first starring roles (he got the lead after meeting producer Menham Globus on the street and kicking near his head), based on the real-life story of Frank Dux, the first Westerner to win the Kumite, an underground full-contact fighting tournament in Hong Kong. The story is pretty clichéd (Dux wants to win the Kumite to impress his master), but this is still one of Van Damme's best movies, mostly because he doesn't talk a whole lot (though he does show his ass, which I think he is obligated to do in every film). His kickboxing skills are put to good use in the various fights, and the minor characters in the film are also quite good martial artists. Bolo virtually sleepwalks through his role as Chong Li, the current Kumite champion, but does look suitably menacing as a villain."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a huge Jean Claude Van Damme fan, but I'll admit this is a great film.Frank Dux goes to a brutal full contact karate tournament called the Kumite, and fights for his master.This movie is based on something that actually happened, but the real Frank Dux, is just a big farce as Van Damme is. Van Damme NEVER ONCE stepped in the ring and fought in Kickboxing. Knowing that, I'm probably guessing the real Frank Dux just made this up while sitting on a chair, eating potato chips.Anyways the acting is pretty good, and the fight scenes are excellent. There are small mistakes, like some of the fight scenes are out of order, for example, a fighter gets badly injured and the next scene you can see him sitting on the sidelines with no injuries at all.The script is OK, and their are some standard one liners in it, but if you can get past that, this film overall is pretty good, even though the truth of the events remains unknown.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie is a classic nowadays. It is the first lead role for Van Damme and it shows a little bit in the movie: the production quality in overall is little average. But still this is a good movie, including magical fight moments, music rich in atmosphere and well proceeding story. Van Damme's acting isn't so great but it doesn't have to be for this kind of movie. I think what he loses in acting ability he truly compensates in his martial art skills. I noticed some small similarities and relations to movie Kickboxer. The most interesting of these is that the fighter named Paredes plays the role of Tong Po in Kickboxer, quite different looking in this movie without the make-up of an Asian. Overall a entertaining and good martial arts movie!</fullReview>

The action scenes are great, I've watched this movie so many times, that I forget all about his stupid accent and horrible acting. It's just an all around great martial arts movie. It doesn't try to be something intelligent, or have something deep to say. It's just a fight movie. Too many fight movies try to pretend that they have a real plot and end up looking stupid. Blood Sport has a basic story that leaves lots of room for the fight scenes without trying to be smart. If you're a fan of martial art movies, then I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

If I remember rightly (I was a little boy then)when the controversy started over his story, photos of martial artists with their heads blacked out were published. They were from a legit Karate Championship.This doesn't matter as far as the film is concerned. The action is fantastic and still hold up after all these years, especially compared to films nowadays training actors for a few months which has lowered the standard of Kungfu/Karate based action. This film was stored away in the studio shelves for a while as I'd seen promo photos years before. This is probably my favourite Van Damme film as after he got exposure he wanted to concentrate on "serious acting roles". It's makes me want to do my stretching exercises every time I see it. Be careful though, make sure you warm up first!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could be, Jean-Claude Van Dammes finest moment. This movie's plot is thick with witty dialogue, brilliant martial arts choreography, and a soundtrack second to none. Of course it has Van Dammes token ass shot (where he shows it for a split second), so for the girls out there who haven't seen it, watch this movie and know why every girl in the 80's loved him. Not only is it Van Dammes movie, it heralds other brilliant actors such as Forrest Whittaker as a MP trying to subdue Frank Dux (JCVD)only to be in awe of his 'moves.' It also has the actor known as Jackson, who is in other movies such as Revenge of the Nerds, who is a brilliant cheesy 80s actor. Oh yes, one other point is this movie also includes an arcade game scene, where Jackson and Dux battle it out on the good ol'2D arcades (probably costing them 20c). I highly recommend this film as it is a masterpiece of the martial arts genre. Favourite quote: "Okay, USA!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've all seen them before. The martial arts tournament movies. This movie, like many other martial arts movies of the same kind, follows the formula: hero trains hard, meets buddy, buddy gets beat up by villain, hero defeats villain and gets the girl. And you know what? I'm perfectly okay with that. It makes for a helluva story. Although this movie is not masterfully acted, mostly by some of the supporting cast, and at times overacted, it still makes for a kick-ass, exciting movie. And I could watch it over and over again. I love UFC, boxing, martial arts, etc. so this movie really appeals to me. I think Bolo Yeung (Chong Li) does a perfect job as the crazy Korean bad guy. Van Damme's acting is decent as well.

		<fullReview>This story to this movie is very straight forward, that's what's so nice about it. Van Damme enters a fighting tournament and tries to win it, meaning that this movie mainly consists of fighting between Van Damme and some random Chinese people. The plot is as transparant as a glass door, but why should this bother anyone? The villain is incredibly unsubtle, Van Damme is implausibly good, but this is pretty much exactly what I expect from this sort of flick. It doesn't stop me from rooting for Van Damme, nor does it really kick me out of the story. The fights, especially the inevitable showdown with Chong Li, are pretty spectacular. None of them look particularly convincing given that the punches miss by about a mile, but the choreography is still beautiful to look at. This is one of my favourite guilty pleasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, the director (Newt Arnold) had been a co-director all his life, and appeared notably as a naked old man in a sauna prank scene in "Porkies"... This should lower our expectations enough because we aren't dealing with dePalma, Tarantino etc. The script is no Lumet either. Although supposedly based upon true life events happened to the real Frank Dux ( who in later years went through litigation with Van Damme over the higher budget spoof of "bloodsport", "the quest" ), the plot is as thin as a spider web. However, this is the 80ish martial arts movie like people loved it to be. Plenty of well-choreographed fight scenes, a decent score by Herzog ( ala Rocky IV) and extra subplots like the romance one (which i read is often a requirement to have the screenplay approved ) and the police chase, which are stitched together for the sake of it. 8-10 because it is a true classic, without much plot frills like those Hues, Rothrock, Norton 80ish movies.If you want a "message" or true realism, go watch Karate Kid I; if you want excellence in fighting, go watch Bruce Lee...</fullReview>

Its an inspiring story and is adapted into the film extremely well. I have wondered on occasions however whether Tanaka really did use a hoist as a method of making Dux's legs more supple of whether that was inserted into the story to highlight Jean-Claude Van Dammes talent for doing the splits!anyway its a great movie so watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those of us who have grown up through the 80s and 90s know what qualifies for a good action movie. Bloodsport is one of those said action movies, for that is not made for the viewer to dissect characters, acting or even plot(s). Jean Claude Van Damme was considered one of the superstars in the Action/Adventure genre, his acting was sub-par but he always delivered sequences of pure adrenaline rush with his 'round-house' kicks and the patented 'aaahhh' screams as he finished a foe. Bloodsport is not a shoot-em-up action film, those were left to Sly and Arnold, instead it is based on a "true-story" of an American, Frank Dux, who involves himself in an underworld martial-arts competition, the Kumite. The movie provides quality action for those who care for these types of films. The acting is faulty but it is not expected to be good. Overall it is a good action movie, and one of the last few since the late 90s to present day has only provided us with CGI scenes involving an abundance of action that can actually only be considered "unbelievable and lame". Savoir films like these that have to be rented only to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Fighting Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen very many fighting movies and this has to be one of the best, if not the best fighting movie I've ever seen. The intro was what I think is good with a good storyline. The remainder of the movie shows a great friendship, and many, MANY, great fights. I'd have to say probably at least half of the movie contains fights. This movie was based on true events which I think makes this movie a lot more inspirational. Frank Dux also helped make the movie and the fights which really made it great. The fighting scenes were amazing. This movie to me is definitely a 10 if you like to watch fighting movies. Plot of the movie: The main plot of the movie is at first, they show Frank Dux working out in a gym in the army. He plans to go to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite, an ancient fighting tournament, to honor his Shidoshi, which is his master, in the tournament. Watch the movie to find out why he really wants to honor his master. Watch him fight the hardest fights of his life and get through the hardest obstacles. Overall: This is one of my favorite all-time movies. Even though it was made in late 1980's, I still think it's one of the best movies. It is 100% a fighting movie classic. I've seen this movie at least 15 times and I am still watching it. I am watching it even as I type this commentary. This is a MUST-GET movie if you like fighting movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-Claude van Damme is a beautiful martial-arts fighter. His fight-art is fantastic and his kicks deadly. In this martial-arts film, in Bloodsport "the true-story" play van Damme a agent from the us-military. He will fights in the limit, in Hongkong and he will wins for yourself and for your martial-arts master Tanaka, but the us-military want not that van Damme ( Frank Dux ) fight in the limit. Dux fly to Hongkong and fight in the Kumite. In the end-fight fight he against Bolo Yeung the fighter from south-Korea. The fight-art in this film is hard and brutal, this is the best fight art in all movies. Bloodsport is a beautiful film about martial-arts, the limit, the old champion and the love. This film has top martial-arts sequences and very good fighter . The best fighter of the world. The story is true and nice. Bloodsport is the best martial-arts film .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie so much more than mere words can possibly hope to express. In fact, this is in my humble opinion THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME. If you disagree, I'd probably hate you anyway so I'll trifle with you not. This movie masterfully conveys the entire spectrum of human emotion in an enjoyable, riveting, and truly inspirational, energy-replete package. You'll be laughing one moment as Frank Dux pulls a fast one on Johnny MP, escaping from the shower stalls in astonishing JCVD fashion, to being somber and concerned the next as Frank gallantly endures the incredibly rigorous training methods of his Shidoshi Tanaka. You will find yourself unsettled on viewing the imposing atmosphere that is the Hong Kong underworld and then suddenly become psyched by the Kumite itself with its age-old, awe inspiring traditions and highly skilled combatants. Another wonderful of the myriad wonderful aspects, are the characters that one can so easily be enamored by. The indomitable Ray Jackson will win you over with his brash, often obtrusive, but usually well-intentioned actions and the loyal bond he and Frank share. Mr. Street Savvy himself, Victor Lin exudes pure confidence and he'll make you feel as though you are part of the Jackson/Dux/Lin team; the good guys! Lastly, the formidable defending Kumite champ Chong Li is an excellent, quintessential antagonist. This man is a blood thirsty, barrel-chested warrior with a black heart and steel will whose cruel actions will elicit your rage. You'll be filled with child-like glee as Frank escapes from the military officials Helmer and Rollins in an all out 80's extravaganza of a chase that ensues throughout the quaint markets and lovely piers of beautiful Hong Kong, set to the ineffably fantastic tune, Steal the Night by Michael Bishop! Exuberance! Nostalgia! A real tear jerker of an anthem! It's just that damn awesome. After viewing this movie you'll go to sleep feeling as though you were meant to wake up and live forever!!! Jean-Claude Van Damme is a real cardiac kid delivering a performance for the ages! This Film truly runs the gamut of excellence! When you watch it, you'll be where you belong, you'll see that golden dawn...and you'll steal the night...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a man who enjoys a great cheesy action film. I have seen countless cheesy action films and this one definitely takes the cake. The Synopsis is: China, a country of great mystery and corruption. Once the feudal lords of this land called the Black Dragon Clan created a martial arts tournament in which their greatest warriors would put everything on the line for a full contact, man on man, sweat feast. Now generations later, a man on a mission to uphold the name of his Sensei and fallen comrade enters this full contact sport, a blood sport, to prove he is the greatest fighter to have ever listed. This fall. Jean Claude is Frank Dux, french accented, American air force major, Japanese martial artist who is one of the most lethal and physically scrumptious man to ever walk the planet.The fighting is sweet for '88. The final fight is orgasmic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie so many times I have all the lines memorized and for a girl that's saying a bunch! I love Jean-Claude as is and that's what made me watch the movie when I was just 12 yrs. old, but the movies subtle humor and great fight scenes keep me watching it at 27. 8)It's just a classic action movie. Bloodsport was based on a true story so that adds some appeal as well. The movies gives you stats from Frank Dux at the end which is interesting and you grow to appreciate the craft and the different fighting styles of all the fighters in the match. I had no idea there were so many different types/styles of martial arts and just flat out street fighting and watching the fighters use their different tactics was very entertaining. Watch it and try not to be looking for an Oscar performance while doing so..just sit back and let yourself be entertained. Some of the best movies were those gone unnoticed by the masses! 8)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"THIS MOVIE ROCKS" its based on the true life of Frank Dux, thats the plot and thats the character. This movie has a plot, and its has characters and it has emotions. The girl for example, Janice she tries to stop the kumite because she doesn't want Frank to get hurt. And the emotions in between Janice and Frank, and Frank and Ray. Their best friends. This movie is pure its has everything. Love, passion, friendship, honor and blood. The kumite was a war zone waiting to be ruled. And Frank Dux ruled it. I thought the cast was perfect. Jean-Claude Van Damme's biggest debut. His best picture. I wish that Van Damme would come back to that passion and once again rule it. I loved Bloodsport and its one of my favirote movies. It has a lot of martial arts and different styles. One of the biggest martial arts movies ever besides Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon.... IF your not a huge martial arts fan or Van Damme fan then you might not like this movie. But my opinion is that Its good and its true....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge of the 80's: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Superstar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport (1988) was the first starring debut for J.C.V.D. After making his American debut in Corey Yuen's No Retreat, No Surrender (as a Russian no less). He stars in Bloodsport as Frank Dux, the first westerner to win the "kumite" a popular Asian fight club underground tournament that is well known despite being illegal. Bankrolled by the boys at Cannon, they were banking on J.C.V.D. to be the next action star. He's quite impressive in his first starring gig.His role did not need him to actually act and his supporting cast was more than helpful. The cast is also filled with many familiar faces (if you're a fan of the Hong Kong Cinema you can point them out). The fighters were interesting and many of them had quirky personalities and the villains were creepy as well. The fight scenes were surprisingly well done. Not a classic in film sense by any means. But the film is well worth watching. IF you love cheesy action films and B-Movies by all means don't miss out on this one.Several years later for reasons unknown the film was franchised out for the D.T.V. market. The sequels are pretty bad and not worth wasting one's time trying to watch them. That's my job!Recommended, but stay away from the sequels.B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best martial art movie ever.When it comes to martial art choreography and filming, no other martial art movie can reach this one, unless you are into Jackie Chan or Hong Kong (Jet Lee) karate movies. Now, when it comes to plot, then its a whole different talk. But seriously, who cares about plots when you're watching a martial art movie? Its the fight scenes that counts and this movie is packed with them. Everything else is less important bonuses. And the blend of different fighting styles in bloodsport are awesome. It has got all from dancing monkey style to no budging sumo style. Luckily for us our hero Frank Dux (The muscle from Bruxelles) is an allround fighter and Van Damme does the ass kicking more stylish than any other martial art actor i have ever seen including himself in his later movies. It is simply a joy to watch the fighting sequences because of the fantastic choreography and especially because its filmed in many angles and in a slow enough pace for the viewer to notice all the great details in the fights. And trust me, there's a lot.If you, like me, are a big fan of American martial art movies like "kickboxer" and therefore don't care about a very, very simple plot. Then this is the movie for you. ;O)I give Bloodsport a 10 simply because its the best of the best in its genre.I gave it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really weird I think, the acting overall would be laughable, at the least irritating. But.....with what we are presented with you forget all about it, because this is a kick-ass movie, so damn good that you take the acting for granted, just like that. I love this movie and remember well when I saw it for the first time. One of my friends called me to come over, he had a movie with all kinds of big fighting guys in it and it was awesome. Indeed, it was awesome. I don't know how many times I have watched it, but it's over 30 and the movie is awesome every time I watch it. Everything is great, the training, the fights (especially the dramatic end-fight, Bolo Yeung is a great muscular adversary), the bonding of Dux and Jackson (damn lovable character by the way) and I adore the music, it fits this movie as well as Ennio Morricone with Once upon a time in the west (my favorite movie ever) and again you can consider the music B-material, but in this movie it works, couldn't have been better. The movie even manages to evoke some emotion......with the training, Dux' mentor when talking about his son, Jackson in the hospital.........I could go on and on, the movie delivers This movie deserves high ratings. But if people can't see beyond the acting, then it's their loss. And people always comparing fighters.....Jet Li has better technique bla bla bla.....fine for them, but I want to see an entertaining movie, not outstanding real fighting techniques, so if Van Damme is indeed more a ballerina, and yes he is more of an athlete, so be it, this movie and a few others with him are more entertaining than the tiresome kungfu flicks out there, almost none of them can entertain me, give me this one anytime. This is the best Van Damme film for sure and highly underrated even considering the acting in it. And it's a "women" movie too, if only for Van Damme's behind showing in all its nudity...........my wife's favorite part of the movie. :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Claude Van-Damme's biggest hit is this "Bloodsport". This movie is all about action, drama, promise, and respect. Van-Damme playing the legendary ninja Captain Frank Dux, is one of the most amazing feats he's ever played. Doanld Gibb known for playing Ogre on "The Revenge of the Nerds" playing Jackson was awesome as well. I liked the part of everyone in the beginning preparing for the kumite. Bolo Yeung as Chong Li was the most devastating characters in the movie. Side kicking one big block of ice and elbow striking the other. Chong Li(Bolo) was a murderous fighter, and deadly champion. Bolo himself as a deadlifting champion really made his character look good. I liked several lines he said in the movie: "VERY GOOD, BUT BRICK NOT HIT BACK!" (The Dim Mak scene) Got that from Bruce Lee's "Enter The Dragon" line with the same comment on the wooden board. "YOU ARE NEXT!" (After killing his last apponent) His last great line was his title relief "MATE!"Gibb's role as Jackson was honorable as well. After trying to be so brash. After nearly getting killed by Chong Li, he wants a piece of Dux in the future, but in the meantime Jackson gained support and trust from the champion. building a bond that can never be broken!After retiring from the kumite, Frank Dux was the ultimate champion. NOW THAT'S A CHAMPION! Van-Damme has made this movie very honorable in a lot of ways: 1. He returned a favor. 2. He gained a friend in a competition. 3. He brought honor in a dangerous sport. I wish there is more to say, this movie draws blood, and it's worth its watch. Very honorable! 3 out of 5 stars. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

I bought 'Bloodsport 2' on DVD, and only realized when i put the film on that it wasn't Van-damme! :-o i was shocked, and disappointed that they had, in my view, ruined the film by replacing Jean Claude van-damme with a cheap look-alike! If i would have know this before i bought the DVD then maybe i would of had second forts.Any well to sum the original Bloodsport up, its a GREAT fighting film and a pleasure to watch. If your into fighting films, then you would of most probably seen this! However, if your not, then maybe you haven't already seen it, but you should!Thanks, Lee 19/07/04</fullReview>

His Fighting style is excellent (with Frank Dux as a personal assistant throughout the film, who wouldn't look that graceful) he is very young and knows how to play the part. Bolo Yeung also makes this film special. I think together, those two make a great good-guy bad-guy scenario and i can't wait for Kumite to be released next year. All the fighting scenes are 10/10 everytime and i recommend this film to anyone who likes Van Damme or his movies. Also, I think that Sumo guy vs. Van Damme fight was pretty good too. Mortal Kombat video game ripped off JCVD's finishing move on the sumo. Remember Johnny Cage's splits punch?? Go JCVD and many more movies to come. Good Luck!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the acting might not be quite up to par compared to the great films of our era, this film is solidly supported by great fight choreography (by the real Frank Dux even), a fine story, and good music. This, in my opinion, is one of the best martial arts films because it is ABOUT fighting, rather than about a cool fighter who is on some mission "to save the girl". If you like this movie, I'd strongly recommend Kick Boxer and Best of the Best as well (see Julia Robert's brother Eric in some cool fight scenes).I'd really love to see Van Damm do another movie that showed his character grow as a fighter.</fullReview>

Van Dam needs to concentrate on these types of movies nowadays instead of the shoot em up genre that just doesn't work for him.

		<fullReview>This is a very well made movie. They managed to gather up decent casting which lead to brilliant performances. I am a big fan of Jean Claude Van Damme, and I can honestly say, this is his best movie ever. It was his starring role that moved him to bigger roles and made him the star he is today.The fight scenes are done very well. It appears as if the actors are in a real fight and it leaves you breathless with some of the actions.I rated this movie a 10, because I can never get tired of watching it and it is totally entertaining for any Van Damme or martial arts fan in general.I did find one more goof about the film though, in Chong Li and Paredes' fight, Chong Li wins by breaking Paredes' leg and you see the bone penetrating the skin. Although, after that fight, if you look in the stands you can see Paredes' sitting in the first row with his leg back to normal as if he hadn't even fought earlier. That is an amazing recovery from a vicious incident. I think they could of done a better job at editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuation from "Enter the Dragon" / Intro to a new age....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its likely that most folks will agree that Bruce Lee began the martial arts craze in mainstream western society........his untimely death meant that others had to continue this trend........and in such a sense, this film is proof of that. Bloodsport is not an accurate martial arts picture, but it was significant enough to place itself above the rest of such films at the time, thus making it somewhat revolutionary and definitely an influence on similar movies to come.You also get the big stage introduction of Jean Claude Van Damme, whose skills are nicely showcased here. The plot summary really explains itself, and even more so since it is based on the real life story of Kumite (Sparring) fighter Frank Dux. This is a typical 80's "B" like movie, with the music, funny hair and a lot of wooden acting.......buts its all in fun and never has a dull moment.If you are a Jean Claude Van Damme or martial arts fan, you definately need to see this one, although imo, Van Damme's "Kickboxer" of 1989 is much more superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Martial Arts Movie from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie doesn't influence a kid to do his best and tell them that the continual struggles are worth it, I don't know what does.Bloodsport was indeed Jean Claud's first movie, and a pretty good one at that. (for a ballerena) Although this movie does not have good special effects or acting it still has one golden value; RE-PLAYABILITY. Anyone can easily watch this movie countless times without losing interest. Bloodsport has a unique quality to it. It has that 80's carefree quality. A feeling that America is at its height. There is no political correctness. Just the atmosphere of a free, bustling, sprawling Hong Kong is enough to make any classic movie a great one indeed. The grade B acting increases this movie's appeal, you couldn't have it any other way. This movie is just above some Chinese kung fu movies, but just below some of the great Martial Arts movies like "Enter The Dragon" and "Karate Kid". After all the Jean Claud movies of today one can easily go back to their beginning with Bloodsport, an all time classic. Even though Jean Claud tried to remake this movie with The Quest, I believe that Bloodsport could not be surpassed.Despite being completely unrealistic at times it does appeal to the Martial Arts crowd very well. The movie isn't too terribly hoaky like some Jet Li or Chan movies where you can spot out the increase of film speed or the unrealistic moves (360 degree head butt, fly in the air) It has that secretive, elite, non-commercialized feel to it. It was truly the Martial Arts of the past, unlike its commercialized counterpart of today.I give this movie a Martial Arts Movie Rating of 5/5.I give this movie a rating of 3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme may be a bad actor but why is he so famous?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch this movie anymore I remember what Van Damme said about how he got the part for this movie. He went into the producers office and he asked Van Damme to sit down. In front of his desk were two chairs so he pulled the chairs a part and did his now famous stretch. I will not argue that Van Damme is a great or even good actor but to say he is the worst of all time just isn't true. There are much worse films in this and other genres that can battle it out for that title.I will say this though, of all his films I liked this one best. The plot (although not great by any means) is better than most in this genre. How many times have you seen the "I must train to take revenge" theme. At least here he is training to take the place of his friend and carry a tradition of his "adopted" family. Donald Gibb is perfectly cast as the American, beer drinking, I can beat everyone cause I am American, look at me, I got my a** kicked other guy. It has some of the best fighting scenes you will see in a VD flick. His acting was kept a minimum here cause he couldn't act ( I not saying he has gotten better with time, just more attempts at it) and the producers know that. For the most part he shuts up through this one. It is a cheesy martial arts film made for people who like cheesy martial arts films and truly it does succeed in what it tries to do. It tries to tell a basic story with some good fights with the standard good guy wins ending.I'm not sure who Forest Whitaker upset to get put in this picture but he is the only eye opening part of this flick. Everything else is basic and uninteresting. The fight between the monkey fighter and the big sumo type fighter is funny, not Jackie Chan funny but funny. Bolo is the best part of the fighting and deserved more in this but what can one do. Van Damme has made quite a few films now and some how most were worse than this one.Is Bloodsport a great movie? No, but it is my favorite VD flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so Van Damme movies are cheesy. And yes, he is worst an actor as you can imagine. And yes, Joey Tribbiani looked more real as a corpse than Jean-Claude as an actor in that Friends episode. Still, JCVD's skill is as a fighter. And this, of all movies, is what fighting is all about. You fight? Then you will recognise your martial art - or style, for those practicing thai boxing, or drunken boxing, or street-fighting - you get the idea. Never has a fight out of kung-fu has been so good represented. 90 minutes of fighting. If you're looking for something else, stay real far. Else, this is The Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, sure it's B-ish, but Bloodsport is still a good choice to watch when there's nothing else left to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean- Claude Van Damme (getting better at his English lol) plays Frank Dux, a strong will-ed fighter who decides to enter the Kumite, a deadly illegal fighting arena where men confront each other and display their athletisism... by beating each other untill they're knocked out, they tap, or they die! This movie doesn't have the best dialogue or script, but it's something that has pretty good fight scenes. The fights are pretty much what you should look forward to if you want to see this. If action is your style, or if it's a case that you like seeing people beat the crap out of each other, see fight club instead. 4.7/10--- my professional rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE GREATEST KARATE-MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Movie is so good you can watch it several times without getting tired of it. Okey, the acting and the dialoges were above average, but that's not what people want to see. We want to see the whole film in particular. The story is very good and the music is AWESOME =). I'm a real fan of 80's music to you who doesn't already know. Van Damme, in this movie is a very good fighter and wants to learn from Mr. Tanaka how to FIGHT. Van Damme has to get through many tests which he manages with some training in no time. When the Kumite starts, the real life begins for Jean or should I say Dux. He has to defeat every opponent to win the special sword which is a Katanasword. He pays his respect in the end to Shidoshi who trained him.Jackson is a good friend of Dux and they seem to get along very good.Anyway, this movie is special because in this movie you can see all the slow-motion scenes in air and on ground. Another thing that makes this movie so immortal is the fighthing scenes in the end. They are so cool and fantastic!!! This movie is a pearl. A masterpiece of art. It is the best Martial-arts movie ever made and will be, i think!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This wasn't the greatest movie ever made. It was easily watchable and fun, and the fact that it was mostly based on a true story makes it even better, but what really makes this movie is Jean-Claude Van Damme's Martial Arts Skill. He is Incredible. Some of the things he can do with his feet are just fascinating. This was a pretty good movie but the last fight scene alone makes it worth it. Kudos to Bolo Yeung, he was a great villain and also has some pretty good Martial Arts Skill. If you like Martial Art's Films, Van Damme Films or Action Movies..this is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm amused to see so many people who are actually serious about this movie. I guess a lot of meatheads didn't realize this movie was so bad that it was good...but at least we both enjoy it. This is a good flick to see when you are not in a serious mood, or not sober at all. There are very few movies that have such funny one-liners. And I mean the kinds you laugh at and not with. Especially fundamental to the enjoyment of this movie is the stereotype biker badass Ray Jackson. Here are a sample of his quotes:"Looks like the Kumite starts one day earlier this year!", "What the hell is a dim mach?" ,"I ain't your pal, d**kface!","You might wanna have kids one of these days." The acting, editing, music (brilliant, creative Kumite song), and feel of this movie is that of 80's kung-fu cheese. Who better to debut than an austrian muscle man with an accent and a penchant for DWI's and adultery for the role of hardass Frank Dux. The real life dude did have the fastest punch (awesome!), but I doubt he was the ladies man like Jean Claude who could look so soloflex sexy in his tight underwear. This is one of the best movies to laugh at. It's just as bad as a movie like Magnolia, but so much more rewarding in its retardness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a great breakthrough for jean claude.the music lends a helping hand also in getting the viewer in the mood for some intense full contact action.van damme(frank dux)is an army guy who enters the underground type kumite and becomes friends with ogre(from revenge of the nerds).they participate in the awesome kumite event and are matched with all sorts of stylists and characters.forrest whittaker's in it too as an agent type guy,teamed up with another agent who's kind of dorky but that's all good.the action in this one outweighs the flaws in acting.the story is good and the plot is decent.the action though,which for me is what it's all about really holds up strong even against these newer flix like matrix and crouching tiger hidden dragon. jean claude's only 27 years old in this one and he looks even younger.he's like the epitome of the description of the baby faced assasin.ogre from the nerds seems to be the best actor in this one so take that to consideration.in other words,the acting's really not all bad at all.give this flick a chance even if you seen it years ago and have temporarily wiped it out of you're memory bank.it will refresh you over and over again.it is unquestionably one of the most upbeat and enthusiastic martial arts films of all time.it ranks right alongside the karate kid,only the strong,best of the best,sidekicks and street fighter as being one of the most notoriously enthusiastic and upbeat martial arts flix of all time. of course it would'nt be bloodsport without bolo yeung(chong li)who's the kumite champion when dux and his pal first enter the competition.chong li and dux dominate,ogre does well enough to face chong li but is badly defeated by him and thus dux sets out to avenge his friend who finds himself bedridden with injuries from the chong li match. dux then qualifies to battle chong li and we see a masterfully choreographed fight scene that will endure for ages to come.not even the fight scene van damme has with tong po in kickboxer matches this showdown.i could watch it till i pass out.it's highly memorable. it's really cool how van damme(dux)recollects his training with the master at the beginning of the flick to enable himself to bounce back against the odds and overcome his adversary.anybody who criticizes this flick is perhaps offended by it's content or something like that. i thought it was highly invigorating,upbeat and enthralling to say the least.this is van damme in his prime and should'nt be missed or dissed.my rating.a 9.0/10 for it's flawless action and motivating vibe. it would've scored a 10 if they'rd been a few more fight scenes.i just could'nt get enough after that music started energizing me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly fantastic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in fifth grade at this Canadian kid's house. We were in his TV room and he told me of Bloodsport. Being an obese 10 year old I was more interested in eating cupcakes, however, I decided to give Bloodsport a try, and to this day I am glad I did. Bloodsport stars Ogre from 'Revenge of the Nerds' as he tries to win some underground fighting tournament against a bunch of Asians, Jean Claude Van Damme and some mystery French/German kickboxer. Ogre loses to Chun Li, but it's all good, Van Damme gets his revenge in the end. The true mark of this movie comes in its soundtrack. There is a purely brilliant song that repeats "cummate', cummate'..." over and over again, this is followed by some cheesy 80's lyrics. This song brings me to tears every time I hear it, much like "rubber,plastic, metal glass" off of the Karate Kid soundtrack. Bloodsport also marks the first movie of Forest Whitaker's career. Note that this coincided with Lou Whitaker's baseball career, coincidence? Perhaps. Anyway, Whitaker is partnered with a gay old man who run around Thailand like a couple of d-bags trying to bring Van Damme back to the States, despite him clearly not being an American. Anyway, perhaps they mistake all 4'11" men with gay accents for US army officers. My call is to see this film, and see it now. If you don't you should not continue your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly pleasant film in its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Newt Arnold directed this Hollywood debut appearance of Jean-Claude Van Damme in 1988. Damme is young here, but does perhaps his finest performance here. He plays the real life character Frank Dux (check the IMDB Crazy Credits section for more details!) who participates in the secret martial arts contest held in Hong Kong every fifth year. There are many fighters and different martial arts, and the scenes of fighting are plenty and stylish and occasionally even Hong Kong style, which means lots of slow motion, lots of high jumps and different fight styles and great use of camera during the fight scenes. I didn't have any expectations about this film since I'm not any fan of Van Damme's. He does decent performance in John Woo's US debut Hard Target, but I'm not particularly interested in Damme's films, but watch them gladly if an opportunity appears. In Bloodsport, he acts also decently and never irritatingly, which is great thing. I think this is his most noteworthy performance because he is pretty natural here and does the fight scenes with skill (as always, though). I think fans of martial arts films and especially people who practice martial arts like this film. The fight scenes are not too realistic as in real life, these kind of punches and kicks would've killed a person, but it is usually the case with these films, but definitely don't try this at home!The music is as 80's as possible with "great" Kumite song performed by some 80's pop/rock band, and there are also some great pieces of electric music in here. The best parts of the film are the scenes at the contest since, as I mentioned, the fight scenes are so stylish and interesting due to their cinematic technique. The title Bloodsport title is explained at one point, so there is fair amount of violence and blood in this film, so don't try to watch it if unrealistic violence and this kind of stuff offends you; necks are snapped, blood is spat, but only sometimes fighters are really hurt or even killed. I don't know what the experts of martial arts think about these films that don't show the real results of this kind of violence, but probably they wouldn't like it. I found this very noteworthy piece of martial arts action films and in its own genre, it gets an 8/10 rating from me, but if you are interested in REAL martial art movies, start to track down films from Hong Kong and Asia. And there are MANY others than Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Jackie Chan as they are only the most popular fighters of the Orient.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**Spoilers**This is a truly brilliant film. If you want to see one of the best martial arts films ever made then this is the one for you. Although the acting isnt too good the fight scenes are outstanding along with the above average music.The film is about Frank Dux(Van Damme) a real life fighter who won the Kumite and holds many records still to this day.It is about Dux going to the Kumite to compete with the worlds best fighters in a full contact competition. Among the fighters who stand out is none other than Kung Fu Legend Bolo Yueng who plays the Bad guy Chong Li.The fight scenes as i said are outstanding and some of the best i have ever seen, Iron Monkey is probably the only film which has better.Dux fights his way through to the final to meet the monster that is Chong Li who broke an opponents leg and killed another unfortunate, although to show that he isnt invincible he did take a few hits from his opponents. The final was a bit of a dissapointment, They shouldnt have made Chong Li cheat and Van Damme fighting when half blind is a bit poor aswell, but it is a good fight and of course Van Damme wins. If you want to see fight scenes how they should be made and arent too bothered by the sight of blood(or Broken legs and backs) then i advise you to watch this film.Compared to other martial arts films, A Classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme v. Bolo in this popular actioner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Popular B-movie that not only established its star as the hottest action property around, but also brought about the re-birth of the tournament movie (particularly in HK), an almost killed-off kung fu cliché. Enter the Dragon only bloodier and not half as enthralling, this cherpy action classic sees Van Damme as real-life master Frank Dux, escaping from army training to represent his dying teacher in the brutal Kumite, a violent martial arts tournament secretly-held in Hong Kong where world representatives get to strut their stuff. Van Damme's never looked better than this, acting as bad as ever yet more than compensating with some flashy footwork, and with the great Bolo returning to the US mainstream as the Kumite's leading baddie, there's no doubting the film's credentials. It more than lives up - Bloodsport is an absolute treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*Let me first say that there are GOOD movies and there are good MARTIAL ARTS FILMS. I have an issue with the people who trash chop-socky movies because of their bad acting/dubbing and low-budgets. Fans of the genre do not watch Bruce Lee films because of the acting! They watch them because of the scenes where Bruce gets bloodied, tastes his own blood and then goes mental on the bad guys. Likewise, Bloodsport should not be judged by its poor acting and numerous cliches. It is possibly the best American martial arts flick ever made. The fight scenes are FAST and well paced and the story keeps you right on rolling along. Also, the film tries very hard to be authentic. This is rare in the action genre. Notice that the young lad who plays "Young Dux" has a French accent? And his parents are migrant workers? They could have easily had "Young Dux" played by an American youngster. This would have been overlooked by most directors and they would have ignored the fact that by the time he was grown up, Dux had developed a very strong French accent!Oh and Bolo Yeung is in this film. He's great, go rent it. Hope it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, a fighting film that's actually good fun to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can tell why people often say this is "the very best martial arts movie ever made" (que exclamation marks and over-use of caps); quite simply because this is a solid, fun movie to watch as a whole.Fighting films should be about fights, obviously, so it would be a good idea to just keep the rest simple, which is just what Bloodsport does. The story couldn't be more basic; there's some kind of underground tournament going on in Hong Kong, famous for it's brutal, everything-goes nature. And our Man with the Dodgy Accent (c) goes off to compete in it to do justice to his sensei, despite the dangers and the officials wanting to stop him. Along the way, one or two more characters are thrown in, and our hero ends up taking on the deeply unpleasant current tournament champ who savagely beat up a friend of his (the friend in question is a fat hairy bloke named Jackson who -really- gets up one's nerves, so it's actually pleasing to him getting thrashed. Justice at last).It's a plausible, simple excuse for lots of loud fights, that works well. Big, complex plots would just hamper a film like this and distract from it's main purpose. Bloodsport delivers where it matters; the battle scenes are all fast, slick and exciting. An very nice touch is to see some of the background characters in action, some with very exotic fighting styles (an agile black blokey who moves around like an animal on the ring is especially groovy). The film also seems to try and bring up a point about the honor of combatants, and while such a thing is usually difficult to take seriously, it works well enough here.All in all this is pleasing to watch. Nothing deep and sophisticated, just a good little burst of adrenaline. And it's done with enough flair to make it enjoyable even for non-machos or viewers who aren't fans of the genre. The simple story, with all the traditional elements in there is fleshed out in a smooth and rapid fashion that keeps it from getting dull (and it's filmed with more style than one'd expect). If you've ever read a fighting manga for boys and liked that, you'll feel right at home here.My only gripe is that in typical Hollywood fashion, there's a "romance" in there that's not so much romantic rather than "He looked at me! Let's hit the sack!". At least not too much time is spent on a really needless element like this (and since it gives them an excuse to show Van Damme's butt it's not all bad).It's still plain good fun in the end, even if you're not an affictionado of the genre (or, like me, just completely ignorant about the genre...but you read too many manga). Just let yourself go and enjoy some mindless, but well-crafted boysy fighting fun.</fullReview>

Sad 2 see that stupid cheesy sequels came out yrs later without Van Damme.If u havent seen it, rent it but 4 action fans-BUY IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-Matrix, The best Hollywood could do in Martial Arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Enter the dragon, every man and his chump tried their hand at a martial arts flick, some good and some bad. One of the more memorable of these was "Bloodsport" Starring Van-Damme in one of his earliest appearances, this is still without doubt his best film. Ironically, the set up for the film is one that would have suited the terrible "Streetfighter" film down to the ground. The film features all of the best cliches of the genre, "Remember your training" "Honor your master" etc, with all the macho trappings. It may be one dimensional, Ghong Li (A wasted Bolo Yeung, who also appeared in Enter the dragon) is the bad guy, Van-Damme as Dux the honorable hero. The film remains enjoyable thanks to several classic moments, Jean-Claude asserting to Donald Gibb, that he might be "A little too old for video games" and the other competitors in the tournament, who are more imaginatively thought out than you might think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is obviously Van Damme's best film, which isn't saying much since most of his movies suck. I wouldn't go so far to say that it is the "BEST MARTIAL ARTS FILM EVER". Because it isn't. The fight between Van Damme and Bolo Yeung was horrible and unrealistic. It was just Van Damme doing a jumping spin kick with Bolo standing their like a statue taking the hit. Another problem I had with this movie is that guy from Revenge of the Nerds. You know what I'm talking about. I mean his character was so lame. I am sure about 70% of the movie was made for sake of the movie even though it was a true story. Just because there is alot of fights, martial arts, and fighters doesn't mean it is a good martial arts movie. If you want to see a real good martial arts movie than check out films by Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Sammo Hung, or any other martial arts star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van damme's best &amp; the greatest martial arts film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is definately Jean Claude van Damme's best movie. I was just a kid when I saw it, he was my childhood hero from then on, and I actually started doing Karate for that reason.Even though he's got an heavy accent in this movie, I think his acting is at his best. It is disappointing to see that he hasn't evolved much, besides getting "Americanized", incorporating a very shallow artificial persona on-screen. In Bloodsport he seems much more natural, in touch with his true self. Furthermore, he isn't and he can't be funny. It seems like they all try: I wish they'd stick to what they are good at.Bloodsport is just amazing in terms of martial art on film. It will never be better, and van Damme's is just great. His style (heavily influenced by his ballet lessons) is so neat and precise. His jump-spinning kicks have always amazed me.If we could change history, I'd make him go back and do movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would be the best Van Damme film I have seen out of all the ones he has starred in. Since I first watched this film about 10 years ago its still one of my favorite Martial Arts film. It has non-stop action, violence and plenty of fighting scenes, which keeps you interested through out the film watching the many different styles of fighting used in the ring. For people who have not seen this film it's something that really would be worth hiring out from a video store. Its a lot better then his new films which really is getting to a poorer standard like Inferno with less fighting scenes and poor acting which is a pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme fans should get what they want here, but it's not an entirely satisfying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) decides to turn his back on the military so that he can compete in the Kumite (which is a full contact fighting tournament held in Hong Kong). However, this is a no-holds-barred event where participants have been killed in the past. This competition puts Dux on a collision course with the undefeated champion Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) and Dux finds that he must pull out all the stops in order to come out of this competition alive.Bloodsport contains many of the staple ingredients that you can expect from a Van Damme film; wooden acting, cheesy dialogue, a predictable story and some rather in-your-face direction. I personally think these things form part of the charm with his films and with these expectations in mind I seldom criticise his films for continually serving these things up (sometimes I just like watching these nonsense films). There are however some things which are not really forgivable in a JCVD film such as....POOR PACING; I think part of the problem here is that this film seemed to introduce unnecessary elements which did seem to slow the film down - the two officials going to Hong Kong to try to get Dux out of the competition which seemed to just act as an unneeded sub-plot. I also could have done without the underdeveloped and uninteresting love interest with the news reporter as well. These aspects served no real purpose and should have been omitted from the story - yes I'm aware it's based on a true story, but how about just focusing on the interesting stuff? The story is also quite poorly developed which wouldn't be as much of a problem if it was a fictional story with a fictional character in the lead role. However, Bloodsport is based on a real character and it perhaps could have offered a little more insight into its central character.Despite the above problems, the 'meat' of the film is actually quite good - the fight sequences are pretty good (although many of the fights are a bit too short for my liking). The fights are quite brutal here and director Newt Arnold leaves very little to the imagination - there is one truly horrific scene that caused me to look away from the screen. The friendship that blossoms between Dux and Ray Jackson was also quite a nice angle to the story.I quite enjoyed Bloodsport, but what really lets it down is its rather poor pacing and its lack of insight which I've previously mentioned. Taking everything into account though this is an OK film which should please Van Damme fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a simple and no-nonsense action/sports movie, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as Frank Dux, who leaves his army post to enter an underground martial arts competition to win the championship for honoring his master, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao).As a straight-to-the-point movie, the plot is well-paced and easy to follow, with plenty of well-choreographed martial arts scenes and action sequences, from the competition fighters duking it out on one another to Frank Dux going against the ruthless and deadly record champ Chong Li (Bolo Yeung). The subplot of the two military officers, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker), scrambling around Hong Kong to find Dux blends in well with the main plot and delivers some added intrigue and comic relief to the story.The film contains some plot holes, for example, the reason why the HK police never investigated the underground martial arts operation was not explained. But, it's still a good flick that action movie fans should enjoy.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Dux (Jean Claude VanDamme) has spent most his life being trained by Tanaka to participate in the Kumite, the ultimate martial arts tournament, where participants are seriously injured, even killed.From a critical standpoint, this film gets sort of a bad rap because of the cheesy acting and formulaic plot. Some people might even give it a hard time because it alleges to be based on a true story which was (not surprisingly) found to be a figment of one man's imagination.But is there not a certain level of nostalgia for 1980s action films? The violence, the hair, the gratuitous romance (which is really forced here). No decade before or since has mastered the action film. 80s horror is amazing, but the action films were really the pinnacle, thanks in no small part to Cannon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic martial arts movie suffering from some weird mood swings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw Bloodsport for the first time, I was pretty amazed. It had intense action scenes and all the things that made a young action movie fan wanting more.Only after 10 years or so when I saw it again, I noticed how weird the movie really is. Basically it is about one man's quest to compete in a secret tournament against the best of the best (and some of the weirdest) fighters around the world. He is fulfilling the last wish of his master by entering the Kumite and fighting to achieve the championship. It is said to be based on the real life events of Frank Dux but I cannot tell how much is actually real and how much is fiction, both in the movie and in the story Dux himself has told. The plot itself is not really complicated or anything too deep but Van Damme gives a good performance as Dux and is mostly very convincing.What 'bothers' me is the odd scenes here and there in the movie: at one point we have this serious fight scene with unsettling music and the next we have Van Damme running away from two military law enforcement agents played by Norman Burton and Forest Whitaker with light-hearted, even comical, music.Also, the female love interest sub-plot is quite irrelevant to the plot as a whole and Leah Ayres serves only to slightly even the scales with the many testosterone-filled fighting machines. I believe she also somewhat blackmails Dux for letting her tag along to get into the Kumite since it is mostly off-limits to regular people. The blackmailing is bewildering to me since she tells Dux that she will tell the agents his whereabouts if he doesn't let her come with him the the tournament and yet the agents already know and/or can locate Dux by themselves rendering the blackmailing pointless and ineffective. But of course, Dux being the gentleman he is, let's her tag along.Bloodsport is enjoyable martial arts movie and it belongs to every fan's must-see list. However, the overall pacing and some scenes take away some of the seriousness of the Kumite that the film no doubt tries to convey through some of the fight scenes and the menacing antagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure, Honest, and Not That Bloody Martial Arts Classic !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Bloodsport) has it all. The quest for heroism, real martial arts, charismatic highly skilled fighter as a lead, and clever fight sequences.At the time of its release the cheap cinemas, nicknamed the summer ones in my country, were crammed by the teens who loved that new wave of martial arts movies, and that newcomer (Jean Claude Van Damme). I do remember colleagues, from school, who jumped over the school's wall to catch a movie for him. Well, sure among the macho men of the action cinema back then : (Sly), (Arnie) and (Chan), (Van Damme) was the more handsome. And with his impressive skills he could be a factor of originality for this movie's repeated story.Overall I loved the simple yet effective script. Despite being clichéd, it worked highly. However some points were a bit weak. For instance : the motive to go to the tournament; it was only to honor the old Japanese mentor? Why that mentor didn't honor himself previously, we didn't even hear him talking in regret that he couldn't win it once (anyway, thank god it wasn't a revenge story !). The reason of chasing the lead by the 2 agents; is that he was a deserter? Not a convincing motive either ! Then, the lead character. He seemed unbeatable since the start, whereas his capacities were many and rare. Not seeing one point of weakness in him led to know ? pretty soon ? that he'll be the ass-kicker of all the contestants; which hurt the movie with obvious predictability. And finally the way the American friend was presented for the first time as brazen to the girls ? It wasn't so accurate, plus there was another brazen already (the Arabian contestant).(Donald Gibb), as the American friend (Ray Jackson), was incredible. I don't know why that comic and lovable actor wasn't utilized anywhere else by the way he was here. He's just a big body to block the way of the lead in all the movies I have watched for him; which is strange and sad ! In his scenes, (Forest Whitaker) steals the camera by his utter childish reactions. I don't know how he was cast as a law enforcement agent, he looks like a shy kid in a high school ! The soundtrack is a trip to the 1980s. The way it comments on the events is so cool. The editing, redone by (Van Damme), did solid and sedate job. Some shots were so well made, on their top is where the lead was doing his split, while what seems to be a meditation moment, in the hotel's balcony, viewing the whole country from above; aside from its sheer beauty it was solemn, having a touch of mysticism, as if he ? by activating his physical and mental capacities ? managed as a human to be higher than the city's skyscrapers, appearing as the king of Honk Kong.There are 3 extra reasons that helped this movie to be a success : Firstly, seeing (Van Damme) doing the split; it was sort of unprecedented for a movie star to do, turning into (Van Damme)'s most famous trade mark, so how about doing it ? in the same movie ? for a total of 7 times ! Secondly, the poster's picture with (Van Damme) flying in the air heading for pointing a kick to his opponent by his feet, a move that next video games based upon this movie I think. That not CG-ed picture fascinated many male, mostly very young, viewers back then, you can also see how posters for movies like (The Next Karate Kid), 6 years later, copy it. Now the third reason is utterly related to the *female* viewers; it's the shot of (Van Damme) right after getting up in the morning with nearly nothing on his body; no doubt that shot was an effective reason for his stardom later, especially with the ladies ! At one point, the movie's lead faces a nasty Arabian contestant, by the name of (Hussein) and the wear of headband, who harasses the female American journalist (played by Leah Ayres), and then the lead beats that brat brazen by a trick. The thing is it's so typical. Because in all, and I mean ALL, the movies produced by (Cannon Group), headed by (Menahem Golan), the Arabian characters are none other than a negative thing, and from all the angles. It was a point I believe (Van Damme) paid attention to some time early and avoided repeating it, particularly after knowing that his movies earn good deal of money in the Middle East countries.In 1996, (Van Damme) kind of remade (Bloodsport), through older age, in (The Quest) a movie he wrote, directed, and starred. Although it was a flop, but that mirrors his true passion towards that hit movie from 1988, which launched him along with showing some of the most important martial arts fights since (Bruce Lee)'s (Enter the Dragon ? 1973). And ? sorrowfully ? it mirrors his downhill within less than 10 years of his career's start as well. It's a fun time with pure, honest, and not that bloody martial arts. I didn't run into these certain qualities, gathered in one movie, that much before or after. Simply, the entertaining B-movie wasn't that entertaining unless few times in history. It's a fair example for a formulaic low-budget action that could be the best of itself, and with its plain themes, smart choreography, hip music and capable lead, it became not only a hit in its time, but a cult classic. Sometimes a mix of simplicity and efficiency is an equation for being classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JEAN CLAUDE VAN DAMME stars in this action packed true story as FRANK DUX, a martial artist who enters the Kumite in an attempts to win it, but first has to face a series of challenges including the super invincible CHONG LI who will gladly go to any means necessary to win it for himself. BLOODSPORT is an early Van Damme movie made before KICKBOXER but by pretty much the same crew as that film. I on the other hand preferred KICKBOXER but that's just my opinion, that's not to say BLOODSPORT is boring, because it's not, if anything BLOODSPORT packs more punch (no pun intended) &amp; offers more excitement in it's mere opening minutes than most modern day action films have throughout their running time duration. BLOODSPORT is a must see for fans who love action movies &amp; to get a glimpse of what sadly is becoming a rare thing these days for action movies, plenty of action from start to finish, an emotional story, excellent acting &amp; directing, suspenseful fight scenes &amp; no CGI/BLUE/GREEN screen effects! Highly recommended to action fans looking for a fun time with plenty of edge of your seat action style stuff to help wet the appetite of action fans everywhere. The only reason I never gave it a full four stars is because of KICKBOXER (in fact this movie contains many scenes that were repeated in that film in terms of all the training sequences) which again I thought was better than this but it's just as good. Followed by three in name only sequels starting with BLOODSPORT 2.*** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme's breakout role is an average low budget action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This title holds the dubious distinction of being the first film that really showcased Jean Claude Van Damme's martial arts. Throughout the film, we are constantly invited to watch Van Damme kick people in the face, spin around and generally do other athletic things, so this can be considered as the first film that broke him into Hollywood. As a film itself, the premise is rather basic and descends into a series of staged fight scenes?the familiarity of the situation comes from the many other films that Van Damme made which were basically just remakes of this one (I'm talking stuff like A.W.O.L., THE QUEST, KICKBOXER, etc.). The low budget is apparent, in that we don't get much in the way of special effects, but the fight scenes are all pretty good. All of these fights looked authentic (apart from the first, I think, where the thrown punches and kicks were too obvious) and kept the attention.The acting isn't really important in a film like this, but still?the female lead is, as to be expected, an airhead, adding nothing to the film whatsoever. Van Damme was still struggling with his accent at this point in time and he lacks some of the natural charisma which he later conveyed. Yes, his acting wasn't as good here, but he makes an adequate leading man and he's never been in better physical shape. Bolo Yeung thoroughly enjoys himself in the sneering role of the lead villain, and he obviously enjoyed working with Van Damme as he later turned up in 1991's DOUBLE IMPACT, playing yet another villain. It's surprising to see a young Forest Whitaker in the cast (this was obviously before he went "legit"), in the pointless role of a government agent whose job is to get Van Damme back to America. These scenes are added in as mere padding, to add something to the film other than the fight sequences, and consequently fall flat.The violence level is high, with lots of kicking and punching. We get some broken arms and legs, and plenty of nosebleeds, but I was surprised that the film didn't add more in the way of gratuitous violence?the only actual violence which hit home were the bits involving Yeung. On an simple level, this film is enjoyable, but it lacks the polished veneer and style of Van Damme's later offerings and therefore can't be considered one of his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I easily get caught up in this genre and BLOODSPORT is as fun as it is hilarious. It is obvious that not one person has any acting ability with the exception of Bolo Yeung and our two agents. The terrible mid-80s rock music (ala ROCKY IV and TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE), adds to the cheese, but who cares? The fighting is as entertaining as the hype itself. If you are too practical, than BLOODSPORT is not for you. But if you love mindless entertainment with a bit of heart, then KUMITE! KUMITE!Frank Dux dodges the government and authorities while bedding reporters and playing video games in his quest to honor his shidoshi and become the champion of the Kumite in Hong Kong.The moments with Dux and his shidoshi were nicely done and touching compared to our hero and Jackson, where at the end of the kumite, some of their touching moments had me concerned. Inspiring in many ways, yet heartfully hokey and sad in others, BLOODSPORT deserves a look in anyone curious about the martial arts genre. It is a good laugh and an entertaining film at that, if you do not take it seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, of course, a cinema purist. I can't stand watching films on TV if they are going to be interrupted by commercials or edited in anyway. I won't even start watching something I have not seen unless I started at the very beginning and went to the end. However, with a couple friends over and a little Mystery Science Theater 3000 atmosphere, I threw all those rules out the window and experienced the last hour or so of the cult classic Bloodsport. Did I watch it as a piece of art? Not really. It was more the spectacle of cheesy 80's aesthetic and campy acting/dialogue that kept me from turning the channel. Was the first hour something important? Who knows, and who cares. I got the gist of what was occurring and from fight to fight knew who the hero and villain were and found myself needing nothing more.I love the tagline for the film?"The secret contest where the world's greatest warriors fight in a battle to the death." How misleading is that statement? The connotations to Mortal Kombat are unavoidable?with rumor being that Johnny Cage is mirrored off our lead character Frank Dux?but to the death is a bit of a stretch. One fighter dies in this film, ONE. When he is murdered, the judges and crowd turn their backs on the killer, unable to condone the brutality. I want to know who marketed this and give them a high-five for skewing the truth to sell some seats. The movie could never be a to-the-death fight and work. Not only would we lose all respect for our hero, but also he would never be able to take a life as shown on screen. The tournament would have been shut down too, with American military cops showing up, people everywhere knowing about the event, and reporters going undercover for a story. If death was prevalent, not even the Triads could keep it up.The beauty of the film, though, is in its soundtrack. Synthesizers and falsettos abound transporting you back in time to bad acting, teased hair, and crazy characters. Every second is chock full of unintentional comedy and my friends and I had a blast with it. Jean-Claude Van Damme made a name for himself off this film, and he does not disappoint. Deserting his army post in order to go to Hong Kong to fight and avenge his master's death, this American fighter has the thickest Belgian accent possible. Maybe they explain that he was naturalized as a US citizen in the time I missed, but either way I guess it doesn't quite matter in the grand scope of things. You cannot get enough of his slow-mo shaking body and wide eyed defiance on the battle mat nor the hammy looks of fear once his adversary Chong Li gets embedded in his head to the point he even manifests him on the bus. His romantic involvement with a reporter is also laughable. There is no chemistry between them at all?I think there might be more between he and friend Ray Jackson played brilliantly by Donald Gibb?and the relationship culminates in a horribly orchestrated scene of them bowing to each other hand over fist. At least it is an ending to put a smile on your face, not from contentment, but from sheer absurdity that you stuck with the story its conclusion.In the end, however, you have to see the film for one performance only, Forest Whitaker as the army cop. No, just joking, what the hell was he thinking doing this film? The real reason is Bolo Yeung as Chong Li. This guy is the epitome of evil. The guy is massive and his menacing stare down is so scary you have to laugh from fear or else you may soil yourself. His silent screams and excitement are so unnecessary and out-of-place that they actually work. This guy doesn't need to scream or yell. You actually start thinking he may be a mute until he finally tells Van Damme he is going to kill him before the final fight.Is Bloodsport quality cinema? Is it even nostalgically worth seeing as a piece of art? The answer is no on both counts. Would I stop flipping channels and watch it next time its on TV? Definitely. As a comedy, the film is wonderful. I can't even say the fighting is spectacular because it is always subverted by laughs. Between the guy acting like a monkey and the Sumo hugging people into submission, every single second is priceless and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty cool fighting but often cringe-worthy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a trend in films that are supposedly about fighting tournaments, where the actual fighting is secondary to the plot, so much so in some instances that there's barely any fighting at all. That certainly can't be said for Bloodsport. The first twenty minutes of the film build up the plot and cover Frank Dux(Van Damn) who is a marine or something, his childhood and his martial arts training. The rest is mostly hardcore fighting. Mostly.Obviously with a movie like Bloodsport, you have to take the plot with a pinch of salt. Unfortunately for Bloodsport, i didn't have enough salt. As cool as it was to see Forest Whitaker in an early role, his character as a Navy/Army(Dunno?) detective trying to track down Dux in Hong Kong was almost as useless as Dux's love interest, who served to be a massive annoyance. I'm not sure why it's considered necessary to have a love interest who inputs nothing to the film but a brief period of trying to hold the male protagonist back. It's misogynistic and very boring to watch. There were a couple of cheesy montages with cued 80's music(How did they not think it would date?) and some awful dialogue too. I'm not even going to touch on Dux's friendship with fellow fighter and bikie, Ray Jackson(Played by Donald Gibb). WAY bad. I don't mean to sound shallow and or seem like i don't like an engaging plot, but lets be honest, its a poorly scripted, awkwardly acted fight-fest, there's no need for shoddy story lines.Anyway, down to the fighting. It was exceptionally well choreographed, and you can tell that the fighters know what they're doing. Occasionally the punches looked a little soft, and Van Damn's odd wailing gets gets a bit distracting, but it's hard to care much when there's so much fighting going on. The villain was great, but the final confrontation between him and Dux is a tad disappointing.Like i said the acting is downright awkward, especially Van Damn's, he is awful(Though not as awful as the child actor playing his younger self, DAMN!) But then, he's not there for his acting. He's there to look good and fight. On that though, there were a few too many buff shots of Van Damn, his huge muscular body was constantly thrown in your face, as well as a gratuitous shot of Van Damns butt, which made me feel like i was watching gay porn. They could have at least thrown in some breasts, it was the 80's after all! Without giving too much away, for a film called Bloodsport, there just wasn't enough blood. I wanted necks broken and faces crushed. I didn't want half an hour of cheesy music, silly chases, unnecessary love scenes, and male butts shots. But hey, that's just me.Five out of Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily one of Jean-Claude's finest movies, may be his best. The acting is horrific and the story is kind of lame but the fighting scenes are pretty fun to follow. All sorts of different fighters in this deadly tournament make it more interesting and almost real. Donald Gibb plays a loveable character as Jean's buddy. Jean ends up fighting Bolo in the finals to see who is the champion. Once again, decent story, bad acting but good fighting scenes. So if you like karate or fighting watch this. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK firstly I'm being generous with that 3 your seeing there. And i'm ashamed that i'm gonna give it that, because just like everyone else, I also indulge in the guilty pleasure of van damme movies. The problem with this film starts off not at the beginning, but once they reach the kumite. Then and only then will you begin to realize the mistake you made watching the 2 o'clock in the morning WGN late night movie. The fight choreography is an atrophy most of the time. Its like watching 2 drugged up apes smash their think tanks together. OK maybe it's not that bad but the lack of skill was as hideous as the one liners.OK I'll be clear on this! I watched this movie about 4 years ago on TV one night, I was about 14 I think and jean claude van-damme was my role model. 4yr's later I watch the movie again and this time I'm anything but delighted. The Only good fights are the ones between van damme and the giant Tibetan freak show, the Spanish boxer Paco and that nerdy looking karate guy, chong li and that lame white kickboxer who gets ownizled, and finally van damme versus Paco. I loved it how they did shot for shot on the runway. People wondering why I excluded the van damme versus chong li match-up, it's simple it was a degradation of the entire movie. There was no attempt to block strikes at all. I wanted to get in there and kick van damme in the marble bag when he was doing that stupid 6 hit kick combination on chong li's face.Overall it's the kumite that truly brings this movie down. The music is great. I loved all the tracks and their arrangement is superb. Kudos to Michael Bishop for his song.Naughty naughty jean claude, no more martial arts spoofs, and shame on you!</fullReview>

Burton and Whitaker (the only two to offer halfway decent acting) play CID officers on the hunt for Dux. Despite bad acting, disappointing choreography and endless clichés, none of the paper-thin characters are exceptionally unlikable (though this might be because they're so poorly developed) and the Hong Kong setting is captured so vividly.

Now, the fact that he lost to Ronald MacDonald - yes, that Ronald MacDonald - may be a good thing or a bad thing - you decide.Don't look for any plot here. Frand Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes to the ultimate Karate match against orders. He is fighting his way up the chain to meet the defending champion; an ugly monster played by Bolo Yeung. His friend gets hurt and that spurs him on to fight harder. That's as much plot as you need. This is all about the fighting and there is plenty of it. Every weird type of karate master is in this tourney and, if you enjoy the sport, you will enjoy the movie.It also features Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) in a great follow up to his funny role in Good Morning Vietnam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Van Damme's Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many good martial arts films and although i'm not the greatest fan of the genre (I generally stick to Bruce, Donnie, Jet &amp; Jackie) I've always found this movie to be extremely watchable. Being one of the first high-kicking films I ever saw it inspired me, though not for a while, to give the genre more of a chance. It is, in my opinion one of the best American efforts of the time and while all the other kids in school (i was 13 at the time) were talking about the karate kid films I could sit back and laugh at them and their weak-ass idol (Ralph Macchio), knowing that i had seen someone in action who was infinitely more tough and talented. The fight scenes at times are quite brutal (uncut) and are the best i've seen in a Van Damme film so far. There is the usual amount of sentimentality always present in his films but the main focus is on the 'Kumite', a secret full contact event held in Hong Kong. The film is based on a true story but is obviously enhanced for visual effect as is the case in most films of its kind (ie professional fighters standing there watching, wide open, as their opponent winds up a massively telegraphed spinning attack). The movie was practically remade in later years as 'The Quest' and may not stand up technically to the latter but shows what Van Damme could do before he started getting complacent and picking up guns. Fight Fans will probably be happier skipping straight to the action as the acting is pretty poor and the story a bit soppy. Bolo Yeung, one of my favourite bad guys, is suitably menacing and perfectly cast as the reigning champion. All in all a bad, cheesy, but entertaining little film and one that holds a special place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone asked me about 15 years ago how I would rate this movie, I would've given it a 9 or 10 instead of the 6 I just gave it. Seeing this movie now it's so easy to see the silliness and bad acting that plagues it. However, as far as Van Damme's career this was the film that made him a superstar and, in my opinion, the one role that he personified the best. That's saying a lot, because watching this movie nowadays I realize how BAD his acting was, but then again he's here for his martial arts skills. Not to say he's that good because there are COUNTLESS people better than him....Van Damme is a ballerina compared to true martial arts experts like Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, etc etc. Everyone knows the story by now; the movie on a whole is entertaining, but it seems more like a comedy than a martial arts biopic. There's silliness everywhere, from the dialogue to the actual fight scenes themselves; so much that you can't help but think that the makers of the film really went overboard with their 'dramatic license', and hardly any of the events in the film really happened. Still, if I had to pick a Van Damme film to watch and enjoy, I'd choose this almost everytime.**1/2 out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This distractively titled movie is a biopic of martil arts pro, Frank Dux. But just because it's based on fact (parts of it) doesn't mean that it's better than your average gung-ho action fest. In no way does the film, even in the slightest way seem like a biopic. Frank Dux was an American- so why does he speak with a heavy Belgian accent. Looks like they put brawn over brains when they cast Jean Claude Van Damme. The movie is average at best, but it still is shamelessly predictable. You can calculate the film's every move. But then again, it's not necessarily bad, but nothing we haven't seen before.

When I was watching it yesterday on TV, and I thought a strange cat got into my apartment. It turned out the cat sound stopped when the fighting stopped (or so it seemed). OK, I know the production values were nothing special, and the voice used for Chong Li was probably the same voice that was used for Arnold in his Hercules movie, But a cat?!

		<fullReview>In Hong Kong an illegal, brutal and sometime lethal martial arts competition is being staged. Fighters come from all over the globe to compete in the three day 'kumite' with the last man standing being declared the world champion ? a title being defended this year by the fearsome and cruel Chong Li. In an effort to honour his death friend and his dead friend's father, Frank Dux deserts his post in the US military and flies into Hong Kong to compete. He makes friends with fellow fighter Ray Jackson, romances journalist Janice Kent and prepares to compete till the finish. Meanwhile two military policemen arrive in Hong Kong determined to return Dux to his station and not allow him to fight.The illegal fight tournament is a frequently used plot device in films of this genre, in fact Van Damme himself has used it several times (and his 2005 project looks like it will be a return to the setting of this film ? Kumite). But just because it is a common setting for martial arts movies and video games doesn't mean that it alone will supply a good plot and an engaging film and Bloodsport is certainly proof of the former even if it sort of pulls off the latter. In terms of plot there is really little more than a bit of window dressing around a series of fights which, lets be honest, is what most of us have come to see. There is practically nothing in terms of characterisation to make the 'plot' more interesting and things like the military policemen, the vague love interest and Dux's background and honourable quest are basically just pointless items that just serve to reduce fighting time without actually adding any value of their own. However it is the fights that are the main attraction and they are enjoyably tough and physical with plenty of good moves refreshingly free of cgi people and wirework. Although the eventual outcome of the tournament is pretty much the safest bet you'll ever get the fights still manage to be enjoyable even if they do lack tension too often. As you'd expect from something like this, it hasn't dated very well and the occasionally bad dubbing, travelogue footage and cheesy 1980's music all take their toll but happily their impact is minimal during the fight scenes.The cast are roundly bad but in fairness few of them will have been cast for their ability to emote! Van Damme is lean and has pretty-boy looks and winning smile that almost make up for his inability to deliver more than a very basic performance. Physically he is good and he has many of his trademark moves here (including some very painful looking splits and the obligatory arse shot!). The support cast features some good martial artists even if some of their styles look very unusual and occasionally funny (is that money style stuff really a discipline?!) but Gibb is not one of them. He is the least skilful of the fighters and he exists as merely a comedic sidekick for Dux (and an inevitable plot device in his own right), a role that he doesn't do very well and just ended up being a rather annoying sub-par WWF wrestler. Ayres is a pretty blonde with long legs and long hair??and that's her contribution pretty much summed up. Forest Whitaker is a strange find but a good one and the support cast features quite a few faces that will be familiar to fans of the genre including Roy Chiao and the mighty Bolo Yeung.Overall this is an OK film if you know what to expect from it ? people getting kicked. If you are looking for dialogue, characters, plot, tension or emotional involvement in the story then you will be sorely disappointed however hands up how many people came here for anything more than the martial arts action? Yeah, thought so ? like the advert says 'this does exactly what it says on the tin' and it does it better than many of Van Damme's films have more recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably best known for being Jean-Claude Van Damme's break-through role, but the pulpy "Bloodsport" (which is inspired by true events of former fighter Frank Dux) delivers good fist-pumping, brutal and sweaty martial arts action set in Hong Kong's underworld. Van Damme's Frank Dux is a marine who heads to Hong Kong to fight in the Kumite, the ultimate, but secret martial arts tournament consisting of the world's best fighters putting their lives on the line. The championship defender Chong Li, a crowd favourite has his eyes on Dux.Stock storytelling, but the martial arts is well-captured and in full-contact. We get the usual flashbacks filled with childhood memories (where the Dux character is portrayed by a dopey looking kid with an even dopier sounding voice), Dux being trained throughout his childhood and into early adulthood by his martial arts mentor Tanaka. There he learns to control pain by being stretched out, catching fish with bare hands (which would become handy later on in life involving a lady reporter, fellow Syrian fighter and a bet), managing to pour tea while blindfolded while blocking a punch. It's all about training hard and building up spiritual confidence, with nothing but concentration on the face. The baby face Van Damme told much more through his animated facials than through his stilted dialogues, which seemed to consist of one line than a pause and then another line. It's an emotional ride filled with pain, pride, and romance and touching male bonding, accompanied by some cheesy soundtrack inclusions and it showed back in the day it was cool to wear you pants above your waist. All of this drama and words of encouragement ("You good fighter. Good. Good.") leads up to its climatic final fight of epic proportions. The polite, relaxed underdog up against the deadly, egotistical champion where slow motion features highly and the intensity remains strong with the yelling, screaming, dirty acts and worried faces. Oh it's beautiful. Watch the faces. It's all in the faces. Pure magic.Director Newt Arnold keeps it up tempo and provides a good montage of fighting, while using the locations to good use. The support cast are able with the likes of Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Forest Whitaker, Norman Burton, Ken Siu and Bolo Yueng is memorable as Chong Li. An pleasurably cheesy fight outing.</fullReview>

In this Kumite, we also have a heavies as Donald Gibb (Ray Jackson), an everlasting funny guy! And Bolo Yeung (Chong Li), a creepy, bad acting, but charismatic dark fighter. I loved Bolo here, he was always bad ass on films, and he is perhaps one of the most worthiest opponents to Van Damme on screen. Leah Ayres is a first Van Damme girl, a sexy journalist that tires to infiltrate to the tournament. Also... the great surprise... Forest Withaker, from younger days. I was so happy to see him here. This film is very powerful, really great martial arts stuff! Watch it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunday afternoon. After one night of partying, I woke up let's say, at 2 am. With a never-seems-to-end hangover (and thus feeling kind of sick) I turned on the TV and started changing channels. After zapping through the cable for 15 minutes, I found to my surprise Bloodsport on a semi-obscure action channel from I-don't-know-where. If you are familiar with the Cronemberg's film "Videodrome", my having found Bloodsport on that particular hour of the day, in that particular channel. one would compare that scene to the scene from Videodrome when the character played by James Wood had found the Videodrome signal.This time, however, I have to point out that a)James Woods' character wasn't as drunk as I was and b) I didn't care if Bloodsport could expose to a brain tumor. Gladly, the latter didn't happen, but I did made an impression on me. Why?, because there couldn't been more of an action cheese flick like Bloodsport. Really, it has all the symptoms that make this movie unforgettable (for some semi dubious reasons): bad acting, lame dialogs, lame music,the American hero, the foreigner almost invincible villain, the tough sidekick, one hot girl and some of the kick ass fights ever. And the end of the day, that is what Bloodsport is all about, the fights. And here where Van Damme and the others fighters excel at. Fast paced bouts, death matches, all of them decently choreographed just to add more drama to this flick. So, in the end Bloodsport won't expose you to any terminal disease. On the contrary, it will amuse and entertain you in a funny way. Better watch it after a serial hangover, it's better in that way. Trust me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It didn't start very well for Jean Claude van Damme. His breaking through, "Bloodsport", is a flick that could have been so much better.First of all they could have changed the script. At times Bloodsport is almost an adventure-movie because of unnecessary elements and therefore rather unrealistic. I would like it to be more of a fake-documentary or a documentary "wannabe" which only focus on Dux and the tournament. The character Jannice Kent has really nothing to do in this feature, she just makes it worse.The music is contemporary and therefore boring. I would like "Bloodsport" more if it had more Chinese music or something corresponding to create more mood in the film.Newt Arnold´s direction isn't really weak but it could have been a more interesting view with less editing, more pans with the camera together with slow and quick zooms.The fact that "Bloodsport" is short for being a feature is just a plus, but some of the fights could perhaps been longer and they could perhaps also having some more fights without spoiling the overall impression.Overall, Bloodsport is for me a big disappointment that misses it's potential but in the same time at some moments a good movie.Rating: 4+ of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult film highlighted by excellent martial arts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is a martial arts film about Frank W. Dux, an American who travels to Hong Kong to participate in an underground martial arts tournament known as the Kumite. Although it's based on real events, it's clear that Bloodsport isn't very accurate in that measure. The fighting styles are authentic though.Jean Claude Van Damme plays the role of Frank. He definitely gives the appearance of someone who could win the tournament, but otherwise his acting is poor. Bobo Yeung plays the bad guy and manages to equal Van Damme's quality in acting. The rest of the acting is terrible, with the lone exception of Donald Gibb as Ray Jackson, another Kumite participant who becomes close friends with Frank during the tournament.The directing is mediocre. It was especially bad during the beginning (the flashback sequence was completely unconvincing), but improved as the Kumite became the focus of the film. There are very few artistic moments, perhaps the alleyway scene going to the tournament being the most effective one.The redeeming element is the fighting. Every tournament battle is unique and offers contrasting martial arts styles. Van Damme is especially impressive in his technique. I also liked the fact that each Kumite participant had a distinct personality.As it stands, I could see Bloodsport being entertaining for most people, but I could only seriously recommend for people who love martial arts. It succeeds in bringing tournament action, but fails at building any drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do you really think this is good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well... When I was a kid "Bloodsport" was one of my favorite movies. Really. This was one of the first martial arts movies that I saw and I loved it. But then I saw "Romeo Must Die"... I am not saying that "Romeo Must Die" is great but it is much better than "Bloodsport". Then I saw more Jet Li movies and I thought that most of them were great. You could read my other comments and you will understand. But I still loved "Bloodsport"... Until I saw it again. Is that the movie that I used to love? The story was dumb, the acting was bad... But who cares about the story and the acting? All we want is fighting, isn't it? But even the fights in this movie were bad. I mean very bad. Most of the time JCVD actually does not look like he is fighting. He just shows us how muscular he is. His moves are slow and his enemies do not move. They just stand there and wait for him to hit them. The fight with Bolo Yeung was pathetic. Really bad choreographed and terribly shot and... Well, I don't think it could be called a fight - each one of them just stands there and waits for his turn to hit. Bad, bad, bad... Why the fights are so bad, why? I am giving the movie more than 2/10 just because it was entertaining to me when I was a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty crappy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport, I believe, was a great success when it came out. I only just saw it, and I can't say I thought it was deserving of much respect. I had to laugh at the terrible acting, and the myriad ridiculous excuses for showing that damned Van Damme split.Basically, the movie is Karate Kid meets Mortal Kombat, but neither the story nor the actors offer any excitement. There is about one good line; when Jackson walks in on Van Damme doing the split thing, he says, "Hey, be careful with that; you might wanna have kids one of these days!"The fights in this movie are nothing special, although of course Van Damme is capable of some impressive kicks. Compared with a half-decent Hong Kong produced kung fu movie, however, Bloodsport is hopelessly inferior and profoundly unimpressive.For the cheesy silliness of it all, I'd give this a 3 rating, but because it is (supposedly!) based on the life of a real martial artist, I'll be a good sport and rate it a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action schmaltz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredibly based upon the true story of undefeated Kumite champion Frank Dux is this action schmaltz from writer Sheldon Lettich and director Newt Arnold. The whole pic is nothing but an excuse for a whole lot of karate chopping, bone crunchin', blood letting brutality that shows us some neatly choreographed fighting, but zero mentality.The hopelessly lame plot is truly an insult, and it makes this pic perhaps even less bearable than a martial arts doco. Van Damme isn't asked to do much, but when he fights he looks petty impressive. Alongside him are some fearsome lookin' dudes, with nasty Bolo Yeung (as Chong Li) showing off with some flexing of his well rounded pecs. Notably, Forest Whitaker appears in the support cast (though to this day he's probably wishing he hadn't).Saturday, February 15, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the music is bad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this movie is from the '80s. Of course the music stinks, but is not a bad flick is really entertaining and have great fighting scenes. The acting is really bad. I don't think you can get any worst as an actor. The story is kind of crappy, besides there is not real proof of Frank Dux ever did all the thing he says he did. The only thing that saved this movie is the fights. They are great. Bolo Yeung is just perfect, he had been in quite a few movies. Even with Bruce Lee once. He is a great fighter if you never seen this flick before watch it for what it is. A fight movie. Ignore the acting and the soundtrack.worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical 80's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a film about a young boy who starts training under a Japanese fighter after him and his friends get caught breaking into his house. At first, he just wants him to help him train his son, but later starts to train him as well.It was basically just about how fighters like to honor their masters by fighting in a private, full contact tournament to show their worth.This film was typical 80's to its fullest extent. Almost every other scene was a montage. The fighting was some of the worst I've ever seen. The acting was no better. The story had so many flaws in it that the director just tried to use the soundtrack to get across the feelings he was trying to portray through terrible acting? Sappy violins for heartfelt moments? Happy 80's rock to show having a good time? Serious 80's rock to show the fighting was meaningful? Sappy Asian music to show being honorable? And so on? You don't meet someone and spend less then 3 days with them and start to care for them like you do about your own family. This film had lots and lots of heartfelt hoopla when the main character didn't know anyone in the movie longer than 2 days. That really didn't make any sense. All in all, this film was terrible. I would pass if I were you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BLOODSPORT (1987)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Ultra-StereoBelgian beefcake Jean-Claude Van Damme made his name in C-grade video fodder like BLOODSPORT before hitting the big time in a series of mid-range Hollywood blockbusters (UNIVERSAL SOLDIER, TIMECOP, etc.). Here, he portrays real-life kickboxing champion Frank Dux, one of the few westerners to triumph in the Kumite ('koo-mih-tay') tournament in Hong Kong, an underground full contact martial arts contest whose final rounds are often fought to the death. However, all 'facts' aside, the movie amounts to little more than an excuse for as many bone-crunching, bloodthirsty fight scenes as the script will allow, building to the inevitable showdown between Van Damme and his only comparable opponent, a hulking Chinese villain (HK movie veteran Bolo Yeung) who has already lain waste to every other competitor in the tournament.While the action scenes are reasonably effective, the dramatic interludes are fatally compromised by bland staging and cheapskate production values (director Newt Arnold appears to have helmed only three films over the course of a lengthy career, during which he's worked mostly as an assistant director on some of Hollywood's biggest movies, including THE TOWERING INFERNO, THE GODFATHER PART II and BLADE RUNNER!). Love him or loathe him, Van Damme is the film's trump card: Captured here at the height of his physical prowess, he strikes an impressive figure during the various combat sequences, where his aptitude for gymnastics and contortion are displayed to full effect. Leah Ayres (THE BURNING) is mere decoration in the thankless role of a journalist who beds Van Damme in an effort to worm her way into the ultra-secret tournament (only to end up falling for him anyway - ho-hum), while Forest Whitaker (a year before BIRD established him as a major talent) and veteran actor Norman Burton play Army cops with a warrant to arrest an AWOL Van Damme on sight. Police officer-turned-actor Phillip Chan Yan-kin (HARD-BOILED) cameos as - you guessed it - a police captain who turns an unlikely blind eye to the Kumite, while Donald Gibb is Van Damme's tournament buddy, a big American blowhard whose arrogance is painfully tempered following a gladiatorial encounter with Yeung. The script was co-written by Sheldon Lettich, one of the more talented figures in the low budget action arena - he wrote and directed LIONHEART (1990) and DOUBLE IMPACT (1991), along with the genuinely impressive ONLY THE STRONG (1993) - but BLOODSPORT has little to offer anyone other than die-hard fans of impoverished HK movie wannabes. Three sequels followed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Listen To Fanboys!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOT THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! NOT EVEN THE BEST MARTIAL ARTS FILM EVER MADE! Unless your a Van Damme fan-boy. Most of the people are giving this film 10 stars. The movie is a complete rip of enter the dragon. (but with the based on a true story nonsense attached to it. Even though there are so many lies to this "True story" inside this movie).I will admit it is enjoyable. I'm 30 years old now and when I was a kid growing up, this movie was awesome. But thats not a good enough reason to give this a 10. The acting is bad (like most 80's martial art movies) and one move (split-kick) Van-Damme is just not that good of a martial artist regardless of what his fan-boys thinks. And sadly enough, this was his best display of it! In reality, we all know Bolo would've destroyed him like he does the rest of his opponents in the movie. But when he gets to Jean Claude, all of a sudden, he can't fight as good or as fast as he did before, LOL. Could this be because he had to slow up significantly so Van Damme could look better? In fact Jean Claude is so slow in this movie that they do double takes and sometimes triple and quadruple takes to make him seem faster. Same with "Kickboxer". So lets try to keep IMDb honest as much as we can, but with this "Fanboy" generation--I doubt any rate system is honest. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly enjoyable martial arts flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport starts in the US where marine Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) goes AWOL &amp; visits his old friend Tanaka (Roy Chiao) who he convinces to teach him some fancy martial arts technique including the 'Death Touch' move. Now Frank is ready, he jets off to Hong Kong where he intends to compete in the Kumite, a traditional full contact no holds barred illegal fighting tournament organised by local crime lords (not sure why though). There he meets up up burly American Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) &amp; together they enter the tournament, it's a brutal tournament where people get seriously hurt, it's a tournament for champions &amp; winners, it's a tournament that Frank thinks he can win. If he doesn't win the thing he will almost certainly die in the arena trying...Directed by Newt Arnold &amp; produced by the infamous Yoram Globus &amp; Menahem Golan under their Cannon company Bloodsport isn't anywhere near as bad as I was expecting, it ain't no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it ticks enough boxes to be enjoyable if ultimately forgettable. Based on true events Bloodpsort was JCVD's fifth film &amp; his first starring role, to be honest this ain't too bad at all. The script by Christopher Cosby, Mel Friedman &amp; Sheldon Lettich moves along at a reasonable pace &amp; it gives the makers a fair number of chances to stage various martial arts fights which is all most viewers will be interested in I would have thought. The character's are alright if a little basic, they are fairly likable &amp; the dialogue isn't too bad either. It tells an OK story with the minimum of fuss with some heroes &amp; some villains &amp; it passes 90 odd minutes harmlessly enough if all your looking for is a bit of martial arts. However it's not perfect with several underdeveloped sub plots, for instance why do the US army want Frank Dux back so badly? They send these two guy's after him who try to take him back but the script never gives any reason for it! I mean Frank is just a soldier, he's not even top level brass or anything, just a lowly soldier according to this so why is he so vital to the army &amp; in what capacity did the army spend lots of time &amp; money on him as suggested?Director Arnold does alright, Bloodsport isn't going to win any awards for grace or style but it looks neat and tidy enough. It has a late 80's feel to it with JCVD sporting a daft looking haircut &amp; a few silly skin tight outfits that look like they belong in an aerobics class. The fights are surprisingly well choreographed &amp; effective, they are clear &amp; concise &amp; you can easily keep track of who is who &amp; whats going on which is nice in view of the modern blink &amp; you will miss it editing &amp; quick cuts style of cutting action films. Apparently even after it was finished Bloodsport was almost never released &amp; JCVD himself stepped in to reedit it so that it could be, I would have hate to have seen the original rough cut. Most 80's action films have at least one unintentionally funny moment, here in Bloodsport there's a scene early on as Tanaka is training JCVD &amp; makes him serve him &amp; his wife tea blindfolded!With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 Bloodsport is competent, it's reasonably well made with decent if unspectacular production values. Shot on location in Hong Kong which gives it a nice authentic look. Apparently paid $70,000 for his role JCVD does alright here but the boy never was, isn't &amp; never will be a good actor. Amazingly respected Hollywood actor Forest Whitaker has a small role while Hollywood typecast Chinese martial arts film bad guy Bolo Yeung plays the bad guy.Bloodsport isn't a masterpiece, it isn't art &amp; it won't change your life but it is a decent film with some good martial arts fights which is really all anyone came to see. Does what it says on the tin, no more no less. Successful enough to spawn three sequels Bloodsport 2 (1996), Bloodsport III (1997) &amp; Bloodsport: The Dark Kumite (1999) none of which feature JCVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible.....even the martial arts is bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't find a movie that could better depict the worst movie making in the world. Even an Ed Wood movie is better at its worst then Bloodsports. I actually have to use ten lines to describe how bad this movie is. The fact that it is so outrageously unrealistic and the martial arts so patheically....well pathetic, is only cracking the surface of how bad this movie is. Said to be a man's movie.....only a man who can find nothing but an unworthy, terrible action movie would watch this instead. While respect must be given to Jean in other movies I must try hard and harder to forgive him for such a weak attempt in trying to bring martial arts to the big screen. Thank goodness he has improved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Bad as You'd Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloodsport is a typically cheesy 80s martial arts action film that might, in time, become more popular than it deserves because its cheesiness will remind people of a certain age of how poor their good taste was in their youth. Truth is, this kind of film only appeals to people of a violent disposition - or who wished they had the nerve to possess one.The fact is, this film is pretty bad on all counts barring some infrequent location shooting on the streets of Hong Kong and some well-staged pre-CGI fight sequences. While the fight scenes do make up a large amount of the running time, they still can't save this film. There's no storyline to speak of: Frank Dux (a young Jean-Claude van Damme who is worryingly called upon to wear lip gloss in a number of scenes) goes AWOL from the army so that he can take part in an illegal kumite full-body combat tournament to honour his childhood mentor and spends much of his time dodging a couple of military cops (one of whom is a young Forest Whitaker) while wooing an American journalist looking to cover the tournament.JCVD's performance is as bad as you'd expect it to be: he might be able to use the muscles below his neck to good effect, but when it comes to using the ones above to register any kind of emotion (other than that primal post-impact scream) he's a dead loss. He has a buddy here, a big annoying guy who overacts as badly as JCVD underacts. I think he was supposed to be some kind of comic relief but he proved so immensely irritating that I was quite pleased when he came up against the arch-villain (a near-silent oriental with a strangely malformed chest) with predictable consequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Cheese, avoid like the plague, swine flu, and ugly fat chicks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to watch poorly choreographed fight scenes, terrible acting, with even worse dialogue, and some of the dumbest slow motion scenes showing Van Damme looking like he has a mental handicap, rather than suffering from temporary blindness, than this film is for you.Perhaps I was missing something when I made the mistake of killing some time recently and watching it when it was on TV, but unless you have ADD or a very low IQ, i'd steer away from this movie, unless you are going to watch it with the view to laughing your ass off at just how bad it is.For the record, i'm not some JCVD hater, if ya take most of his films for what they are, they are OK, Universal Soldier and TimeCop were entertaining enough, and I don't deny they guy makes kickin people in the face look awesome! But this was just pure cheese as stated in my summary.If you want some old school martial arts movies, stick to Bruce Lee ones, or if you must Chuck Norris, as they just do a much better job of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you give a 10 to a movie like this one, while crouching tiger hidden dragon for example has MUCH MUCH MUCH better fight scenes and much better acting etc. etc.This is one of the worst fighting movies ever made. The fighting scenes are so slow and hacky-tacky. And unbelievable unrealistic. And then they claim this story actually happened haha.Come on guys, go see some real fighting movies. Like Bruce Lee movies. Not very good acting either but at least the fighting scenes rule.This movie is beyond crap. I can't even believe there is a second movie. And again, stop giving movies like this 10 stars, if you like it give it a 6. It's not a 10 star movie, keep IMDb honest!</fullReview>
