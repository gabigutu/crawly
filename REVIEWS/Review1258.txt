		<shortDescription>Screw Rotten Tomatoes this movie is as fantastic as it could get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 16 years, Bryan Singer delivers the X Men movie we've all been waiting for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalyptically bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he "persuades" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring cliché dialogues like "It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you."Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole "destroy the world" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think the critics have been way too harsh in this case - It's actually rather good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.Firstly I found it to have a perfectly serviceable story, with Apocalypse and his followers recruiting the very vulnerable and angry Magneto as part of his plan to destroy civilisation and rebuild it in his image. Fassbender turns in another solid performance and you really feel his pain and confusion for the Erik/Magneto character. I also thought all the supporting cast were absolutely fine in their roles, and to me Evan Peters as Quicksilver really stole the scenes he was in and makes a fine addition to the cast. The same also goes to Tye Sheridan as Scott/Cyclops, whose back story is filled in better and with more depth than it was in the Wolverine origins film.I see the critics have been moaning about having too many characters in the film, yet I actually think it was handled better than it was in the Captain America: Civil War film. In Apocalypse the large cast do actually have something to do and contribute to the story, whereas the Captain America film felt like some were shoe horned in, which I felt made that film feel bloated and repetitive whereas this one at least get the storyline moving. I felt that Civil War felt way too long because of all the story padding yet Apocalypse, whilst also a long film, kept my interest to the end (and yes there is a post credits scene that I suspect is setting up Wolverine 3). I should also add that Apocalypse, despite it's bleak story, does have some moments of humour and wit that went down well with the audience.I also felt the surprise appearance of Wolverine fitted in nicely with the back story that we already know, particularly the one told in X Men 2 and the Origins film, nicely closing that particular characters story arc and fitting in perfectly with the circumstances surrounding his appearance in the very first X-Men film of 16 years ago. If this is to be Wolverines final appearance with the X-men then they have given him a lovely send off.I did find some minor flaws with the film though, particularly with the visual appearance of some of the characters and how their ages don't compute when the first X-men film of 2000 is taken into account. However, asides from that I thoroughly enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse and thought it was a solid &amp; worthy addition to the other X-Men films. The films had spectacle, action, laughs and carried on with the journeys of the characters we have got to know and love over the past sixteen years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie out of the trilogy!!!!!!BORING!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing. Predictable trash. The first hour was the concept of "Hi" "Hello" and we are bringing the band back together.Jean Grey(Stark) was miscast. Why was she in this movie? The acting was poor. And of course Ms. Jennifer Lawrence giving me a Hunger games weak speech at the end. Jennifer Lawrence is not even that talented of an actress but Hollywood is trying so hard with her. She hardly does anything in this movie and just says, "fight" over and over. Raven didn't even do anything."Magneto, you're not bad, you're good" from Prof. X. I'm thinking, "Yes, I have the point". I wish Magneto woulda zapped a coin threw my head at this point. The final scene had him floating for a half hour wondering if he should fight. WTF He did nothing. Or and the fantastic four combine their powers to defeat this stargate joke. I do not recommend. Anyone that said they liked it doesn't know anything about quality. I did like the other two xmen before this. Mostly, "Days of future Past". This is as disappointing as "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull". If you do decide to see this movie, I already feel sorry for you. Just give me your 10$ and I just saved almost 3 hours of your life. It was bad...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Power Rangers movie, not an X-Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen I saw all X-Men movies, i am fan of X-men, BUT this one was really awful. I can't even know how to describe this crap. Can't believe this movie was 2.5 hours film that was actually got into production. Its an insult of xmen movies. Its a Power Rangers movie not X-Men.First of all, Script is just awful. "Oh good to see you" - "long time, where you'v been" - and lets hug for 15 minutes and say how good to see each and one of them, like you are watching some kind of TV series like Friends or somethin'.Second: If you want to go and watch x-men crazy fight scene movie, you will end up with super power guys use there super power to mimic the fight at the end of the movie. All fights are 20 minutes + - of almost 3 hour film. Magneto do nothing in this movie, even in final fight scene, he is up in the Air and thats really it. Everything looks cheap plastic, there is a moment that they are on hill and guess what, its like someone make a polish on this hill, its looks so cheap you can't believe it. You fill the Studio...Third: all this movie was like made up for a sake of movie. You wont see a Mystique for a long in this movie, She decide tolook a like a girl (Jennifer Lawrence)... Or The budget for CGI was not enough.Fourth: Logan / Wolverine - Hey ))) he is there for 1 minute. yep that what you will got. 1 awful minute that he is running. He is in this film just for saying that he was there. Nothing added to the film from his appearance. Fifth: i can understand that they want a new crew and remake all this thing, but guys, from good x-men movie, it becomes some superhero mess.It was just unnecessary movie. They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen Storyline is just for kids Channel. Anyway, i just felt so disappointed they just ruined it. thats it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>couple tiny spoilers*****Apocalypse....I give it a C and I'm being nice, what a disappointment but it was expected, can't believe what singer has delivered, I would rather see Justin Lin make an xmen movie! Singer needs to go! I could not let go my disgust with apocalypse costume design. I just couldn't. I see why they went with the look they have, because to singer he wanted to show Oscar Isaac face, to show the man behind the make up sort to speak. But it's terrible! He's apocalypse I don't need to see the damn actor playing him!! First whole hour is terrible, only thing I enjoyed watching was magneto's story line, quick silver steals the show once again and wolverine does as well. Disgusting what singer has done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "nothing" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another X-Men movie.. and again, not much of anything happens. There is a plot, yes, but it is poorly written and lacks substance/soul/meaning. The attitude of "I don't care" is what I came out with after seeing this movie. Instead of having a soul, it feels like a bunch of things put together in order to make money. You see characters, but aside from Quicksilver, which felt shoved in, no one really has an attempt at an arc.--- SPOILERS!!An hour into the movie, it SEEMS like something will happen. Two hours into the movie, they end the threat of Apocalypse. The end. Apocalypse wasted. I have several other issues with this movie, 1) Nightcrawler's teleportation is stopped by electricity? 2) Apocalypse access the internet by touching a TV. Yes yes, it is not the internet, but it is such a concept. Anyway, Apocalypse learns all the languages this way and sees the atrocities of humanity. What kind of powers did he have? He came from the beginning of mankind, and then jumps to the "present" where he magically has a mutant power that lets him access "technology". Anyway, awful! Reading minds would have been better. 3) The Angel transformation scene is simply stupid.. rock music, alcohol, a cool pose.. Apocalypse's way of "convincing" others into joining him is as bad. He says "come with me" and that's it. What does he want? To kill all! Sure, I'll join. 4) Apocalypsis takes Magneto to his conncentration camp (which is intact after who knows how many years) and somehow knows about Magneto's past for some reason. Knows his name, knows how he feels. 5) X-Men insults the Star Wars trilogy, calling the third (Return of the Jedi) as the worst one. Why? 6) Oh yes, Magneto lost everything, again. For some reason, he hasn't learned his lesson, and continues to hang out with women and have children. Then they get killed and he blames everyone! 7) Stan Lee's cameo is.. nothing. Him looking at the sky as a civilian. 8) Somehow, aside from being somewhat telepathic, or so I understood, Apocalypsis can also teleport for some reason. But then he states he needs Xavier's powers! So, which is it? Do you have all powers or don't? If you can do most of what it is shown you can do, why do you need 4 horsemen, or other mutants? 9) Quicksilver's scene, while awesome, is super coincidental. No reason why he should have saved everyone from an exploding mansion. He isn't in super speed 100% of the time! Nor he knows the place is exploding! Yet he walks right to the center of the mansion and sees and rescues everyone. Ugh. 10) So, a "psychic event" destroyed all the world's nukes, and Colonel Stryker tracked the source to Xavier's mansion.... suuuuure. 11) Wolverine shows up and kills people, retconing his origin. He then runs in the snow. Fine. There is no real "Berserker Rage". Anyway, sucks and unnecessary. 12) Psylocke uses a whip to fight, instead of her psyonich blades. 13) Magneto goes all-out-destructive with little reason.. but wait, he becomes good with even less. 14) Mystique turns into Psylocke and for some reason she has a blade. It was a "twist", if you can call it that. This scene, where she attempted to kill Apocalypse is the closes the writer could come close to a surprise situation. 15) Apocalypse turns big, yes, in a mind sequence. Looks bad by the way. Apocalypse does little to no shifting actions. He remains as seen in the pictures. 16) Quicksilver DOESN'T tell Magneto he is his father. The reason? There isn't one.They said Lawrence didn't do much in the movie, that it was the kids that did.. but ultimately, nobody really does anything. The fights are not even 2% of the movie, it's mostly talk (some bad lines, nothing mind bending). Mutants underused, which is the biggest let down. The movie is a lot of nothing! Oh, and the X-men have Sentinels now, for some reason.. Lots of stuff, lots of nothing. Not even a good waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This year's FANT4STIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Bryan Singer is in love wit Stryker of course we get to see the Weapon X program (again!) and of course, Wolverine because why not.As for the characters: Magneto barely does anything in the whole movie, Apocalypse is a one note villain, Xavier phoned it in and Jennifer Lawrence was NOT Mystique at all, as expected she played Raven Everdeen.Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet. SPOILER ALERT! And the way they defeat Apocalypse is by combining all their powers, just like in FANTASTIC FOUR (2005) or even FANT4STIC (2015).This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written, the worst movie of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is terrific, but the second half brings it down.Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming apart, making it hard to care about the situation. Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just brings the film down from the really good first half.X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.Check out my Youtube channel where I review movies as well!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOGWUFunDhIwKVcL7eNMWiQ</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell is wrong with all the bad reviewers? This movie is so great, sure it has a few things that they could've done differently but name a movie that's completely perfect? It's an over all awesome movie. So many people are talking trash about Apocalypse, how bad the representation in respect the comics was...are you freaking kidding me? This is for me by far the best villain of any superhero movie. Yes, he's not exactly like in the comics, but c'mon people, Oscar Isaac does such an AMAZING job interpreting his character. I really don't understand why people are so upset. I mean yeah, he is too much of a villain to have died, but hey, we're talking about a Hollywood budget movie, it's not like in the comics where they can make dozens of editions with alternate endings or reanimate characters. People who go see a movie need to understand that making a movie like this is extremely expensive and it's just impossible to explain every single detail about all the characters in just 2 hours. They do the best they can and while yes, sometimes movies are total trash, this X-men movie was for me, the BEST of all. And Apocalypse is by FAR the best interpretation of any villain out all the superhero movies. Thank you Oscar Isaac for such amazing role. Mad acting skillz right there.Peace out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X:Men Apocalypse---THE MADE FOR TV MOVIE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.The new cast can't seem to hold up a movie on their own, McAvoy is a huge miscast 3 movies later, Fassbender struggles to hold up the movie. It seems like their veteran counterparts did most of the work these past couple of films.Apocalypse is terrible, I had reservations about him before, but you can tell they didn't know where to go with him or how to handle him so they kinda just piggybacked off of stargate. There's this strange pedo-like relationship he has with his younger horsemen. The wolverine cameo was so forced and out of place you'd think this were a superhero spoof movie.There's a random scene where the new gang of mutants goes to the movies and jean literally says "At least we can agree on one thing: the third movie is always the worst" and it cuts back to the movie. The scene literally has nothing to do with the rest of the story its just spliced in there for some reason.Which begs me to question whether the cast knew how terrible it was and just did not care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, here's the deal: some super-powered freak wants to destroy the world (what else?), some kids with a lot of adolescent issues and identity crisis confront him (oh, they also have super-powers, but that is, obviously, not as important as the aforementioned issues), they win, the end.The story was most likely scrapped within a 15 seconds or so. I honestly don't believe that anyone would take longer to come up with such kindergarten plot. I rate it 1. I'd rate it minus three (-3) if it was possible since that would be much more appropriate.Characters: pc crew lead by non-attractive feminazi-pleasing females. These are the heroes. The villains are, as always, lead by a white male. The good guys (or should I say girls?) apparently suffer from some horrendous late puberty and act accordingly for most of the time. Bad guy(s) is stereo-typically needlessly pompous and all his god-like powers aren't worth squat when he's faced with a girl since modern pc dictates that the girl just cannot get her ass kicked by a male in any of the mainstream media. So there you have it: tough break, Apocalypse.Casting &amp; acting: God awful and god forbid. This hastily assembled group of pc adequate kids aided by untalented actress who lands her role in this one solely due to the popularity of a certain TV show can't lift a finger to the original cast. James McAvoy &lt; Patrick Stewart; Alexandra Shitt (no mistake) &lt; Halle Barry; Jennifer Lawrence &lt; Rebecca Romijn; Ridiculous random guy (Cyclops) &lt;&lt;&lt; James Marsden; as for the rest of the cast, did I already mention that it mostly consists of non- attractive feminazi-pleasing females? Storm, Jean, Psylocke... Average looking at best with a talents to match. Truly good actors such as Fassbender and Isaac are wasted on this one.Anyway, to cut the long story short (since I've already given this cinematic disgrace a lot more attention than it deserves), do yourself a favor and avoid this trash. Despite the data that ticket sales are sky-high (a questionable data, I might add), Hollywood has reached an all time low regarding the quality of its production and recent superhero flicks (this one is a prime example) lead the way into the abyss.</fullReview>

Clearly he still hasn't learnt his lesson, This movie was crap, I JUST SPENT ?25 at the cinema and it was a waste man!! We have now had six x-men movies out and still no bloody good story line, still no full x-men team, (which should be, Professor x, Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, Rouge, Gambit, Beast, and sweet little Jubilee) there's not enough action through out the movie, and this one really gets on my tits, NO DAM COSTUMES! I don't get it, all the other characters in the marvel movies has there original costumes! but in x-men there are dressed in black and look like bikers.If someone is going to make a good x-men movie they should start by watching the 1990s x-men cartoons and use that as a base to build on. I'm sorry to say but I will NOT going back to the cinema to watch another x-men movie again an till someone can prove to me they know what they are doing because at the moment this is a disgrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Mutant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first mutant En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac), who was worshiped as a god In Egypt, awakes in the present days, he learns how the world has been transformed in his absence. He decides to bring the Apocalypse to the word and recruits four powerful mutants to assist him in the destruction of the weak. Now the only change to save the world depends on Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and a team of young mutants. "X-Men: Apocalypse" is another enjoyable adventure presenting the first and most powerful mutant of the world. The fight between the good and the evil is engaging and entertaining, supported by top-notch special effects that gives the sensation of a comic book on the screen. The best segment is the Magneto story in Poland and the fate of his beloved family. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "X-Men: Apocalipse" ("X-Men: Apocalypse")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grounded in its storytelling while gorgeous in its pandemonium, Apocalypse is yet another winner from Bryan Singer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I prefer First Class and Days of Future Past, Apocalypse truly surprised me. It has the grandest scale of any X-Men movie, and possibly of any superhero movie period. It revolves around the first mutant born tens of thousands of years ago, En Sabah Nur, hailed as an all-powerful god in Egypt before a mutiny in the ranks caused his pyramid to collapse, burying him in the process. Fast forward to the '80s and we see Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) investigating a cult following of this mysterious mutant. Unbeknownst to her, only the smallest amount of sunlight was needed to awaken En Sabah Nur who subsequently causes an earthquake that is felt across the globe. The beginning of this movie is slow, and rightfully so. It shows the origin of Apocalypse, at least how he came to be trapped for all these millennia, and proceeds to show the individual X-Men characters in their respective settings. Magneto has a wife and child, Mystique is rescuing captured mutants like Nightcrawler and Angel, and Professor Xavier is teaching classes in his school. Soon enough, Scott Summers enrolls in the academy and meets Jean Grey. This sounds like a lot to cram into a movie, and it is, but this background was necessary as a foundation for the story to build upon, and boy does it ever.Apocalypse is one of those villains that has only one goal: world domination. Has it been done a thousand times before? Absolutely. Has it been executed as well as this? Probably not. If there was ever a practical motive for a villain to want to push the reset button on Earth, this is it. The guy's name is freaking Apocalypse and was hailed as a god in his time, and having seen how corrupt the world has become, he believes it's time for some new leadership. He has a huge ego and even huger powers to boot. He recruits some mutants, including Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and eventually Magneto, to help fulfill his global extinction plan, and it's exactly as destructive as it sounds. This might be the most catastrophic and destruction-filled action I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Cities crumble into dust, the Earth itself collapses from the inside, every nuclear warhead launches simultaneously across the world. It's pure pandemonium.The acting is superb across the board. There's no need praising McAvoy or Fassbender as they've proved themselves many times over. The newcomers are the real shockers here, especially Scott Summers played by Tye Sheridan and Jean Grey played by Sophie Turner. Both are brilliant in their roles and have great chemistry in the scenes they share. Oscar Isaac is excellent as Apocalypse. The material he's given is fairly vanilla but he pulls it off with both charisma and restraint, acting exactly how you'd expect a ten thousand year old god to act in the modern age. And the guy is just menacing to look at. He has a magnetic, commanding presence, and suitably so, being the most powerful villain ever put to screen. Evan Peters kills it as Quicksilver yet again and is given more screen time, plus another show-stealing scene for the fans of his DoFP debut. It's a large cast but it never feels unbalanced. The characters that need to shine do indeed shine, and even the background characters have their rightful place in the movie. It wasn't cluttered like it could have been. Rather, some of the best scenes in the movie are quiet character building moments.This was officially the last straw for me in regards to the credibility of critic scores. Just because it's not as good as Civil War doesn't make it a bad movie, and their criticisms of "a cliché villain" and "underwritten characters" are asinine and nitpicky. We needed a villain like this. Galactus was the closest we got to an apocalyptic villain but he was raped, mutilated, and morphed into a fart cloud in The Silver Surfer. It's about damn time we get a guy literally called Apocalypse to bring the world down to its knees. The characters are "underwritten" only in the sense that they don't spend twenty minutes going through each of their backstories and that's because they didn't have to. The movie captures their unique personalities and quirks within five minutes of them being on screen.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't a perfect movie but it's the epitome of a great summer blockbuster. The visuals are stunning, the chaos is immense, the humor is well placed, the pacing is spot on, the music is great (Metallica and Beethoven anyone?), and the entire film builds up to an explosive climax that delivers everything you'd want in an X-Men movie of this magnitude. If you're a fan of superhero movies, do yourself a favor and take the critic scores with a grain of sand. This is a must-watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst most boring comics movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only vote so low as 1, but that is more than this movie deserves. This horrible movie makes you go to extreme efforts to try and care about the characters, and that is a merit (in the bad way), to make so well-known and beloved characters unrelatable and boring. The movie is awful, it has horrible pacing, and the OST must have been done by some deaf person. It has many inconsistencies story-wise, but its worse sin is to be SO BORING. The timing is all messed up, and the story is so badly told that you end up not caring for the characters, to the point that the action scenes look like a bunch of nobodies hitting another bunch of nobodies with many inconsistent and unexplained deus-ex-machinas going on here and there. Hell, Apocalypse is supposed to be a source of terror, but he doesn't inspire any terror on the viewer, and in the end he is beaten to nothingness with almost no effort. This is as disappointing as it can get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but inconsistent sequel in the X-Men series...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.It is not about being a purist, but about honoring the original. In an age where superheros are invading our cinemas, one could do worse if one watches a film about hope and freedom, about homophobia, racism, bigotry, immigration and all sort of other social issues. And somehow none of the X-men films so far have successfully brought these themes to the screen.This film suffers from having to focus on thousands of characters and locations. Some characters like Mystique and Magneto are given substantial screen time, while others such as Psylocke are given only a few scenes. The film also tries to fit into the overall X-Men continuity, while trying to stand up on its own.A great film for a pop-corn viewing with your friends, but a sub-par X-Men film in general... It is sad that the most substantial superheroes of our age, that really have something to say about the world we live in, are treated as badly as this...Mutant and proud? Unfortunately there is nothing to be proud of expect the money the film is about to make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent entry but not without it's faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So after loving DOFP, circumstances (eg: Holiday)caused me to have to wait several weeks after the release date to watch this movie and before showtime I had heard mixed reviews, but with most of them leaning towards a poor one I went in without any expectations so that I may avoid any potential disappointments. Now firstly let me say I wasn't disappointed, I found this film to be a decent enough entry in to the Xmen universe, certainly better than some other notable entries (Origns - I'm talking to you...). There was lots in this film that I liked, mostly as it seemed more loyal to the cartoon I watched back in my youth that I loved so much. There were plenty of characters involved in the film, comic book style action sequences and the always fun quicksilver scene, such a welcome addition to the xmen movies, and something that maybe points out one thing Marvel have done wrong with a character in their films... The Weapon X "cameo" - I enjoyed this but think it would have been so much better had they not spoilt this in the trailer, it fitted well with the story and you knew you were going to Alkali lake so it would've been nice to have had the anticipation of whether you would see Wolverine, but it was done well done and I liked that this was all we saw of him. Now I like the Wolverine character but personally felt that the original trilogy suffered due to an overdose of Wolverine, yes he was the main character of the first films but none of the other characters got developed which I felt made the films suffer, this is why I liked that Cyclops had a much more prominent role in this film and enjoyed that it seemed to focus more on him and Jean Grey and his rise to becoming a leader of the X-men.Now this wasn't the perfect film and there were bad points that I found to it. The pacing of the film was a little strange at times, it was a shame that Havok's death seemed to be almost glossed over "He was closest to the explosion" "Oh, I thought I got everyone" ..... "Oh well, never mind...!" Bit of a shame as we never got to see the "Bad ass" he was made out to be in the previous outings. Speaking of deaths I did have a sneaky feeling there may be another one in the film and almost expected Mystique to die in the final battle, especially with her being built up as a hero all the way through the film, but then wondered if Quicksilver might perish when taking on Apocalypse on by himself - in another fantastic sequence, but this was not the case.Whilst it was good to see a big cast, The horsemen seemed to just be "there" and with the exception of Storm (slightly) were not fleshed out - Angel is seemingly built up as some seasoned warrior and is introduced with a cage fight scene having just beaten the blob and having gone 10 fights undefeated (Which we don't see any of) before he meets nightcrawler where he promptly gets his "ass handed to him". Even in the rematch at the end of the film he still struggles to put up any kind of fight. Psylocke was just sat in a room with Caliban evidently as his bodyguard, and for no real reason just decides to join Apocalypse, though this may be to save Calibans life?? But it would've been nice to have spent a little more time giving them some character - especially in a 2 &amp; 1/2 film.My biggest problem though which I had ever since he was announced was Oscar Issac as Apocalypse. Whilst I have no problem with him as an actor I just never saw him as being that character and wasn't convinced of him at any point through the film. Apocalypse is a hugely overpowered mutant who has a deep booming voice and should be menacing and instil fear in to those he meets, yet Issacs is tiny and had too much of a softly spoken voice in the film and I just found he didn't fit the part at all., he just looked like one of the gang when stood with his horsemen. Now whilst I'm not saying he should've had the part instead, I think someone like the Rock, with his build, would've been more visually suited to the character, but that's just my opinion.Whilst this does almost wrap the whole Xmen story up I do hope there is another one after this, they have after all teased the Phoenix saga again so can see this being the next big thing, though I think the next film will be too soon for this story to resolve as it will need fleshing out more first, but the end credit scene leaves a couple of potential movies, with a potential creation of X-23, or hopefully Mr Sinister as the next big bad. But overall it's a good enough entry and I don't think it's as bad as some people have said, it's certainly not worthy of the 1's and 2's out of 10 that some people have given it??? But again it's the nods to the comics and cartoons which I liked about the films, with the scene at the end with the team in their cartoon costumes in the training room a brilliant way to end the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but still worth your time. Don't listen to the critical reviews!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to be honest. This was the comic book movie I was least looking forward to this year but I went to see it anyway because the trailers made it look decent. I didn't go in expecting much but I was surprised when I really enjoyed this movie. It is no where near as good as First Class and Days of Future Past but it is still worth your time. Apocalypse was a great villain and Oscar Isaacs played him brilliantly. I also didn't mind the costume that much (It could have been better though). Most of the cast was really good in the film (My favourite being Evan Peters as Quicksilver). However unfortunately Jennifer Lawrence was not at her best in this film. She just didn't have the enthusiasm and looked bored for most of the film. I also didn't really like the actress that played Jean Grey. I'm not sure what her name is but to me she was just kind of wooden and boring to watch. I do wish that they could have developed the horseman though (Not counting Magneto) because it seemed like they didn't have much reason to suddenly be bad (Especially Psylocke). The things this film sets up also gets you quite exited for future instalments. I definitely think it is a good thing that they seem to be re-doing The Dark Phoenix Saga and possibly introducing one of my favourite X-Men villains: Mr Sinister. Overall this film is enjoyable and any comic book fan will most likely enjoy it because it is still better than Batman Vs Superman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype, Apocalypse rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film after reading lots of spoiler free negative reviews, which is probably not a good idea. However, by the end of the first 30 minutes, I was already questioning the sanity of those reviewers.First up, the story is not only a good one, it's a great one, and more importantly, it makes sense.The cast is at the top of their game here, and it shows. There's a certain scene where one of the antagonists of the series loses some loved ones, and you can almost feel their pain. This is how you make a great movie, story first, then have a cast that can deliver in bringing that story to life.The special effects are first rate, and there are a lot of them, even for a movie that features superheroes doing their stuff. But there aren't many times (if any) where you think any of those scenes could have been done without a building or bridge being destroyed. Every special effect featured in Apocalypse was required to bring that part of the story to life.The movie's run time is just under 2 and a half hours, and every one of those minutes is put to good use and never wasted. When you walk out of a theatre thinking you were only in there for 90 minutes, you know that you were entertained from start to finish. Even the cameo by Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was great.If you're an X-men fan, well, a fan of the X-men movies anyway, you'll enjoy this film for sure. I'd rate it at least as good as X2, and on par with Days of future past, and a little better than The Wolverine. How this movie could be rated as anything other than excellent, is bewildering. Go see it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly One of the Better X-Men Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never had a big appreciation for the X-Men films, at least not until recently. The first time I saw them was during the initial 'Avengers' craze. I thought to myself, "These movies are mediocre and don't have anything to do with Iron Man or Cap, so why bother?" Only recently have I re-watched them and changed my opinion. Slightly. I now find I enjoy the original 'X-Men' film, but most of the sequels are mediocre to bad. Even the critically acclaimed 'Days of Future Past' and 'X2: X-Men United' were only 6/10 for me. That being said, it was easy to not expect much from this film. It looked crowded, lacking of Hugh Jackman, and had recast all the characters for a young, rebooted X-Men film. I am happy to say that the movie functions very well for the large amount of things going on in it. It actually does feel apocalyptic (thank God), as this is something 'Age of Ultron' and other end-of-the-world superhero movies have always missed the mark on. Oscar Isaac himself is good as usual, but also as usual, he doesn't have a whole lot to do. Actually, Apocalypse has nothing to do with why this movie is good. We've finally got some good character arcs in this film, the kind we haven't seen since the original trilogy. 'First Class' especially, lacked what I really wanted: a satisfying prequel showing what these characters were like before we knew them. Magneto, Charles, Cyclops, and Jean are especially well-explored (I won't even mention all the callbacks to the first movies; Phoenix, anyone?). The only unfortunate thing about this is that it is an alternate universe prequel thanks to the events of the last film, and it's likely we'll never see the prequel events of the first reality we were introduced to. 'Wolverine 3' is obviously going to take place in this alternate universe, and in fact I'm fairly certain we'll never see anything beyond the happy ending of 'Future Past' in terms of the original characters. Oh, well. More movies, more money, am I right? Anyway, another complaint of mine would be to admit that aside from the brilliant Quicksilver sequence at the X-Mansion, the animation was a little grainier than I would have preferred, though this is minor. Given it's 1983, we've got some great music making appearance, not to mention a quick scene in which the kids come out of the theater having just watched 'Return of the Jedi'. We get the standard joke about how the third in the Star Wars saga is the worst of the trilogy (if this were Disney, I'd also mention how much they love sticking Star Wars in our face now that they own it- remember 'Civil War'). Other than this, I was overall content with the fact that this is my first X-Men movie in theaters. It gets a 7/10, which is what the original got from me as well (I find this is usually the standard I hold to superhero movies). So, though I admittedly have some doubts about the future of this franchise, it's really not a new feeling for me and I do give this installment my approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Dwight Shrute would say: Good, not Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*MILD SPOILER ALERT FOR X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST* X-Men: Apocalypse is directed by X-men veteran Bryan Singer, and co-written by Simon Kinberg (as well as Singer himself) and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Oscar Isaac, and Hugh Jackman for 4 minutes (no, seriously). The film takes place in an alternate timeline created after the events of Days of Future Past, with the ripples of Wolverine burning the Gray's Sports Almanac and changing the course of history. This causes major retcons to other films in the continuity (looking at you Wolverine: Origins) as the 1980's setting is the picturesque backdrop for the conflict between the Mutants and humans. Confusion to the timeline aside, this film on paper is a slightly superior film to Days of Future Past, but in execution (while a good film) is lacking. The characters were engaging, but the trailers much like Avengers: Age of Ultron pitched a different film. While not as disappointing as Ultron was, it does have similar pitfalls and does falter. If you are a fan of the previous X-men films (except 3 and Wolverine: Origins. Those movies don't exist and they're also horrible) and as long as you monitor your expectations, you will enjoy this film. During the time of civil expansion in Egypt, En-Sabah-Nur (Apocalypse, also I have no idea how I know to spell that off by heart) is the first Mutant of his kind. He has built an empire and is seen as a god, but he is not immortal. He seeks out means to treat his lifespan, but during that time, there is a coup to overthrow and kill the false god, and in the process he is imprisoned in a collapsed pyramid forced into a several millennia long slumber (cue the title sequence) waiting to regain his strength and retake what is his. Since this is an alternate timeline, and the later X-men films take place in the not too distant future, let's assume that Apocalypse didn't recover. So, because of "time travel" the ripple created a timeline where Apocalypse will roam free (I'm really getting tired of typing the word "Time"). After the events of Days of Future Past, Magneto has shed his old identity, started a new life, Charles Xavier has reopened the X-mansion, and Mystique is on a crusade to liberate mutants all at the same time Apocalypse indoctrinates mutants as he calls them "The Four Horsemen" in efforts of bringing about god-like proportions of destruction (MASS HYSTERIA). The film is shot extremely well, with good cinematography, good use of costume design, soundtrack, score, make-up, time-period and everything seems well realized. The film is written to an acceptable degree, with a fantastic arch for Magneto, an interesting arch for Charles and Mystique, and a good arch for Jean Grey. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner really shine as a young Cyclops and Jean Grey, giving a believable relationship. All of the newcomers do give stellar performances (although one is stoic in particular) Storm, Angel, Nightcrawler and a serviceable portrayal of Psylocke. Oscar Isaac does an acceptable job as Apocalypse, but he wasn't as developed or menacing as I would have hoped, and the same can be said for the four horsemen (Psylocke, Storm, Angel, and excluding one character since their arch is good) especially with the context and history of the characters, (I know that you can't cram that much lore into 2 hours *cough* Batman V. Superman) there could have been some exploration of the characters and their relationship with Apocalypse. For example, Storm in the comics was homeless, a gutterpunk and saw that her abilities made her a goddess. The relationship that she could have had with Apocalypse, a fountain of seemingly unlimited power could have been interesting. Or Jean Grey; her conflict of controlling her power, and how someone like Apocalypse would affect her. The best aspects of the film are the characters of Charles Xavier, Mystique, Magneto, Quicksilver and Jean Grey with all of their archs being interesting, but also takes a long time to resolve them. There is growth in these characters, and visual progression, but it takes a long time for them to get fully realized. Quite possibly the best scene in the film is the "Quicksilver" Sequence (similar to DOFP) but perfected and dominates the previous. I will not spoil what song is used during the sequence but it is a good choice. X-men: Apocalypse is a good movie with great moments, but a few flaws. But those do not allocate into a great film, as the flaws are too noticeable to hold it back. This is not a bad film, and should not be compared to the likes of any other superhero franchise, since it has a different formula. It is not Captain America: Civil War, or Batman V. Superman. It is a FOX owned Marvel property, and not Disney nor DC. The key to enjoying this film is to manage expectations. To look for how the film is interesting, such as parallels it makes to other films (it makes an interesting parallel to Return of the Jedi) and the biggest thing lacking in this film is risk. With an altered timeline, one would assume that the future is set in stone, so that for the most part the characters would be safe and that the world would not end, and while that does take away some of the weight of the climax, there is still risk as some characters do die in the process. Apparently there will be an extended cut on the home video release, which is something that I am looking forward to exploring. This is a good film. With good character, a few shoehorned Easter eggs (seriously, Wolverine?) an interesting setup for the future, and some depth. It may not blow your mind, but it won't disappoint too much. Just don't expect Days of Future Past. Or X-men 3. A good movie: 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weakest in the trilogy, but not bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching "Return of the Jedi". And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it's the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It's in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn't anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn't all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching "Rocky 4", it's alright but just not good as "Rocky" and "Rocky 2". The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it's basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn't worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn't anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the critics would have you believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If X-MEN:APOCALYPSE does not quite rise to the level of DOFP it is not for want of trying, for this latest installment in the franchise really goes for the bigger is better style of film making. From the beginning, many of us longtime Marvel and X-Men fans have waited with anticipation for the movies to tackle En Sabah Nur, one of the mutant's biggest foes, and for the most part, the movie pays off nicely.But it is not without its flaws, starting with a tiring two and half hours running time, mostly because the first 45 minutes or so is all about exposition and setting up the many, many characters who appear, including Apocalypse himself, his future four horsemen, the teen age versions of some X-Men anchor characters, along with catching up with Charles Xavier, Eric Lehnsherr, Mystique and Quicksilver. This has become a staple of the X movies, where different versions old favorites have to the reintroduced over and over again. Nobody trusts the audience to just jump right in to the story and go with it. It's nearly an hour into the film before the good mutants and bad mutants begin to move in directions that will lead to the inevitable Big Showdown at the end. I will say that for the most part, the movie is free of the clunky plotting that is so obvious in other super hero movies-BATMANvSUPERMAN being one of the most recent and worst offenders.As in all comic book movies, if there is a good villain, then it's a good movie, and in this respect, Apocalypse might be seen as something of a disappointment in that he's just another megalomaniacal super villain bent on taking over the earth because he's just better than everybody else. In a lot of ways, he just comes off as a mutant version of Ultron. But this is where casting is key, and Oscar Isaac gets so much more out of the part than was evidently in the script, with makeup that is a dead ringer for the comic book and FoxKids cartoon version of the character. Isaac is able make this Apocalypse truly menacing by using a good actor's best tools: his voice and facial expressions. He truly gets this villain's malevolence. Of course at the end, we get the standard face off with evil, where some of the bad guys have a sudden epiphany and change sides, while the supremely all powerful Apocalypse merely wounds and disables the heroes when he could clearly just kill them outright, but then they wouldn't all be able to join forces and take him down, like we've seen so many times before in other super hero movies.The best part of the bigger is better comes when Quicksilver saves the students at the Xavier Institute from certain death in an explosion; this is CGI at its best and utterly tops the great scene in DOFP where the speedster rescued Magneto. It alone is worth the price a ticket, which is due in no small part to Evan Peters, reprising his role from the previous movie and building upon that earlier performance. Another great scene is the caged match between Angel and Nightcrawlwer. Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Codi McPhee-Schmit are excellent as the junior league versions of Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. James McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult are back as Charles Xavier and Hank McCoy, so too are Josh Helman and Rose Byrne as William Stryker and Moira MacTaggert. Newcomer Ben Hardy is Archangel, while Alexandra Shipp easily steps into Halle Berry's shoes as Storm. The best acting, by far, is done by Michael Fassbinder as Eric Lehnsherr, who perfectly captures Magneto's torment as, yet again, tragedy pushes him to the dark side. The death of his family in the woods is one the strongest scenes in any of the X films. But how many times do we have to see the same sequence where he and Charles have the same conversation over whether mutants and humans can live together and will Eric stay and be part of the solution or just walk away-again. And it's always great to see Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who manages the nail the comic book character to a tee. That Hugh Jackman cameo as Weapon X wasn't really needed, but he is still a welcome sight in what will always be his signature role. Best piece of dialogue: that dig at LAST STAND.As for the next movie, well bring on Mr. Sinister and the Mutant Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Critics are way Wrong! "Apocalypse" Delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 8th installment of the X-men franchise (excluding "Deadpool") blasts off with this big-budgeted extravaganza featuring the long awaited super-villain Apocalypse. After the huge success of "Days of Future Past," Bryan Singer gets another go at the franchise. The film successfully captures the spectacle, humor, heart, and awesomeness that filmgoers have come to expect from the X-men franchise further solidifying that Bryan Singer is THE MAN to direct the X-men movies.When "X-men: Apocalypse" was prescreened it became bombarded with negative reviews -- leaving many (myself included) skeptical of the film's potential. Though what critics do not seem to get is that yes, "Apocalypse" is flawed, although it still thoroughly entertained its audience from start to finish with awesome super-powered set pieces, thrilling action, delightful comic relief and cool cameos of beloved characters.The production team and the writers really made this film work. The performances were great from a very young and likable cast. The special effects were solid yet did rely a bit too much on CGI. The action was thrilling and provided audiences with tension through the threat of character deaths and other calamities present unlike in "Civil War" where there was not much tension in the action (albeit still cool) because most of the fights took place between friends who we knew would never kill each other. The humor was sporadic yet still funny. X-men always makes great use of their one f-word limit. Finally the nuke scene with the subtle touch of Beethoven and the Quicksilver scene with the Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams' were just simply exquisite.Now Apocalypse did have flaws. There is no denying that. The timeline still has inconsistencies and continuity errors. While watching Apocalypse the average moviegoer probably will spend a good amount of time figuring out if the years and ages line up correctly. Like no way Nicholas Hoult looks twenty years older than he did in "First Class." Rottentomatoes went so far to call Apocalypse (the villain) cliché. Which is partially true because he wanted to destroy the world; which is what every super-villain wants to do nowadays! Also another review on IMDb said that all the X-men team up to defeat Apocalypse (the villain) by combining their powers in a Fant4stic kind of way. That is very true and the scene did seem like a bland and anticlimactic approach to kill off the big bad Apocalypse. Also since X-men is known for having an abundance of superheroes present: giving each one sufficient development is a task too difficult. Given this, certain characters had no development or little to do like Storm, Angel, Jubilee, and Psylocke -- whose only purpose for being there was to make teenaged boys lose their sh...In a nutshell "X-men: Apocalypse" is another good addition to the X-men franchise that will continue to propel it forward in more ways than one. The production team did a great good of integrating action, emotional depth, resonant themes, and humor into a seamless whole. Hopefully the studio will keep Bryan Singer at the director's chair and if they even think about getting a new director, they just need to be reminded that the only good X-men movies came from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlike the other superhero movies, this one got it just right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year where most hated Batman v Superman (with few who actually saw how great it actually was), loved Civil Was (with the same few that saw all the problems it had), Apocalypse is a superhero movie that feels just about right, it is the superhero movie we have been waiting for this year.Unlike the trailers, the story is much more complex and dark. The trailers lead to different expectations so a pleasant surprise was found upon viewing. The villain is as comic book as he can get, his followers included. Apocalypse is by far the most fearsome enemy the X-men had so far. He is a type of villain you just love to watch and hear, and you hate him with every fiber of your being. Isaac's portrayal was superb. His godlike attitude and inhumane deprivation of every emotion was difficult to produce, but he succeeded nicely. Taking into account his godlike performance, the final battle simply keeps you stuck exactly where you're sitting, unable to move with a sense of not wanting this movie to end. The only problem is getting to the ending. The story does drag a bit in the middle, at points really unnecessary. Still, the movie's basic story line functions like a nice and compact structure.Other than that, the portrayal of Magneto was by far the best we have seen. Fassbender's deep understanding of the character leaves you wondering just how much time he spent in researching the character. Also, he managed to keep the character as close as he could to the original Ian McKellen performance.At this point, the true problem of the movie is revealed. There simply is not a leading man/woman. Lawrence was intended to be the leading role, but she never really takes full control. McAvoy does a great job again, but never really steps as the leading role. Also, a lot of young actors portraying younger versions of the X-men lead the second half of the movie. Maybe that is the reason why the second part drags a bit, they are still not up to the role of being leading stars (even though they have potential). So, basically, Isaacs as the villain took over. Was that a good choice is questionable, but the movie's functionality because of that is not doubted.The element that binds all this together is the music that follows scenes to a subatomic level. From the character suite's to the action scenes, the music was superbly done. Also, some humor elements really give this movie a lifelike dimension.All in all, is you loved the previous movies, you will adore Apocylpse. The problems are simple, a lot of characters with not one good guy in charge lead to a dragged second part of the movie. Still, it was performed brilliantly, technically nicely done with much more character development of Magneto, which lead to a darker tone of the movie. Apocalypse is a type of movie you will want to see over and over again, and every time you will find something brilliant, even if it's just how much fun you are having while watching it.P.s. If Suicide squad doesn't mess up, Apocalypse is this years greatest superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great X-Men Adventure!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it isn't coining the box office receipts that "Captain America: Civil War" commanded, "X-Men: Apocalypse" surpasses "Captain America" with lavish spectacle, brinksmanship suspense, and fertile fantasy. Part of the reason is that Twentieth Century Fox produces the "X-Men" movies, while Walt Disney Studios handles the "Captain America" franchise. The "X-Men" franchise displays greater edge and paranoia than the formulaic, facetious, Disney Marvel franchises. For example, the body count in "The Usual Suspects" director Bryan Singer's latest Marvel Comics adventure "X-Men: Apocalypse" is double, perhaps even triple that of "Captain America." "Sherlock Holmes" scenarist Simon Kinberg and Singer have no problem with liquidating some X-Men characters. Meantime, Disney produces Marvel sagas where few super-heroes suffer permanent injury. The divide and take sides "Captain America: Civil War" concluded in a stalemate with Cap and Iron Man playing patty-cake. The inescapable problem that Singer and Kinberg face in the ninth "X-Men" franchise entry is predictability. The original "X-Men" trilogy charted the story of Xavier's mutant super-heroes along chronological lines. The second "X-Men" trilogy, starting with "X-Men: First Class" (2011), then "X-Men: Days of Future Past" (2014), and finally "X-Men: Apocalypse" ventures backward in time, examining the origins of various characters. "X-Men: First Class" dealt with the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis, "X-Men: Days of Future Past" unfolded at the end of the Vietnam War in the 1970s, and "X-Men: Apocalypse" transpires in the 1980s. "X-Men: Apocalypse" makes several allusions to "X-Men: First Class" about Professor Xavier's romance with CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert. Since the second "X-Men" trilogy occurs before the original trilogy, we know the principal characters are in little danger of annihilation. Nevertheless, Simon Kinberg's screenplays for those three films have all been imaginative, audacious, with the X-Men taking things to the brink. Clocking in at an extensive 144 minutes, "X-Men: Apocalypse" doesn't wear out its welcome, and Singer doesn't short-change his packed ensemble cast. Furthermore, the malevolent Apocalypse in his first full-blown cinematic incarnation proves to be a challenging opponent. "X-Men: Apocalypse" qualifies as a larger-than-life but slam-bang, sci-fi supernatural saga staged with considerable intellect, wit, and panache."X-Men: Apocalypse" opens during a pharaoh's burial ceremony in ancient Egypt in 3,600 B.C. Naturally, Singer relies on spectacular CGI special effects galore to conjure up this vast, sprawling, ceremony as the first mutant, Apocalypse, finds himself betrayed by a duplicitous cabal. They trap Apocalypse in a pyramid, and the structure vanishes into the earth for 5,600 years until the 1980s when CIA Agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne of "Bridesmaids") stumbles onto it. She finds a passage that leads to Apocalypse's burial chamber. A cult has been struggling to resurrect the notorious lord, and Apocalypse emerges from captivity to find the world greatly altered from his day. Dark and sinister, with tubes curving out of the back of his head, Apocalypse emerges as an ominous figure in a bizarre outfit. He saves a Cairo street thief, Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp of "Straight Outta Compton"), from two vigilantes. Eventually, Ororo will become Storm. He recruits a fallen angel, Angel (newcomer Ben Hardy), and Apocalypse transforms Angel's wings into steel so he has the ability to hurl razor-sharp metal feathers which are comparable to machetes. The most important recruit that Apocalypse attracts is Magneto, Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender of "Prometheus"), who is in no mood to love mankind. Erik has suffered another great personal tragedy. During the intervening ten years since the events in "X-Men: Days of Future Past," Erik has maintained a low profile as a factory worker in Poland. Sadly, he is forced to reveal his mutant ability to manipulate metal when he saves a fellow factory worker from certain death. Unfortunately, the local authorities descend on him with bows &amp; arrows. Magneto flees and joins Apocalypse. Apocalypse is appalled at everything that has transpired during his protracted absence, and he decides to change everything with the help of Erik, Storm, Angel, and a "Wonder Woman" lookalike warrior Psylocke (Olivia Munn of "Ride Along 2"), who boasts both telepathic and telekinetic abilities and dresses like a dominatrix. The collateral damage that Apocalypse and his henchmen create overwhelms the entire Disney Marvel Universe. Impudently, Apocalypse prompts all of the superpowers to launch their nuclear warheads into space where the ordinance will be useless and civilization will depend on the intervention of Professor Xavier (James McAvoy of "Wanted") and the X-Men that are a lot younger than their predecessors. Happily, Jennifer Lawrence reprises her role as Raven, and Nicholas Hoult returns as Hank McCoy aka Beast.As exemplary as "X-Men: Apocalypse" is, "X-Men: Days of Future Past" still tops it, but the two movies differ in terms of scope. Director Bryan Singer isn't as enamored with the 1980s in "X-Men: Apocalypse" as he was with the 1970s in "X-Men: Days of Future Past." He cuts back and forth between the heroes and the villains as they clash. This extravaganza serves up one good scene after another. Two of the best occur when Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters of "Kick Ass") aka Quicksilver and Wolverine demonstrate their respective skills. Quicksilver embarks on a rescue mission at Xavier's School for Gifted Children after the building comes under attack. Quicksilver darts about like a wraith snatching somebody here and seizing somebody there, before the house collapses in a pile of smoking rubble. This scene provides some genuine levity in the middle of Apocalypse's devastating plans to renovate planet Earth. Without divulging too much information, Wolverine's solitary scene is as savage as it is sensational. The grand finale between Charles and Apocalypse is a drawn-out, but exciting exercise that drums up white-knuckled suspense. The evil first mutant intends to freight his consciousness into Xavier's body and then appropriate Xavier's gift to connect with everybody's mind on the planet. While Charles and Apocalypse tangle like maniacs, the X-Men have their hands full with Apocalypse's Four Horsemen.If you haven't kept up with the "X-Men" cinematic universe, you may find its plot difficult to follow.</fullReview>

Quicksilver was amazing as usuall better than days of future past.wolverines quick cameo was a nice bonus and ties into the overall plot line. storm was done even better here i think than holly.b version, which i never thought they did justice. Here however she feels and acts more like storm. overall amazing movie. one of the best in the series and contender against any movie out there..so go see it and decide for yourself..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Age of Apocalypse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finding Captain America: Civil War to be far better than expected,I was happy to discover that a new X-Men title was also coming out.With having somehow missed seeing the last few X-Men flicks,I decided that it was time to catch up with the gang.The plot:Betrayed by his worshippers,the first ever mutant En Sabah Nur is entombed alive.1983:Finally breaking out of the tomb (only took a few 100 years!) Nur finds a world which has lost its way,due to the "weak" ruling it.Deciding to remake the world to his dream design,Nur starts gathering up fellow mutants to work with him.On the other side of the world, Alex Summers learns that his brother Scott is getting mutant abilities,which leads to Alex taking Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school,so that Scott can get a grip on his abilities.AS Scott begins his training, Xavier and his fellow mutants soon discover that the "first ever" mutant has come back from the dead.View on the film:Mutating over a 2 and a half hour running time,returning co- writer/(along with Simon Kinberg/ Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris) director Bryan Singer &amp; cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel largely take an underhanded manner to placing the X-Men in the 80's,with Reagan photos,fading Cola billboards and Metallica tracks scattered in the background. Exploding the action over a large canvas,Singer skilfully uses slo-mo to make the special skill of each X-Men stand out,as Nur's chaos pours down like a halo of bullets.Continuing on themes from the very first X-Men movie,the screenplay by Singer/Kinberg/Dougherty and Harris deliver a sincere message about being proud of your true self,which helps to give the action an underlying purpose.Going back to the very beginnings of the X- Men,the writers cleverly find spaces to pull threads from the past films,which along with tying up the loose ends nicely, also reveals how dangerous Nur is.Filling every corner with X-Men action,the writers appear unsure over how to carry the legacy of the past 8 films over,due to the huge baddie and large number of X-Men leading to any pauses to help each mutant stand out largely being skipped,as the X-Men face the apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The third in the trilogy is always the worst".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before panicking that this line, referenced to a beloved Star Wars film, means disrespect is afoot, you may come to realise this is a clever joke on the problems of the third X-Men film...Apocalypse is about an ancient Egyptian mutant, possibly the first, who is awakened in the 1980's world of our now established mutant heroes. He tries to bring his rather hard line imperial-racial global view to fruition while X-Men young and mature struggle through their own problems to defend each other and the world from the threat Apocalypse himself presents with his gathered 'Four Horsemen' to help cleanse the planet. Younger members learn to fight this threat together while their mentors and would be mentors grapple with long term human and mutant issues of acceptance in society.Finally we again have proper stakes in a Marvel film. A Main character taken, people dying within the carnage but some seriously nasty deaths also occur and not all characters finish without further black marks against their name.Some character depiction and inclusiveness unfortunately suffered really badly e.g why would I want to see my favourite character's Angel and Psylocke unless they are done justice with development. Enjoyable despite finding some characters physically inaccurate, at least some were natural with freckles and moles which was refreshingly human. I don't understand though the obsession with constant exposure of Mystique. Despite loving Lawrence's acting, Mystique as a core X-Man? No not ever. Thank goodness she does such a good job rather than the near mute in the very first film.Apocalypse has divided opinion, what led us to this stage?Bryan Singer directed a superb effort in 2000 leading the first film. The oddly named X-2 soon passed as an all out superb sequel to a very good start, remaining well loved and highly respected among super hero films. Following this came the atrocity (we do not mention its name) that 20th Fox couldn't hold out for Singer to direct. Dark lord among saga ruining sequels, due to its rushed and ignorant stamp-out ending of the comic's decades long epic tale of mutants, this abomination left the whole saga in tatters with previously happy X-film fans hating the whole lot. In fairness Berry and Janssen were seriously lacking in the first film but that's a quibble.An age passed before First Class arrived. By no means great, it showed huge promise and here we are now, way off from original source material but film conversions can condense yet be respectful if treated properly. Again a lousy one-shot director was not in it for the long haul but by chance the excellent actors brought real humanity and characters to life. They and solid production design saved this from otherwise dodgy and repeat prologue sections.It seemed incredible that Bryan Singer would return to direct these films again and Days of Future Past sounded a nightmarish story to pull off. It turned out excellent for those who love and appreciate either the comics, cartoons or decent X-Men films prior. Its only shame was (I begrudgingly have to accept) was showing a snippet of that accursed instalment No.3 but ultimately wiping it out as a false memory in the story (may it be wiped from our memories too).We come to Apocalypse and will inevitably be divided. Either:The long term multi layering of X-Men films brings a slower, more mature film that massively expands the animation and comics to cinema, fulfilling the best representation of comic book mythology to date proving Hollywood's dumb sequels and critics wrong.OrThe film-makers messed up and overreaching themselves in scope and script, left little dramatic tension or screen time for 'my favourite character'. We wanted more of the same, not this CGI heavy and dialogue leaden mess. 'Now get on with it! Shut up and fight!'There are valid points in both stereotyped views above but I'd offer genuinely critical points as someone who loves super hero films but rarely gives them higher than 7 stars, so without gushing or hating:Apocalypse is an enormously ambitious story/character to commit to screen and it is hard to believe they took a really great shot at it. It's consistent in vision from First Class onward yet links creatively with Bryan Singer's previous and first two films.This feels like the X-Men world and depicts the central plot characters very well. All viewers should finally know whether they actually like X-Men in general or not through the accurate communication of their entire cultural and character setting across multiple films.Vast scale destruction in CGI is overstated in modern cinema with grandiose orchestras blasting out epic themes for too many 'epic' moments for years, therefore reducing the impact of an otherwise truly epic event. These parts were least interesting with character interaction scoring highest for fictional expansion of Marvel's world. You may also find the the destruction a little boring, whenever the whole world's going to hell, you sort of give up and accept something too big to comprehend. Dramatic intent makes more impact. The musical score was good by the way with a brief but great Shawshank rip off.There's a lot of bad guy 'standing around' while their boss speaks. The 'enemy' deserve more substance and action, at least you may well agree with Apocalypse's view of the modern world. Sympathising with enemies is always a strength and humanises them. 'En Sabah Nur' or Apocalypse does something terrific with some deeply atmospheric Beethoven played to amazing effect. Quicksilver steals the good guy's best scene again with much humour, ignoring coincidences and luck, this was delightful as last time.Overall good acting outweighs CGI here, its a brilliant slower universe expander for people who like X-Men and can enjoy an excellent fully grown up saga, not one off blockbusters that repeat Hollywood popcorn brain formulas. Make another!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some issues, but still worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was very little that surprised me about the quality of this movie. I knew that it would be a step down from DOFP, but would likely still have a good story with a few problems. Some of the problems were not of the sort I expected. The heightened stakes proved to be less of an issue than I expected. It held back some of the emotional appeal, but not that much. The characters ended up being more of a problem than I had hoped, which was too bad because the other two requels did a really good job with character development.In this case, there were a few too many characters too give them proper depth, I suppose. The returning characters were good. Charles and Erik were very engaging, and you knew where their philosophies were at. Charles got to be kind of cool this time around rather than just wise. Erik's feeling of entitlement to his rage is brought to a new level. The other returning characters of Moira, Hank, Raven, and Peter were pretty good. It was great to see a little more Quicksilver action. I thought Hank felt more natural this time around. Raven was a little forced, but not as much as I'd feared from her prominence in the trailer. However, the new characters were a big problem. They weren't very well introduced, and didn't really make you want to root for them. The three lesser Horsemen were hardly given any attention, and even the new protagonists were very poorly developed. I suppose some of this can be accounted for by their being in the original three, but it still didn't turn out good. Of course, we can't forget our villain, Apocalypse, who is interesting in more ways than might be expected. I was afraid we might get a flat villain, but his motive is actually pretty good. I really liked how he abhorred tools, especially when he got rid of all the Cold War nukes. Robbing his enemy of weapons rather than using those weapons himself revealed so much about his value on natural power and ego.The story as a whole was decent, but some of the scenes were excellent. I loved the opening with the transference of Apocalypse. Magneto losing his family was also done really well, along with his subsequent recruitment by Apocalypse. The climax was also pretty good, and the fashion in which Apocalypse was defeated, while it felt a little clichéd, still felt plausible and thematic. However, the entire sequence in Col. Stryker's base with Wolverine and everything was totally unnecessary. It made sense that he would capture the mutants at that point, but that space could have been filled much better.The visuals were top-notch, which is to be expected. The Quicksilver scene was probably the best spfx scene overall. The script did a decent job with dialogue, but it didn't do very well with shifting focus between the different groups of characters at the right pace. The acting from the returning roles was good, but the new faces gave some flat performances. I was particularly unimpressed with Sophie Turner as Jean Grey.The theme of mutants fitting in with the rest of society was not touched upon very much here. It comes up a bit in Hank and Raven's conversation and the stage fight between Angel and Nightcrawler. There is more of a focus on controlling and unleashing abilities, mostly with Jean and Scott, but It's rarely addressed. However, the way Apocalypse amplifies his followers' powers is rather interesting. With the exception of Angel, he really just tells them "You have so much undiscovered potential, let me show you how to tap into it."So, as you've probably already heard, it's not the best of the X-Men movies, but that doesn't make it bad. If you think you'll want to see it at some point, go catch it now while it's still in theaters rather than waiting and watching it on your computer for free. It's definitely a movie you want to see on a big screen. You should see at least First Class and DOFP first because the events of both are referenced and there are a couple of flashbacks to them as well. There are only a couple of references to the original movies, pretty much just in the Wolverine cameo, so if allusions like "would you prefer yellow spandex?" annoy you, don't worry too much. If you hate save-the-world plots, this is better than most, but it still has most of the prototypical elements. Overall Rating: 8.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please note spoilersThis is a fun watch and a good end to series films with the current younger team (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult ) The jumping between the different characters was an interesting way to deal with the multi views of what was happening, however it was very disconnecting ( the snaps to black felt too long) The in film comment about the 3rd films is correct. Apocalypse's horseman did feel a bit useless and a bit of an after thought . As for Apocalypse himself Oscar Isaac was a good cast but the character lacked the gravitas to be a destroyer. Again fun watch just not as epic as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie. I have always been of the opinion that the acting from Jennifer, Michael and James are superior to the actual material. The story is a little over complicated and being a fan of the previous movies I was a little lost in recalling what happened previously. I probably should have revisited them before watching this one. Throughout the movie I kept on hoping Erik, Mystique and Charles would survive so that we could have more movies with the same cast. I thoroughly enjoyed their interactions, their connections and their backstory. I didn't like the overall story line of Apocalypse and his 4 horsemen/women. We also didn't get to know them very well. The scene where Charles speaks to Erik and Apocalypse is busy doing a project runway costume design was just laughable. The whole Erik using the earths metals to destroy everyone was stupid. Apocalypse could have done that himself, faster and more efficiently. He was more obsessed with getting Charles's power. Why? so he has to switch to a new body, does he then retain his old bodies powers, with the powers he already has can't he just absorb other mutants powers.Why did Charles wipe Moira's memory of them? Charles deserved to be happy. When Beast helped Mystique to move to safety it was so cute, so many feels, we could've done with more of that. And why are they not together? So basically, please make more X-men movies and please recast Wolverine.</fullReview>

I recon this is a good movie to watch with family and with friends. There were elements of comedy, action and for once, there was a real risk factor to the story...which covered more than just America!!

		<fullReview>Only becoming a recent X-Men movies fan, I have to say I really enjoyed 'X-Men Apocalypse'. Definitely up there with 'First Class', but falls short of being better. Apocalypse is a great villain, but doesn't get enough screen time. Quicksilver's scene is nothing short of epic. I never thought they could surpass his scene in DoFP, but somehow they have. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are also great as Professor X and Magneto. The only major gripe I have is Mystique: I do feel like Jennifer Lawrence at this point is phoning it in, and her disguise gets way too much screen time. She's only really Mystique for like 2 scenes (not even for any full scenes).Overall though I really enjoyed 'X-Men Apocalypse', despite some small issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome! I never felt so much emotions, action and humor in a X-Men movie. All of it was balanced extremely good and I enjoyed watching it. Michael and James did very well, like they always do. Oscar Isaac had a very powerful performance. Jennifer fulfilled my expectations. The newcomer actors completely blazed it, I was very satisfied with their performances. Last but not least, Quicksilver had me with that scene which was even better than the one from Days of the Future Past. Sweet Dreams from Annie Lennox was a perfect choice for it, amazing! Anyway, about all of these negative reactions--&gt; haters gonna hate, and they can go f*** themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best superhero films ever made leaves early reviewers clueless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is absolutely amazing! The early reviewers don't seem to understand these characters and they don't understand this film. It sets a new precedent for comic book films in a world over-saturated with adaptations.The film hits every nostalgic and aesthetic beat it's supposed to without devolving into pure fan service. The writing is great. The allegory the mutant plight is for civil rights is given its due screen time. The characterization of the superheroes goes beyond their powers and outfits and at least touches the heart of who they are as people. Its main fault is juggling so many characters and so some of the acting comes off as stilted at times. In a way this is also its strength, because it manages to tell a coherent and compelling narrative with a large ensemble cast of characters, emulating the source material faithfully. It is a comic book fan's film.The action scenes are epic in scope, with stakes so high you'll be on the edge of your seat with you eyes transfixed on the action, yet never does the pacing sacrifice plot or character development for obligatory spectacle. Everything is purposefully sensational.As someone who was born in the 80s and experienced these characters' evolution through popular culture onto the big screen, I can say that X-Men: Apocalypse brings the flavor of the comics and the 90s TV show to the big screen in a way that children of the 80s and 90s love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great closure of the new trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-men Apocalypse has received mixed reviews from critics and some audience members, but I will say that ,is awesome no doubt. For starter it introduce the characters of Storm, Nightclawel, Cyclops, Marvel Girl and continued the thing of the new trilogy, with the First Class been in the sixties, Future in the seventies, this was in the eighties and the setting ,the costume and the references show that it was put work in to it.Now when I went to see it ,I had just finish my exam period in the university and I wanted something to light up. I get it and much more. For the title character Apocalypse I was pump and Oscar Isaak took this character ,whose freaking name is APOCALYPSE and gave an great performance ,that combine with the fact that the powers of the character were more that he fingers in my hands gave me much joy. To the story Apocalypse lived during antiquity and was praised and after a big sleep he awakes in the '80 and seeing how the world had become he decides to give lessons in power. For that he takes four persons to be his horsemen and increase their powers to maximum. Between them is also Magneto ,just THINK a buffed up MAGNETO my lord of Light protect me. Against them are the X-men who are a mix among the older team and the new students ,great!This movie like the First Clas is an X-men movie with out Wolverine in the lead role, though he makes a small cameo and I will say I was waiting to see him like that since the two thousands', the same apply to many of the new X-men who were much more in the movie than I expected and the actors done a fantastic job. Sophie Turner as Gean Grey, great choice and she is really well suited in this uncanny team, first you take the North and now the X-men I bend the knee to the new Queen of the Nerds!Now to the theme of the movie, here is family and what we are willing to do in order to have one, protect it and avenge it ,if it went there, the movie shows what are the X-men apart of superheroes ,are a family and as Macvoy says "I feel sorry for the man who is going to hurt them (X-men)" ,thanks Professor you are awesome. Now I get a bit why critics have hit this movie show much, it is because after Days of Future Past, Deadpool raise the standards for X-men flicks and the fact that only three weeks before Civl War was in release made many people to compare them and lets face it Civil is the best movie of Marvel so far! In the end between Batman versus Superman and Apocalypse the latter took wrongfully show mixed reviews. Also this the last movie with Jennifer Lawrence as Mustique ,pity but we end up with a high note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bryan Singer you are big.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to critics at Rotten Tomatoes listen, I got out expectations for this movie, but Bryan Singer managed to silence the haters, with a funny and straight out of the comics history. I love the reinvention of the X-Men young and costumes are the best I've seen. At last we see a villain who will wreak havoc in the lives of these mutants although would have been better as their best moments were when he was white eyes. Another thing I do not like anything was Angel. Okay, I know it's difficult to put it blue but that Miley Cirus hair. Wolverine's cameo was impressive as we see with that Weapon X suit.Well, after the end of this movie is a reminder because we already know where the story part. As Hank said, time is like a river, you can have stones then return to normal.The movie is good and I recommend it if you're a fan like me of the X-Men</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't understand why "X-Men: Apocalypse" received poor ratings. I found the movie to be very good. If you are a fan of the X-Men and/or enjoyed "Captain America: Civil War", you will likely enjoy this film.Instead of offering my own review, I am going to respond to the "top critics" from Rottentomatoes.com:"It's basically a closing chapter to a feeble trilogy that started out pretty well and then ran out of gas... Oscar Isaac wasted in the role of an invulnerable ancient supervillain who becomes vulnerable just in time for the final showdown." Andrew O'Hehir (Salon.com) Clearly this critic is biased against the comic, for he refers to it as a "feeble trilogy". And if he paid attention (and didn't look forward to his scathing review), he would've seen that Apocalypse was not vulnerable, but a "back door" access was made to begin defeating him via Jean Grey in his mind (something that wasn't possible earlier in the film)."Mutants galore infest "X-Men: Apocalypse," but the pile-on quickly becomes wearying....but the storyline, such as it is, would have benefited from major pruning." Peter Rainer (ChristianScienceMonitor) A pile-on of mutants? There are possible three additional mutants added, with only one being introduced for the first time (Nightcrawler). Inclusion shouldn't be an issue, it's time taken for backstories that become clutter. And, "pruning"? This is a very simple story, only the characters are given a little more dimension beyond simple cartoon characters. And my response to Rainer, applies to Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine, as well ("Enough already. Singer throws so much mutant at us that nothing sticks. I was almost rooting for Trump to impose a quota.") Jean Grey, Cyclops, Mystique, Quicksilver, and Nightcrawler, with the last one being the only new character (though, he did appear previously). Mr. Travers, the movie is not called, "X-Man," and per your complaint, like O'Hehir from Salon.com, it appears you don't like this comic series. Well, I could go on, but, you get the point. The story is good -- and not convoluted. The acting is good. And, of course, the directing is good. If you liked the other "X-Men" movies, you like this one. And, personally, I found this one better than "Days of Future Past", which was a bit convoluted for my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men movie made but it is still enjoyable if you're an X-Men fan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.How good is this movie? It may not top the previous X-Men movies but that doesn't mean the movie is terrible. It is all based on opinion. Don't be scared to see the movie all because critics are making this movie look bad, go see it for yourself for your own opinion. You decide whether the movie is good or not. In my opinion, it is actually good. Not great, but good.Are the younger versions of the X-Men in this film? Yes. We have a younger version of Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler and Storm. We also have many amazing recurring members from the previous movies such as the young Professor X who was amazing, a slight older Magneto, Mystique who is also a little older and Beast who is still young as ever. And yes, Quicksilver returns and tops his amazing scene from X-Men: Days of Future's Past. How is Apocalypse the character? Honestly, I feel that Apocalypse was a little weaker than his comic version. If he was CGI like Thanos from Guardians of the Galaxy, he would've looked more threatening and tyrannical. I could basically compare this Apocalypse to a wimp who cosplays as Apocalypse with really good make up. His role is almost similar to Ultron.Is Wolverine in this? Yes! He may have a small cameo but it is a damn excellent cameo! When Wolverine enters the screen, the film basically transforms into an R-Rated action scene. Now that is who Wolverine is. It is also based on the real weapon x origin of Wolverine. He acts like a wild animal and slashes anyone who gets in his way and even this guy who begged Wolverine for mercy got his face ripped off! How dark is this film? It is actually pretty dark. There is a lot of death and depressing moments you will feel. We also get more connected with Magneto and why he hates humanity so much. It almost felt as he was the main antagonist in this film. We see his past and his present and why he turned into a dark and yet powerful supervillain. Also, the way Apocalypse murders people is pretty brutal and frightening.Would you recommend it? Of course! Like I said, it may not top the previous X-Men films but that doesn't mean it is terrible. If you love X-Men, as well as apocalyptic superhero movies, then this is the film for you. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse is a must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Younger versions of the iconic X-Men: Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm and Nightcrawler finally make their debut. We also get introduced to young Psylocke and Angel since their big screen debut in the travesty that was, X-Men 3: The Last Stand. Some characters shined brighter than others, leaving the rest in the dust. There is a lot of fun action, easter eggs and nods to the comics. This film was the first in the X-Men series to truly cater to comic-book fans rather than the casual movie goer, which ultimately is the reason behind the flak director Bryan Singer is receiving.Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan and Kodi-Smitt McPhee really delivered as the iconic young X-Men. Turner, who played Jean Grey, really stood out as the breakout performance of the movie. Her being branded as an outcast amongst outcasts due to her lack of control. There was so much power in Turner's performance of Jean Grey that will surely give way to future films for her. Sheridan gave us a rebellious Cyclops unsure of his role in the world, until the time came for him to step up, where he showed subtle signs of becoming the leader we know him to be. Kodi Smit-McPhee was a promising Nightcrawler. All of the horsemen aside from Apocalypse were mere action pieces. It was fun to watch, but such a let down as a core comic book fan. Storm once again was underused for the other characters to shine.Lastly, Oscar Isaac did a pretty good job with what he was given. At times he was repetitive and monotone, but his charisma as an actor really shined! All in all this movie was made for core comic book fans.

		<shortDescription>Cameo appearance of the century!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a truly great film, that has to be said. I was never massively captured by X-Men films in the past but since I watched Days of Future Past I was immediately captivated. I went back and watched all the original films and am now a true fan of the franchise. This film had everything as it takes you back through the origins of the cast of the first X-Men film. Perhaps the best origin story of them all, and there were a lot to follow believe me, is that of The Wolverine. Now when he was first shown in the trailer I was hesitant as to his role but as it turns out it was the best role they could have given him.*This where there will be some spoilers*. Wolverine makes his appearance when a group of the mutants are captured by Colonel Striker. Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler are roaming around the base when they come across a highly guarded crate which seemed to have some sort of animal in it. It was Jean Grey who identified that it wasn't an animal in the crate, she then continued to open the crate just in time for a group of guards to arrive, before being torn to shreds by a rather angry and distressed Hugh Jackman. During his 5 minute screen time we get to see the aftermath of him being tested on. This isn't linked to the abomination that was 'X-Men: Origins' but a link to his over solo film 'The Wolverine'. Then right at the end we see Jean Grey tap into his memories and give him some back so that he calms down and is able to be that extra 1% happier. The last we see of him is as he goes running off into the cold snowy mountains, a familiar setting to where we see him in 'The Wolverine'. It was a truly fantastic cameo appearance and really acts as a great prequel.I wasn't surprised that this film was great but there were some real stand out performances, McAvoy and Lawrence are no surprise but I was very happy with how Oscar Isaac portrayed the character of Apocalypse incredibly well. We were also able to see the wrath of Havok only shortly before... Well lets not spoil the entire movie. Unless you've read the comic books go and see what happened.Honestly can say this was a great film and was plenty to watch, loads of action and some great story telling. The visual effects were phenomenal although the only downside would perhaps be Psylocke's outfit, wouldn't say it matches her comic book outfit that well but you can easily get over it.Enjoy the film and I hope you agree on the Wolverine cameo scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They are uniting for good....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after the Paris peace accords, Professor Charles Xavier has recruited several students at his special school with the aim to establish it as the home for humans and mutants alike as they explore their strengths and grow together in harmony. But deep in the dark ruins of Cairo, an ancient power, En Sabah Nur has been awakened after millennia and has realized that the new unrelatable world needs to be destroyed so he can establish a new order. Deemed to be the very first mutant and the all powerful one, Apocalypse needed his four horsemen to pursue his devastating plans. The students at the Xavier school must now find within them, a way to harness their powers and use them to stop the apocalypse. The students must now become the X-Men. Erik (Michael Fassbender) lives a secluded life with his wife and daughter, concealing his powers while working in a foundry where one day, he is forced to use them to prevent an accident. The incident doesn't go unnoticed by his co-workers who report it to the authorities. An unfortunate encounter drives Erik mad with rage and his resulting vulnerability is soon exploited by Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), who recruits him as his fourth horseman after Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). In a powerful display of his newly enhanced powers, Magneto desecrates the site of Auschwitz and threatens to build a new world for Apocalypse. Meanwhile, Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Alex Summers/Havok have been busy recruiting mutants such as Kurt/Nightcrawler and Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). Also coming to their aid in the nick of time is Quicksilver/Peter Maximoff (Evan Peters), who steals the show each time he makes a run for it. Their sanctuary is compromised as Apocalypse learns about Charles' powers and kidnaps him to aid in his plan for gathering mutants across the globe. In the aftermath of the explosion, Hank, Mystique and Peter are taken captive by the Military, leaving Scott, Kurt and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) in their hot pursuit. The rescue effort was doomed if it wasn't for the accidental release of Weapon X, that unknowingly aided in their escape from the facility. Magneto's control of Earth's poles causes widespread destruction, killing millions as En Sabah Nur almost enslaves Charles to his will. But it's Jean's psychic powers that find the call for help from her Professor and along with the young fighters and new recruits, they race to prevent Magneto and Apocalypse from causing Earth's total annihilation. Cyclops has an engaging introduction to the team and Tye portrays the fear of his uncontrollable powers in a credible manner. Nightcrawler always has a freaked out look but is entertaining while Beast is almost underplayed in his role. Olivia Munn's brief presence has a lot of intrigue still remaining about her origins and powers of being Psylocke. Alexandra plays a young, uncertain Storm who isn't evil enough yet to choose a permanent side. Evan Peters is as witty as he is hasty and Quicksilver is by far a show stealer when on-screen. Oscar Isaac's villain isn't the all-powerful as they hyped him up to be. His God-like powers were seldom on display to be ascertained as the biggest threat to superheroes, let alone break away from the cliché of apocalyptic villains who want to recreate the world. Mystique had the entire world focusing on her eccentricity after being exposed in Paris and Jennifer Lawrence shows her reservations very well. Her performance is deliberately underplayed but she holds her position as Charles' favorite by her own merits. Michael Fassbender displays the torment and inner rage that Magneto experiences with a lot of sincerity, making it an outstanding performance as a villain. His reluctance to join his friend's school is deeply rooted in his suspicion of humans who have caused most of his tragedies. James McAvoy is extremely likable as Prof Xavier because he quite naturally charms his righteousness through to us while showing genuine care for both mutants and humans. Sophie Turner's Jean Grey surprisingly ends up being the highlight of the film and not because of her character's importance in saving the day each time. She has invested in the character that's learning to unleash her powers with a lot of reluctance at first and then realizing her true potential. She is a far better Jean Grey than her predecessor and with Mystique by her side, her development should get a lot more exciting. Director Bryan Singer (several X-Men films) is more than familiar with character introductions, mega villains and optimizing CGI to aid his storytelling and action. Yet, the film does lose the gravity of a major villain who was supposed to be the greatest nemesis of the X-Men. To see him so grossly under-utilized with just a handful of action scenes and a lot more of clichéd dialogues is quite disappointing. Apocalypse may not be the best X-Men film to date but it sure is as fun, exciting and entertaining as the best of them. What it lacks in, it makes up for in the attributes of its characters who are either too righteous or perfectly balanced now to fall on either side. 8.513 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers.For a good or a bad - it is the (more or less) the typical X-men/Superhero/Super power movie. I'm not some sort of a mega fan or anything but I do enjoy all X-men movies. If not for anything, at least watch 'cause that's the last time that Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine. VERY sad fact for me! The movie has a lot to offer but still nothing that original (more or less). In saying that - it's very colourful and the actors are First class! Im kinda sick of Game Of Thrones actors to be in every new movie in 2016 but I guess it is, what it is. Anyhow, long story - it's a great movie to watch it in the cinema - don't wait to come out on blu-ray or anything like this. You'll probably like it...but your girlfriend probably won't :D but she won't hate it either...so...go son! :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly well-done with one of the best villains of the franchise. One or two flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So X-Men: Apocalypse is either the third, sixth, or ninth film in the series depending on how you're counting and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence returning for a third time while bringing in new cast such as Oscar Isaac, Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan. The basic plot is that an ancient, powerful mutant known as En Sabah Nur has awoken in the 80s and wants to "cleanse the earth" of the weak and so the X-Men must stop him.As a whole, I like the X-Men franchise; despite it's bumps I've always felt it's had it's own vibe and personality and is different enough from other comic book universes such as the MCU and the not- so-connected DC properties. X-Men: Apocalypse continues in this and although shares similarities with other movie plots still feels like an X-Men movie. The stories we witness in this film are some of the finest we've seen in the franchise. The two biggest characters we've been following for years of course are Professor X and Magneto and each of them are so well-developed and incredible characters you know exactly what they are feeling and why they are where they are. Magneto's arc in this film is a highlight and from one particular scene in a forest you are hooked on his story and understand why he's doing the things he is. Professor X is great as the leader and strong-minded force who keeps the X-Men together and he really has some great scenes, especially towards the end. Another story in this movie is of course the one of the titular character himself, Apocalypse; his backstory in Ancient Egypt alone was a thrilling and well executed event and when you really see what he can do in the 80s I found him to be the most powerful and best villain they've had in the franchise. Just his voice, and mannerisms are so dark and menacing you really feel like he is an unstoppable threat.Apart from those three, other character highlights were the young Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler who fit well into the story and I really enjoyed seeing them, and then of course Quicksilver returning from Days of Future Past doing much more in the movie including one of the best scenes of any superhero movie, beating that of his previous. Everyone else did OK but weren't really used as much; Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique doesn't do quite as much as she has done and never has her own 'action piece' as it were and then three of the horsemen, Psylocke, Angel and Storm each had one particular shot that was cool but mostly stood around until the climax where they still didn't have too much screen time.Effects wise, all the powers and abilities looked fantastic. There was a lot of CGI and green-screen during the climactic battle and for me personally I thought that all looked just fine. There were one or two specific shots which weren't particularly good in my eyes but that was it.Some problems I had with the movie was that, as I said, some characters didn't really have much screen time and/or didn't really do anything at all (looking at you Jubilee) and then another thing isn't really a problem as it is the ninth X-Men-related movie but X- Men: Apocalypse requires you to know and remember quite a bit of the past films and this universe in general, so it makes it almost inaccessible completely to the general movie-going audience and unless you've seen at least five of the other films a lot will go over your head and seem out of place. And as a final negative point there were two scenes in particular that pushed the 12A (PG-13) rating to it's limits which will be fine for a lot of people but I think some will be quite surprised at how dark they went.Other than that X-Men: Apocalypse is a really powerful and thrilling superhero movie, and for me one of the best in the series, not quite beating First Class as my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apocalypse who was the first mutant ever, is from the Egyptian days. Awakens in 1983, he is more powerful than ever, and puts together his own band of mutants in hopes of world domination. It's up too Charles Xavier(James McAvoy) and his band of young mutants in hopes of stopping him.The well known characters like Cyclops and Havok and not to mention Beast don't really stand out as much they should. McAvoy is okay as Professor X, but it's Michael Fassbender as Magneto, that really takes the film, showing more Lars to the character, I was really liking his story arch. Jennifer Lawrence is alright here as Mystique. But Oscar Isaac has Apocalypse is creepy but no so much menacing, the animated Apocalypse was way more menacing. The effects are pretty descent, battle scenes enjoyable. I wonder there gonna be any more X-Men films, for me it ends with me not wanting anymore.</fullReview>

It wasn't as good as First Class or X2 or DoFT but it was still a good movie.

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse: Only a Supervillain, not an Event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is by no means, bad... In fact, it is a very enjoyable watch. Bryan Singer paid attention to story, however, 2 big problems arise from the ashes Apocalypse wanted to build upon.Firstly; Apocalypse wasn't supposed to just be the main villain, he was also supposed to be THE event, an apocalyptic event - I'm sorry, but after 16 years, the wait doesn't quite feel over just yet... Sadly, he was incredibly underplayed. The dude is immortal, period! He can alter his molecular form to suit any situation... He can possess any being of his choosing, at will... Transform different parts of his body into weapons simultaneously, and absorb energy... So, Cyclops is probably the WORST person to fight him! Also, as far as I know, Apocalypse already had telepathic abilities... The man is damn near impossible to defeat, but I understand that it has to be done, however, the way in which it was done, though very enjoyable to watch, wasn't good enough. Phoenix had to do it, but, was Jean ready to transform? And also, were the humans, the human race aware, that uuhhm, the world might end? I mean... the apocalypse was, so contained that, I could've been in Egypt watching Survivor, while completely unaware that I may not.However though, a lot about him, was done right... Was done very well. His ability to enhance powers, his demagogue ability... His apparent bond with celestial technology... His presence as a whole, was arrogant and powerful (nicely done Oscar), and I liked that.Second problem; You spend the whole movie trying to figure out if, the time line makes sense... I mean, Apocalypse is the 8th installment of this universe, and they've been going so back and forth in time that, I may just get a second shot at that other love of my life that got away back in 2007, in 2007. But whats awesomely annoying is, Bryan Singer may be linking the times like a pro.From there, Quicksilver - the only thing Fox did far better than Marvel - was amazing. Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Nightcrawler delivered. Mystique... I don't know, Jennifer didn't feel like she wanted to be there. Jean, Cyclops and Havok, the relations were relayed well, Psylocke (who's so very hot) and Angel were, meh... And Storm... (Alexandra also, so very hot), OK.Disappointed, no. Apocalypse could've blown me away, but, I'm happy to stay. 7/10.</fullReview>

X-Men movies are about mutants being connected and by doing everything together, they can achieve greater good.About the film: -The main antagonist Apocalypse does not feel like a scary and all-mighty villain. -His lines are simple and a bit dull. There should be more depth to them.+Great CGI +Amazing cast, Fassbender NAILED it as Magneto (once again) +Many characters +Scenes you will never forget (in the best way)I still feel like Days of Future Past is far better than Apocalypse.

		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse takes place in the 1980's, 10 years after the events in Days of Future Past. A god-like mutant has awaken and wants to destroy civilization in order to regain his rule. The X-Men must stop him before he becomes to powerful.I simply didn't find this story to be particularly interesting or believable compared to the other superhero movies in recent years. Apocalypse didn't look or feel all that powerful even though his powers would indicate he was. He was shorter than some of the mutants when in the comics he is a giant and didn't need much assistance. The gathering of the horseman was also kind of sad as he felt like he just picked up the first four mutants that he saw. There was nothing special about them, they each said I will join you but that is about it. Apocalpse is the kind of villain that you make into two movies, like what Disney is doing with Thanos. The first movie could have been used for Apocaplse to acquire his army of followers and the second could have focused on the battle and how the X-Men will respond to the situation. I guess that is why they are not doing that as the two would look similar. I personally don't think we needed another end of the world X-men movie given that we just got one. DoFP just seemed more intense of a situation which also lead to my mediocre interest in this battle. The scenes that didn't involve Apocalypse were for the most part quite enjoyable. Most notably the Quicksilver scenes as Evan Peters once again steals the show. The new actors also did great in their roles and had good chemistry with one another. Of course, this may be my own personal problem but again I find Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique to be just bland. The lines she spewed just lacked emotion and her one liners fell flat. I am glad that this was her last movie.I didn't enjoy the movie as a whole but the parts that I did like made up for the fact that it is just rather mediocre. I still recommend seeing it just be warned. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get all the hate towards this movie. X-Men Apocalypse went really really slow , I admit that. And almost half first of the movie there barely something happened. But it's kinda necessary to built a background story to the character,which it should take a little longer because 45 minutes is not enough and make it kinda "rush it" because the story happened 10 years after the previous movie and I must tell you it's not really boring at all. There are some few "funny" scenes in this movie , although some of it maybe will make you cringe. I guess Bryan Singer kinda playing it safe because of what happened to all the hate towards BvS movie for being too "serious" and "without" humor. I guess these times you can't really make super hero movie without a funny scene.The visual effects is superb , as usual. The fighting scenes is also cool. Probably the down low about this movie is that it has a really interesting plot with something different in it which kinda cool but there's a few minor clichés and some irrelevant secene. It's really worth the watch , especially because it's visually cool and it's kinda different than any other superhero movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Action Movie from Start to Finish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy well written, well acted, well directed fun summer action movies, go see XMen Apocalypse. Everything is spot on in this movie from beginning to end. The plot is well conceived and carried out, which is sometimes a problem with action/superhero movies (see Batman v Superman as an example of that.) The Big Baddie in the movie is intriguing, powerful, and scary. He feels real and is well acted by Oscar Isaac of Star Wars: The Force Awakens fame.All of the Xmen we love are back. We get to see origin stories for some we've known for a long time. All of the young actors, led by Jennifer Lawrence reprising her role as Mystique, are excellent. We get to see more of the delightful Quicksilver who was introduced and had one of the best scenes in XMen: Days of Future Past as well as a young Storm and a young Nightcrawler doing their thing. The action scenes with Quicksilver running here and there and Nightcrawler popping in and out of fights are some of the best you will see. Watching the conflicts of Magneto, Storm and the others trying to decide which parts of themselves they will embrace and which side of the fight to stand on brings layers to the movie beyond just the action.This stands with the best of the XMen movies and with the best of superhero movies. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

Only flaw in this X-men is perhaps the usual confusing time line and the big bad boss that doesn't seem strong enough. Everything else is good.The most fun part is seeing Peter speed through things. Hope he'll get more screen in next installment or maybe a solo movie. And i think her sister Scarlet witch should make it to the film tooAfter seeing the film, actually i don't understand why critics gave it a bad rating. I bring my family and they enjoyed the film.

		<shortDescription>A question for comic book fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a review of X-Men Apocalypse (a movie I enjoyed, as my rating indicates). Rather it's a question-- an observation, really-- about the genre. Screenplays are based on original ideas, or they're adapted from another source, such as a book, a fairy tale, a play, a TV show, etc. Comic books have recently become a gold mine for adapted screenplays, but the genre isn't new. In 1931, the movie "Skippy" was based on a comic strip, and the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar. Two more nominations came in 2003, for "American Splendor" and "Our Cancer Year," both based those respective comic book series.Most moviegoers understand that adapting a film from a book or another source means a departure from the original material. Film, after all, is a different medium with different demands on creativity, including whole armies of creative collaborators led by the director and writer(s).But fans of Marvel and DC Comics don't seem to understand that when they enter the movie theater, they're going to see a movie, not a comic book come to life. Many reviews posted here seem to be looking for absolute faithfulness to the original material, which is not only unrealistic (film has different tools), it is an insult to the creative filmmakers who adapt the material.I've seen all the X-Men movies, and the various Avengers films, and Superman and Batman, and etc.-- I'm a genuine fan of the genre. But I have read none of the comics. Not one. I was a film student, and learned to appreciate that medium on its own terms. My favorite novel is "Moby Dick," but nobody needs to read Melville's masterpiece to know that the movies based on it are mediocre. Nor does anyone have to read "Moneyball" or "The Martian" or "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" or "The Maltese Falcon" or "Rebecca" to know the film adaptions are good.Films must be judged on their own merits, not on how closely they adhere to the original source material. If comic book fans come to terms with that, they may find themselves enjoying the original as well as the adaptation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Wonderful X-Men Film, With Untapped Potential to be Something Greater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Days of Future Past was quite possibly one of the best superhero movies of all-time, and my personal favorite X-Men movie. With big footsteps to follow, X-Men: Apocalypse goes bigger and better in some aspects, and continues the franchise's path of success, but doesn't quite shine like some of its predecessors. Director and writer Bryan Singer has been able to craft some amazing stories in this growing X-Men universe, with spectacular character arcs spanning two separate main casts, and intense, intimate action steering the ship. The plot of Apocalypse gives an enticing premise, and a great story for longtime X-Men fans to love; the story of the world's first ever Mutant, the title character, and his eternal quest to rid Earth of mankind to build a new Mutant-ruled world. In ways, this is a story we've seen before with Magneto as the main antagonist with his idea of a better world run by Mutants, but the large difference here is the villain, who doesn't want to rule humanity, but extinguish it. In my opinion, Apocalypse is a terrific villain, he's introduced right from the start of the film, and his development through the movie is steady and strong. We have ourselves a great, wicked, powerful villain by the end of the movie, which at the end of the day, helps create a better story.The pacing of the film was solid for the most part, outside of a few scenes where it starts to feel choppy. One place in particular, is when Quicksilver's spectacular scene is put back-to-back with Apocalypse's first encounter with Professor X. After an epic showdown between the two characters, ending in the X Mansion, we quickly cut to an entirely different feel, with an 80's soundtrack and loads of humor. Now individually, both of these scenes are brilliant, but put side by side, Apocalypse and his awesome evil ways seem to feel dumbed down, and the movie falls out of place momentarily. Aside from that large hiccup in pacing, the movie has a good flow to its storytelling, and with that, maintains a track record of great stories being told in the X-Men franchise.The action in the film was great. It was large in scope and scale and for the most part, we get to see every character on display a least for a short time. The action sequences don't bog down the pacing of the film, each action scene is written well enough towards the progression of the plot that you won't be caught wondering what the heck is going on. The action is visually engaging, fairly well choreographed, and primarily keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The X-Men universe is a large one, and with separate time lines now a staple of the franchise, we have two actors for almost every character introduced since the first X-Men film in 2000, older and younger versions. For the most part, this has been a strength of the franchise, with two casts being able to develop the same characters. In Apocalypse, we get to see the introduction of younger versions of some iconic characters, including Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, Angel and Psylocke. Unfortunately, outside of Nightcrawler, who provides some of the films best laughs, and Cyclops, who is played very well by up-and-comer Tye Sheridan, there is some massively underwhelming development and lack of screen time for the other aforementioned characters. I would have loved to see more time spent of Jean, chiefly given that a redo of the iconic Dark Phoenix Saga is reportedly on the way. Storm, Psylocke and Angel were poorly used and heavily under powered, mainly while enlisted as three of Apocalypse's Four Horsemen that he recruits to help him conquer the Earth. The actual performances by the character's actors are frankly wonderful, but the writing of their characters were not so much.While some of the newer heroes have yet to blossom into their full potential, the likes of series mainstays Professor X (James McAvoy), Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and even fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) all return and continue to deliver outstanding performances. Wolverine's cameo in the film just might be the best written scene with Wolvie in 16 years. He's fast, looks the part, and is brutally violent, with more blood spilled in one scene than the rest of the X-Men movies combined, a sneak preview at what's to come in next year's R- rated Wolverine movie. Along with Oscar Issac's spectacular portrayal of Apocalypse, and another wildly entertaining performance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the majority of the cast and their characters are done very well and are highly entertaining.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't the best film in this franchise, or arguably not even in the top 3 of films (Days of Future Past, X2 and First Class), but that doesn't mean it's not a great film. Yes, there are some inconsistencies in the pacing of the film, some criminally underused characters and a lack of overall development for those characters and the continuing growth of their arcs, and the X-Men franchise at large. However, those flaws cannot hold the film back from telling an engaging immediate story with plenty of humor, showcasing some exciting, occasionally grand action scenes, or having a huge roster of characters played extremely well by every one of their actors, with special recognition to Oscar Issac, Michael Fassbender, and James McAvoy. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the last scene of the film, which is arguably the best. It pays homage to the Bronze Age of comic books, includes terrific fan service and teases the future of the franchise. Even with consistent pressure from fans to return the X-Men film rights back to Marvel Studios and the MCU, Fox and director Bryan Singer continue to prove the doubters wrong with another great entry into the epic X-Men universe.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it falls under the shadow of DOFP, X-Men Apocalypse is another great entry in the superb X-Men series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the great amount of superhero movies released today, it is difficult for many directors to deliver a high quality of movies of the course of a series. With X-Men Apocalypse, Bryan Singer may have just proved himself to be the best superhero movie director. Singer once again crafts an interesting story, balances a large cast of interesting character, and shows his ability to direct elaborate action sequences. Although the overall execution is not perfect, it still results in another entertaining superhero film. As with any superhero film, a hero (or in this case heroes) are only as good as its villain, and Apocalypse emerges as a well-done villain, which is a welcoming sight compared to some other recent superhero villains. The opening sequence provides a great backstory to the character, and perfectly establishes him a false god who can't possibly exist without the presence or physical bodies of other mutants. By the time he awakens in 1983 and begins to enact his plan of eliminating the weak, it all makes sense and has actual purpose. His role as an alien of sorts who doesn't understand today's world perfectly lends itself to his plan. It gives the character a commanding purpose, and as a result makes him feel like the all-powerful character Apocalypse is meant to be. Where X-Men Apocalypse especially shines is in its decision to go with another new cast of X-Men. Each actor does a nice job capturing the spirit of their young, inexperienced mutant. Tye Sheridan especially impressed me as Cyclops, showing the mutants growth throughout the movie from fearing his powers to becoming a member of the new X-Men. The addition of fan-favorites like Nightcrawler and Quicksilver were also pretty awesome as the two prove to be the movies biggest scene stealers. Talking about great scenes, I have to mention THAT scene. Yes, X-Men Apocalypse boasts another AMAZINGLY AWESOME Quicksilver scene that somehow transcends the previous one!!!! Combine that with the equally excellent Weapon X cameo, and you'll be sure to walk out the theater with mind blown! For all the flashy scenes that X-Men Apocalypse may boasts, it is littered with flaws. To start, coming into this movie, the X-Men storyline had already been riddled with a number of holes, and this movie only compounds the problem. Even the most dedicated fanboys will have trouble trying to piece together the events from X-Men (2000) to Apocalypse. Also, while the addition of a number of new characters did help to expand the scale of the plot, the movie definitely reaches a maximum occupancy level, which results in a number of characters serving absolutely no purpose. While X-Men Apocalypse's flaws do prevent it from being the best in the X-Men series, it in no way keeps it from being another superb superhero movie. Singer has created a fantastic formula for superhero movies that has shown itself time-and-time again with great results. His ability to create compelling characters, action sequences, and (most importantly) stories has made him one of the best superhero movie directors. X-Men Apocalypse is just another example of the greatness that results from Singer's formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action Movie Since TFA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't argue with the Comic book purists who complain about the deviations from the comics, except to say that the deviation(s) happened in XM:FC. They have followed through with the story-line they started in First Class. I understand those who don't like the sometimes good(or flip-flopping) Magneto and Mystique, but it's been that way since FC. The characters have been written/portrayed consistently IMO.I'm not a comic-book guy - I just wanted to good, entertaining film. And IMO - it delivers and then some, AND THEN SOME MORE! I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It doesn't have that bad start that BvS has, and it doesn't have the bad ending that CA:CW has. It is emotional and intense from start to finish. The story-line from FC through DOFP to Apocalypse has been consistent and compelling IMO. This is a fantastic conclusion to the trilogy.It does seem to me that there's now a heavily entrenched bandwagon paradigm(among fans and critics alike) that anything from Disney/Marvel is an instant classic when announced, but anything from any other studio is trash before it is even done with post production. I'm not buying that.I can't wait to see this one again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new with wasted characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just checked and the poster for this film has 12 characters on it. But i can only think of 4 or 5 of those characters that have more than one line of dialogue in this film. This is where the film fails and once again Singer chooses to have characters there for window dressing only. Character motivation drives a story and makes the viewer engage with the characters. I felt no engagement with any of the them, even Magneto who spent a large portion of this film floating around. If someone can understand why Storm, Psylocke and Angel joined Apocalypse then please let me know because due to their lack of dialogue (i think Angel said two lines, Psylocke two and Storm maybe 4). JLaw is playing the reluctant hero (again) and you could have easily swapped her characters of Mystique and Katniss around without anyone noticing, but she really did seem to be going through the motions on this one. This really did scream of the studio wanting her character to have a larger role in the film just because it's JLaw. Xavier is coming across as more arrogant as the movies progress making him a much less likable character, i put this down to direction and James McAvoy's portrayal as Sir Patrick Stewart although confident was always humble in his portrayal. The new cast of mutants make an OK go of it but again due to lack of interaction left me feeling numb to their fate. I could go on but the more i think about it the more disappointed i become. On a plus side, i have honestly sent 10 minutes trying to think of a positive point and i can't. CGI maybe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie for children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waited for months to see this movie after the very good X-men days of future past. Yesterday I finally saw this movie at an IMAX theatre and was very disappointed. Somehow there is a new formula invented in Hollywood where directors need to show a lot of destruction, exotic creatures to get profit. For example this movie fits in a countless other titles with lot of special effects but a worthless story. Good examples are: + Transformers arc + Avengers arc + 47 Ronin + Batman vs Superman + Snow white arc People forget that movies are meant to tell a story. Where are the good movies like The Godfather, Seven Samurai, The Manchurian candidate, Papilon, Leon, Taxi Driver etc. To the analysis of the movie (contain Spoilers)A blue mutant called Apocalyps awakes after thousands years of slumber in the 21th century. Apocalyps has a very strange metallic voice and walks like a grandpa in the markets of Cairo. Nobody notices that he looks inhuman (in the previous x-men people were shocked to see the original form of Mystique) and meets a thief called Storm. After scanning a TV with his hands he tells her he is disappointed in the world and wants to reshape it in its image. In whole movie there is no explanation besides this strange argument. What is his endgame? In the next scene Apocolyps and his soldiers are preparing for a war and can expect to be attacked. But suddenly Apocolyps decide in the middle of the war to change bodies with Charles Xavier and be weak for attacks. I don't understand this because Apocolyps was already capable to hack Charles and use Cerebro. Then we see a dozen of mutants (without any background story) we don't have any additional value to the movie. To name a few: + Magneto. Angry about the death of his family and decides to ally with Apocalyps to extract iron of the earth + Peter Maximoff. He can run very fast and is in search/ reconcile with his father Magneto. At the end he doesn't have the balls to tell him+ Horsemen of the apocalyps (Angel, Storm, Psylocke) Disappointing. A few fight scenes but why put them in the movie if they get minimal screen time?+ Cyclops, Jean, Nightcrawler Teenagers who are insecure about themselves and are in search who they really are. We haven't seen that before.+ Moira purely in the movie for a romance element+ The only good characters which deserve screen time is Charles Xavier who puts a good performance to deserve sympathy Only for the special effect is it worth to watch this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise that a science fiction character can be described by other characters in a movie as a figure misinterpreted by the people of previous eras as "Yahweh" or "RA" and that this super-powered being designated four comic-strip movie character followers to conduct evil deeds causing them to be mistaken for the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse doesn't show much concern for Judeo-Christian sentiments. Or for the accuracy of either the Old or New Testament current worldview (or ancient Egyptian religious beliefs, probably, for that matter). Does somebody hope to consign the Old Testament to the dustbin of history?Practicing Jews and Christians will likely find the movie's description of its own premise highly offensive. Radical thought guru, the late labor organizer Saul Alinsky advised students of societal change who wanted to disrupt belief systems to poke fun at your targets. Comic book characters are really funny from the perspective of little children. So we don't always notice when they compare our Deity to the sun god of the long gone Ancient Egyptians.A late comedienne once joked: "How dare you pee on my roses and then have the nerve to tell me you just watered my lawn?" I think she understood Alinsky's views. Big budget films should not lend themselves to becoming Alinsky-style tools for desensitizing children to Old Testament ideas in my opinion, so I rated this film as a 3 (it probably should have been lower, but admittedly the special effects work).If you think its okay to belittle Judeo-Christian belief systems in this way, and to accustom your household to discussing Yahweh in obsolete terms, by all means take the grand-kids to see this big budget Hollywood production this summer. The next time they spend an hour or two in temple or church listening to religious texts, they can say "Yahweh? Hey, I heard about that dude! He was on the X-Men!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the best and worst of this film is captured in a single extended tangent. Following a dastardly assault by En Sabah Nur, our protagonists are kidnapped and taken to a remote mountain fortress. The kidnapping and subsequent breakout has no impact on the main story aside from slowing it down and drawing it out, and also allows for a cameo that even the most casual of fans will see coming a mile away. The scene is a narrative dead end that no one ever talks about ever again, robbing it of any possible value ? but it does get a small rise out of the audience.Really, what's most disappointing is how familiar this end of the world feels. Magneto floats with his arms out. People put fingers to temples. Nothing new to see here. Nothing more to say.</fullReview>

So, movie starts with the old time around 3000b.c. when one mutant trying to become immortal for that they having ceremony in between that humans interrupted the ceremony and every mutant got killed except this than he gone for long sleep. When he woke up after long sleep he started to control as many mutants as possible. So, some of mutants started working under him some are not. Forcefully he trying to kill or control every human that is why some of the mutant are against him. So, they fight and saved the entire human by that villain. After watching this movie I think there is little bit of repetition in this movie and upcoming parts of this movies series may have lots of repetition let's see how they come up with new idea. Although this movie story is so-so but the action is great as always if you are true fan of this movie series you should watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though it's much worse than "Days of Future Past" it was still a good movie. There were some themes that actually kept me interested. The Magneto story line was absolutely gorgeous. The action was violent and well performed. But all of this doesn't make it perfect. It was filled with idiotic one liners and there was a point in the movie where the CGI landscape looked like an "Overwatch" map. Apocalypse didn't actually spread his wings and his sidekicks were TERRIBLE! I was very hyped for Olivia Munn as Psylocke, but she had 3-4 lines in the whole movie! She and the Angel guy had no contribution to the plot and Storm was nearly as useless as them too. It was filled with plot holes and questions that cannot be answered with the sentence: "It's the power of the mutants" or something like this. But at the end of the day, "X-Men: Apocalypse" is an awesome and fun movie, which actually tries to expand into some deep themes which can make the audience think after the movie has ended.</fullReview>

While it was not in my opinion better than DOFP it still had a great story and lots of cool sequences. I am glad that they did not go overboard with this one like they did in The Last Stand. I think most people that like x-men well still think that it was a decent movie. Unless they just don't like the superhero thing. All the new actor and actress'd did a great job. There were though some parts in the movie that i thought should have gone by faster. Like some of the shots where a hero does something cool and we see him or her stand in glory is getting old and may have been over used in this film in my opinion. I liked the inclusion of history and the scenes with erik are my favorite.Micheal Fassbender stole the show for me again. As well as the new Scott and Jean Grey they did a marvelous job. There were some continuity issues that i saw with Storm but, whatever. Ill accept her accent for now. I do wish that i saw more from Olivia Munn's character, i felt like she was just there. I also wish they set up or fixed the passing of getting all the four horseman together. In this case the third one was not the worst, but it was still a great addition to the X- Men universe.</fullReview>

This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it! Apocalypse might not have been as good as First Class or Days of Future Past, but it certainly wasn't a stinker on the level of Last Stand, the way that most critics portrayed it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men story lines all pretty much revolve around the same theme: Humans fearing mutants and acting upon it irrationally, causing bad mutants to revolt and good mutants to attempt peace.We start off in 3600 B.C., with set pieces that showcase ancient Egypt as good as any we've seen since maybe The Mummy in 1999. Here, the first mutant known to man, En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (though his name doesn't seem to really be important), gets betrayed and trapped underground for centuries. This dude would've given me nightmares if I saw him as a child.Then we wind up in the 1980s, with some cool zeitgeists of the era. But not too much so that it becomes a nostalgia flick--though that wouldn't be too bad either. We catch up with our X-Men stars ten years after the events in X-Men First Class. We're introduced to a few new mutants and get most of our favorites back. Apocalypse gets awoken from his long sleep and decides to assemble a team to kill off humans--along with any mutant who stands in his way. The film does a great job of balancing a cornucopia of character's story lines. Everyone is accounted for, but wisely, most of the villains aren't touched upon that much--including Apocalypse. Some may argue that he lacks a unique incentive, but when you're the most powerful mutant ever and thirst for omnipotence, what other incentive do you need? But it does go beyond that. His philosophy is Hitler-esque in that he wants to destroy who he believes to be inferior beings. And he's given a sort of false-charisma that makes the fact that he has followers believable.The only other villain for which we get sufficient depth established is Magneto--perhaps the most compelling story in the whole X-Men saga--with only Wolverine's giving it a run for its money. Magneto walks the line between good and evil at times in the series, with his fantastic dynamic/friendship with Professor Xavier furthered upon even more in this film.The action doesn't feel empty and neither does the plot. The characters are enjoyable and we don't feel cheated out of anyone's backstory. But we don't feel forced into one either. The good thing about having multiple movies and prequels is that we trust that, in time, we will know each character's origin.X-Men: Apocalypse may not have the most radical of premises within the X-Men universe, but its a subject that is still treated with much realism and ongoingness--something other franchises don't do quite as well. The civil war battle thing has been a common theme among superhero movies this year, and X-Men does it best. Something of the grandest proportions is actually at stake. Heroes and civilization as a whole may actually be destroyed.It all makes this a solid installment in the series and maybe the best superhero movie this year (so far). Plus, its plethora of characters and a creepy antagonist make the movie engaging and not feel quite as long as it is. We needed some redemption after the slap-in-the-face time travel entry, Days of Future Past, nullified the stories in a franchise we've grown to appreciate. That was more of a cool idea in the moment, while this movie is an important idea.Oh, and we also get an esoteric post-credits scene, whose meaning will most likely be forgotten by the time the next film comes out anyway.Twizard Rating: 94</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but expected more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had a difficult task, trying to top 'Days of Future Past' which in my opinion is one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, while this film was good, it fails on many aspects that made the previous one so good.The acting here is very good, there is not one bad actor here. Michael Fassbender is the star performer here, the scenes in which he was the centre of, always turned out great. But I would go as far to say, we did not see enough of him. The movie follows the heroes more, but does do a great job at showing the threat of Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as the main villain was a brilliant choice. From the trailers and posters, I believed that he would be over the top, but instead he is intimidating. The story on the other hand, is not too compelling. X-Men, X-Men 2, First Class and Days of Future Past, have all had great stories. They were all perfectly paced, with enough going on to keep you both, invested in the main characters and everything else that's going on. This film is a mess. Some characters were a complete letdown, we were made to believe that they would be kick-ass, but instead they stood in the back not uttering a word. I would say that I was not greatly disappointed in Jennifer Lawrence character here, while she was important, I believed that she did not suit well in the hero role. Mystique is a villain, and she should stay that way. By having her being an hero this time around, does seem right.This film is not bad, the critics, yet again don't know what they hell they are doing, with their ridiculous reviews, but this is not even close to being as good as the other X-men films we have had. With the exception of Origins: Wolverine (shivers). Go see the film is you are a fan of the series, and you will possibly like it, but don't expect it to be as good as the last one.7.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of the X-Men Series &amp; the Latest in the addition is no different. It's a good follow up after First Class &amp; Days of Future Past &amp; has much more destruction.To be fair I would say I liked the movie because the 3d effects &amp; action sequences were excellent, However the story was weak as compared to the previous 2 movies. It's kind of getting repetitive in a sense that Magneto tries hard in each movie to be nice but situations make him choose to be the antagonist &amp; in the climax some moral sense prevails &amp; he chooses to be nice again.I hope the next movie in the series has a better story line that moves forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying and entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is a movie that while hated by many is also loved by many including me. It is not as good as batman v superman or civil war but it is entertaining and worth the price of admission. it never leaves you confused and the visual effects are mind blowing. It will give you a true look into the legendary characters of the X-Men and has been one of my favorite movies in 2016. This movie has humor, a great plot, character development and stays true to the source material and leaves you wanting to see the next movie. There is also some moments that make the characters human and tragic. They are shown to be viewed as they would in real life if they were to exist as they are hated and not trusted by many in the world that they live in. The villain is also very convincing and is an interesting figure in this movie. Overall, this movie is a 7/10 for me due to the reasons listed above.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse was very fun, but got quite messy at parts. X-Men fans will like this just like I did. it is a huge step down from Days of Future Past and has a pretty clichéd villain. I forgave the clichéd villain because of how cool and how frightening he was. Oscar Isaac did so good as Apocalypse. The characters are well developed, but some of them do not get enough screen time and some get to much. Angel, Psyloche and Storm have no motivation, there is no reason why they agreed to help Apocalypse destroy the world. What would they gain? Overall I thought the movie was good, I had a blast watching it and will be watching it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was far better than what I've been hearing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember where I heard it, but I heard this was going to be a bad film. To be honest, I don't blame people for saying this - there have been how many X-Men movies up until now and the most recent 'official' one was "Wolverine", which I heard from quite a few people that it was 'bad'. However, I did like the movie and the recent Marvel movie "Deadpool" also had a cameo by some X-Men in it. So that must count for something right? This new one I walked in as a skeptic and believe the movie came out a winner. The movie started out as something I can only describe as straight out of "Stargate" due to the heavy Egyptian, as well as science fiction technology involved. And to be honest, it even goes so far as to having the main villain transfer his consciousness to another 'host' so that he can live a long life. Sounds strangely like "Stargate" also. Anyway, as things go awry, we are sped up throughout the ages until we make it to the 1980s. The movie is not necessarily a sequel, but is actually a prequel. This is an entirely new cast, save for one cameo made by an X-Men character from the first three movies - I will not spoil it, but when 'they' make their appearance, it makes adds up - the movie actually has quite a few events that show why it leads up to the original X-Men trilogy in the first place. Is the movie good in this respect? As a prequel and form of micro-history, it is fantastic.The new cast has quite a bit of living up to do - these 'younger' characters are unsure of themselves, they have some 'teenage' quirks, and they otherwise do not have full mastery of their powers yet. I'm sure most of us as movie viewers want the final product, rather than a bunch of teenagers running around like "Mary Sues". That is okay, because the movie takes to the Mary Sue trope and abuses it. The X- Men have all of the 'goods', they just do not have access to all of them. Instead, we get to see the characters play around in the 80's version of the world, and they are in full form. More importantly, the characters take second stage at points as they are just discovering their powers, and it is the government that is running the show. It didn't work this way so much in the original trilogy when the mutants were becoming more common and the government was powerless to stop it.There were points, I will admit that the movie would qualify as 'lackluster'. These points are when the movie takes a series dip in the quality department - I'm used to Marvel movies over delivering; it doesn't change the fact this movie is better than a lot of movies. When the movie is good, it is good. There are a few sluggish moments - the speed mutant (for instance) gets about a five minute montage that seems to be -way- to played out and take -far- too long as he rescues everyone from an impending disaster. This is actually played to effect when he decides to... well, I won't spoil it. But it makes for a funny moment. But the point is; the movie doesn't have much of a build up - it is good from start to finish - as a prequel. It is probably of the same stuff the originally trilogy is and maybe I'm just a movie goer that has been spoiled by recent Avengers films.Originally posted to Orion Age (http://www.orionphysics.com/? p=11400).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad reviews "didn't get it".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the good old "if you didn't like it, you didn't get it" argument might not be the coolest way to go, but it is certainly a plausible theory as far as what the hell went down the weeks after this movies release. Singers last (so far) superhero epic is fantastic. Simply great. The villain is a CLASSIC superhero villain, with echoes that goes a long way back in the comics. I don't mean just Apocalypse; his mannerisms, his presentation, his dialogue, his written approach to a 'new reality' is such a nod to other villain story lines, that my nostalgiabutton was pressed and held for the duration of the movie, and perhaps a few hours more even. Same goes for the protagonist group. The new and younger additions to the X-Crew might have some slightly annoying connotations today, as the YA movies certainly have made youth extremely mundane and tedious. Though; quality always prevails, as I hope this movies legacy with time will help prove. Anyways. Stop the hate. Watch the movie. Again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! Good story with cool scenes and adorable characters:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie, the story line trace back to the last X-Men movie. At the very beginning, the scene in Egypt corresponds to the movie from the end of the last?X-Men, Days of Future Past, because of that, I got more excited when I started watching the new one.It is a whole new story, so people who have not watched the last one, even the whole series of X-Men movies, will be able to understand and really get into it. The title of this new X-Men movie is Apocalypse, who is probably the world's first mutant. He comes from the ancient Egypt, and used to reign the country with his four horsemen. His people try to rebel against him and put him to slumber for thousand years, but he raised again and try to bring destruction to the world because he thinks the world is going to the wrong direction?false Gods, politic power, and riches. He tends to cleanse the earth and be the dominant of the world. Therefore, he destroys the military weapons around the world through Professor X's mind-power.As a result, the world is under attack of Apocalypse. The main goal of the X-Men is to protect the human beings and save the world. There is definitely a coming war between Apocalypse and the X-Men. With this outline, people can find that there are more personal descriptions about some characters, such as Magneto, Storm, and Quicksilver. Those parts are also attractive, making me want to know more about them, and engaged me to the sets of their personal feelings.Generally, this movie is a really great choice for the X-Men's new audiences to watch. All the characters seem like they come to show for the first time, and they give the audiences enough information to catch up even though they only know a little bit of the former stories. The scenes of fighting and action are explicitly awesome, and it was also entertaining to see different mutants using their powers. I highly suggest people watching this movie. This new story is familiar but different because the story of X-Men series is changed by Wolverine when he goes back to the past in the last movie, Days of Future Past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably what I appreciate most is the great effects. Yeah, movies about superheroes are always known for a lot of effects, but they're not always this good. As far as I've noticed, in most movies the special effects have a lot of flaws. I watched this movie on 4DX and it was pretty good, I appreciated how good it looked visually. I liked the scenes from the different parts of the world, I'd say they're well-planned. When it comes to the plot, I like it that Ancient Egypt is involved, I find ancient civilizations intriguing. Other than that, in many ways it's a typical American movie about superpowers and world apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go.See.This.Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I've never written a review before, despite being a total movie junkie and a regular here on IMDb, just so you know HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS MOVIE..I tried to avoid any trailers, reviews, promos and interviews for this movie because I loved Days of Future Past (DoFP) so much I honestly believed nothing could top it so I kept my expectations to a minimum. Thank God I did. This movie cannot be described using just words, I give it 10/10 for literally EVERYTHING. It had me sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time, so let's get started.In the year 1983, ten years after the events of DoFP, we get a glimpse of the 'X-men' we know and love from the first three movies; first we see how the main characters, Charles, Eric, Raven (...etc), have been growing into them, and then are reintroduced to several familiar mutants, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm and NightCrawler (...etc) Now I really don't want to give anything away so let's just say the rest of the film takes you with them on an epic mission to save the world.Cast: I can't stress how much this cast excels at delivering all the emotional scenes with grace and simultaneously kicking-ass in the action-based ones. A few standouts to me were Michael Fassbenders' captivating portrayal of the ever-so-complicated Magneto (yet again) reminding us all why he was nominated for two Oscars, James McAvoy once again shines of compassion and wisdom as Charles Xavier, but takes his vulnerability and fear to the next level in this one, Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse was original and truly the ultimate villain, he's everything you hope for and more, Evan Peters doesn't disappoint as the funny Quicksilver, and is more than a comic relief this time, Sophie Turner did a great job playing Jean Grey; beautifully embodying her inhibition and quiet intelligence...what can I say the whole cast is phenomenal. Story and structure: The movie has so many elements and layers yet its surprisingly easy to follow, it starts off with a lot of different character story lines that all intertwine eventually. The story line kind of resembles DoFP in terms of giving you what you expect but also throwing in bits and bobs that you weren't expecting, keeping your eyes open. Clearly it was so carefully, well-edited to ensure you gain the most out of every little detail. Although there are a lot of X-men First Class flashbacks, you will be able to understand the film, but probably not appreciate as much, so I would recommend seeing that first. Cinematography and Music: Now this is why you see superhero movies in the cinema; to get the ultimate experience from all the action and excitement. Let me tell you there's a lot of CGI, but it's very well done, after all how can you create such an epic, literally 'end of the world' movie without a little bit of digital magic? In all honestly, I did not write this review to convince people to see this movie, even though they should, I wrote it out of pure love and appreciation for it; I couldn't stop thinking about how great it was, in fact if I were you I'd stop reading reviews and just go see the damn thing :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have been reading quite some reviews before deciding to write my own. My opinion? I think that this one was probably one of the best X-Men movies of all time. I mean, if you take out the first one that I watched when I was half my age now and I was amazed by it, I think the others are pretty much below this one. I read comments about the CGI, the costumes, etc. I am all for it. I also agree that the X-Men franchise has been struggling a lot with costumes and effects, more than someone would expect. I mean, we have seen nice CGI elsewhere that also looked as realistic as they can get (Deadpool for one). I can't understand why they can't make Psylocke look real when she is running on that rooftop in the final battle. This was disappointing as hell. And of course, it seems like Mystique was better off with CGI and not with this weird costume that looks like it came out of a cheap rental for Halloween. Other than that, the movie had the funny element, albeit not that much as avengers or deadpool of course, but it was nicely made. I completely digged the story about the first mutant and I liked it a lot (would be amazing to have this in ancient Greece, no?). The cast was good in their roles, although I would like to see someone else as Jean Grey. Sophie Turner did a great job but I think her looks just wasn't enough for me. I think that the previous Jean Grey cannot be surpassed. The scenario was really good also but I felt at times that the movie was too much spread out all over the place. Maybe keeping things more tight would be better for the movie. Overall, it had so much material that the easiest thing to do is to find loose ends. But that's beyond the point of such movies. For example, I also didn't like the fact that they magically build the house back and I don't think that their powers allow them to do such things, but anyways, I won't sit down and nag about the plausibility of such thing in a superhero movie!Looking at the movie afterwards, you can say lots of things and really go into details and miss the essence. My feeling while seeing it was that this is 8.5/10. I can't give halves, so I bump it down to 8 cause 9 seems too much. Apart from one or two scenes, I was truly immersed and I enjoyed every part. And of course, the nice connection in the end with the next movie was worth waiting for. This was a nicely done movie and it would be rated even higher if it wasn't so closely released with Deadpool or Civil War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost gave up going to theater after reading bad review from critic but after watching it, i wonder why i enjoyed it more than BVS &amp; Civil war .X Men Apocalypse showed how Dark &amp; Comedy can be in Same movie together which BVS failed &amp; Most Avenger film barely follow.Movie won't bored its audience &amp; it will keep the excitement alive with new event one after another .Its a perfect example of how Movie can have 2.25 hour long but still enjoyable every minutes of it .The acting was Super specially from Gene Gray Actress as a new comer &amp; don't forget the awesome part of Quicksilver .He really deserve a solo film,i can enjoy his moves almost 24/7 still won't feel bored .As usual Magnito &amp; profeesion xavior's acting is always deserve admiration.Critic talked about Other side kick of Apocalypso not having much dialogue .Well Most hire killing machine don't really have their own back story with tons of dialogue in most movies ,so why critics whine about that i don't understand .Critic also talked about how Apocalypso don't sound Evil .Well Apocalypso is a ruler &amp; his intention is to rule .He is not just a Joker of Bat Man .So critics failed again .I Actually loved how Apocalypso actually have a caring voice cz otherwise no one can force Magnito to join force .Maybe there could be different design of Apocalypso ,that is arguable but its not near to ruin a movie .Another Critic Whine is about Jennifer Lawrence(mystique) too much .Jennifer lawrence wasn't even in any major role till the middle of the movie .She Actually stayed on the side allowed other super hero to shine .Feel other super hero got more activity time than Jenifer lawrence If you got bored after Civil war &amp; BVS then Apocalypso can bring something different &amp; new .IT has so many thing to enjoy apart from the main story .I think some part of the movie will be remembered for long time in the future .It really brought the sudden underdog being the game changer to whole new level .I think its one of the best X men movie. i would rank it after First class(just cz i like cold war theme) but its as good as days of future past if not better.But Its has Some moments which No other X men even dare to Show ,which take this X men to another level</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations were low coming into this one so I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It was not perfect, a Bryan Singer X-men film is never going to be perfect at this point, but it did contain a lot of cool action and quite a few mutants. Sure, I was not happy when I initially saw that Storm, Magneto and Psylocke were three of Apocalypse's horsemen in the film when none of them were in the comics; however, the story of why those three joined worked enough that I am not quite as baffled as I first was. I was disappointed by the fact that Angel was a bit more underutilized again, not sure why they find it so difficult to do him, but he does have more of a part here than in the his other film, X-men: The Last Stand which this film takes a jab at. I thought that was uncalled for, I do not understand why everyone dislikes that one so much as that one still has some of the better action sequences and fight sequences of any of the X-men films. A lot of people have been panning this one too, but as I said, I enjoyed it as I was expecting to dislike it quite a bit more than I did. It did do some things I was not fond of, but for the most part this one delivered for me.The story brings us back to Egypt where a strange being with great powers is about to transfer his consciousness over to a person who has great healing ability. This process is interrupted by people who tire of this being, claiming he is a false god and they collapse the pyramid. Unfortunately, the false god is not killed, but only locked away in a sleep. Flash years later and we witness a young Scott Summers learning his amazing ability, Mystique still trying to rescue her fellow mutants and Magneto trying to live life as an ordinary man. Things begin to be set in motion; however, and soon Apocalypse has awakened and he immediately takes a young girl who controls the weather under his wing and gives her incredible powers. He also finds a young woman named Psylocke, Angel and Magneto and he begins his plans to destroy the world and create it anew! Only the new students at Xavier's school for the gifted stand in his way of world domination! Once again, Mystique plays an important role in this film and pretty much aligns with the good guys. Once again, this baffles me as she was never that important in the comic and she never really joined up with the X-men, at least not up to the point I was reading them. They did do a good job of giving Storm and Magneto reasons for joining Apocalypse, but I was kind of disappointed by the way Psylocke was depicted as my mother who had never read the comics assumed that she was a villain in the comics. She is a good guy and though she looks the most like her character than any other character depicted in a Singer film, he managed to make her look too villainous. Nightcrawler was done well and though I still think they do not make Scott as good as he was in the comics he was done better here than the rest of the films. He actually got some good hits in this time! Of course, Quicksilver was once again quick and the most funny of the characters.So this one was good, could have been better, but I will not complain too much. The film is rated PG-13, but it has to be a pretty hard PG-13 as there were some pretty graphic deaths throughout this one. It would not have taken much more to make it an R. It was nice to have a different villain this time in Apocalypse and from the post credit scene if they do another film it will be another villain in that film as well. Though next up will be the next Wolverine film and after that probably Deadpool before another X-men comes out; granted, Deadpool more than likely does not exist in this universe though his character is owned by Fox too. Not sure how he'd do in one of these films, but I do know he would want to be the one to drop the one F-bomb in a most likely PG-13 X-men film. This one was not perfect, but better than expected so overall I was happy with the result and not mad I dropped money to see it in the theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Apocalypse - Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse is the 4th superhero movie to come out this year and it's my personal favorite so far. It's also my favorite X-Men movie. To me it was what an X-Men movie should be. One of my criticisms of this movie is the way Apocalypse died. I mean, he can turn people into sand or whatever or does that not work on mutants? You can't really make a villain too powerful without it being stupid. Then again that's just my opinion. The Wolverine cameo was nice but it wasn't needed. The whole Striker thing just felt forced and unnecessary. The acting, CGI and action scenes were good. Seeing cities being destroyed was really cool. I recommend watching X-Men Apocalypse. It's a really good superhero film and can be enjoyed by everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's good. trust me.People have been slamming this movie left, right and center. When I entered the hall, I was expecting something not-so-good like B v S. I was waiting, and waiting to be bored or disappointed. Those didn't happen.It had good drama. I like what they did to Magneto. I like Wolverine's cameo. I hope Wolvie 3 would use that bit in Alkali Lake. Oh, there's Phoenix!!! (I told you there'll be spoilers) I had doubts of the 'new' Jean Grey. But in the end she looked GREAT!! Yes, Cyclops. A bit underused but still good in the end.OK, yes. Too many characters. Fans would really love to see them in action. But in 135 minutes, only so much could fit in. I would really love a chick (psi)fight between Jean and Psylocke. Oh God, I would really love to see more metal knives flying around. But,... I don't think we'll see that anymore. UNLESS...!!! Anyhow, X: A is a good movie. Don't listen to bad reviews.No, wait. Do read bad reviews like I did. It would be great to say that they were WRONG!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men is really an unusual franchise for Marvel. As an avid reader of Marvel during its breakout period fifty years ago, X-Men was a nice magazine but I would guess not one of their top sellers. Back then the talents were a little more modest, Cyclops and X-Girl were around along with Angel, Iceman and Beast (not blue). As a movie franchise I would guess X-Men is Marvel's top seller, they have gotten a lot of mileage out of the characters and have almost flawlessly crossed over to a younger cast (but for Wolverine). I have seen two or three of the most recent entries at the movies, but even though I have enjoyed them they are not something I die to watch again on cable.Which brings us to the most recent X-Men. Right off I have to say that Marvel excels at casting and the newer X-Men are no exception, the new Prof. Xavier (McAvoy) continues to be spectacular as does Fassbender as the Magnetic One. I thought the rest of the characters are done well also, including Peters as Quicksilver and a stunningly gorgeous Munn as Psylocke. The adversary for the X-Men is an ancient Egyptian mutant who seems too much to handle, the problem with these apocalyptic show-downs is that the next time out they sometimes feel they have to top it (ala Avengers I and II). This movie was not something I would necessarily see again (maybe?) but it never let up and me and my 11 year old never thought of leaving early, well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can Bryan Singer undo this movie, Please?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 10 minutes or so are quite exciting but what follows is not so much. Every time following that when things seem to start picking up The movie screeches to a halt again. What this movie is trying to do is reboot the X-Men again, bringing in the characters from the original Trilogy as their younger selves. I can't help but compare this to the much better movie X-Men: First Class which managed to not only introduce us to its cast of characters but also do so in a fun way.Take that scene in First Class where Havok was being trained to hit targets and fails miserably with some fitting music in the background. Nothing even remotely as fun happens in this movie.Magneto is back again, and this time he's playing a henchman for the main big bad Apocalypse and I could respect him as a bad guy a bit more if he wasn't so easily swayed in one direction or another.Some random humans kill his family? Magneto wants to destroy the world. A quick speech from Mystique? No longer wants to. Someone messes up his order at a restaurant? He wants to destroy it again. OK that last part didn't happen but its still pretty silly how he was handled.For some baffling reason they decided to bring back Moria from First Class; why? I still have no idea. It literally added nothing to the movie at all. Bryan decided to undo the sacrifice Prof X made at the end of the first movie for the sheer hell of it. He didn't stop there, though. He also undid the weight of the ending of the last movie too! Remember when in Days of Future Past Mystique prevented Wolverine from being taken in by Agent Stryker? Well he still ended up with him making that ending entirely moot.Sophie Turner was clearly miscast as Jean Grey, As much as I like her on game of thrones - she was not the right choice for the role. With her boring stare at Prof X as he telepathically cries for help. "Meh i'll do it in a minute after I apply some more make up!"The pacing of this movie is just horrendous, drags on way too long and when it finally gets to the action packed ending you no longer care.The worst of it is the movie didn't feel like it did anything new, even the Quicksilver part just felt like a copy of something that has been done better before.In summary, this is a poor followup to X-Men: First Class and Days of Future Past. Its slow, boring and completely devoid of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather than going after the negative comments of some people,i would like to write my own review.Before 3 months, I watched the movie, I had read all the reviews coming about it. Mostly negatives. And, as the release date approach I kinda had doubts about this last installment. But I went ahead, because I love the casts and Bryan Singer. To my surprise, after I had watched it, my mind were still in awe from the movies. It's not as bad as the critics said. Sure, I am agree with those reviews regarding Apocalypse. But it is so forgivable because the X-men do a heck of a job getting rid of him. As for the fact that there are a lots of characters in there that made them seem a bit underdeveloped because lack of backgrounds,well you gotta admit that this is a 144 minutes movie, which could barely explains all those stories. I left the movie Theatre feeling heartbroken by some of the things that happened in the movie. Hats off to Sophie Turner. She did a great job! Well if you love X-men franchise, you'll love this one.So guys!Watch once with positive viewpoint.Definitely ,you will find some nice things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not going to be a long review, i want to summarize my thoughts on the film, now after i just saw it in the cinema.The movie is absolutely spectacular. The effects, the settings, the pacing, the acting, the music, the direction. It is all very well done, and if the story itself had kept up with the rest, this would be close to one of the best, if not the best, superhero film to date.But the story is a bit weak, it's hard to take in a few of the twists and turns in this film, but still everything else is so brilliantly crafted, the movie pulls it off anyways, and that makes me feel i got my moneys worth. This is very important to me when i go the cinema. I need to walk out feeling i was entertained.I'm usually the guy that puts story and script first when it comes to films. Way to often when the story is bad, the script and the acting and all the rest that follows almost always seem half done. This is not the case here.This movie is like when you bake a cake, and you end up putting in a small amount of salt instead of sugar. You notice you did, but you don't have time to fix your mistake, so you bake the cake to the best of your abilities anyways. At the end it's one hell of a spectacular looking cake you made, but people notice the taste is a bit off, but somehow the added salt contributed to the flavor in a good way, and the cake was very much edible.This is how i feel after seeing this film. It is really well crafted, and i do recommend people seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Franchise is Running Out of Steam...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After immensely enjoying the turn the X-Men franchise took after the disappointment of X-Men: The Last Stand, I was pretty excited to see this movie. I love comics, but I never got into the X-Men, so I can excuse some of the inaccuracies that seemed to upset hardcore fans. I just enjoyed the movies.X-Men Apocalypse is the weakest film since duds like Last Stand and Wolverine Origins. It just didn't have a whole lot going on. One of the biggest critiques of Marvel (yes, I know X-Men films aren't produced by Marvel Studios, but I'm speaking of the publisher of the original medium) is that their villains are lackluster. The big baddie through the whole franchise has been Magneto, easily the most charismatic and entertaining Marvel villain on film. Though we've had brushes with Stryker and Trask and his sentinels, this is the first movie in which the X-Men had taken on a true super villain who wasn't Magneto-- Wolverine vs. The Silver Samurai aside. But it's almost like director Bryan Singer painted himself into a corner with Apocalypse. The villain was too powerful and could have easily achieved his goals without the help of his "four horsemen." He could have ended the world, in mere minutes, all by himself. But, of course, that would make a boring movie, so Singer and Co. had to figure out what to do with the world's most powerful and dangerous mutant for two hours before the final climax was to begin.There were scenes where the villains were literally sitting around the desert talking about how they were going to lay waste to a city on the horizon. There were scenes where the most powerful of the villains went out recruiting much less powerful villains to join him. Really, Singer just didn't know what to do with this character. How do you create conflict and drama when the bad guy is just too powerful? Well, you can't. Of course, after two hours of watching the most powerful mutant ever talk about what he is going to do (instead of simply doing it) he finally unleashes his fury. Except that, the X- Men actually have the most powerful mutant in the world on their side in Jean Grey.So, again, why is Jean not simply destroying Apocalypse in the first 10 minutes of the movie? Because, running time needs filler.And that's basically what this movie is: Filler. They came up with a concept that would make the storytelling aspect problematic. And rather than tweaking the concept or fleshing out the story with subplots, they just assumed explosions and superhero fights would be enough to carry the film.They weren't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sacrifices thematic depth and complex characters for superficial thrills and repetitive plots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "apocalypse" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this "new trilogy" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey. Thankfully the masterful execution of dialogue and acting chops saves this film from sinking into mediocrity.There are lot of plot threads to follow. Fortunately or unfortunately it does not require much inferring or complex thinking to follow the story. It is very simple and it is in its simplicity that it loses out on the richness of character than past xmen movies had. Our characters are all reduced to two dimensional archetypes each with familiar story arcs. So familiar in fact that the whole movie is a pastiche of plot points taken from past xmen movies. Eric is the grief stricken blood knight who goes evil with vengeance when tragedy strikes, again. Scott jean and Kurt are the inexperienced loners who have to work together to overcome their challenges, a little like pyro, Bobby drake (ice man) and kitty pryde (shadow cat) in X-men 2. Mystique replaces wolverine as the badass wanderer who is thrown into a leadership position to guide our young loners. Xavier is once again captured and the X-men's home base is compromised, again like X-MEN 2. Powerful mutant with delusions of godhood and a gang of loyal followers is Apocalypse this time replacing magneto's role in the first 3 xmen movies. Call it homage or call it cliché, I feel that this story manages to toe the line between familiar and fresh. The familiar elements gives us a sense of the revolving nature of conflict, that history repeats despite the best intentions. The fresh elements of course add new facets to a film which could have otherwise been a complete bore, thanks to the slow burn nature of the plot which mostly sees both good guys and bad guys gathering their key players for the final showdown. Those who can appreciate a slow build up would love this while those who need their immediate action fix would be left disappointed.Divisive might be the best word to describe this movie. When the action does come, it is a special effects spectacle of mutant powers on display where everyone.......pretty much stands around shooting things at each other. Oh look, the villain is getting the upper hand! Let's shoot more! Where physical stunts and fights come, they are a thrill to behold except the dated wire work which feels artificial. Interspersed between these divisive battles are particular scenes of movie magic. Quicksilver (last see in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST) returns and we get to see the full extent of his powers once again only on a larger scale. And at least this time he has a purpose in the story other than being a just a miraculous attempt. But as mentioned earlier his motivations are touched on but not explored. His character is simplified into yet another archetype.Beneath the visual spectacle, the movie under utilises its cast of characters. Ty Sheridan's Scott Summers could have been great as the new audience surrogate, going from meek bullied loser to taking his first steps as confident leader of the X-Men. Instead he is also shoved into the background after his introduction. Kodi-smith mcfee's more feline looking Nightcrawler is also another intriguing character sidelined. Instead we get more Charles Xavier and more Eric playing out their character drama like star crossed lovers. Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic actors, especially Michael Fassbender completely nailing the tragedy of Eric's character arc. But their story came to a decent close in the last movie and this one just feels like more of the same.Apocalypse himself is a villain that is as equally divisive as the movie itself. On one hand, it seemed that the creators were going for the "all powerful but frail" type of villain ala emperor Palpatine of Star Wars. The snake-like menace that Oscar Isaac exudes through his sinister delivery is betrayed by a design that borders on corny. Oversized platform boots, plastic looking Armour and an ill defined set of powers all downplay the threatening presence of the villain. His motivations could have been much deeper. A commentary on modern commercialism replacing the religions of old perhaps as the new "cult following"? Or a criticism of humanity's arrogance and self glorifying nature? Maybe even a critique on how common folk are quick to idolise mortal "false gods" of the influential and powerful? No, no and no. None of that thematic depth here. Apocalypse is merely your Saturday morning cartoon variety villain who wants to destroy the world to rebuild in his image.It is not a bad movie per se. Visually stunning, an easy-to-follow plot and well cast characters set to a script filled with witty dialogue that does not overdo the comedy. The acting is professional and the music by John Ottman is a grand thematic continuation of But for a grand finale it pales in comparison to films like X-MEN 2 by glossing over its deeper themes of social commentary especially, in the treatment of mutants as an allegory to prejudice against social minorities. It lacks the urgency, high stakes tension and emotional depth of DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and the chemistry among the cast is no where near XMEN FIRST CLASS. I would place it as a middling entry into the X-men franchise that succeeds in opening the doors to a whole new generation of X-men movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not dull, but way too convoluted and busy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest in the ever-growing X-Men franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse (2016, **) is generally okay. There are several problems with it that will be noticed by even someone who's just vaguely familiar with the characters. There are too many story lines and too many characters. There are plot holes. The plot is also staggeringly familiar. Continuity with the earlier films is almost nonexistent.It's all about the first (apparently) mutant, En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac). We meet up with him in ancient Egypt as he's somehow transferring his consciousness into a new body, seeing as how his current one's decrepit. Then there's a rebellion, the transference doesn't quite take, and everyone's buried under rock and sand for centuries. Until the present, when an undercover CIA agent (don't ask) wanders to a subterranean lair in Cairo but doesn't cover up the entrance with a carpet, thus allowing the sun to come in and revive En Sabah Nur, who then proceeds to kill people with his mind and recruit mutants.Meanwhile! In eastern Europe, Magneto, I mean Eric Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) is living the simple life as a factory worker with a doting wife and a little girl, which certainly means bad things will happen, as they do. (This is set after he tried to kill the president but was stopped by Mystique.) Short story long, Magneto flips the heck out, has a crisis of conscience, kills people, and flees. But not before shouting, "What do you want from me?" to the heavens. He's recruited by En Sabah Nur (who, by the way, is the Apocalypse of the title). En Sabah Nur's plan is to destroy Earth and build a new society, in other words the same as countless other villains.And because En Sabah Nur is such a strong mutant, he's able to get into the mind of one Charles Xavier ? manipulate him, in fact. Which allows En Sabah Nur to find all the mutants he needs, and which also gives director Bryan Singer a chance to bring out a plethora of X-characters, like Storm, Psylocke, Cyclops, Beast, Angel, Havoc, Mystique (of course), and Jean Grey. Most of these characters were in earlier X-Men movies, but now they're all different ages. I don't mean different just from the other movies, I mean different relative to each other. Like in an earlier movie, two characters might be about the same age, and here they're suddenly a generation or so apart.X-Men: Apocalypse isn't dull, but it's way too convoluted for the franchise. It's almost as if no one thought there'd be any more of these films after this one, so they had to cram everyone in. The result ? too many characters; a winding, tortuous plot; story lines with no real resolution; and general incoherence. It's a kitchen sink approach that just never works. Some actors fare well, such as Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Evan Peters as Quicksilver (who, incidentally, has the best scene in the movie, hands down). Some mail it in, like McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique). Some try their best, like Isaac and Fassbender. And some seem ill-equipped and over their heads, like Sophie Turner, who plays the indomitable (but young) Jean Grey. Turner is really wooden.</fullReview>

For example (spoiler**) Storm originally meets Nightcrawler in X-Men 2, but all of a sudden meets him for the first time in this movie now!? Huh!? Also, Jean's time line is all screwed up from this movie as well.

		<fullReview>En Sabah Nur is Apocalypse, the first mutant who ruled ancient Egypt until he was entombed. It's the 80's. CIA agent Moira MacTaggert goes to Egypt and witnesses his emergence. He recruits his four horsemen Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Angel giving them greater power. Meanwhile, Raven recruits Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler from an East Berlin fight club. Alex Summers brings his younger brother Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's school. Quicksilver arrives at the school just in time to rescue almost everybody from an explosion but Professor X is kidnapped by Apocalypse.I really like the first half. There are some good introduction of the new characters. It's working fine for the most part. It hits the pinnacle with Quicksilver's rescue which is funny and exciting. It is visually dynamic and a joy to behold. The rest of the movie feels like a long slow slide into mediocrity.The most troubling problem for the continuing franchise is the use of Mystique as the leading X-Men. That character has never been in that role. JLaw is struggling to put out the intensity to match the central part. She and her character is not up to the task so far. It's also funny that her powers is to not be JLaw. The other problem is Apocalypse. I hoped for better but his mega-destruction is underwhelming. It's a lot of bland and his powers are nebulous. I actually think it would have been better to allow Apocalypse to be a two-parter. As an one-and-done villain, he isn't allowed to be anything more than a monster of the moment. With a lower level of power from him, it could be more compelling to struggle for the soul of each horseman. As it stands, the character Apocalypse is nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something old, something new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Third one is always the worst' says Jean Grey when leaving the theater after watching Return of the Jedi back in '83. She was right about that one, and conscious or unconscious (I doubt the writer intended for this movie to be the weakest in the second X-trilogy), she's also correct about X-Men: Apocalypse. However, also like Return of the Jedi, Apocalypse still is a whole lot of mutant fun for those who didn't expect the franchise to reach new heights anyway.Granted, it's not the story that provides the mirth, since it's the stuff of repetition, variations on themes and lack of narrative evolution. Basically, another all-powerful mutant rears his head and threatens to destroy the world for mankind so that its stronger successors can take over. And once again, the X-Men, fighting for peace between man and mutant, must get together to stop this megalomaniacal scheme from becoming reality. This time, it's not Magneto who has hatched the diabolical plan, but rather a 5,000 year old ideological predecessor, an ancient Egyptian once worshiped as a god, with the modern moniker Apocalypse. Magneto, once more masterfully performed by Michael Fassbender, merely provides some muscle to help Oscar Isaac's semi-god with his evil shenanigans. Isaac does a decent job playing an age old villain, but he's no Fassbender and his Apocalypse is nowhere near as intimidating or intriguing as the much more relatable Magneto.Still, the villain suffices for the cause of bringing together two generations of X-Men, the First Class lot and the new batch of young recruits, including novel takes on classic X-characters Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler. Their performances and their chemistry make us hopeful for the future of the franchise, should the studio feel like using them for the next installment Apocalypse seems to be building up to. For although it's meant as a conclusion to a trilogy, the ground work is amply laid for more to come and these young stars succeed in making us curious about what lies ahead. The new additions to the cast are aided by snappy dialogue and light humour, making the shortcomings in the plot not nearly as blatant as they would have been in lesser hands. Nevertheless, it's clear director Bryan Singer, who has made his fourth X-movie with this title, has run out of ideas for the X-universe. Though we appreciate his work on both trilogies, new blood would be equally welcome in the creative room as it proved in the cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Some believe that the first mutant was born thousands of years ago. He was some kind of god, and he's going to rise again." Years after the events of the last movie the X-Men members have gone their own way and are no longer the group they once were. Eric (Fassbender) is living life quietly in Poland with a wife and daughter. Charles is still running the school and training new students every day. Things are going smooth until an ancient evil is awoken and the future of the world is threatened. Once again the X-Men must band together to save the world, but this time things get complicated because Eric is fighting against them. After watching Days of Future Past I said that they should end this franchise. The time line aspect was so perfectly done and I felt that any further movie would ruin what was done. I have really like the Newer X-Men movies and even though I thought they shouldn't have made more I still went to see this one. Once again I have to admit that I was wrong. I loved First Class and didn't know how they could do better, and they did with Days of Future Past. This one tops both of those as well. The movie is funny, tense, has a strong grip on reality while still being a comic book movie. The cast is so perfect in this and the new additions are seamlessly added and really add to the feel and excitement. It is very hard for a series to consistently top itself but this one pulls it off perfectly. The sequel curse seems to be missing this series all together. Do yourself a favor and watch this today. Overall, once again, this movie tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I give this an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best x-men movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie gave everything I expected from it, and more. This movie is better than the old one, the old one sucks. they made the cast perfect for their characters, the costume are amazing (love storm's hair), the cgi is awesome. They add more character like psylocke, angle, young storm, young jean grey, nightcrawler, jubille and many more The most favourite one for me is quicksilver he's awesome and apocalypse is really awesome too. I think the old x-men franchise is not part of the new universe, because they changed character origins tooIf you want to watch this movie you have to watch x-men first class and x-men days of future past. Some people says that this movie was a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that the X-men series is one of the most popular Marvel series in the world, this film does not live to the standards in my opinion.4 key points that attracted me to the series in the first place when X-men went mainstream:- Character development - Story line - Suspense - ActionI did not see non of that in the new installment. Instead they dragged the film for too long with only very few action scenes.This is X-Men for goodness sake, there should be action and suspense in every single corner of the film!!!I've never fallen asleep in a cinema before... So I guess this shows how engaging the film was to it's viewers. Please note that I was not the only one that fell asleep that day.I'm struggling to keep interested in the series from performances like this.I expected more from this film, hoping it will be as successful as the Avengers series. massive disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming ... but has some moments for the fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie... However it's going to be difficult to write a review that doesn't dwell on the negatives.First things first: the plot is way too simplistic. Introduce bad guy, gather protagonists, gather antagonists, fight. That's literally it. One could say it's a good change of pace from the way- too-complicated-for-their-own-good other superhero offerings seen recently but in this case it feels flat and linear.The cast is basically the same as X-Men: First Class. Magneto / Fassbender and Xavier / McAvoy are still good but it feels like Jennifer Lawrence doesn't want to be here? She's supposed to be jaded in this movie but plays the jaded Mystique maybe a little too well...? In terms of characters: Quicksilver is still the greatest speedster ever on the small or big screen; Bravo to Synger on his interpretation of ultimate speed and how that could basically make you almighty. Well done.The rest of the characters are somewhat disappointing: the X-Men offer so many possibilities but it looks like we are limited to that leather look introduced by Synger 15 years ago. He invented the modem super hero movie look but now he is limited to the style he invented? The costumes are a bit ridiculous and Apocalypse is the best illustration of that: Oscar Isaac looks a bit odd...kind of off. And you get that across Psylocke and her way too small panties look, angel's techno wings etc etc. Today, the X-Men could look better. And don't get me started on the blue gang (Beast and Diablo don't feel real; they really never did...)For the good: a lot of Easter eggs and fan service. The Wolverine scene is fantastic for those who know the source material. The end fight is satisfactory... but it's difficult not to be underwhelmed.The X-Men need to be reinvented on the silver screen. Fox needs to go back to that glimpse that First Class offered and that was forgotten too soon after. We need something new; no more "Magneto is not a bad guy really!" " But he kills" that we've been served for 15 years. Time for a reboot. The source material is great and deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse, where we get the X-Men another full ten years later (also still have barely aged a day since First Class, but whatever, movie), and now the stakes are GLOBAL! It's time for a blue-skinned Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie villain steps up to bat to take over everything to "cleanse" humanity, and take on his four horsemen/women for this apocalypse while the X-Men sort of race to stop him (I say sort of since they get captured at one point).This movie is... a movie, that exists. It's the textbook definition of an "eh" experience. I didn't hate it, there's actors in it still trying and working their butts off to dig deep into characters they've been in for three movies now (McAvoy and Fassbender come off best, Lawrence is sometimes in it and sometimes not), and there's new people (Sophie Turner for one) who are trying as well. But what they're given is... minuscule, too little, and too undercooked. This is the kind of movie that features both Beethoven's 7th symphony/2nd movement and it made me think of the Nic Cage flick Knowing and how *that* used the song better (which wasn't much at all), and then uses at another point Metallica's "Four Horsemen" because, hey, title! These may sound like small points, but they're what I latched on to while watching this. It's a plot that is both stupid and rehashed not only from other X-Men movies but from other movies in general. The End of the World OMG scenario doesn't cut it anymore (not that Fox will stop if Independence Day 2 is any indication, but I digress). And unlike the previous two films which were rich in character and motivation and using the period they're set in - 62 and 73, the height of Cuba and Nixon - there's not much here to distinguish it from the 80's aside from the obvious Thriller jacket and Star Wars reference (which is so out of place I'd wish that Kevin Smith could come and smack Singer across the face).Here's my analogy for X-Men: Apocalypse: if you're the kind of person who likes to go to Burger King, and you haven't had a Whopper in a little while and you go to the local Burger King and get a Whopper that's been sitting around for half an hour - so it's not inedible for it's not cooked fresh - and you eat it and go "Well, it's a Whopper," and don't ask them to cook you a fresh one and take what you've received and don't ask for anything else... well, you might be fine with this movie. But it's the textbook definition of a movie with a ton of great actors without a good story.Also, if you happen to love Oscar Isaac as he's one of the most magnetic personalities in American film right now... this is a stunning low for him as a character to play. He has NOTHING here, compared to this Poe Dameron in Star Wars is Michael Corleone as far as complexity goes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine chapter in the X-Men saga!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse is another fine chapter in a franchise that director Bryan Singer brilliantly setup in 2000, and returned with the excellent Days of Future Past in 2014. Yes, it may be a CGI heavy action-adventure but it's bold, effortlessly mixing action, characterisation, social commentary and mythology that we have come to expect from this saga.With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan. Set in the 1980s ? several years after the events in Days Of Future Past that revealed the existence of mutants to the world ? we find Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) continuing with his School For Gifted Youngsters, as he welcomes new students (Sophie Turner's Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan's Cyclops, and Kodi Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler) who are coming to terms with their powers. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is still conflicted as she seeks out other mutants, while Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is hiding in Poland with his wife and child. Soon, however, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wakes from a centuries-long sleep to find weak, blind leaders ruling the world. He gathers together Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto, using their fear and anger to convince them that humanity's time is up.With so much going on, it's incredible how Singer's cast of young and old fit so well together. Several of the returning characters are given time for emotional scenes, while new mutants are given room to breathe as the young, vulnerable yet heroic students. On top of the characters already mentioned we have Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/Beast; Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver; Lana Condor as Jubilee, Lucas Till as Alex Summers/Havoc, Josh Helman as William Stryker; Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert and last but not least, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine gives a show stealing scene to remember. All the cast deliver performances ranging from good to great. Michael Fassbender once again portrays his intense inner struggle perfectly. Jennifer Lawrence, on the other hand, looks and sounds like she'd rather be elsewhere.For the most part, the movie isn't afraid to take it's time, setting up the young heroes and catching up with the old guard. With a runtime of 2 hours and 24 minutes, i certainly felt the pace drag at times. It's kind of expected since the X-Men movies are known to be more talky and intellectual than others. Overall the tone is dark, dealing with heavy themes of loss and inner conflict. And yet, unfortunately, there is goofy comic relief crammed in for those who fall asleep too easily. Although in the third act the CGI felt overblown, the action scenes are stunning visual eye candy. Nightcrawler vs Archangel, Cyclops vs Storm, and Beast vs Psylocke are jaw droppingly good. No shaky-cam or over editing here, just intelligent, well framed direction that's easy to follow without trying too hard.X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an end and a beginning. It ties up what's came before with what's ahead. Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughan continue to inject fresh ideas with familiar elements, building an unpredictable universe with deep stories, creative visuals and fantastical characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X -Men: Apocalypse is a superhero film and the ninth installment on the X-Men film series. It is directed by Brian Singer with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Nile Valley, 3600BC: mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is revered as a god by the Egyptians, but his growing power proves to be his downfall, at least for a few millennia, as a group of concerned humans successfully carry out a plan to trap him under a collapsing pyramid. Cut to the 1980s, and Apocalypse is finally released from his tomb, recruiting several misguided mutants (including Storm and Magneto) as his followers in order to achieve world domination.There's an awful lot going on in this latest X-Men adventure, so much so that it's a little too much to take in at times. As a result, the storytelling suffers a little, but not enough to prevent this from being another fun addition to the franchise (my favourite superhero series by far). Not as mind-blowing as Days of Future Past, but still a very entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Evan Peters as Quicksilver once again steals the show with another awesome display of his super speed abilities, rescuing the mutants of Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted from a massive explosion, but there is plenty else to wow the senses, the film packing in lots of slick set-pieces, including the spectacular opening 'pyramid collapse' scene, Magneto (Michael Fassbender) pushing his powers to the limit, and Wolverine on the rampage (an uncredited cameo from Hugh Jackman).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Olivia Munn as very sexy villainess Psylocke, the neat jibe about the third film in a series always being the worst, and for including Metallica's The Four Horsemen on the soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse (2016): Dir: Bryan Singer / Cast: James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Sophie Turner, Oscar Isaac: End of the world is upon us with the release of ancient mutant Apocalypse. His plan is to wage war on humankind and destroy the planet in favor of rebuilding a new one. James McAvoy returns as Professor Xavier whose ability to invade one's mind is a prime target of Apocalypse. Michael Fassbender as Magneto deals with another loss as his attempt to blend in with humanity is countered with the death of his wife and daughter thus making him a prime target for Apocalypse's arguments against mankind. What is unfortunate is the amount of time we see Jennifer Lawrence on screen verses her change into Mystique whereas in the original series we rarely saw Rebecca Romijn. This is all about celebrity status and less about character. Sophie Turner as the troubled Jean Grey who struggles to maintain control of her powers and foresees what is to come. Oscar Isaac plays the monstrous Apocalypse whose power and ability to descend through centuries is due largely to his ability to manipulate his followers. He will increase their powers but only to his benefit. Bryan Singer returns as director and is backed with a decent screenplay and explosive special effects but the results are far from special. With the exception of the constant reminder of Lawrence's celebrity presence the casting is fine and many of the mutant characters compelling, including a cameo from Wolverine. The result is an entertaining film that will work on the imaginations of hardcore fans. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apocalypse of the X-Men Franchise? - X-Men: Apocalypse Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the 2016 summer-movie season kicking off with Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, Fox's X-Men: Apocalypse jumps into theaters this Memorial Day weekend. In 2014, Fox struck gold on Memorial Day with X-Men: Days of Future Past, receiving remarkable reviews among critics and audiences and earning over $100 million over the four day weekend. Fox wishes to do the same this year with Apocalypse, but I am ambivalent if the latest installment in the X-Men franchise can achieve the same success that it mustered two years ago with Days of Future Past. The movie centers around the X-Men's battle with Apocalypse, the first mutant in X-Men history. Apocalypse is reborn in 1983 and sees that the mutants and people of the world follow blind leaders and they are distracted by the increasing globalization, cosmopolitanism, and militarism of the world. I thoroughly enjoyed these themes and how they were implemented into the film. Who would have thought that a superhero flick would deal with themes like this? Additionally, I enjoyed the continuous theme of how the X-Men are supposed to fit in with society and how this relates to minorities and the civil-rights movement of the real world. One of my main issues with the movie was the film's run time. With a length of nearly two hours and thirty minutes, I was constantly checking the time on my phone to see when the film was over. This X-Men movie was a pretty rudimentary film and followed the same formula of the other movies. The final fight scene of the movie was very entertaining even though it did not make a lot of sense. Furthermore, while there was fan service from the comic books that I deeply enjoyed seeing, most of it was unnecessary and only prolonged the movie. The new members of the X-Men in this film felt wasted, some of which are vital to the story in the comic books. I was disappointed with the overall story of the movie considering the previous installment was one of the best comic book movies ever created. Yet, despite the rigid story line and the lengthy run time, movie was probably the most entertaining comic-book movie I have ever seen. I do not think this movie is the apocalypse of the X-Men franchise, I suggest Fox takes a hard look at what they will be adapting next and make sure they focus more on the story rather than the aesthetics.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film and would recommend it as one of the better films of late. Anyone who has read my other reviews will see that I am a harsh critic of dull, unintelligent films of which I have seen far too many of late. I loved Apocalypse's ability to boost the power of other mutants and who can also resurrect himself via other mutants whilst at the same time gaining their powers. Unfortunately some of the other powers he demonstrates are laughable; like plastering people into walls. Anyway here you have a well-paced film where mankind gets breather from Apocalypse by interrupting the resurrection process trapping him in limbo. Fast forward to now and lo and behold he gets free again and the stage is set for another good v evil ending, but what x-men story doesn't have this? Nevertheless and despite knowing this, the film builds to a fine climax. It is a shame that the ultimate victory over Apocalypse was so predictable. I would have preferred to see it play out as follows:- Have Apocalypse take Xavier's powers then find that Jean Grey has more but in attempting to get hers inadvertently releases 'Phoenix' who wipes him off the face of the earth, followed by the saving of Professor Xavier by some means (possibly using 'wolverine's' recovery powers. What do you think? Afterthought: It is such a pity that special effects have become so dominant these days because it clearly makes it harder and harder to outdo what has come before and there is little that is refreshingly new here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Apocalypse is a movie where an Egyptian god-like mutant seeks and desires world domination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was worried for this movie when it was announced, partially due to the build up of X- Men's previous movie Days of Future Past. Because of DOFP success, expectations were probably building up for its next movie. And because that the original X-Men movie director Bryan Singer was directing it. I had my hopes and my concerns for X- Men: Apocalypse and when the movie came out and as I was watching it, my disappoint grew larger and larger. My first problem with this movie is the pacing. The pacing of this movie was so unusually constructed. The exposition was poorly given, and the backstory of the movie executed poorly (although it is significant enough for audiences to understand). Each scenes also seemed to stretched to unnecessary time lengths. Characters seems to just be popping out of nowhere just for the sake of the plot. The lines of certain characters seem to just be made up as the movie's going along. Almost as if the actors were improvising, trying to come up with lines that fits the plot, when in reality it just strays away from it. Acting was pretty decent, not bad, but not good either. Just a tasteless odor in your mouth, that's just overall...okay. Plot chemicals from previous X Men movies were brought back in such obvious manner that made me go "Ugh, not this again?" And frankly, anyone that watched other films could've seen the ending from a mile away. They were only a "finger-full" of scenes that were quite enjoyable to watch. For an example: the Quicksilver scene was once again quite spectacular. For those who've seen the kitchen scene in DOFP, think of that times two in this movie. It was really astonishing to see how Quicksilver reacts to a larger environment in that scene whereas in DOFP it was in a closed space. There were some "heartfelt" scenes with Magneto in them which contributed to the plot quite well. Final Verdict: A mediocre, mid level 7.4/10 This movie isn't the worst X Men movie up to date. Considering other terrible films of X Men such as Wolverine Origins or The Last Stand. But seeing other Marvel fanboys's reviews, I've decided to give a piece of my mind to give a honest review. This movie is not a terrible watch, but if you're not too into superhero movies or at least getting disappointed, don't watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good (But Not Great) Chapter in the X-Men Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the X-Men since I first read the "Age of Apocalypse" comics in the mid-90's, and as such I was intrigued by this film. I've of course seen all of the X-Men movies leading up to this point, which put me at an advantage over someone who wanders into this film blind.This is a reasonably good movie. The whole Egyptian element of Apocalypse's background and the setting for much of the film doesn't really work for me (it makes for a strange hybrid between comics and Egyptian mythology, in my view), but the movie is faithful to its source material in this regard. Similarly, the story is a bit convoluted, but that, too, is something that has precedence in the comic books.That said, there's much to like about this movie, from its reasonably good acting and its well done CGI effects, along with a good script overall. This is not a bad movie, by any stretch.However, there is something about this film that is hard to articulate that is simply bothersome. My biggest problem with the X-Men franchise at this stage is that it has become hackneyed. The previous installment, "Days of Future Past", reset much of the story's timeline so that a new generation of actors could bring us new stories to the big screen, which is great--the new cast is off to a nice start.And yet, this film feels very much like a direct sequel to "X-Men: First Class", a film which is itself five years old this year. And "Apocalypse" features so many references to previous films (including a clever self-deprecating dig at "Last Stand") that the movie takes on the feel of the latest chapter in a t.v. series more so than a feature length film. That serial nature of this film, and others in the series, is both the franchise's trademark feel and yet also takes away from the individual films as standalone movies.All this said, I'm going to give this movie 7/10 stars. It's well made and fun--a good popcorn movie, as they say. But it's not outstanding. Worth seeing if you're an X-Men fan or a comic book fan in general, but not mandatory viewing for those who are just fans of good movies, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once I released myself from my self proclaimed comic book opinions of how First Class ruined the timeline, I was able to thoroughly enjoy Days of Future Past. Seeing Apocalypse as the next hurdle, I was super excited for this movie. I can say I was not disappointed. I enjoyed the story line and there was tons of action. They managed to avoid the trap of comic books movies of late, re-telling of origin stories and they still managed to introduce new characters and allow for further development of others. I look forward to the future as well. I could nitpick but I would rather allow myself to enjoy as much as possible. Obviously I have questions about some things but hopefully they will be answered in the next few movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On Saturday, I went with a friend to go see X-Men: Apocalypse because I needed to spend some time out of the house and with my friend I haven't seen in a while. I did see DOFP in the cinema as well and I highly enjoyed that one, although I don't remember much about it other than that fantastic Quiksilver scene and the ending, and I highly enjoyed this one as well! What makes this X-Men interesting is that it revolves around different themes and other items in storytelling than in most superhero films released in this day and age, and for some, it might be easy to confuse or frustrate. But I appreciate this new brand of storytelling in this film, I think what any comic book movie should do is make you think to make it unique in its own way, and this film does that to make it something genuinely special. Oh, by the way- Oscar Isaac NAILED it as Apocalypse, he's so intimidating to the point where I would watch it solely because of him! And although all of the action sequences are so much fun, there are two of them that stole the entire movie for me- if you thought Quiksilver's scene in DOFP was amazing, you ain't seen nothing yet! I'm already seeing this movie again in the theater, and I honestly think it's that level of worthy! Also, I did see this in 3D, and although it doesn't add much to the movie's quality, the added depth does look nice in a lot of certain set-pieces, so if you love 3D, then you'll probably get a kick out of this one, and I thought it looked cool enough, so whether you watch it in 2D or 3D, this movie's a lot of fun all around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was recently blown away by Bryan Singer's new X-men movie. As an longtime avid comic book reader it is easy to see that Singer has a real handle on comic book story telling.The first act does a great job of truly giving more depth and understanding to multiple characters. It made me glassy eyed on multiple times, and giving me chills on others.The second act, was fun and action packed. It had me on the edge of my seat.The last act, although not bad was definitely nowhere near as good as the first two portions of the title. The big bad is not a real threat, and so when the big guns are brought out it seems unwarranted. If they had done a better job of building up the villain I would have said that this was a perfect comic book film.</fullReview>

Oscar Isaac who stars as the villain Apocalypse is quite good as the villain. But the problems for Apocalypse is his motives. You don't know for sure what this guys motives are, he does explain it once where he wants to "Cleanse the earth for the strongest" but you don't get enough of his motivation. Quicksilver in this movie shines and steals the show again like in Days of Future Past, with another awesome scene with his speed. X-Men Apocalypse is really fun time and does not deserve under a 50% on a Rotten Tomatoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its not amazing, but the critics were too harsh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was actually my first time watching an X-men movie. I never seemed to be interested in the movie series from X-men 2000 to X-men Days of Future past. But like Captain America Civil War, (which is a great super hero movie, a must see) I once again chose to see this over the Angry Birds movie. But that's not the point. I came in with low expectations, expecting it to be only a little better than 2015s non MCU Marvel film Fantastic 4 (which is underrated, but still not good). But I actually found it quite good. Here's why:I found the story in it a rather interesting story that puts you close to the edge of the seat. It includes very funny humor, backstory that doesn't fall at a boring level, and intense , but riveting action scenes. One issue is that the bland characters (which I will get into) gives this interesting story a stale and bland side, but that still doesn't destroy this riveting action movie, Like I said, the characters in the movie are mostly bland, but with little exception. Charles Xavier, for instance is like Nick Fury from MCU films, but he lacks big personality. Raven is also a pretty bland character, and I think the writers /directors could've used the character and Jennifer Lawerence better. But some exceptions are some comic reliefs that are actually funny, and provide most of the great humor the movie has to offer. The villain Apocalypse, lacks a big villain build up, and lacks a personality, but he does have great reasoning for being a villain. In fact, it may b a character a lot of people could possibly root for.So overall, I think that this film is worth your time with Great special effects that look very believable in it's effort, and a great story and humor. It's not as good as Civil War, but it's fun exciting and exciting, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>XA (X-men Apocalypse) A supercharged X-men movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OKay the critics were over-exaggerating this movie. The movie had everything that makes a superhero movie super. Over the top action, decent story, great characterization, and a menacing villain.This movie gave me the feels I have never felt in any superhero movie before. And some of the scenes were so engaging I was afraid to blink.Now as much as I enjoyed this movie I do strongly believe Days of Future Past was much better because of better execution. XA's major problem lies with the execution of the villains(4horsemen and Apocalypse). These guys were suppose to bring the end of days in the most biblical sense and it fell short of that. The four horsemen were not utilized to to their full potential. Like Storm should have cause worldwide weather phenomenons like hurricanes forming on land, thousands of tornadoes, floods, electric storms. Psylocke could have dropped on cities like a nuke with telekinetic forces, and Archangel should have used his metal feathers to rain death on the population. And Apocalypse could have been the one pulling the strings and picking up the pieces laid waste by his horsemen. The four horsemen do not get much attention to and its just too bad. These guys were to be the ones who drive this movie and I believe if they had been more focused on this movie would have been better than DOFP.The movie didn't reach the potential that its predecessor reached, but its very enjoyable. The high-energy of this movie is nothing like you ever seen in any superhero movie. Mutants let their powers out and its fantastic. Quicksilver!!!!!! Damn!!!!!!!!!!!! Great movie all around. 2HRS 24 mins and it felt short. GO AND WATCH IT!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie. I was confused at first about the time line stuff, but once I got home and got on the IMDb message boards, things made more sense. Really loved the effects, the action scenes. They were intense and pretty believable. Apoc was interesting, too. Glad that started movie out with a bit of how he came to be, helped me get into his character more. Loved Magneto's backstory and character growth--it was pretty intense but fit the story well And Mystique...She's really intriguing. I hope to see more of Quick Silver. LOVE him &amp; his humor. Really enjoyed that it was based in the 80s. Professor Xavier...great character. Love the actor who plays him a bunch. :) Nicely done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This does contain a spoiler. This is coming from a X-Men fan growing up watching them Saturday mornings to watching them the last few years in the theaters. While I did not care for X-Men: Wolverine but I did like X-Men: The Last Stand however X-Men: Apocalypse is by far my favorite X-Men movie.Why well because it featured my favorite mutant the first ever Apocalypse. Considered as a God of sorts he is the most powerful mutant out there. He has virtually one strength of every mutant or can combat it. He is resurrected into the movie and controlled his own destiny and path throughout the movie. What Apocalypse want Apocalypse got. Including his "supposed four horsemen"I originally gave it a 7 while starting the movie and throughout then when I started seeing Apocalypse normally throughout the movie I gave it a 10. However I dropped it back to a 9. Why because at the end it featured what I thought would be a Batman vs Superman like showdown in Apocalypse vs Magneto (my first and second favorite mutant respectively) but it was not much of a showdown which let me down and that does happen to me throughout the movie.Other than that a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prepared too long for the final fight, yet the final fight is too short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of the movie is very very very very long. The director prepared a lot for the final boss fight, that it's even a little boring at the end, but the "boss" fight is not exciting enough. Personally, I think the boss is not powerful enough to deliver enough visual effects. They should shrink the preparation part and focus more on final boss fight. Still, the quality of this movie is great, while it is not a 10/10, it deserves a solid 8 to 8.5 IMO.Those who were confusing about the X Man original 3 movies can find most of their questions answered here in this movie.

		<shortDescription>New decade. New X-Men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'X Men: First Class' (2011) showcased the origins of the heroes and villains we had seen in the original trilogy. It brilliantly encompassed the 1960' backdrop of the power struggle between the world powers. 'Days of the Future Past' (2014), set in the 1970's, completely eradicated the established continuity-allowing Apocalypse to act as a 'soft reboot' of sorts. With Bryan Singer back to the director's chair, this film is a continuation of Days of The Future Past, in which the whole timeline had simultaneously been reset. Now set in the 1980's, the heroes face their biggest threat yet, in the form of an omnipotent and omniscient mutant called Apocalypse. He is the world's first mutant who simultaneously wants to destroy everything this new world stands for. Apocalypse starts by introducing the titular antagonist's origins in Ancient Egypt. Singer captures this mythological world rather epically and composer John Ottoman helps capture this feeling. Obviously, something doesn't go quite right, and Apocalypse is later reborn in 1983, the same year in which Star Wars; Return of the Jedi was released. I love how this film addressed the film as a little reference, but more importantly, one thing that separates the current X-Men films from other superhero films is the setting. Since 'First Class' each film makes the setting feel special, whether it be through the cinematography or props. The film reintroduces heroes such as Cyclops, Jean Gray, Storm, Angel and Nightcrawler but they are younger, less experienced and not a part of the X-Men. I really enjoyed Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, whose ability to shoot beams of energy through his eyes acts as a burden at first, as he is unable to live a normal life. However, when he is introduced to Professor X's School For Gifted Young Youngsters, he learns that his powers are not a burden but can be used for good. Out of all the youngsters, he and Jean Gray probably had the most character development. Speaking of which, Sophie Turner's Jean Gray leaves something to be desired- I think I just need to see more of her before I judge her portrayal. Although, she does somewhat capture the anger, loneliness that Jean Gray has, because of the extent of her powers. Kodi Smit-McPhee's goofy portrayal of Nightcrawler was reminiscent of Alan Cumming's memorable performance in X Men 2. He was enjoyable and acted as the comic relief, much like Evan Peter's Quicksilver. An overriding theme of the X-Men films is identity with a particular focus on acceptance. This is one aspect of the film that I really enjoyed as Bryan Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg address these themes and generally the franchise has done a good job of tackling these themes- something 'Fantastic Four' (2015), failed miserably at doing. Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse didn't work for me because he just wasn't entertaining or captivating enough. I'm not saying he needs to break out dancing in between a fight or crack numerous jokes at the expense of the heroes, but there's something about a villain who is arguably less one dimensional. He was clearly powerful, threatening and his motives were clear as glass, but they weren't necessarily interesting. It's the sort of motive we've seen before and that's why I didn't enjoy the character. Michael Fassbender's performance is also something that stood out, particularly in the first quarter of the film as we see him trying to adjust to life as a father and husband, whilst also hiding his powers and identity from those he has met in this newly formed life. There is one scene in the forest that was fantastic and much like X Men: First Class, Fassbender gets to show off his acting prowess. The film does feature numerous characters in this ensemble and this review would go on for too long to talk about each performance, so the ones mentioned are the ones I particularly felt were worth talking about. My biggest gripe with apocalypse is the 'end-of-the-world' narrative. I think the X-Men films work better when the story is more close to the heart. To elaborate, narratives revolving around the theme of identity that highlight the divide and difficulties between a world with humans and mutants living side by side have previously allowed the X-Men franchise to stand out. That said, Apocalypse's narrative acts as a tool for conventionally forming a team, the X-Men. In this regard the narrative works, but it doesn't make the film stand out or seem unique. Apocalypse is an enjoyable film through its setting, some particular set pieces (including a particular fan favourite cameo and Evan Peter's Quicksilver) and some truly great performances fronted by Fassbender, Tye Sheridan and James McAvoy. It's problems lie in the fact that it tries to up the ante and scale, whilst world building and introducing new and old characters, meaning that in my opinion it lacks the heart of some of the other X-Men films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A limping sequel compared to Days Of Future Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like the X-MEN franchise. Even before Marvels Iron Man, the old movies never stick with me other than noticing how dated they were.And for a moment, there might be a chance to update or even reinvigorate this series, what with First Class being awesome, Days of Future Past being better than expected, and Deadpool actually having fun with itself. But after watching Apocalypse? I was disappointed. While not terrible, this movie pretty much encapsulates the bland, dated, and totally clumsy aspects of the older X-Men movies with the sparse amount of good things spaced out by uninspired or flat-out bad things. It never rises any more than above average and occasionally falls below it, but it is overall better than what it could have been. The story, for one, is far too simple. Apparently there was an ancient, all-powerful mutant called Apocalypse who, after a century-long power nap, inadvertently gets reawakened and decides that mankind needs to be destroyed because how else do we set up the third act fight scene? In doing so, he unites a new set of mutants (or old mutants but younger), while also amplifying their powers in an attempt to kidnap Charles Xavier so that they can use his mind powers (GEE, THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR!!) Meanwhile, the mutants back at the Mansion, both old and new, pretty much dawdle around until a major plot turn prompts them to stop him and his rogue mutants. No, really, that's it. Now this wouldn't be a total issue, but that's only if it allows some compelling connective tissue. As a screenwriter, your options are A): add some interesting character dynamics, arcs, or even just world- building, or B): add needlessly complicated plot points that at least prompt the characters to trudge along until the final blowout. Sadly, this movie does neither, thus making the whole story feel empty and unmotivated. During the transition to the second act, after almost 40 minutes of character introductions and pointless meandering, the film then detours to a pointless Wolverine cameo, where the young Stryker kidnaps the mutants for some reason. After that, they decide NOW to go to Egypt to stop Apocalypse and bring back their professor. There's no rising or falling action, no defining themes that gave this series its lasting weight, no further explanation to its jumbled continuity (why is Wolverine taken in by the real Stryker rather than Mystique from the last movie?) no 80s-era context outside of pointless banter about how bad the third Star Wars movie was (Do you smell irony?), or no tangible stakes at hand, despite the movie insisting how powerful Apocalypse looks by destroying the city, because that hasn't been done enough already. This monotony also extends to the characters. Angel, Storm, Psylocke, and Nightcrawler have no purpose outside of fighting. Mystique at one point positions herself as a revolutionary for the mutants ? because who isn't sick of seeing Jennifer Lawrence pulling that shtick again ? but then does nothing. Magneto gets a new family at least, but it serves no purpose other than the movie needed for him to get sad and be evil again. There is a stunning, albeit stupid plot twist involving Quicksilver that goes nowhere in the end, but he's once again extraneous and only there for that same speed show from the last movie. Oh hey! Jubilee is finally in these movies, but for pretty much the same role as the old X-Men cartoon, which is no role. Only Jean Grey comes close to any dimension, growing from a frightened mutant tormented by her powers and then fully blossom in an admittedly dazzling finale. But then there's Apocalypse, played by the unfortunate Oscar Isaac. I could go on by how dull and aloof the other performance is (Jennifer Lawrence in particular looks so bored throughout this movie it feels like a protest) but Isaac as Apocalypse in particular delivers the most unforgivably ridiculous performance. To say nothing of his boring character and over complicated set of powers, he looks and acts like a total fool, as though his glaringly terrible makeup design wasn't bad enough. Speaking of design, you'd think the films saving grace would be the action and the CG, right? WRONG! Further proving that X-Men veteran Bryan Singer possesses no grasp on big-scale stories like this (ask me about Jack and the Giant Slayer some time), this movie inherits the worst of the old movies, with awful CGI, flat aesthetic, overuse of establishing shots, and uninspired fight scenes. I'm not saying that Singer is a bad director more than I'm saying that he works best in small-scale thrillers like Usual Suspects and even Valkyrie. Now it seems like the reigns of Matthew Vaughn have totally slipped the proceedings, delivering the same TV-level style that I thought we passed over by now. Believe me, folks; I wanted to like this movie. I wanted a comic book movie other than Disney that could really prove as a true competitor in the modern movie landscape. But as I stand, X-Men Apocalypse is too reliant on the old with not much new to the table. Here is to hoping that the next movie, or rather a new production crew, would finally give this tired franchise the X- Men First Class level high back. As it stands, its meh.For my full review, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/05/review-x-men-apocalypse.html</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is bore town. Very slow paced and lacklustre. The effects looks forced.. oh look.. buildings falling. Nobody cares. The character Jean Grey was miscast in my opinion. The only thing I could hear or see was Sansa Stark. Her British accent is quite strong and she doesn't quite pull off the American. Poor acting doesn't do the character justice at all. All very annoying. The most noteworthy character was nightcrawler.. otherwise waste of characters, waste of Storm. Quicksilver has already been played in the previous movie. Nothing spectacular to add here. The villain.. cringe! How many times will he say 'a better one', cringe! No excitement, intrigued, mystery.. the movie is too long for what it is. The after credit scene was the worst I've ever since and guess what.. the credits went on and on forever. All very much a waste of additional time.I guess the villain wasn't the most powerful after all since he was obliterated by a very bland Jean at the end. Completely passable. Not worth IMAX fee. Maybe 2D off peak, just maybe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic film and a fitting tribute to the comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really really really enjoyed this movie, I remember sitting in the cinema watching it thinking "I need to watch this again, quickly!" This was a roller-coaster of film which did justice to both the comic world and the world of film, and that's something I haven't said about other comic inspired films much. This is the best of the X-Men films, even better than "Days of Future Past" which took some doing, because that was previously the best of them. If I'm honest, the reboot/ new timeline has done the X-Men franchise the world of good, the films are bigger, better and darker - something the X-Men definitely deserves. I personally think they are partly responsible for the success the current MCU and DCU are having. This is the 4th superhero/comic film of the year, I personally think this is better than "Batman vs Superman" and "Cpt. America: Civil War". As an immersing spectacle to tantalize the senses this is on par, for me, with the "Deadpool" film, and I really enjoyed that, but for different reasons. The film was set in the 80's and delivers for the actual time period with feelings of fear and nuclear war, as well as the colour and the sound of 80's fashion and popular culture. It also delivers on the feeling of early X-Men comics, fear of mutants and man's need to control them, with characters looking to find and understand themselves and what they are capable of.Brian Singer directs and has used the new timeline created in "X- Men: Days of Future Past" to wonderful effects to weave a great story. The film introduces En Sabah Nur, or Apocalypse, the first mutant, woken from a deathly slumber about thousands of years. Events transpire that allow him to enlist his regular 4 horsemen to serve him and bring down humanity. His aim is to cleanse the world of the weak (humans and anyone that opposes him generally) and build the world again with him as it's ruler. Standing in his way are the X-Men, who themselves have journeys and story's unfolding at he same time. I don't want to spoil anything so that's as far as I'm taking the synopsis. The cast is brilliant and believable throughout, not just can they act but as an Englishman it's nice to see a Brit heavy cast delivering sublimely. Established characters as well as new appearances make great showings, nobody seemed out of place here. The emotional variances and deliveries were brilliant throughout, giving you everything from love to tragedy, fear to fascination, comedy to conflict. The action scenes were top notch and suited the characters in the film very well. With each unique character, a different power, and each variant is acted and delivered with class. Sometime the CGI and cabled action shots were a little obvious and overdone, but it was still damn fine eye candy and didn't ruin things. It actually served to offer the comic book physics that I'd expect. The film isn't afraid to set up a story at over two hours but it didn't drag at any point, I couldn't wait for more to happen and I certainly look forward to more X-Men films like this one. Stay tuned for the usual post-credits scene, if you know the MCU and X- Men comics you'll figure out who might be pulling some strings in the next movie and like me you'll be ready and waiting. A thoroughly well deserved a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst X-Men movie since "Origins: Wolverine".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have huge expectations, but I was hoping to enjoy this movie at least more than "Batman v Superman". Well, I was being naive, apparently. "Apocalypse" is the worst comic book film of the year so far, and the worst movie from the X-Men franchise since "Origins: Wolverine".There are a lot of things that don't work here (uninventive fight scenes, extremely cringe-worthy and dumbed-down dialogue, a messy plot) but, as I've always said, the pillars in any film (and especially any comic book film) are the characters, and they don't work here. At all. Apocalypse is one-dimensional, dull and derivative. Magneto goes through the exact same path that we've already seen in previous movies, and it's gotten extremely predictable and tiresome. Beast's role is virtually non-existent. Xavier has lost everything that made him interesting in "First Class". Wolverine's cameo is pointless. Storm, Psylocke and Angel are criminally butchered by a writer who obviously doesn't give a f**k about the source material. They still don't get how the Phoenix force should work. Nightcrawler has become nothing more than a device to transport people into places. And Jennifer Lawrence gives the most lifeless iteration of Mystique we've ever seen on screen. She does literally nothing during the whole movie. The only character who shines is, once again, Quicksilver, who gives us the best scene hands down, although it isn't as surprising as it was in "Days of Future past".I've repeatedly read some fans of the "X-Men" franchise defending it over other comic book-based film series because "the X-Men saga includes mature and deep character studies". Well, I invite you guys to watch "X-Men: Apocalypse" and reassert that statement, if you have balls. It's a mishmash of CGI with an unforgivable lack of heart and emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I will never see another Singer X-Men movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of those writing in anything above 8 stars, I question your sanity. This movie is only a hairs breath above X-Men 3 in the entire pantheon. This movie is just bad. If you know the original source material, this movie will just kill you. A wise man once said, if you've got 4 screenwriters, you've got no good screenwriters. I've lived by that mantra, and this doesn't fail it. The writers take one of the most iconic mutant villains, second only to Magneto, and reduce him to vague and ominous (insert bad guy here) style of antagonist. Only a mixed up, ethos of the original character remains. They also take the villains original abilities and just give him any power they want. To play off this God persona of the character. It seemed like the only thing was written towards was another movie to introduce whatever cast they want to try and sign for the next 2 movies. There is one they wrote into their very own movie. "Everyone knows the third movie is the worst." Of course, a tongue in cheek reference to X3 (one of the worst movies I've ever seen). However, since X-Men first class, what do you know...it's the 3rd movie to try and reset the whole universe. Well, played Singer, but not well enough. We know your 3rd movie in this trilogy should be thrown out as well.</fullReview>

He was actually OK.If you thought they could not top Quicksilver's awesome scene from Days of Future Past, get ready for a treat because his scenes were amazing. Marvel, you should get a few lessons on how to make a proper Quicksilver from Fox. Sophie Turner was really good as Jean and I think we finally have a bad-ass Cyclops. Saw it last night and I will probably go see it a few more times. Lets hope there will be more X-Men movies with this cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Young Cast &amp; Excessive Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has its flows, but I don't think that it's rotten. One major problem is the excessive nostalgia for the old movies. It is OK to make an homage at some point, but it's not acceptable to make a movie fulled of it! It took away from the story, and took way too much time from the movie; this precious amount of time could've made the movie way better.The young cast shines although they were giving little to do except for JEan Grey maybe... For once we saw glimpses of shadows of a possible true X-men team...The old cast is OK, but their story felt redundant... The director should've focused on the young cast who btw are playing the real X- men members... The villain was well established, but lacked true motivations. Same goes to the Horsemen. It's a shame because in the comics there's lot of good materials &amp; valid motivations &amp; backstories, singer &amp; Kinberg should've been easily inspired. The ending felt rushed, it was a huge CGI mess, nothing made sense. It was underwhelming. To resume all of this, the x-men played supporting roles in a movie called X-men... (ONCE AGAIN). The villain is a mere shadow of his original material counterpart. The only positive I found is that the young cast did a good job, &amp; they are potentially good for a future movie that focuses on them. the old cast did a good job acting-wise, but their story isn't new. Although the movie is still enjoyable, it is not as good as it can potentially be (knowing what the original material offered)... 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but still a worthy addition to the saga!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it's because I've been told how bad this movie is supposed to be by every review I've read beforehand, but this was a great (action) flick! Granted, it's not the most profound of the X-Men film. But then again, what can you expect from a film with a premise about defeating the ultimate evil? As it turns out, quite a lot actually. It's a bit more than a straight up battle royal. I won't spoil anything here but there are some scenes and lines that really do forward the plot lines of individual characters as well as the overall universe. It's not much but it is presented in such a nice package that it satisfied me (and I definitely don't like dumb action films).Having said that, the action in this film is superb. It might be that this does overshadow the plot and character development to some extent but I can't fault a film for having amazing battle scenes. I have rarely been blown away by action scenes in an X-men film. But this film definitely upped the bar. And not just by Quicksilver's amazing scene (which blows the previous out of the water).I feel this film has gotten an undeserved bad reputation. For instance, I recall critics discussing why Apocalypse was underwhelming, in both dialogue and stature. They said it was strange that he could grow tall (as seen in the trailer) but then didn't do this all the time. That is unfair criticism as there is a great explanation for why that occurred only in that particular instance.The above is just an example but overall I feel the criticism was undeserved. And it may well be that this is to be the final X-men film. If that is the case then this is the perfect ending. This film's plot development does bring the X-men saga full circle. I'm a sucker for a good origin story and this film tells the origin of all parts of the title: both Apocalypse and The X-Men themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific X-Men Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the X-Men comics most of my life and I have been utterly disappointed with every film but by far and away this is the worst. If you've ever read the comics this movie seems more of a spoof then a serious film adaptation. Its like watching my childhood getting crapped on. Obviously none of the actors, writers or director have any idea what they are doing. Its astounding when the comic is the perfect script for film and for whatever reason its completely disregarded. I am actually writing this review as I watch this god awful piece of crap, it's the only way I can find some means of catharsis. How anyone can stomach this "film" is beyond me, they obviously have never read an actual X-Men comic. How Marvel can let one of its most epic comics fall this far goes to show how no one even cares at this point. The cost of making this "film" sickens me even further. I can go on and on about how much I hate this movie but I don't want to waste another minute of my life evening thinking about it. I just wanted to take the time to write my first review to warn any serious fan of the comic to not waste their money on this junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Apocalypse could be better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had bigger expectations about this movie, it wasn't bad but it could be better, after ''Days of Future Past'' everything was complicated because we didn't know what happens which the characters. Thankfully this movie explain some things but I think it isn't enough. Anyway the trailer was better then the movie. In conclusion ''X-Men Apocalypse'' wasn't so bad at least it was better then the first three movies but overall it isn't my favorite from the series. The fight with Apocalypse should have been harder and Wolverine should have appeared more, he only appear on a scene and Sansa (I mean Jean ) gave him back some memories. OK this is a good idea because now we want to know what Wolverine finds out but I would have liked him to fight Apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Things i liked in this movie.Action sequences were splendid even if it was obvious cgi, looked lengthy to make. Quicksilver very awesome.Things i disliked about this movie.Cringey dialogue many times throughout the movie you can predict the next sentence coming... My name is not Eric *face palm* my name is magneto. Or when mystique reverts to her blue form to set an example to the students i'm like really? cough clichéetc This film is a cliché encyclopedia, so in short the script is atrocious. Why was wolverine in the movie again? literally he appears in the movie kills 20 or so fully armed guys for no reason at all and is never seen again, um? what the hell?The problem with Xmen movies that they do in the past is that there is no suspense at all because you already know that nobody can die given that they are alive in the future, for that reason there's no tension nothing you chill back like yep they all live doesn't matter what happens in the film they will live. Just me?The movie ends because phoenix goes super bird mode and kills the bad guy..... that's it pretty much phoenix gets annoyed and kills him. She could have walked up to him in the beginning and said hello i'm a phoenix and killed him there.Convincing magneto to turn against the bad guy was easier than convincing a child to eat ice cream, it's really completely terrible that he has a change of heart after destroying a few cities and afterwards simply walks away a free man after heavily blemishing human-mutant interactions forever.I could list on and on the terrible things in this film, like why do random people in the modern world resurrect a guy from centuries ago now? and not hundreds of years ago, why was storm forgiven when she allied with the evil guy? why was Erik allowed to walk free? Why did quicksilver want to see magneto? and when he got there nothing happens?Although i'm not the best writer out there i hope this convinces some people to skip the film not worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse -- Worst Superhero Movie *Ever*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I'm talking "Green Lantern." I'm kinda angry I lost my whole afternoon. There was pretty much nothing redeeming about this film at all. I have a headache from all the special effects. It was worse than the first "Transformers" movie. Most of the acting was bad, and when we are talking about James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, that is pretty sad. They couldn't do anything with that script!It was a total betrayal to fans, the epic graphic novel story and the *entire* X-Men mythos. None of the characters were *in* character. It destroyed even the canon of the movies. It was boring--even with all that action--it was interminable. Terrible, terrible, terrible movie. Money grabbing. Disrespectful to comic history and those who hold it dear. I want my mind back. I want my time back. Bryan Singer... For shame, for shame, for shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Hollywood's Idea of Justice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally went to see the movie and came away definitely unimpressed, even though it has spectacular special effects. My wife asked me what it was about. I said it had a little story and a lot of blowing stuff up. Other than providing the origin story for Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Storm and the bald Xavier I couldn't see the point of the movie. It was stale and lifeless. Moreover it was dark in tone, very depressing. This is not the sort of movie I care to see over and over. The only light moments involved Quicksilver rescuing the students and a dog from Xavier's school.There were a number of strange and illogical elements. I was offended that the screenwriter, Simon Kinberg, had the En Sabah Nur character claim to be Elohim, which is the Hebrew name for the God Almighty who created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1), and who is the God of Israel in the Bible. In this respect the character is antisemitic.It also seems like the mutants keep getting stronger, especially the chief villain Apocalypse and Eric. I don't think the writer stopped to consider what the real impact to the earth would be if someone had the power that Eric was performing. If he hadn't stopped he would have destroyed the planet and there would not have been anybody left to serve Apocalypse. We're also supposed to believe that Eric's manipulation of the magnetic field around the earth would not have caused long-term harm to the environment. But, X-Men stories exist in a fantasy universe governed by magic, not science.The other incongruity is how Eric (Magneto) is transformed from a mass murderer to a sympathetic character at the end of the movie. We're supposed to feel his pain. Charles believes there's still good in Eric, but Charles fails to be the voice of justice for the victims of Eric. (In fact, no one even brings up the subject.) How about asking all the families that lost loved ones because of Eric's rage and destruction how they feel about exonerating Eric. If Eric could get a pass for mass murder, then he has no reason to hate the Nazis for killing his family. Eric is an evil pragmatist and only does what is good for Eric. He should have been executed for crimes against humanity. But, I seriously doubt Charles believes in capital punishment. Perhaps, Charles is the voice of the screenwriter (Simon Kinberg), in which case he would be seriously screwed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the X-Men, they are my favorite superheroes, but this movie was the worst of all. The idea, as usual, was great and it has two stars because of the special effects. While watching it I could not help but make comments about "mistakes" or things that could have been done better. It happens in all movies, there is always something that could have been done in a different way, but so many things???? I don't even know what to say, I'd have to watch it again to remember. What I found worst were those "quotes". Whoever wrote the script was not paying attention. The moment with Wolverine? That was ludicrous. A big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formula superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, right? Who would have thought it? A superhero movie where the heroes discover a great threat to humanity and then overcome it.So, yes, this is pretty much a by-the-numbers effort from all involved in the X-Men franchise. There is nothing here to really make you go wow, or gasp in surprise. The reason being that you have already seen the action scenes in countless other superhero movies and any twists there might have been are entirely blanked out by the hero mantra that "good must always win the day".So is there anything to recommend this film? Well, it isn't Batman vs Superman, or Fantastic 4, so it is immediately not the worst superhero movie ever. But it is very generic. I honestly don't see the need for the hundreds of superheroes when they all are essentially the same character, just with different powers.If there is any bright spot to this movie, it is that the complete and utter lack of imagination throughout most of its running time is entirely thrown into sharp focus by the scenes involving Quicksilver. Unlike the rest of the movie, where standard mayhem and violence ensue with the kind of gleeful (yet boring) world destroying force we have all come to expect, Quicksilver's scenes at what could have been.The imagination and fun that clearly went into devising his scenes of inhumanly fast movement shine like a beacon in an otherwise rather dimly-lit movie. It is hard not to like this character, who is able to effectively move so fast the rest of the world seems to stand still. The fun they have with his one big scene is clear, and harks back to an era when superheros could be fun and not scowl-faced gritty impersonations of themselves. Quicksilver, in his way, is the less-sweary cousin to Deadpool. There is an irreverence to him that I hope they don't ruin with "character development" and, of all the myriad of heroes getting their own movies, one starring him would be the only one I would be interested in seeing.However, beyond Quicksilver, there isn't much to really draw you into the film. The rest of the X-Men get decent enough screen time, though I kind of wish they'd just be done with the origins stories and get on with the group as a team. And, I'm sorry, but James McAvoy's school for mutants is increasingly starting to seem more like Hogwarts than it is a place for mutants to come into their own.The movie, as I said, is capably done, but it isn't anything you haven't seen before (excepting Quicksilver) and leaves you feeling "Meh!" more than anything else.There is the obligatory Staneo and, for no reason other than fan-service, Wolverine makes a brief appearance as a kind of Maguffin to get the students out of a tough spot. His appearance is entirely unnecessary but just done so that they can say he is in the movie.All in all, this is a formula movie with no surprises.SUMMARY: Formula hero flick with nothing particular to recommend it. Not awful, but just more of the same you've now seen countless times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"X-Men Apocalypse" is technically masterful and fun to watch, but feels like too much of a good thing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call 2016 "The Year of the Superhero Battles". After the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel went at each other in "Batman v. Superman" and the Avengers divided (then reunited) and conquered in "Captain America: Civil War", "X-Men Apocalypse" (PG-13, 2:24) features mutants fighting each other. They're fighting over a mutant's mutant named En Sabah Nur. But you can just call him Apocalypse. That name reveals this film's tie-in with another cinematic superhero trend of the 2010s ? world domination. After the Avengers prevented a sentient A-I baddie named Ultron from destroying mankind and rebooting the world in 2015, an ancient mutant who is actually named for the end of the world tries to do the same in 2016. Or is it 1983? Heck, these movies' own characters have trouble keeping it all straight ? even within the X-Men universe. In a meta reference in 2016's "Deadpool", as Colossus drags the title character across a bridge and says, "You will come talk to Professor Xavier", Deadpool understandably and hilariously responds, "McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing."I'll try to keep from confusing things further with my plot summary, by limiting character references for simplicity's sake. (To read more about who's in this movie, God has given us IMDb and Wikipedia.) In "X-Men: Apocalypse", a variety of human beings with special powers continues their magical mystery tour of the planet, as the supremely psychic mentor and do-gooder Professor Xavier (that's James McAvoy in this one, Mr. Pool) tries to bring out the good in all mutants - even the bad ones. Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is trying to live a quiet country life in Poland when something happens that REALLY makes him mad and he's not inclined to be magnanimous towards his enemies. We then meet three other overseas mutants who are morally ambiguous and/or evil to varying degrees. We also see the sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Raven Darkhölme / Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) traveling the world and recruiting (for Xavier's academy) young mutants like the teleporting Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Meanwhile, back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters in Westchester, New York, Professor X is working hard to help a growing number of resident mutants. They include the telekinetic Jean Grey / Phoenix (Sophie Turner) and Scott Summers / Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), whose eyes have just started shooting out extremely destructive laser beams. The Professor has help from the also sometimes-but-not-currently-blue-hued Hank McCoy / Beast (Nicholas Hoult), but X becomes distracted by the re-emergence of his memory-impaired old flame, CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), who is in Egypt investigating the legend of an ancient mutant, who's also part of this movie's 50 Shades of Blue.Back in ancient Egypt, about five and a half millennia ago (give or take a century), En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (an unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) continued his habit of transferring his consciousness into the younger bodies of other mutants, and, in the process, adding their powers to his personal super power arsenal. When some mutant-haters betray him, and even his current generation of four helpers (later called "The Four Horsemen") can't save him, he's buried underneath a collapsed pyramid and forced to take a very, very, very long sand nap. As one summary of this movie has said, "Fast-forward to 1983 (10 years after the mind-bending, time-travelling events in 'X-Men: Days of Future Past')." Some present-day believers unearth the king of the mutants, utter some chants, and release En Sabah Nur into the modern world. He catches up on everything he has missed (and learns to speak English) by touching a TV set and immediately begins gathering another team of mutant minions. He has decided that mankind has gone astray without his guidance and he plans to wipe out nearly all humans (whether they're evil or not) ? and he doesn't even provide any of them with an ark! This harsh latter-day Darwinist will only allow the strongest to survive, destroy everything man has made, and then rebuild. "X-Men: Apocalypse" is impressive and entertaining, but seems like a little too much of a good thing. Its visual effects, action set pieces and hair-make-up work, taken as a whole, represent the most creative and best executed that I've ever seen in a single movie. At first blush, those sets of accomplishments seemed destined for some serious awards season love (with more than a few wins). However, the film's extraordinary technical achievements are symptomatic of what's wrong with it. Although Movie Fans who are new to the X-Men franchise will be unable to appreciate the layered character development and the references to the previous films, the plot of this film does stand alone and isn't hard to follow. It's fun and awe-inspiring to watch? but has too much going on. This movie naturally brings to mind previous X-Men installments, along with movies in which several (or all) of the Avengers appear. If this trend continues, Stan Lee himself (who, of course, has a brief cameo in this Marvel film, with his real-life wife) may have to develop a super power and pick up a shield or something.Come to think of it, I wonder if I'm the only one who would be interested to see Ultron and Apocalypse go up against each other. Of course, they'd both have to still be "alive" for that to happen, but the way the X-Men franchise plays fast and loose with timelines, anything is possible. Then there's the possibility that Ultron and Apocalypse, with their different but complementary skill sets and mutual penchant for destruction, could join forces. In that case, all the X-Men AND Avengers joining forces might still be unable to stop that dastardly duo. Even if such a battle were to be fought, the resulting movie (with cameras naturally there to capture every crash-bang-boom) would be even more cluttered than "X-Men: Apocalypse"? which I'm giving a "B+".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but lacking in emotional depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why be different when you can look like everybody else?" Nightcrawler (the blue-hued teleporter) questions Mystique (the also naturally-blue-hued shapeshifter) in X2, to which she pointedly responds, "because we shouldn't have to".In The Last Stand, Storm, at learning that non-mutants have developed a cure that permanently suppresses the Mutant X-gene, cries, "a cure for all mutants? But we don't need a cure. Since when have we become a disease?"And yet, yet there are others who feel quite differently. Those who will give anything to feel 'normal' and are only too willing to give up that which makes them special. Because as there is no doubt that innate (and often intimidating) extraordinariness renders a mutant as formidable, so too it is certain that it makes one aberrant in the eyes of others, such power-possessors only just about managing to outpace vilification, then rejection, social ostracization and even the threat of extermination.Which path then should the gifted choose for themselves? Should one live as a proud pariah or eternally condemn oneself to a fate of inert impotence? The question itself poses a seething paradox, because even if one were to pick the former things won't grow easy, the risks attendant with pacifism or aggression, the only two approaches available, then springing to life, accentuated further by the one immutable dimension to the mutant conundrum: the inability of humanity to rise above prejudices.It is these emotionally resonant thematic threads that have since its inception set the X-Men series apart from other superhero productions, interwoven as they are through deftly layered and penetrating allegory: the omnipotent thesis being the trials and inner conflicts of social misfits, the discrimination and dilemmas faced by minorities, be they ethnic, sexual, religious or whatever.Should a people assert the right to coexist under the umbrella of a proud and distinct identity or should they always aspire to blend in with the mainstream? Is society hardwired to fear those who look and behave differently? Is it really possible to convince people to think in a manner that runs counter to their primal instincts?Apocalypse is a great spectacle, as are all the X-Men movies without exception. (OK, we can forget about X-Men Origins:Wolverine for the time-being). But let's be honest here. Really honest. It is certainly not the best film of the series, the thus far unsurpassed one being Days of Future Past followed closely by First Class and X2.And this loss is chiefly down to the fact that this latest instalment, save for Magneto's backstory, which in retrospect appears tired and stale, fails to pose any searing questions or to explore the internal thought-processes and predicaments of the characters.Instead we're served just another superhero movie populated with a galaxy of CGI-enhanced mutants, whose motivations despite the actors' tremendous performances (especially from the latest entrants), fall emotionally flat.What's more, whilst the previous two instalments in the series draw on historical events of the time-periods in which they were set (The Cuban Missile Crisis and The Vietnam War), Apocalypse could well have occurred in any time frame. The film is none the richer for being set in the 80s.The plot is straightforward enough. In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse, having amassed the powers of many other mutants over millennia, awakens from a slumber and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen, Psylocke, Storm, Archangel and a broken Magneto, Apocalypse plans to create a new for mutants- only world order. As the earth convulses in doomsday throes, the X- Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier work together to prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.The performances are as usual all superb and the CGI eye-arresting. But the two performances that stand out are those of Jean Grey, whose perceptivity and latent vigour are brought alive to pitch-perfection by Sophie Turner, and of Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, whose comic relief is so good that I will re-watch the film for just his scenes. The one disappointment however is Oscar Isaac from whom I had high expectations. It seemed like his talents have been 'overmasked' by CGI, so much so that he appears as generic a villain as any and his actions are the less menacing for it.Nevertheless, the closing battle scene is as grand and edge-of-the- eat nerve-racking as one might expect of an X-Men movie despite the fact that its enjoyment, as that of the film's as a whole, will be somewhat compromised for those not familiar with the events and characters featured in the earlier films.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad movie, overly long, some strong acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simple plot, lots of special effects, predictable outcome. This is the formula that drives Hollywood movies today, and this movie is no exception. The movie contains strong acting, but that is totally upstaged by the immense use of special effects which gives the movie a cartoon-like character. As this movie is based on comic book characters, that should not be surprising. The premise of the story is a shaky one - humans divided into two subspecies, one mutant and the others normal. The cause of this division is not explained. For the story to be engaging, this division has to be accepted without question. Otherwise the entire story is meaningless and contrived. The movie offers two and a half hours of almost nonstop special effects. There is some character development which adds some substance to the plot, and makes the movie more watchable. But about two-thirds of the way into the movie, the story becomes rather tedious as it moves to its inevitable outcome. The problem with comic book characters is exactly that - they are comic book characters, and frankly, how emotionally invested can anyone really become in characters that by their very nature are pure fantasy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stop me if you've heard this one before. A single humanoid with immense powers wants to wreak global death and destruction just because he can. No, that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.*beep*2 evenly matched groups of nominal heroes with a wide variety of super-human powers duke it out over some arcane movie-mcguffin dispute. No, that was Captain America: Civil War.*beep*Regular human beings stand by helplessly as their buildings are toppled, cities exploded, and fellow citizens slautered by the tens of thousands during a pissing match between 2 supposed good guys. No, that was Batman v. Superman.*beep*We know from long experience that superheroes always defeat supervillains, so where's the fun in that? It's finally reached the point of detachment wherein the only credible danger that a superhero can face is another superhero ? or possibly a god.*So it is here. The god in question started off in Egypt 5600 years ago as a regular mutant (named En Sabah Nur {not that anyone cares}, portrayed by Oscar Isaac, better known as Poe Dameron from the recent Star Wars movie), but his particular power was the ability to transfer himself into the bodies of others, including other mutants. Every time he did so, he added their abilities to his own and eventually came to dominate the civilization of the Nile. But in his arrogance he was viewed by the common people as a false god, and a conspiracy among his own palace guard resulted in his being buried under a collapsed pyramid during a period of vulnerability as he was again changing bodies.Fast forward to the Reagan Era, when a CIA agent accidentally opens the ancient crypt, and empowering sunlight falls on the arcane runes which will reanimate the dormant deity. He spends some time strolling around Cairo, taking in the sights of the modern era, before recruiting 4 mutants to be his henchoids, the 4 "horsemen" to his Apocalypse. One of them is the grieving and misanthropic Magneto / Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender, who will grow up to be Ian McKellen). Another is weathermeister Storm (Alexandra Shipp, who will eventually become Halle Berry). And there's Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn, who will grow up to be Mrs. Aaron Rodgers). His come-on to all of them is that he can enhance their nascent powers into something truly formidable.Standing in the way of his plan of world destruction / domination are the students at the School for Gifted Youngsters run by Prof. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, wwgu2B Patrick Stewart). And it turns out that Prof. X himself has the one superpower that Apocalypse covets most of all: the ability to reach into the mind of every human on Earth.Truly gargantuan quantities of wanton destruction ensue.** These are well done, as the various FX subcontractors dominate the film. There's some pro-forma dialog, but hardly anybody gets a chance to truly act.Much of this film makes sense only if you've seen the previous ones in the X-Men series. Which I have. And I'm a comic-book fan. So I still liked it. YMMV.?????? *Altho see the wry observation: "Captain America met 2 gods face to face; still a Christian. Iron Man met 2 gods face to face; still an atheist. The Hulk met 2 gods face to face; kicked the snot out of both of them." (except he didn't say "snot")**Why can't we ever have superheroes whose skill sets involve building things? Instead, the new kid in school is Scott Summers, whose only ability is to blast the living crap out of everything he aims his laser-beam eyes at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The X-Men make a surprising but flawed return to the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been sixteen years since the debut of the X-Men franchise in 2000, and the series is shown to still be running. Director Bryan Singer has given grace to the franchise, though it has fallen victim to a few disappointments along the way, take 'X-Men: Origins' for example. This ninth installment to the series continues the story after the events of 'Days of Future Past' when our hero Wolverine traveled back in time to save the world from the tyrant robots known as The Sentinels and restored peace, though the peace for the mutants was only temporary. The film opens up in ancient Egypt with the awakening of the most powerful mutant in the world Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac), a mutant born thousands of years ago as a god and is capable destroying absolutely everything in this path. When the mutants learn of his return and discover this plan to completely wipe out civilization as we know it while assisted by his four horsemen: Storm (played by Alexander Shippe) Angel (played by Ben Hardy), Psylocke (played by Oliva Munn) and later joining them is Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender). To an grueling effort to save humanity, the mutants band together to defeat Apocalypse once and for all. Joining the mutants is Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), The Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quiksilver (Evan Peters), along with some newcomers including Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smit McPhee), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) assisted by Professor Charles Xavier (Jams McAvoy).This film serves a pleasant continuation to the X-Men storyline, but it's not quite as fresh as it should be, hitting a few flaws along the way. The film begins with a truly compelling premise and introduction of the main villain Apocalypse to kick off the story which follows an antagonist who is portrayed as a god. So yes, the film does seem to implant some biblical symbolism in the story including the four horseman of the Apocalypse which some may be familiar with in the Bible. The execution of the story is strong enough to maintain interest. But if there is a major flaw in the story, it lies within the pacing along with the main villain Apocalypse himself. After a compelling introduction our antagonist, the story journeys through a bloated amount of exposition, moving the plot at an unnecessarily slow pace during the first half. I can't argue that the establishment of Magneto's story and his transformation from an innocent man to a tragic anti-hero, everything else feels a bit confused, at least until the story finally kicks off during the second half. The same goes for Apocalypse. With a villain as powerful and legendary as him, viewers would expect him to be treated with proper development. The part this villain fails at providing a clear motivation as why is trying to destroy the world other than just to destroy it. Without a solid motivation, the result is a villain that feels rather underdeveloped, though he reaches redemption from a decent performance by Oscar Isaac.While the film may not bless with the most engrossing villain of the franchise, we are fortunately granted with of course, exhilarating visual effects and action sequences to pinnacle our excitement. The action sequences are fun as ever, and given by the impressive CGI, they're quite pulse-pounding to watch. The climatic battle during the final twenty minutes are easily some of the best moments. Like the previous film Days of Future Past, Quik Silver played by Evan Peters earns his time to shine in another of his big "freeze-motion" scene accompanied a classic 80s soundtrack (Haha!). Apocalypse on the other hand, is cool to look at but the CGI and costume design on Oscar Isaac is not too impressive or particularly scary enough to make him look menacing. Even if the visuals effects don't impress you, it's great to see some of our favorite cast members return to the screen along with newcomers like Tye Sheridan and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Cyclops and Nightcrawler. The performances are incredible, especially Michael Fassbender who delivers as captivating, emotionally-driven portrayal of the iconic Magneto. Is his performance Oscar-worthy? No, but it stands truly memorable.X-Men Apoaclypse may feel like a slight step backwards in the series, but it's solidly entertaining and marks an accomplished opportunity by director Bryan Singer as well as a worthy kickstart to the summer, even if it hits some flaws in the process. This film is worth seeing, especially for X-Men fans and bound to score big riches at the box office, much like every other Marvel-based picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand both the haters and the fanboys because the movie is both good and bad depending on what's important to yourself. There are three aspects that are awful dialogues (sometimes quite cheesy and dull), story (main story of this film) and Apokalypse. There is some great stuff too entertainment, atmosphere and story (x-men universe related).This makes Apokalypse pretty bad as a standalone movie but it can be a enjoyable movie if like the X-men. Its definitely not the best X-men movie i would rank the X-men movies like X-men2 &gt; First Class &gt; Days of Future Past &gt; Apocalypse &gt; Last Stand &gt; X-Men1.Watch this Movie if you know all the other X-men because it connects the old and new movies very nice together or if you just want some action, fun and entertainment. If you expect a complex, meaningful or original story save your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another X-traordinary film added to the franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the latest instalment of the X-Men franchise. I had heard a lot of negative publicity towards the film and to be honest I think that X-Men: Apocalypse is actually a very well made and interesting movie. All of the performances in the film are flawless. However, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performances are very powerful and bring a great deal to the film. The character Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac) is also extremely intriguing and nothing like anything we have seen before. The storyline of the film, although following a lot of individual story lines, is very straight forward and easy to follow without being too clichéd. Singer's direction is on the money. However, he has proved himself multiple times already - so much so that I would expect nothing less. Inspiration from the comics has clearly been interwoven into this film as characters such as Psylocke are seen rocking costumes almost identical to those seen in the comics. The CGI and other special effects seen in the movie are also breath taking and it is clear that now the X-Men films have truly perfected their style. It is easy to see that many people have worked very hard to create such spectacular effects. Overall, I would give this film 8 out of 10 because it is everything a good X-Men film should be: interesting, relatable and impressive. The film even has a cameo from a very familiar friend to the franchise and, although this time he is not a front runner, it is okay because even just a taster is fun to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exiting and Action Packed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the third film in the prequel X-Men franchise that has a stunning cast, amazing special effects, and a story worth viewing.Bryan Singer gets his superhero movies; that was evident with the first two X-Men films and with Days of Future Past. He knows how to build a film with minor villains before expanding over to the super-villains, in this case, that is En Sabah Nur, also known as Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac, And like that, the story builds up the action, the characters, their dynamics and the story. There is a mad man here; he has a plan, and the audience gets that plan. This movie is not a mess, it's a clear and cohesive story, there is nothing complicated about it. It has a slow start to establish the villain, where he came from, and why he was asleep for centuries. Then when he wakes, the writers and the actor established his madness very early on. We know what he wants and ultimately how he intends to get to that objective.Admittedly, the beginning of the film following the opening sequence is slow, but the story is reintroducing the viewer to the characters, where they are in this time, emotionally, and physically. It's been ten years since the previous film, so a lot has changed for them. There is also a deeper look into who they are, into their hearts, their darkness and their light. These characters have grown, and everyone, the writers, the director and the cast was able to bring that to life and highlight it. It's an amazing story, yes a superhero film, but it's more than that, it's about family, about identity, and everyone was able to capitalize on that.Again, the casting here was perfect. Isaac is a phenomenal actor who captures the insanity and calmness of his character perfectly. He's a sociopath with a very real God complex, and Isaac makes his character stand apart. Isaac just elevates the role, he plays with the calmness very well, and he's excellent at playing the manipulator, He's a genius and stands apart from the rest of the film;, he stands apart from the noise of the action.Nevertheless, he wasn't the only standout actor here. Sophie Turner was a great Jean Grey and this film finally highlighted the extent of her powers. Now, I'm not a big fan of Jean, but she is powerful, and the audience, we finally get to see that power, and the performance, Turner's fear and strength, it was brilliant. She is Jean Grey. No offense to Famke Janssen, who was a good Jean Grey, this film was just written better to explore who Jean Grey is, and Turner was the perfect choice to bring it all to life.Another benefit of the movie was that the cast was small, and the story introduced new characters without slowing down the pace of the film highlight their origins. We don't need that; one sentence of where they come from, one scene, that's all anyone needs, and that is what this film delivers. It keeps the pace of the film moving forward and increasing in speed, that by the end, it's hard to believe it's a two and a half hour film. It just moves so quickly, working towards making this film even more exciting.At the end of the day, this is a great movie. The casting was perfect, the story worked hard to highlight who these characters were, their strength, weaknesses, and it was a cohesive film with a slow start but an exciting end. Moreover, the homage at the end towards the 90's animated series, that was just icing on the cake.Oh, and now?SPOILER ALERT?that the film showed us our Phoenix, can we get a PROPER Dark Phoenix Saga movie in production?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As taken from: http://www.beyondvalwood.com/#!A-review-of-the-movie- XMen-Apocalypse/c218b/574e38200cf209161af623b0WARNING - some spoilers ahead!Hello dear readers,Yesterday, Hazel and I watched X-Men: Apocalypse. If you know anything about me, I am a HUGE X-MEN fan. So I had HIGH HOPES for this movie and HIGH EXPECTATIONS, while Hazel just wanted nice special effects and lots of mutants. Silly dog.So Hazel gives this movie 3.5 stars out of 4. I agree with the little dog in that the movie was visually stunning, believably acted as they all are, and very entertaining. We are both thrilled that Quicksilver got to play a larger part, and just like he did in Days of Future Past, he stole the show whenever he appeared :) The best scene in the movie goes to Quicksilver again, he did not disappoint :)But I also have some big problems with this movie. I understand the Days of Future Past erasing the time line of the first three movies (and thus making them null, void and pointless), but I do not think it went far enough in its explanations. Apocalypse compounds on this problem in its failure to bridge any connections in the prior story lines at all (Weapon X cameo? I guess?).Inconsistencies with Night Crawler's abilities are not resolved or explained. In X2 (which would have been his future if not for Days of Future Past), he refuses to teleport into a building he's never seen before, but does it into the Helicopter with no difficulty. This is a minor nitpick, but it seems the movie scaled certain mutants powers as it needed to fit the plot. Cyclops, in an emotionally unstable state, delivers an optic blast to a high school student about 2 feet in front of him behind a bathroom stall door, yet the boy is left relatively unharmed. A few days later when showing Xavier his power, in a calm controlled setting, he unleashes a blast that scores the ground and splits a giant tree like it was balsa wood.My largest problem with the movie is Magneto's character arc. The ramifications of Magneto's actions are never addressed (and thus he is never forced to confront them), which gives the entire film a hollow and shallow feeling. As we see Magneto level skyscrapers and bridges all across the globe in the film's climax, one has to assume a few (possibly thousands if not millions!) humans are also being killed. This is glossed over by a news report stating Magneto assisted with defeating Apocalypse, Magneto and Jean rebuilding the mansion, and Magneto and Xavier having a chuckle between old friends. However, how would this actually look? Mutants got into a fight...cities all across the globe were almost torn to pieces...not exactly a plus for human and mutant relations. The basis of Magneto and Xavier's conflict, which is a HUGE theme in any X-Men film, is living harmoniously with humans. This is undermined greatly by not even acknowledging Magneto may have shredded up countless humans in thousands of jagged, metal death-tornadoes.A plus and a minus was the villain, and title's namesake, Apocalypse. I felt Apocalypse's power was captured on screen perfectly. He's a very powerful mutant, possibly one of the most powerful, and he was portrayed this way. But although he spoke with grandeur and zeal, he didn't really say much. "Must destroy humanity and rebuild!"...over and over again...okay? Why again? By leaving the viewers in the dark about what Apocalypse's true motivations are, they have also left us without tension and focus that this movie desperately needed.I will say that even though the ending may not stand up to scrutiny, it was splendid. It wrapped up the entire movie together nicely, while leaving room for the next one. It's an odd movie, in that although it had some problems, we left the theater thoroughly satisfied and enjoyed myself quite a bit. I give it a solid 3 out of 4 stars. We'll round up towards Hazel, and give it a nice 3.3 stars. It's what a summer blockbuster should be, entertaining and visually cool.-Jessica, author of Beyond the Veil</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse was X-cellent, despite what some people might say about the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the critically acclaimed global hit, 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', director Bryan Singer once again returns to the X-Men Franchise with 'X-Men Apocalypse'. While, this movie might not be as good as the previous movie, it was still a blast to watch! I found it, very entertaining, in the face of its dark somber and emotional tone. I was very invested in the brutal story. It's just sad that some critics don't agree with me. I think, the main reason, why they might dislike, this movie is, because the fact that Warner Bros DC Comics 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and Disney's Marvel Studios 'Captain America: Civil War', has been trying to do, more complex mortality stories, while 20th Century Fox is trying to simple it down with the standard comic book 'save the world' plot line. For the most part, I think, they're just being a little over critical. After all, the X-Men franchise has always been a little too serious or stretch out, with its stories, dealing with bigotry, prejudice, and diversity. It's time for them to take the franchise, a little more simple and straightforward with a standard extinction storyline. After all, it's a superhero film. Yet, this movie is no lightweight. It's still has depth and strong character development. While, the civil rights issues is not explore much, here; it was still kinda refreshing to see, the X-Men have to deal with issues, something bigger. I like the concept of rational humanism vs God worshiping, here. I just wish, it was discuss more, than being limited for more a visual disaster movie, tone. Don't get me wrong, I like the visuals in this film, but I felt that the CGI could need some more work. There were parts in the film that look utterly unnatural, due to the fakeness of the green screens like the Quicksilver/ Pietro Maximoff (Evan Peters) running scene. Despite that, I love, how absolutely brutal the action is for a PG-13 movie. I just wish, I knew, what was the villain's motivational was about. I get that, the Egyptian God/Mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) wanted to destroy the world, but I'm not entirely sure what he wants to do with it, really. It's never truly explored. He looks confused and clueless. Honestly, does he want to destroy mankind or not? It look like he could had wipeout the world, as least, 3 times, earlier in the film. Besides that, I kinda like this version of Apocalypse than the 'Age of Apocalypse' comic book version. After all, the comic version was a little too over the top with the caliber of his mutant powers. I thought Oscar Isaac did well for himself in this film. He really look and act very sinister. Still, I had a big problem with his henchmen, the Horsemen's motivations. I really don't get, why they're so willing to destroy the world. I get the reasons, why Archangel/Warren Worthington III (Ben Hardy) would, based on the story, presented and the comics; but why would Storm/Ororo Munroe (Alexandra Shipp) &amp; Psylocke/ Elizabeth Braddock (Olivia Munn) join Apocalypse? Their motivations are not credible at all, unless, they were supposedly brainwash. Even with that, why the sudden change of heart, toward the end? Did Apocalypse's mind control suddenly turn off? It makes no sense. Anyways, there's a lot of destruction in 'Apocalypse', but very little consequence for the people that kinda starred it. It's weird that Storm would get away, scot's free, toward the end. On the other side, the motivational of the X-Men, both recurring characters and new ones were very clear. It's just odd, that Mystique/Raven Darkhölme (Jennifer Lawrence) is nothing like her comic-book counterpart. I get that Jennifer Lawrence is a big name and hate going through the long make-up process but couldn't they get her to appear and act, more like the Mystique from the comic books. After all, I kinda like villain, Mystique than hero version. It's really taking away, yet another leader role from Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). He seem a bit, underdeveloped, here. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was alright, despite, kinda being bitchy. Still, her American accent doesn't sound quite right, as her British sounding voice is really showing. As much as I dig the new characters, by far, the best is the recurring characters of Professor X/ Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto/Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Both were amazing in their roles. It's just sucks, that the pair barely share a scene together here. I love that fascinating relationship between them. Stan Lee also has a cameo, but it come across, as really disturbing and awkward to watch. Also, it can't be, an X-Men movie without Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman). He was alright in his small bit in the film, but the inconsistency with his character is just confusing. It doesn't match, well with the end events of the last movie. I guess, that scene was just a red herring. Still, it makes you wonder, how did the real Col. William Stryker (Josh Helman) capture him for the Weapon X program? The film is full of plot-holes like this. I know this movie marks the first installment in the new X-Men series following the Cosmic Retcon. However, I don't get in the timeline, that history has been altered so much, that some mutants have now been born long before they were in the original timeline and how the recurring characters are able to age so slowly. It's a bit jarring, but I willing to give some leeway, because thinking too much about it, will give you, a headache. Despite, the trouble timeline and artistic license to both history, science and comics; I didn't really allow it, to take me out of the movie. Overall: As a conclusion to a trilogy, 'Apocalypse' falls somewhat short. Still, I say go see it, as if there is no tomorrow! It's worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with limited magnetic attraction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the day that Britain voted to leave the European Union it feels fairly appropriate to review a film with "Apocalypse" in the title. For me the X-Men films have always been in the 'see if I have the time' category: mildly diverting but largely forgettable. And X-Man: Apocalypse, the third in the "prequel" series, has a forgettability half-life significantly shorter.Starting in Mummy-esque fashion in ancient Egypt, the evil super- mutant En Sabah Nur (an almost unrecognizable Oscar Isaac) arranges for his soul to go hopping around from old mutant body to new mutant body to gather a smorgasbord of powers. In mid-hop he is brought down to earth (literally) and buried alive for several thousand years before being awoken. This happens in 1983 when CIA agent Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) ? thrillingly for me channelling an Indiana Jones vibe so long missing from our screens ? leaves a rug-covered hole uncovered (no, seriously, I'm not making this up) and unleashes the beast. With a need to gather around him his 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse' En Sabah Nur chooses the four most talented mutants (ed: read, the first four he comes across!), one of which is Eric Lehnsherr (aka Magneto, Michael Fassbender) who's in the midst of having his own 'mare of a day. Literally everyone on the planet gets progressively involved until the story builds to a huge showdown in modern day Cairo.Let's start with the positives. It's watchable and has a few high- points worthy of note. In particular, the scene where Quicksilver (Evan Peters) saves Xavier's students (plus dog and fish) from an ongoing massive blast is just hugely entertaining. And most of the acting (as you might expect from the calibre of the cast) is excellent: Michael Fassbinder; James McAvoy; Nicholas Hoult; Jennifer Lawrence and Rose Byrne all carry their parts extremely well. (I'm sure Oscar Isaac is his normal superb acting self under all of that latex, but it is almost impossible to tell). Also of note is young English Saoirse Ronan lookalike Sophie Turner (replacing Famke Janssen in playing Jean Gray).Where the film irritates though is in some lazy plotting and tangential and unnecessary diversions in Simon Kinberg's screenplay, adding to an already overlong running time. As a specific point, and while not as snort-worthyly derisive as the 'Martha-gate' scene from Batman vs Superman, there are at least a couple of allegiance switcheroos in this film that are just thoroughly unconvincing. More fundamentally, if you were pushed to say in 10 words or less what this film was about you would struggle to come up more that "Bad guy rises and needs defeating". None of the underlying social and racial tensions of the human/mutant struggle that made the previous films more sociologically interesting, are really of any relevance within this story.Also of enormous irritation to me is the blatant science abuse going on. Without giving too much of the plot away, there is massive magnetic disturbance to the earth that has highly selective effects: an office building is ripped apart (presumably that's the effect of tens of thousands of staples and paper clips fighting to get out?) and yet the metal bridge next to it just suffers some minor damage; a shipwreck rises from the sea bed into the sky, and yet this is all observed from an unaffected ship on the surface; and the X-Men fly into the very heart of the disturbance in a plane ? ? presumably one made of Tupperware or similar? Come on scriptwriters of the world ? employ some decent science advisors! (It's not as if science geeks go to watch these sorts of films or anything!) As a final concern, the film depicts the casual total destruction ? note: NOT the mild glazing damage meted out to Metropolis of Gotham? TOTAL destruction ? of Cairo and presumably the majority of its 7.7 million residents, all without pause for a flicker of concern or grief from any of the characters. Would this be acceptable if this was London, Chicago or LA? Or is it OK in the current climate because 90% of Egyptians are Moslem? I would seriously like to think not, but for me this left a bad taste in the mouth. The director is series director Bryan Singer. My message to him is that if this is the best you can do, it's time to send this pony to the retirement farm. On leaving a showing of "The Return of the Jedi", Jean Grey comments to her colleagues "At Least we can all agree the third (film) is always the worst": never a truer word spoken in jest.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is an epic film, full of action and special effects, but at the same time, focused on the internal conflict of the characters, which was always the most important thing in the comics. Speaking of which, I will mention that I'm not bothered by the irregular continuity in the films of this franchise, or the abundant inconsistencies which generated five previous movies (I'm not counting the individual spin-offs) made without such a strict unifying criteria as the one of Marvel Studios. Yes, the respect to the Holy Continuity is something I appreciate in the comics, but I don't want to let it interfere my appreciation of a cinematographic adaptation... as long as it's good, which is definitely the case of X- Men: Apocalypse, whose screenplay is quite well structured, gradually accommodating its pieces until building a solid and coherent story which simultaneously works by itself and as a continuation of the global themes of the saga. On the negative side, those same themes start feeling a bit repetitive after such many visits to the same creative waterfall... Charles Xavier trying to convince Eric Lensherr to help the humanity which hates them; Raven Darkhölme trapped between her good will and distrust against humans; and the young mutants who see their abilities as a punishment instead of a blessing. I know that those are the ideological pillars of X-Men, so their presence in every film shouldn't surprise me; however, they are getting kinda monotonous. Fortunately, we have many pros on the other hand, such as the good integration between the "classic" characters, the newcomers and the new versions of some old acquaintances; Sophie Turner's excellent performance as Jean Grey; the scene with Peter (not "Pietro"?) Maximoff, which isn't relevant only for the plot, but also the character's future development; a deep and tragic villain such as En Sabah Nur, with powers which go beyond the easy special effect (even though, to be honest, I didn't find his big apocalyptic plan completely logical); and John Ottman's wonderful score. As for the special effects... they are very good, but they feel a bit excessive in some occasions. However, the main pro of X-Men: Apocalypse is the fact that the story and the characters are always given more relevance than the visual spectacle (even though it's not neglected either). In the context of the franchise, I would place X- Men: Apocalypse below X2 and X-Men: First Class, but above X-Men, X- Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: Days of Future Past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Adaptation of a Comic Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost, yes of course this movie does contain flaws, and the group I went to see it with actually really disliked it, and I was shocked. I love the first two in this series, Days of Future Past is my favorite, but First Class is very close. The only complaint I have is as a huge fan of the X-Men comic books and the TV series, these two previous movies were brilliant, but I never thought of them as translations from that source material. Which is where we get back to Apocalypse, this felt like the best reputation in a long time by any comic book movie, they nailed almost every single character, with the exception of maybe one of them that I will get to. Now I get to the three complaints I have heard from my friend. First, the movie felt incredibly long, and maybe this is just me but this felt so short to me, like a one hour special on the TV series almost, I personally could sit down and watch 10 hours of the X-men. Second was the movie wasn't explained about certain parts, without going into spoilers they had said it was very confusing at parts, which most of them aren't as familiar with the universe as me so I like to say that is the reason. Now we get to the main villain which if you haven't seen it understand that Apocalypse is a flawed villain in general and probably the highest degree of difficulty to pull off, now with this in mind I thought they did a great job to still get the character right. I would definitely love more and more of the X-men movies as they are still my favorite franchise thus far, and I can say they are definitely certain problem that I might have missed that I turn a blind eye to because they nailed the X-men so well.Hayden's score: 9.4/10 Definitely go check it out, this movie should be making a ton more financially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I paid my money and went to see X-MEN: Apocalypse. I am an eternal optimist and although I was terribly disappointed with the first 2 Bryan Singer X-MEN movies (I mean... character re-write of Rogue was criminal). I thought maybe he would get it right this time. Unfortunately, my optimism was not repaid and the movie was again disappointing. In my opinion the problem is the stories, then are just so bland which is a direct result of the Bryan Singer re-writes from the original X-Men stories, which were awesome. BUT... Bryan Singer does not limit his poor quality story telling to the X-Men movies - No! Just look at the awful Superman returns movie from 2006. This was the pinnacle of boredom and was the worst superman story I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Maybe Hollywood is happy to throw money at poor quality stories at the expense of CGI and special effects but the paying public (I hope) will not tolerate this forever. I will avoid movies directed by Bryan Singer going forward....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest X-Men film isn't completely dreadful, but you may be tempted to cancel the Apocalypse after watching it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to fault anyone for approaching X-Men: Apocalypse with optimism. 20th Century Fox has consistently failed the Fantastic Four, but they've had a better track record in recent years with Marvel's mutants. We've been #blessed with Bryan Singer's Days Of Future Past, a brainy, bold thrill ride that uses its myriad characters to excellent effect in telling a time-twisted tale of doom and? well, apocalypse. Tim Miller's snarky, wacky Deadpool proved without a doubt that the studio is willing to take a risk on a cult property and let it explode all over the silver screen, rather than neuter it out of hand. With Singer back on board and a top-notch cast, hopes are understandably high for the cataclysmic confrontation suggested by the title of this latest entry in the X- Men franchise.We're even promised the holy grail of X-Men villains: ancient mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac, buried under too many layers of make-up and prosthetics). This righteous blue-hued dude, with his huge but poorly defined power-set, is an iconic antagonist for our band of superheroes in the comics: he's been known to lay waste to Earth in the past, present and future. In Singer's incarnation, Apocalypse's four Horsemen include wing-tipped Angel (Ben Hardy); weather witch Storm (Alexandra Shipp); energy-blade-wielding Psylocke (Olivia Munn); and a bitter, broken Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender). It's up to Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his X-Men ? superpowered students that include younger versions of uber-powerful Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Cyclops/Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) ? to stop Apocalypse from claiming the entire world for himself. Along the way, shape-shifter Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) must decide just how she can best contribute to the mutant cause in which she so firmly believes. Here's the thing: keep your expectations low ? lower ? lowest ? and X-Men: Apocalypse may just pass muster. This is a cookie-cutter blockbuster, sliced and diced together with more efficiency than heart. It dutifully ticks boxes as it chugs along: Apocalypse recruits his acolytes. Magneto loses his heart and soul (again). Charles and Raven discuss and disagree on tactics. Superheroes face off. It's all strung together with several sequences of world- destroying action, filmed in true Roland Emmerich style. Devotees of both the movies and the comics will find things to enjoy: a twitchy, endearing young Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who looks very much like a demon but is deeply devout; another deeply amusing explosion of special effects as fan favourite Quicksilver (Evan Peters) zips through a hilarious rescue mission; and an already publicised cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that will drive fans berserk.But think a little harder or poke at its shaky plot, and X-Men Apocalypse falls apart quite readily. The truth is that much of this film is neither inspired nor inspiring. It's okay, for the most part, but it's never great, and barely ever good. Simon Kinberg's script is a limp affair, recycling bits that worked better in other movies in the franchise but breaking very little new ground. The stakes are insanely high, but the threat never feels genuine ? a feeling that is only reinforced by the clumsy and anti-climactic way in which the final showdown takes place. Can we say deus ex machina? Yes, we can.The character work that lends so much emotion and power to earlier installments like First Class and Days Of Future Past is missing here too. Too much of the story relies on emotional connections that aren't established too well, and which can only be supplied by the viewers themselves. The film meanders without much purpose through its many relationships, staging a series of first meetings or reunions that basically amount to: Jean and Cyclops meet cute! Charles and Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) meet cute! Raven and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) meet cute! But very little of it sparks to life, and there's a troubling disregard for female agency, too, that fuels Magneto's entire emotional arc in this film. We're also told why Moira disappeared in between films, but she's not given any time to forgive what she has had to forget. At least Singer's cast does good work with what little they are given. As a re-energised Charles, McAvoy is as appealing and charming as ever. Fassbender remains a gift to the franchise: he imbues Erik with the perfect blend of heartbreak and hatred, which serves as a potent reminder of why he makes a far better antagonist than the automaton-on-evil-autopilot that is Apocalypse. In the context of the film, Lawrence delivers a decent performance. But it's still hard to shake the feeling that she's miscast in the role, with her explosive star power prompting the filmmakers to transform Raven into someone pretty much unrecognisable to comic readers. In just eight years, the genre that was once treated as the difficult bastard stepchild of the movie industry has come fully into its own. It's only May and we've already seen three superhero films hit cinemas ? Captain America: Civil War: excellent; Deadpool: awesome; Batman v Superman: awful. This latest installment in the X- Men franchise falls on neither extreme. It displays a couple of flashes of brilliance, but not enough to drag it out from the uncomfortable middle ground of mediocrity it occupies. Here's hoping Singer (if he signs on to direct) and Kinberg find their footing again with the inevitable follow-up to X-Men: Apocalypse ? we've already been told that it will be set in the '90s, with a rather obscure end-credits scene teasing just where the franchise will go next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Superhero Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not without flaws. So, why did I give it a perfect score? Because no movie is without flaws and this one surpassed my expectations and took me on a journey that I had never been on before. Now, this movie is not to be watched as a standalone film. If you are thinking about watching this movie, watch First Class and Days of Future Past back to back. The reason for this is because Apocalypse has so much emotion packed into it that it would be lost if you haven't recently watched the previous two. That being said, this movie was incredibly balanced on the emotional scale. I found myself feeling anger, sadness, happiness, and suspense at different, perfectly timed points throughout the film. There was never a dull moment or a scene I could cut out. Everything just worked. That being said, there were a couple of minor flaws, all of which can be overlooked by the full scale of the movie. I also must applaud director Bryan Singer, as he managed to take over 10 super-powered mutants, put them all in one movie, and give them all equal standing throughout the film. I didn't see too much of one character or too little of another (though I would've liked to see more of all of them). Every character had their strengths and weaknesses that fit together with their own individual stories. And my biggest praise for this film is that it did something that no other superhero movie has really done for me: every character pushed the limits of their powers. It wasn't like the Avengers where every time they throw their hammer or punch a bad guy they don't even show a sign of struggle. I could feel the characters giving it their all as they fought off a truly formidable foe. Everything in this movie worked: the humor, the action, the story; all of it. I could nitpick here and there, but I won't, because it seems like the rest of the critics have done enough of that already. If you go into this movie with the last two under your belt and an open mind, you will come out feeling like you can take on the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another boring superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that this X-men movie was good. I did enjoy the last one but I thought this was just a rehash of the same old thing. Aliens have always seemed to have a fascination with Egypt at least that's what the movies would like us to believe. So here comes another mutant creature here to take over the world followed by fight scene etc. The actors were good even though my daughter was a little confused by Storm you'd have to know a lot about the comics to understand why she would be in Egypt. I did feel sorry for Magneto and Mc Avoy's professor X has always been good. It was nice I guess that they included Wolverine. I just wasn't blown away by the story; well how many times can you take over the world and not get bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse feels like an X-men comic, but it comes at a cost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"X-men: Apocalypse" is the first X-men film (aside from the "Deadpool" 2016 spin-off film) that feels like it almost completely embraced the comic book series. The new characters are mostly teenagers who are unsure/frightened of how to use their powers, and the villain, Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac), is the first straight-up comic book style X-men villain that isn't Magneto (Michael Fassbender), or another human villain such as William Stryker (Josh Helman).This entry in the XCU has been met with mixed reviews from professional critics. Some are saying it "paves the way" for the franchise to grow in a new and fresh direction, while others are bashing it when comparing it to ground breaking films in the franchise (such as "X-men: Days of Future Past,"2014).I happen to see a lot of strengths in this film, but also a few weaknesses as well. Let me start with the strengths."X-men: Apocalypse," first of all, does not feel like another typical "Bryan Singer X-men film" (which might be where some of the criticism comes from).Singer does not repeat the slow build up that films, such as "X2" (2003) and "X-men: Days of Future Past," had before they build up to the final climax. The whole film (despite being one of the longest running films in the franchise at 2 hours and 24 minutes) flows by rather quickly. I never once got distracted or started wondering when this film would end, like I have with other comic book films.Singer also manages to make the action flow throughout the whole film. Many complained about how little action there was in "X-men: Days of Future Past" when compared to the dialogue, but "Apocalypse" manages to make equal time for talk and action and often combines the two together.The new cast members also impressed me, though some get more screen time than others. Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) finally is given his due justice, and has some of the best character development than he has ever had in the previous films. Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) also impressed me (I was very concerned about her casting after the first trailer), and Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smith McPhee) proves yet again that he is one of the most likable characters, next to Quicksilver (Evan Peters).Other new characters get decent amounts of screen time, though maybe not as much as they deserved from a fans standpoint. Psylocke (Olivia Munn) was one who I really enjoyed on screen and hope to see more of in the future (possibly in an upcoming Deadpool sequel or X-Force movie).Also, don't worry about the "First Class" cast, they get great and equal amounts of screen time as well. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) didn't take over the film like the trailers tried to make you believe, and she was written in a way that made her character's previous development useful for the plot, and not forced because of a contract.Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy both impress yet again in their strong emotional performances as younger Magneto and Charles Xavier. I hope the X-franchise continues to use them in future films, because they are magic on screen.Lastly, Evan Peters Quicksilver proves yet again that he has the most fun character in the film. If you liked his "Days of Future Past" scene, you will absolutely love his newest scenario. His role is much bigger in this film and a lot of the humor comes from his character alone.Now that I've sung my praises, it is time for some negatives. The biggest flaw in "X-men: Apocalypse" is that the film doesn't quite reach the intellectual and emotional impact that we have come to expect from previous films in the franchise (especially the ones made by Bryan Singer). There isn't much to talk/think about with the "Civil Rights" metaphors (in fact this film barley acknowledges it), and even the religious metaphors and ideas such as Apocalypse being a "false god" fall short and aren't given enough time to sink in.Apocalypse as a character also feels somewhat one-dimensional in how he wants to destroy/cleanse the world. He is never truly defined as a character, despite Oscar Isaac giving his all to the role. When he is convincing the horsemen to join him, it isn't given much thought or reason to why they join him (other than Magneto). Towards the end of the film the character improves as a villain, but by then we still don't really understand much about him. In a way this is refreshing though, because it gives the other X-men room to grow as characters and we get to watch them have fun fighting someone other than Magneto, again.In the end, "X-men: Apocalypse" is a solid film in the franchise and is probably one of the most entertaining films they've made. Intellectuals and fans of Bryan Singer's older X-men films may be somewhat disappointed, but the film has proved that this franchise still has new life and stories to tell.I look forward to seeing where things go from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superhero epic of glorious ambition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I trust professional critics in many scenarios. On many occasions, I tend to agree with the critical consensus for the most part. However, sometimes the critical consensus falls into a viewpoint I cannot bring myself to agree with. The film has some serious issues in regards to its pacing and treatment of some of the cast, however, X-Men: Apocalypse has managed to do something no other comic book film to date has ever done to date, to bring the scope of the original comic's mythos successfully to the screen. The films begins in 3600 B.C. as a rebellion in ancient Egypt causes the god-like mutant Apocalypse into a long stasis. In 1983 as Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has taken charge of a new generation of mutants at his school and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is living a life of peace with a family. However, their idyllic lives are now threatened by the re-emergence of Apocalypse, who recruits four powerful mutants to be his horseman in a mad quest to take over the entire planet. It is up to the X-Men, old and new, to stop him. Apocalypse has been widely criticised as being extremely dull and with a 144-minute runtime, the film definitely takes its sweet time getting to the grand finale. But what it does use that expansive runtime for is key bits of world building, and as a comic-book and literature fan, I'll take good world building over a rushed, propulsive plot any day. Apocalypse has an epic scale, and the massive build up certainly helps to add weight to the explosive climax, but some elements of the film's scale work against it. The cast is huge and many members are either underutilised or under-written to an embarrassing degree. Magneto has a compelling, dramatic story in the film's beginning, but gets little to no resolution when the dust clears. The Four Horsemen are the worst offenders, with Storm, Psylocke and Angel practically having about 5 lines of dialogue between them in the entire film. However, the rest of the film's cast manages to salvage their parts in fantastic fashion. Singer used Days of Future Past to establish the 'First Class Timeline' as standing alongside but separate to the original X-Men film universe and James McAvoy continues to distinguish himself as a different Professor X who's funny and yet heartfelt performance stands alongside Patrick Stewart's iconic portrayal of the character. Newcomers Scott Summers/Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler bring a fresh and welcome set of perspectives to the film and it's nice to finally see a Cyclops audiences can truly empathise with on screen. Oscar Isaac does the best he can as the maniacal main villain, Apocalypse, but the character is fairly one-dimensional and audience reactions to him will be hit or miss depending on your preference. A character that has been proved to be consistently excellent and a standout, though, is Evan Peter's Quicksilver, who plays a much larger and more involved role here than his previous outing in Days of Future Past. He has another standout, spectacle scene and probably the best action sequence in the film all to himself. This speedster is right on the money with solid characterisation and a strong performance from Peters. Despite all negatives I could pick up on with the slow-moving plot, some weak sections of the cast and a few other completely forgettable technical nit-picks, Apocalypse certainly knows how to show its audience a good, fan-service filled time. One thing I could never criticise the X-Men franchise of is becoming stale, especially Singer's entries, which is a lot more than I can say for most of Marvel's last few entries in their cinematic universe. With the original film, Singer redefined the superhero genre in cinema, with X-2 he created a multi-layered conflict between multiple factions of humans and mutants and with Days of Future Past he gave audiences a gripping time travel adventure. Apocalypse takes a step even further away from the franchise's 'based in reality' roots but does so with grandeur and confident swagger, while retaining a sense of realistic emotion and genuinely funny humour that never overplay's itself. The film is a behemoth, a comic-book epic of a level of ambition I've never seen successfully put to screen before. The film does something that no other film has ever done: made me feel like I'm watching a comic brought to life from page to screen right before my eyes, and the feeling is absolutely glorious. The action is electrifying, the powers bright and flashy and displayed in their full glory, from Psylocke's energy sword to Cyclops eye beam. This is X-Men for the people who loved the original stories in their Chris Claremont days or grew up watching the 1992 animated series. The soundtrack even gets into the sometimes ridiculous mood of things, jumping from eighties pop to a grand, bombastic score when appropriate. By time the obviously shoehorned in Weapon X appearance comes into play, you're too immersed in the spectacular gravitas of the film to care and you've strapped yourself securely in for a rollicking good time. In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse ends up being one of the most memorable comic-book films to date, perhaps because it is easily the most comic-booky film I've seen yet, in that it showcases this set of compelling super-powered characters in an event of such grand scale, I thought it could only appear on the page. Ignore the critics and make your way down to your local cinema to make up your own mind. Any fan of superheroes, especially of X-Men, will most likely appreciate the ambition on display here, even more so that it works so splendidly. In my opinion, it's far superior to Civil War. In fact, X-Men: Apocalypse may well be my favourite comic-book film since X-2 came out in 2003, and it definitely serves as an appropriate send-off to the 'First Class' as a new generation of X-Men begins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not DOFP but still a great installment into the franchise that is rewarding and sets up the future of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apocalypse is a great mix of what we've come to see from the current trilogy and like the third part in any series it takes shots at itself in great ways while still holding a serious tone. Some of the highlights of the film include the new batch of X-Men of Jubilee, Cyclops, Night crawler and Jean Grey. The overall humor in the film could be the best of any X-Men movie in the series with several cleverly placed comments.The set up for future chapters in the series, and ultimately the ending scene as well as the post credit scenes should have any fan of the comics excited about the movie and the future of the franchise.The villain in the series is the pen ultimate villain of the X-Men comic books and although I didn't feel he was done justice given how menacing he is in the 2D world, I felt they did a good job bringing him into the franchise and ultimately creating a legitimate threat against the X-Men as a whole.All in all the movie is in the upper echelon of all comic book movies, and although it's not my personal favorite in the series it holds it's own and has more mature tone then most of the bubble gum comic movies we see these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fearless. Solid. X.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the proof that the screen adaptation for a story arc from the comics can, indeed, be changed, if that change is for the best.A lot of characters to take in? Certainly, but not to worry: they were somehow able to handle it perfectly. Each character has its own importance and development (ok, not Jubilee, she is barely in the film), and that is one of the keys for a perfect script. Also, it can sometimes be very cruel and down to Earth, which is perfect, considering the giant number of movies/TV shows afraid of killing their important characters, for example. That's why I call this script a fearless one. It's not about the audience, not about what's going to happen in the future. It's about delivering a good story in the present.By the way, Simon Kinberg has, again, done a great job here. Same goes to Bryan Singer. Perfect rhythm, very well thought-out connections, characters' interactions all on point, and that list goes on and on. Surprisingly, it contains all the elements for an awesome superhero movie. Plus, I must say I couldn't be happier with how the whole movie revolves around the true meaning of "family", and the different forms of it.It's a 9/10 because of some repetitions from old movies through the script, mostly with Erik Lehnsherr. It's basically everything we've seen before (twice). His resolutions are so the same I had the feeling even some quotes were identical. That feeling of "oh, I've seen this before somewhere" it's not so good here, unfortunately.Overall, a very nicely done film that you can't miss. DO NOT listen to the critics or that friend who's comparing this to other superhero movies. This is X-Men: Apocalypse and it's everything it intends to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me'n the missus headed off on a date-day to the movies and we saw, by mutual agreement, X-Menapocalypse. It's always a good opportunity to suss out what may tickle our future fancies and there was a poster advertising 'BFG' which quite took my fancy until the child-bride hushed me correcting me in front of strangers by pointing out that it was a 'Big FRIENDLY Giant'.The X-Men starts off quite well. It is set in ancient Egypt and there is a pyramid and we get the chance to say 'Oooh, we've been there' and there is a Klingon who is going to be made live forever by getting dead-guy juice from, well, a dead guy. But things go amiss due to various heroic efforts by blokes with spears and a great big rock that slides into the pyramid. The Klingon, who turns out to be the first mutant and who is called Apocalypse, is buried. I think that's his name anyway. I can't remember anyone actually calling him that but.He's reanimated of course. If he wasn't it woulda been a PFS movie. He learns our languages by watching Egyptian TV. Good luck with THAT. I know two words of Arabic. 'Laa' and 'Insh'allah' both of which practically mean 'No' Apocalypse doesn't really carry off the super-powerful nasty. For a start, he wears platform shoes and these diminish his air of malice significantly. The impression is more that of an unimaginatively made-up Gene Simmons than, say, your full blown Sauron, the Dark Lord. Or Darth Vader. He puts together an army, and it's a pretty small one ? 'the 4 Horsemen' but they don't have horses so the are just the 4 Men. Well they aren't all men so they aren't even that. The 4 Skins? Dunno. He gives them X-men gifts which are surprisingly modest given his supposed omnipotentness. Whips and skimpies are fine for relaxation, but not really your first choice for world domination. He does have a formidable weapon in Magnet-Man who gets a fancy-dan helmet and can do good hovering Apocalypse and his 4skins are pitted against Sansa Stark, whose time with the funster Ramsay Bolton has taught her a trick or two about survival and some of these tricks are going to make future intimacies unpredictable at best and positively lethal if she's 'just not in the mood'.A contractual obligation is met when Wolverine takes out a heap of baddies then runs off to duel bears and suchlike.Nuclear weapons are unleashed on an unsuspecting solar system. The Sydney Opera House is destroyed.I won't spoil the experience by giving away the ending, although a sequel that is also a prequel leaves little room for maneuvering on the outcome.Would've been heaps improved with Deadpool and Daenerys Targaryen. What wouldn't be improved by Daenerys Targaryen? We've suffered so you don't have to!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good job Marvel, you ruined X-Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, this review will be free of spoilers, all this will be is my reaction and thought on this movie.I got to see this movie for free with a very good friend of mine that works at my local Movie Theatre. I had high hopes for this movie, due to my personal opinion that the franchise of X-Men had been on a steady increase in quality of their productions.While sitting in the Theatre, I started to look around. In this small, packed screening room of around 40 people, I noticed only around 3 people where actually paying attention. I noticed around 5-6 people actually stand up and just leave this movie, I also noticed around 10 people sleeping, and the volume level in the room was high due to discussion. And the best part is, there was someone sitting of front of me who simply just decided to watch YouTube just right then and there.If that isn't bad enough, the story was bland and barren, and the parts of the movie that seemed to have somewhat potential, where eventually also ruined by the poor story of this film. The film seemed to go on and on. A good movie could tell the same story in half the time.I honestly would have had more fun and entertainment getting a blood test.Marvel had released a few films that had set the bar high for me on this film, but this was just so beyond marvel. Good job Marvel, you ruined X-Men.If you are a fan of a movie with CGI that will simply give you a migraine after about 3 minutes of continuous attention, and a movie with a bland story that will put you to sleep, I would highly recommend this movie.As my final thoughts, I would strongly recommend for you to save your money. This movie is a waste of time. This movie is a joke. This movie is a failure. Due to this, I would rate the movie X-Men: Apocalypse a 1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like to mindlessly waste an hour or two of your precious existence, then possibly this cinematic garbage might be for you. However, if you want your cinema to be entertaining, then stay well away. This movie could (and should) have had at least 30 minutes cut from the running time. The pacing is so slow and not helped by the overuse of set CGI pieces that somehow were not thrilling at all. There was better stuff in The Mummy.This is lazy film making. And the response from the audience I was part of? A considerable amount of audible yawning.One of the worst films I've seen this year. Let's hope the plug is pulled on this franchise.

		<fullReview>This movie was a disappointment.I was so excited for this movie. The first trailer gave me chills. I was ready. I was prepared. I was lubricated. And you know what? This movie didn't go down smooth. It was long, rough, overstuffed, and worst of all, boring.You've seen the trailer. You know that Apocalypse wants to destroy the world. Why? Who knows at this point. There's "false Gods" and "idols" so he'll destroy the Earth "and from the ashes, build a better one!" But where's the real motivation? We've seen the "bad guy wants to destroy the world and make a better one" millions of times before, and seeing it once again was not exciting in the slightest. And Apocalypse wasn't even menacing either. What were his powers? Giving motivational speeches? Seriously, all Apocalypse does is talk and talk and say the exact same things over and over. However, he did have one AWESOME line that had to do with the Tower of Babel, but other than that nothing about his character was memorable or menacing.And what about the four horsemen? They hardly did a thing. Storm? Did nothing. Angel? Nothing. Psylocke? Nothing. They were recruited, and then dropped until the climatic battle scene at the end of the film. They weren't intimidating at all. Now, the film did a good job of setting them up (except for Psylocke in my opinion, she literally had almost nothing to do at all) but once they were recruited, I don't think they said a word ever again. They just stood there, fought a bit, and that was that.Now let's talk about Jennifer Lawrence. Please, for the love of God, get another actress. It looked like she wasn't even trying in the role. She looked so incredibly bored, so incredibly dull, that it looks like she was reading her lines directly off of the script. Everyone else at least looked like they were trying, and then Ms. Lawrence comes on screen and all enthusiasm is immediately gone. And I don't hate Jennifer Lawrence. I liked her in First Class a lot, but now it just looks like she doesn't even want to be in these movies anymore.There were some good things in this film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely fantastic in every scene they were in. Fassbender especially had a fantastic scene in the woods, and he was about to have a fantastic scene in his place of employment (you'll know it when you see it) that was instead ruined by Apocalypse intruding and ruining the momentum. I do want to say though, that the amount of tragedy that Magneto is now suffering in this series is ridiculous. They need to stop making this character suffer over and over just for the sake of him becoming a villain; at this point it's ludicrous. McAvoy is of course great (I haven't seen him play a bad role yet) and I really hope he continues to play this role well into the future.Quicksilver returns, and his scene was just as thrilling as it was in DoFP, if a bit longer and a tad drawn out. I liked Sophie Turner as Jean Grey a lot, even if her accent was a bit spotty at times. She really did seem to be bringing her all to the role, and I look forward to watching her in future installments. I also liked how gruesome this movie was for a PG-13 film. There were some bloody, gory parts in here that literally had my jaw hit the floor, as I didn't expect to see some of the things I saw in a PG-13 superhero movie. Also, there is a sequence, that I will not spoil, that includes some very violent and very raw action, that unfortunately takes place in a section of the movie that honestly could've been cut out. The sequence, however, is great. Overall, this movie was a big disappointment, and I'm sorry to say that. I honestly thought the movie was going to be great, as I absolutely adored the first trailer, but unfortunately it is not. You can't relate or understand where the villains are coming from (except for Magneto), so it's hard for the audience to be invested in them or to care about the stakes. The amount of destruction in this film is almost pornographic, yet there is no impact as all of the carnage is seen from a distance, and not from street level, so the audience feels disconnected to everything that is happening on screen, and in a film that desperately wants its audience to fear its villains and root for its heroes, this is unforgivable, as instead being of thrilled and invested, the audience is bored and detached.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best X-men Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A week before I saw the movie, I had read all the reviews coming about it. Mostly negatives. And, as the release date approach I kinda had doubts about this last installment. But I went ahead, because I love the casts and Bryan Singer. To my surprise, after I had watched it, my mind were still in awe from the movies. It's not as bad as the critics said. Sure, I am agree with those reviews regarding Apocalypse. But it is so forgivable because the X-men do a heck of a job getting rid of him. As for the fact that there are a lots of characters in there that made them seem a bit underdeveloped because lack of backgrounds,well you gotta admit that this is a 144 minutes movie, which could barely explains all those stories. I left the movie Theatre feeling heartbroken by some of the things that happened in the movie. Hats off to sophie Turner. She did a great job! Well if you love X-men franchise, you'll love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been better..fell short, missed opportunities.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the movie was childish and like a Saturday morning cartoon. the comics are better. the acting is good as all actors are top of their game. but the story left a lot to be desired. predictable. old same formula. the direction could have been better. interesting characters are not given enough screen time. story needs to be more mature. i understand that this needs to be kid friendly... but at the cost of the actual source material... i think stories need to be close to the canon... its not that i want to go a watch a movie that i have read in a comic book... i want to see the the movie improve on it... not rewrite history.overall i would watch it but not in the at the cinemas but wait to stream online... its been long enough we need the movies to grow with us not stay the same</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent attempt, but underwhelming finale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like people are too quick to rate this as either terrible or amazing. It is definitely somewhere between. Compared to the previous 2 amazing X-Men films, this one is disappointing. But it has a lot of good new characters and well directed action.Although Oscar Isaac gives a great performance, I feel like Apocalypse should be more physically intimidating or larger, rather than just showing off how powerful he is a few times. This is also due to a problem with pacing. I feel like Apocalypse shouldn't have been shown so much so early in the film, and there should have been a build up to the confrontation towards him and the X-Men. There was no sense of epic-ness when the two sides met, so it felt lacklustre. The motivations of the villain were boring and uninspiring. It would have been better if his goal was just to enslave and rule over the humans and abolish their technology, rather than just destroying everything and killing. It's because of this whole "we'll destroy everything they have build" thing, that it seems like there's not even any plan through the whole film.The final battle was underwhelming. For a mutant whose power is God- like I was expecting an all out offensive against him and some amazing displays of power with great visuals. In reality it wasn't anything that we hadn't seen before. A wasted opportunity to show off one of the most fearsome and intimidating villains of the X-Men. Aside from these major problems, most of the film was decent. The performances were all good and the action was well done. However, there are better action scenes in the previous 2 films and a lot better story elements than what is shown here.The word I would use to sum up X-Men:Apocalypse is DISAPPOINTING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men again. Y? (innovative pun intended, thank you very much)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Explosions. Devastations. Mutations. Guns. Powers. What the world is watching...A neat beginning with a intended story behind to be thrown into the evolution. A fascinating and interesting way of showing that the time passes on, through Christ and Jesus to Mona Lisa to airplanes to the World War II and so on right into the future; this made as an combination of computer signals going through the internet, a safe and a train passing through different episodes. Excellent made, indeed! Splendid!Oh my... one epic and memorable scene! I laughed hard! Genius, modern and on the spot! The thing I wonder is; does it fit into this kind of movie? Look it up; about 1 hour and 16 minutes into this motion picture. Astonishing! Remember... Flash Gordon would have seemed glued in superglue and tar during extreme slow motion. Sweet dreams are made of... speed?A little, subtle wink to Bruce Waynes Alfred in Batman. Girl lying in bed (in Batman Bruce Wayne is in bed), the father says "Never!"... as so does Alfred in Batman.There is a strong message behind and inside "X-Men: Apocalypse". Will humanity fall by its own hands? There is also "an description of how 'God' can act and be", just watch En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse. What if there is a "God" that is a mutant, can grasp everyones power to become almighty... and is just asleep and been so for thousands of years? Well, it is whatsoever in every way besides that a great story and can deliver fiction.This X-Men has transformed into a youth based fiction that better suits up into the category of let us say Hunger Games and Divergent. This... is a sad fact. The world is suffering from environmental threats, economic disasters, terror and then some... The movie industry suffers from inflation in special effects. And; period. As once said in movies; we need a bigger boat (Jaws).... we need big f****g guns (Split Second)...well, it could be one of those things that makes X-Men sink. Or am I wrong?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great effects and sound. - The actors : Has to connect more with emotions to deliver. However, Oscar Isaac is on the rising. - Entertainment : X-Men here, X-Men there... X-Men everywhere. Little entertaining, yeah. - Age : 115,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)</fullReview>

I just think it's not well written because in the second movie, when Kurt Wagner appears for the 1st time, Jean and storm don't recognize him.. and he played an important rule in this one, as they all, and the same about Logan since she helped him in the past.. and Raven, despite her opinion on helping mankind, she would never hurt Charles and in the first movie, she does.... And Eric would never leave her to "die" when she is "cured" in the 3rd movie.. i think but this is not my first concern but the others pointed are..other than that, i love x-men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having mixed feelings about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wouldn't be wrong to say that it is Bryan Singer's most mediocre Marvel attempt ever. Kind of a mixed baggage actually, has so many flaws and yet so many thrilling scenes to keep you riveted.X-MEN: APOCALYPSE ATTIRE En Sabah Nur is here. But no one takes him seriously. Is it the attire? Is it the other-worldliness? Or is it the fact that he gets scorned at so many times that people laugh at him? Or it could probably be the panache Oscar Isaac was missing? In the comical world Apocalypse is a complete badass, who makes death his servant. Even the animated series is trickling down with his inhumane acts. Here, not so much.SPOILERS X AHEAD: The good thing about the movie is that it is really dark. Death is a quickie affair and Singer doesn't stop singing with it throughout the flick. What he tries gorgeously this time to bring in the front-line is the spotlight Summers deserves and Tye Sheridan aces Scott to perfection. He gets a proper screen time unlike prequels with a really powerful laser shot that will give you happy feels for him.The high point of X-Men Apocalypse is Peter Maximoff hands down. He brings in a few laughs as he coolly sways around in bullet time to set things right. Watch out for that awesome bit! Michael Fassbender is still the pillar holding this X-Men timeline together. With his extraordinary acting prowess he makes Magneto one of the most revered characters ever. You can't help but feel sorry for the fate he ends up with every single time when he tries to do good. James McAvoy still does a great Charles. We finally get to see Alex Summers in action, but sadly it was ephemeral.DOWNSIDES OF X-MEN: APOCALYPSE I didn't like the fact that Singer decided to go with a theatrical resounding voice for Apocalypse whenever he would try to jackhammer a point. Also, Apocalypse isn't really psychotic, not at all terrifying to look at, and it would seem hanging out with him wouldn't be a problem. His regalia quite odd and the flair we expected in him badly missing.That Wolverine bit in the X-Men: Apocalypse will definitely give you the jitters, but Jean trying to pacify the animal seemed so forced that you wonder where the subtlety is. We could have lived without it Bryan! At times the movie flings into uncalled corners where you can pinpoint the incongruity and the missing gravity. Characters don't spend time grieving or even wonder-struck at what's happening. We can blame editing for that.OTHER MCU CHARACTERS IN X-MEN: APOCALYPSE We see Jubilee here and finally some Sentinels that will fill you up with the animated series' nostalgic vibes. Blob cameo was a pleasant wink. Eventually we get a glimpse at what's coming in Wolverine 3 which makes MCU imminence a delectable treat. Wink at Mister Sinister! But you still overlook it all since it is a comic after all. Things are supposed to hole that way. All in all it was really entertaining.There is no better way to put it as Jean, who says,"At least we can all agree the third one is always the worst".I am not going to debate on that. She just proves the point, as if Bryan knew midway that X-Men: Apocalypse was going to end up in shambles, and tries to justify the movie with that sneer.All in all, X-Men: Apocalypse is nothing but a one time forgetful watch.Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Villain? What Villain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I left this movie feeling extremely distraught at the fact that Apocalypse' power was NOT erected with any justice. We are talking about one of the top 5 or 6 most powerful villains in the marvel universe, and the movie does not paint that portrait. The justification will never be found in my eyes as how you can sub-title a movie after a villain and have him play such little role and not be brought to life as he much as he should have. If Apocalypse could have been more of an instrument in creating a plot other than "hes the bad guy, we need to beat him." But I do feel like I need to watch the film again just to double check that I am on track here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comic book movie from the 90's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-men has always had a huge place in my heart in terms of the franchise and the comic book. When the first X-men movie came out, I gushed on how good it was and how perfect the film was. I was upset when Singer left the franchise and we had the Last Stand... but now we have a new Last Stand. X-men Apocalypse.Right off the bat, the first 10 minutes, you get the tone of the film... this is a pure comic book movie from the 90's. You have an ancient setting with pyramids and a bunch of poorly done CGI shots and mounds of fake people cheering their mutant god. It's campy... it looks awful... and then the sequence is just so awful where it ends with a scene of the floor collapsing and a never ending drop sequence where a battle ensues. It reminded me of the 90's cartoons which would have been fine if we didn't have the previous X-men movies that set a more dramatic tone for the franchise.The rest of the tone throughout the movie is dramatic and rushed. You should know all of the mutants that you see like Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Jubilee, Angel, Psylocke, etc... oh you don't know who those guys are? Well you're out of luck from any back story, they are here and you should have done your research.The action sequences are dreadful. There was a scene in a prison where I just couldn't believe how bad the fight sequence was. Sure there was blood, but it was so anti-climatic that I just couldn't believe it.I'm so disappointed in the film and I guess they should have just left the franchise with Days of Futures Past which was a great closure to the franchise.</fullReview>

But let's be honest, as we got further away from the first X-men, which was a fantastic, full-fledged coming-to-life of the comics, it's got boring and boring. This one was just CGI.You couldn't much improve on anything. Acting was very good and so were the visual effects, but pretty much everything else was nothing cohesive.The point is, lower your expectations than you would, keep the TV on and have some popcorn, maybe do the dishes if you're at home.

		<shortDescription>Amazing (No Spoilers!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse to me is one of the best X-Men films along with X- men Days of Future Past. The film picks up 10 years after the events of X-Men Days of Future Past, but the film also deals with some of the events that happened in X-Men First Class.Pros:I believe that the X-Men movie franchise is mainly to do with the story of Magneto, and how the tragic events in his life have affected him. X-Men Apocalypse shows the real emotion of Magneto and makes us as an audience understand why he does what he does. Michael Fassbneder really understands the character of Magneto and that helps with his performance.The way they introduced the new characters in this film was done really well. They didn't just chuck them in the film just for fan service (although they do give fan service) they fitted perfectly with the film and the actors made the pages of the comics come to life.Cons:I didn't feel that invested in the character of Apocalypse. Not saying that he was badly acted, I just found that he wasn't that interesting of a character and that made him for me the most boring part of the film.The character of Angle portrayed by Ben Hardy, if found to be a very week character and felt like he was only in the film so they could have all 4 horse man.Conclusion: The film is very entertaining and has a lot of memorable moments and it sets up for future films to come. The film also has a lot of re-play value and most decently worth buying on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but mostly forgettable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Days of Future Past, despite the puzzled narrative and cloudy second half it was still a hugely entertaining film that I could return to any day. X-Men: Apocalypse however, feels more dull than awesome.There are some truly great concepts that I'll get to later, but I constantly got this feeling that this film was just padding for this series. They wanted one more film, and so tacked on another unnecessary concept and storyline.Now, it's great seeing Nightcrawler back after his last appearance in X2, and he once again makes for a cool character, but just like most of the cool characters in this film, he does very little.That's one of the big problems with this film, the plot is on autopilot. No-one needs to really do anything because the plot's moving along by itself. Mystique spends the first half of the film running around doing... something that has little relevance to anything really, and Nightcrawler just tags along for most of the story.Cyclops makes a return, only to again do very little. He only becomes important during the film's climax where he joins the fight against Apocalypse.Oh boy, let's talk about Apocalypse. He's the bad guy, that's about it. This has to be one of the most boring villains in the series. He wants to destroy everything, simple as. There's no struggle, there's no character whatsoever. He's little more than a plot device.However there is one character I would like to talk about, and that's the legendary Quicksilver. His introduction at Xavier's academy beats the classic kitchen scene from Days of Future Past 100 times over. It's such an awesome scene.And I guess I kinder like Jean Grey as well as her telekinetic powers make for some nice scenes. But everyone else feels like they're just along for the ride, and that extends to the villains to.Apocalypse barely even has to try to convince Angel and Storm to join him, two characters who should've been awesome but just spend their time standing in the background while the real antagonist makes his demands.Visually, this is a good looking film. The GCI is OK although I dare say they could've been a little more imaginative but it works so I won't go too deep. The make up effects are highly impressive most of the time and nothing stands out to me as looking cheap or unconvincing.The acting is the best thing about this film. Sophie Turner and Evan Peters are my favourites but everyone is doing their best with what they've been given. Even Lana Condor who, considering this was her first ever acting role, is doing a great job.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse isn't bad, but it could've been so much more. Unlike most of it's predecessors, the imagination just isn't there. The characters are little more than plot devices, the villains are uninteresting and most of it just feels like the film trying to keep itself going under the weight of strong but badly constructed themes.The plot is thin, the characters are weak and the whole thing is entirely forgettable, but at least we'll always have the Quicksilver scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For what it is - entertainment with familiar characters - it definitely delivers. It was refreshing to see the characters use their powers as we've been expecting since the first movie, although the relatively new cast don't have the screen presence to draw us completely in. Fassbender and McAvoy are flawless in their roles, and it makes you question what kind of film this is - an action adventure comic book film, or a gut-wrenching exploration of what one is capably of after they've lost everything.There lacks the cohesion that the first two films had (the third doesn't exist), and kind of jumps between awkward humour and heavy drama. Some reveals and build up fall flat or seem too obvious. But like I said, we get to see our childhood heroes and villains really kick ass and wreck havoc. I had a lot of fun watching it. And I was never really a fan of Quicksilver before, but let's say after this film, I think he's kinda cool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse. .The film succeeds as a gripping often fascinating entertainment and that is without doubt an achievement. The film begins with a panorama of timeless ripples of sand lapping at the base of a massive Pyramid whose blue iridescent Ankh alerts us to changed conditions on the ground. It is 3600 BCE, 500 years before the unification of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms. At that time the dominant cult was Horus, the source of the gold encasing of the antagonist En Sabah Nur (Apocalypse) played with skill by Oscar Isaac. Skill is needed given the over application of greenish make up that confines acting to the eyes and the odd self satisfied smile. Why not? RelIcs are to be observed or worshipped not interacted with. Over the establishing shot we hear the wise voice of the Professor Xavier, the excellent James McAvoy who at the end will experience a physical transformation as his hair dissolves and he becomes the figure of Zen authority so memorably played by Patrick Stewart. Given the work it takes to bring down Apocalypse, thoughtful exhaustion is note perfect."Mutants born with extraordinary abilities and yet still they are children stumbling in the dark, searching for guidance , a gift can often be a curse ?" There is no better way to begin really. This is a trope Mr Kinman plays like a virtuoso; the ambiguities of power. Within the figure of Apocalypse we see the embodiment of the gift that is the poison, the creation of stability through destruction. Apocalypse has an agenda which nicely bridges the world of Pharaonic thought with well as its modern version the magic of fascism. The annual inundation of the Nile, the flooding that made agriculture possible was guaranteed by rituals of worship and continuities of royal control. The body of the Pharaoh itself was to be preserved forever, continuities were managed on a terrestrial and celestial basis.The misconceived effect of loyalty to supreme power (fertility of the Nile delta) is reiterated historically with the lure of fascism. Isn't the extreme of right wing discourse a clarion call to return to the old days, of better times when things weren't so bad? Men were men and women were helpmates. This return is in part facilitated by forms of social cleansing, a purge.Mutants find him attractive in part because as Professor Xavier has already told us they are lost children in a cruel world. How quickly they respond to his paternalism and an augmentation of their mutant powers promising liberation from past enslavement, making the world the way it should be. Apocalypse knows how the world works, he learns it from the young Storms' telly, sifting through all the paranoiac images of the 80's to conclude that it is nuclear weaponry that is the strongest control mechanism. In the same sequence he concludes that Magneto is one of the strongest mutants. That is until he encounters Professor X within Cerebro (the shiny aluminium augmentation of his mind, a pre internet world wide web that first appeared in 1964) that allows him to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. We find Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto working in a Polish steel mill, and living with a sweet wife and daughter in a tree filled paradise. This of course would have been a reality that might have been possible had there been no final solution and the consequent experiments conducted on him in Auschwitz which increased his mutant strength would not have occurred. Note the timelessness of his workers cap, the simplicity of the home. This was precisely the idyll that was disrupted by the rise of the Reich , the steel mills of Eastern Europe co opted to produce war materials and steel and coal were the items most needed. Magnetos dream world hovers between two realities. When finally the thing that makes him different is exposed (saving a workmate from being crushed the instability caused by resurrection in distant Egypt of Apocalypse) the consequences are identical to that of wearing a yellow star during the Reich. There is the knock at the door, thugs outside, the slaughter of innocence. Magneto goes through it all again, as his true being is exposed ?only the uniforms are different. Again the cause of this moment is the irruption of the fascist impulse as embodied by apocalypse.What better way to seduce Magneto then than to take him to the physical memorial to his past; the abandoned shell of Auschwitz. Naturally its destruction can only be the destruction of a building, removing the shell neither erases memory or its future as an object of pain but it works ?for a while. The point is that the destruction we see, is precisely the promise of Fascism, the promise of a new way by simply tearing down the old. The transference of the aberrant Apocalypse into the modern world can only be defeated by modernisms impulses of democracy and consultative collaborative management. "You will never win" says a virtually crushed Professor from under the super enlarged fist of arrogant Apocalypse "You are alone?I am not."This choreography of team talent against an individual oppressor has become so ubiquitous that is is beyond formulaic, it is inevitable. Think of the Avengers, the Justice league, the Fantastic Four, even a team whose boardroom might be more chaotic like the Suicide Squad. That's not to mention the multitude of cameos from other super beings that have appeared in films like Ant Man, Captain America and I'll stop there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie met and exceeded my every expectation for the Apocalypse villain story-line. I only had vague memories of the cartoon but this movie amplified them to a new extreme. And my one stipulation, that Apocalypse be, by far, the strongest and most bad-ass mutant ever but still with a rational plan and an undeterable love of his mutant brethren, was easily satisfied. The one thing I remember thinking, about halfway through the movie, is this going to be a two-parter? But whether or not that is the case this movie ended with no disappointments. And if you like the movie and the X-men mythos you'll want to stay through the end of the credits because there is a little bit that implies what the next story-line will be about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is far more enjoyable than the previous one because it doesn't try to be serious and sophisticated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"X-Men: Apocalypse" is seen as a disappointment by almost many fans after "The Days of Future Past", but I think "Apocalypse is a better film on many counts. "TDOFP" didn't have comics tone, the movie took itself too seriously, the story was basic, but it tried to be sophisticated etc. "X-Men: Apocalypse" is a fun ride, but also it has also an intelligent story. The opening scene and the villain En Sabah Nur reminds me "The Mummy" and it was entertaining! Yes, Raven played by Lawrence has no big function in the story, she is just there, but I've started to like her character, even if I know the fact that nobody can surpass Rebecca Romijn. The parts which we visit each character with them are very interesting and enjoyable. Magneto's past being revealed was creepy and sad and masterfully done! It shows the dawn of evil inside him. "Two new students (Jean Grey and Cyclops) in a boarding school meet and slowly fall in love" is a cliché story tool, but that's OK. The so called platonic love of Xavier was hilarious! Angel is darker and more intense here. We witness some very important moments in X-Men history, seeing what happens to the characters we know for a very long time etc. I need to confess that I was disappointed by Quicksilver here, because his new famous scene here is a rehash of "The Days of Future Past" unfortunately and that one was better for sure. This one was just funny, maybe hilarious, but definitely not jaw dropping like the previous one. The relationship between Charles and Magneto is gripping and impressive here like Shakespeare plays. Wolverine scene was perfect and the most brutal Wolverine scene in any Wolverine film so far! The climactic final part is an action packed. It could have been better, but with perfect CGI, little emotion and some team work, it just delivers and the mind games were very exciting! "Apocalypse" is a more entertaining and more colorful film than its predecessor. It has the perfect tone for a X-Men film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't expect much and I didn't get much. As a sci-fi movie it was good; as an X-men movie it felt barely average. Typical villain, the usual back and forth between mutants switching from one side to another, the Stan Lee cameo, the end credits scene. In the end, it didn't feel like anything.That was its largest flaw: with all the scenes of personal loss, mental torture, mass killing, shootings and evisceration I didn't feel one damn thing. Personal loss was used as a generic token to change someone's behavior in a way that made no sense, the torture and the killing were carefully doctored to show almost no blood and no people that one might feel connected to in any way. Surely we are all used to faceless soldiers dying in droves and even if you know rationally that the New York bridge and the Sydney opera and the entire city of Cairo were full of people, you don't see any bodies, any suffering and the movie makes sure you don't care.What was the purpose of it all, then, if all your efforts are pushed into CGI and making your audience not care? I know it's Marvel fatigue, but at the same time the movie was simply bland. And not by accident, but on purpose. Enjoy your two hours of heroic clichés and expensive special effects and, while you think of the plot and the characters, imagine you are watching the cartoon. It will help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse rises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvel continues its relentless production of superhero movies with Apocalypse, the latest episode in the X-Men saga. The eponymous villain, Apocalypse, the world's first mutant, rises from centuries of slumber and to say he's unhappy with the state of the world is an understatement. As you would with a name of Apocalypse, he decides the only way forward is to wipe out humanity and start again.This is the third in the X-Men prequel series and reunites the excellent McAvoy, Fassbender and clan. There are a number of additions to the roster this time, most noticeably Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner cast as a young Jean Grey. This is a great piece of casting with her resemblance to Famke Janssen (she's tall and has red hair) and she manages to deliver a decent performance as the mighty telekinetic.The story is about what you'd expect from a superhero movie: it has a lot of fighting. This isn't on a par with Avengers but it is consistent. There is some character development, particularly with Jean Grey and Magneto, but Apocalypse could have benefited from taking a lesson from First Class and show us a bit more of their personalities and conflicts.If you're suffering from superhero movie fatigue, there isn't a great deal here to change that except that X-Men has always been an ensemble performance and isn't focused on one character. Yes, Magento and Xavier dominate but most of the other characters have a decent amount of screen-time to add some variety and mix things up. The Horseman of the Apocalypse aren't particularly well-used though, and with Apocalypse as powerful as he is, you'd have to wonder why he even needs them. Perhaps all self-respecting megalomaniacs need flunkies to do their bidding and fetch coffee.X-Men: Apocalypse is a fun ride. There's a lot to enjoy and the action doesn't let up but it does follow the formulaic superhero movie format. If you like X-Men, this is a must see but don't expect anything too deep and meaningful. Oh, and yes, there is a post- credit scene too if you can face sitting through the credits (or buy it on DVD and forward past them).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The X-Men are back &amp; better than ever!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep it simple and short. The movie was flat out amazing. If you grew up watching the cartoons like X-Men The Animated Series, X-Men Evolution then you'll really love this film. The plot was excellent, made perfect sense, The scenes were vibrant &amp; awesome. Action packed, a great story overall. Had very emotional scenes. The Villain Apocalypse was superb Everyrhing a villain should be unlike Marvels Cinema villains Zemo, Ultron &amp; Loki who were awful. The heroes got their new amazing costumes &amp; the next one with Sinister will be great. Civil War was boring compared to this one. This movie along with DOFP &amp; First Class are the best trilogy. The movie was fun, not too dark but not too goofy like Marvel films. It had great scenes, with Magneto, Phoenix, Nightcrawler, Peter &amp; the horsemen. Overall fun movie, &amp; I recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie with epic scenes but some plot holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start of by saying this is my favourite of all the X- Men titles.--- Spoilers ---Apocalypse should of won... If anyone has seen this movie, they can see he can literally kill people by clicking his fingers or turning walls into dust. He could of killed Phoenix before she could do anything. He could of destroyed the entire world even if he did have Magneto's help. I also feel like there were way too many stories, Magneto was by far the best character and had the best story. Phoenix and Cyclops had a story and so did Quicksilver. Quicksilver's story was kinda pointless as he doesn't even finish it off. Cyclops' story was a tad boring as well and Phoenix I didn't even care about. Unfortunately for this movie they had to make Phoenix a story because they chose Apocalypse as the villain and not many can actually defeat him other than Phoenix.I gave this movie an 8 because some of the scenes were epic and Apocalypse was probably one of the most entertaining villains I have seen in the past 5 years. Magneto was also a huge part of my rating, he had the best story, best scenes and best acting. This is definitely worth watching and worth watching again. However it did tweak how it should of ended for movie viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse ? Review (Spoiler Free)X-men: Apocalypse is the third prequel to the (mostly) successful Xmen trilogy and it tells the story of the mutant Apocalypse (portrayed by Oscar Isaac) in his bid to control the world.Once again, Professor Charles Xavier (Professor X) is portrayed by James McAvoy, Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) by Michael Fassbender, Raven (Mystique) by Jennifer Lawrence and reprising her role as Moira MacTaggert is Rose Byrne. Once again, the three of them own their roles and give a very believable performance to the extent that had Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen not played the original roles of their respective characters, you wouldn't be able to envision anyone else playing the iconic characters.Also returning in this is Nicholas Hoult (Beast), Lucas Till (Havok), Evan Peters (Quicksilver) and a horde of other characters. There is a scene with Quicksilver that any viewer will be remembering and laughing about weeks after seeing and even the scenes where Quicksilver is only a minor character, he all but steals the show (Bryan Singer, please give us a Quicksilver solo movie). In this film we get to see young portrayals of Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and even Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit- McPhee) and whilst it may throw up some questions about their story lines in the original X-Men movies, especially X2, them being in the film works wonders.Whilst the pacing during the first act of the film lets it down a little bit, from one scene involving Magneto I was entirely hooked ? even the people sat around me talking could not distract me from the 2 hour 27 minute film.X-Men: Apocalypse uses a fair amount of CGI and I would say that it works well throughout. There's one particular scene during the last act where anything less than flawless CGI would have entirely spoilt the scene. Fortunately for us, it doesn't.Since Nick Fury showed up during the credits of Iron Man back in 2008, Marvel fans have usually had to wait behind after the film ends for around 10 minutes to see an end/mid-credits scene which is usually a teaser for what is to come in the respective franchise and for X-Men: Apocalypse, Fox finally jumped on the bandwagon and gave us an end credit scene which clears up a surprise (unless you've seen the trailers) cameo that appears during the second act. Well, I say clears up but it also brings up 1001 more questions to be answered but then, isn't that the entire point to these end credit scenes?Overall, director Bryan Singer has delivered yet another outstanding X-Men film since taking back the reins of the franchise. As I said, a jumpy opening but once the events have all been established, it's a very engaging movie that I felt invested in for the vast majority of.I'm giving X-Men: Apocalypse an A!(This is where most reviews would post a link to trailers but I feel the trailers for most of the movies released within the last year have been way too revealing so no link, just go and watch the movie.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men, Apocalypse: "Everything They've Built, Will Fall..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 7.0, Good Movie, But...* Director Brian Singer has produced masterpieces and disappointments over the years in cinema and his latest movie X-Men, Apocalypse is a bit of both. The X-Men series over the years has consistently been more exciting and entertaining especially the two prequels that really lifted the saga to the next level. The introduction of who is considered MARVEL comic's strongest character, Apocalypse was indeed anticipating however after watching the movie, it was not all bad, however having witness the power of all these mutants, a lot of potential was wasted in what I was hoping for.* Characters: - Apocalypse: We all know Oscar Isaac is a talented actor, and Apocalypse in the comics is a badass villain, but after watching the movie, his character felt lacking. I wanted Apocalypse to be the Thanos of the X-Men universe. It really is a shame when his power is almost limitless.- Professor X: James McAvoy is one of Hollywood's most underrated actors, he is a star in all his rolls, and his Charle's Xavier is no exception.- Magneto: The mutant of metal played by the magnificent Michael Fassbender is the greatest character is X-Men as he is the villain we all want. He has had it tough man! His parents and now his wife and child, like far out his performance makes you feel his pain! Well done Michael you've given the fans the Magneto they deserve!- Mystique: Raven is an awesome character, whether hero or villain however in this feature she felt like a memory and not a character as all.- Jean Grey: She nailed it, the Dark Phoenix is coming!...- Mutants: Im really angry Havoc is dead and cry baby Cyclops lives! The new nightcrawler is awesome, angel was a let down sure his wings where nice, beast was kind of there. And as for Wolverine, a furious cameo! P.S Quicksilver is way better than the MCU Quicksilver!* Plot &amp; Design: The X-Men series is evolving its story with humanity and mutants truly outlining the conflict of between them. The visuals are thrilling and exciting filling the audience with enjoyment, however this only appears over half way through the film. Unfortuantly I feel that they have put a bit too many characters in the X-Men series, and Singer has made it hard for us to determine the true protagonist of the X-Men. For me it's Magneto.* Its a good but flawed sequel in the X-Men franchise, Apocalypse could have been so much more, speaking of which, in the movie he dis arms the world of it's nukes. He could have literally dropped them on the earth and won, that simple... But look it is a decent movie that covers the plot holes from it's much better predecessors. If your a MARVEL fan it's hard not to like. It's no Captain America, Civil War (8.7), but it's better than Batman V Superman (6.5)Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for all you mutants out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men was better than Civil War....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not better than Winter Soldier and Avengers. Winter Soldier was perfect. But Civil War seriously unforgivably sucked. Hard to follow and understand, it was a mess. Shows how people's IQ's dropped since Winter Soldier. Also shows how people are too prideful to admit......Civil War was aimed for children and not for adults. Even Tech-insider admits Rotten Tomatoes almost had them fooled. X-Men easily beats the #%#&amp; out of Civil War. It actually had creepy death scenes, kills. Civil war had playful endless CG fights. Civil War did not live up to it's name. Apocalypse did. Even bad reviews didn't kill the franchise, but extended with Deadpool 2, X-Force and another X- Men Franchise. I do plan seeing all of them in theater and buy every ticket. Oscar Isaac is incredible as a fantasy villain. I also loved the artistic bright blue colors, brings you into the world of Marvel Universe's comic book art and style. This movie was 10/10. Almost took out a point, because Apocalypse's powers where not all revealed in the movie. But he is suppose to come back, so we will see in the future, maybe New Mutants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am so disappointed. I saw the movie poster with Mystique getting choked and I was immediately hyped up because I thought it was going to be a film about "Choking and subduing women." I mean here was a movie that had been in the news and criticized for its portrayal of women as doormats, but I'm watching it and the only people dying are men! Men getting cut, blasted, crushed by rubble, and even beheaded! Hello?! Where are the women getting hurt? I had to wait until nearly the end to see 1 woman in peril. And when it does happen, its shortly stopped. In a fictional world, not even a bad guy can hurt a woman and get away with it. What was that giant poster about then? Or all the controversy surrounding it? This is problematic. This does not support the patriarchy I know and love. ::SPOILER:::I also could have done without seeing the scene where they gassed all the gays. Ultimately it just wasn't good, stop giving Bryan Singer jobs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ivan Ooze returns to the big screen 21 years after his debut, and this time, he can make his eyes go white at the drop of a hat, and not only that, he can help disguise humans as walls and floors too!!'Worshiped as a god since the dawn of civilisation, immortal Apocalypse becomes the first and most powerful mutant. Waking after thousands of years, he recruits disheartened Magneto and other mutants to create a new world order. As the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance, Professor X and Katniss lead a team of young X-Kids to stop their seemingly invincible nemesis from destroying mankind.....Fox lost their bottle when they showed that one second clip in the trailer. But not only that, they lost out on what could have been the biggest surprise in film this year. But, they must have doubted the final product, if they thought that that clip would sell more tickets. And rightly so, because Apocalypse is probably one of the biggest disappointments of the summer, which is a shame, because in between the crassness of all the excessive money shots, we have glimpses of genius that helped create one of the biggest comic book franchises of them all.And this is thanks to Fassbender. Every scene he's in is gold, and he's easily the best thing about this mess. He's easily the character you want to empathise with, despite the fact you know he will turn into Ian Mckellen sixteen years ago.Issac tries hard to be a convincing villain, but when you look like a strangulated phallus, you are hard pressed to be taken seriously.The quicksilver scene is a much needed highlight, it's hilarious as well as tense, and the big surprise is an absolute treat, but imagine if you weren't expecting it?So it's a wasted effort, one of the poorest X films for the simple fact that it has flashes of genius, but decides to go for spectacle instead.I think enough is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The third one is always the worst'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an opening sequence set in ancient Egypt, X-Men: Apocalypse rejoins Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique in Berlin 10 years after the events of Days of Future Past. Witnessing an illegal, underground fight between two young mutants, Angel and Nightcrawler, Mystique quickly shows her colours to those gathered to watch the brawl, using her unique set of skills to free the battling mutants. From here, we jump from place to place, visiting Xavier's school in Westchester, a modern day Cairo, and Poland where Magneto is in hiding. It's an introduction that sets up every piece of the narrative as quickly as possible in order to really get the ball rolling, yet because of this, it often feels unsettled and unsure of how to handle the new characters it introduces along the way.Of these new characters, the young versions of classic X-Men Cyclops and Jean Grey that are handled the best. Tye Sheridan shows all the early signs of a born leader as Cyclops while Sophie Turner struggles with a power she can't control as Jean and the two actors display good chemistry on screen which makes their interactions all the more enjoyable to watch. Kodie Smit-McPhee is also entertaining as the German born Nightcrawler who was last seen attacking the President as an adult in X2, yet his main function is to provide the film with comic relief and he's not given much depth. Other new characters are not nearly as well presented as this young trio, with Psylocke, Storm, and Angel being underused for the entirety of the film. Olivia Munn may look the part as Psylocke yet she's given very little to do throughout the film and the same can be said for the other two characters, with Alexandra Shipp receiving not nearly enough screen time as one of the X- Men's most prominent members. Perhaps this is down to their role in the film, serving as 'horsemen' to Apocalypse, portrayed by Oscar Isaac.Resembling a Power Rangers villain ? you know the one ? and intent on taking over the world, Apocalypse is the closest we've come to a maniacal comic book antagonist in an X-Men film. Isaac delivers a restrained performance, for the most part, choosing to present the mutant as a calm individual despite his immense power, yet come the final battle, he can't help but indulge himself in the material written by Simon Kinberg and go full super villain. At times it may be cringe worthy but Isaac is a good enough actor to pull the role off without it feeling campy and he deserves a lot of credit for this because in the wrong hands, Apocalypse may have been unbearable on the big screen. At the very least, his inclusion paves the way for the biggest on screen battle ever seen in the X-Men series which provides the film with some entertaining spectacle, but even as Cairo is ripped apart from the ground up and debris fills the screen, the full threat of Apocalypse is never really felt.While the new characters are somewhat lacking, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are once again on fine form as Professor X and Magneto. One scene in particular requires Fassbender to display his full acting ability and proves to be extremely heart wrenching, even if the event he is reacting to is a little clichéd after this many superhero films, while McAvoy remains poised as Professor X who finally goes bald in this outing. Sadly, Jennifer Lawrence is extremely one note throughout and no longer seems to enjoy playing Mystique, a character that has been severely mishandled in Apocalypse largely because her name has been attached to the role. As she delivers a speech to the young team at the end of the film, it's hard not to picture her as Katniss in The Hunger Games and it appears as if she's merely going through the motions and delivering a performance we've become all to familiar with. Thankfully, Evan Peters makes up for her lack of enthusiasm as Quicksilver who once again steals every scene he's featured in, including a much more complex slow motion sequence in the Xavier mansion which should put a smile on the face of every audience member present.Characters aside, the film does suffer from some shaky CGI as well as an overabundance of moments that can only be described as fan service. One of these moments includes a nod to the audience about Brett Ratner's disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand, while another sees Professor X urging Alex Summers to 'wreak havoc' upon Cerebro to protect them from Apocalypse, a tongue in cheek reference to the characters codename in the comic books. As cute as these moments may be, they do occasionally break the suspension of disbelief and may throw audiences out of the film, and the worst of these is a sequence involving Wolverine. Though it's always a pleasure to see Hugh Jackman as the character on screen, his involvement here is unnecessary and the films narrative seems to stop momentarily so that we can admire Wolverine's berserker rage in all it's glory. With another solo outing scheduled for 2017, perhaps the character would have been better left on the sidelines for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-So</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, I like to root for the underdog. And since DC and Warner Bros. have metaphorically s*** the bed with Batman Vs. Superman (2016), 20th Century Fox's X-Men series (2000-Present) is the biggest superhero game in town other than Marvel. Being a fan of the comic books, growing up with the animated TV series (1992-1997), and enjoying the ever expanding bevy of merchandising material, I admit I am bias when it comes to this particular IP. Of course I enjoyed the high- water mark that is X-Men: First Class (2011). Yes, I unabashedly love the original movie trilogy. Yes I even like X- Men: Last Stand (2006). These guys have been doing the superhero team-up shtick on the big screen much longer than some. At their best, their aesthetic gives those lapsing into superhero fatigue but still looking for that explosive kick a much needed respite. At their worst their soulless, characterless and confusing cash-grabs that cheapen the civil rights subtext that gives the X-Men their unique flavor.X-Men: Apocalypse begins in ancient Egypt where a gaggle of mutants are adored by throngs of people witnessing a processional. Apocalypse (Isaac) heads the pack and is about to transfer his consciousness into a self-healing mutant when something goes wrong. Fast-forward to 1983 where Charles Xavier's (McAvoy) school has just enrolled series regulars Scott Summers (Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Turner). Meanwhile Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Fassbender) attempts to live a normal life in Poland after the events of Days of Future Past (2014) have made him the world's most wanted man. Thanks to the sleuthing of CIA agent Moira Mactaggert (Byrne), Apocalypse is unleashed and sees humanity's dominance over mutants as reason to pretty much end the world.X-Men: Apocalypse lies somewhere in the middle of the pack as far as quality. The action, while occasionally repetitive never ceases to amaze and newcomers Sheridan, Turner and Alexandra Shipp as Storm manage to find deeper dimensions to their characters despite finding precious little time to do so. Additionally, the emotional epicenter at the core of this film (and indeed every X-Men film), the relationship between Charles and Magneto remains as complex as ever.Yet with so many mutants crowding the halls of Xavier's School for Gifted Youth, not to mention the streets of central Europe, it's truly impossible to really let a lot resonate. X-Men: Apocalypse has enough story to fill three films yet with a huge amount of characters to appreciate and the same dour cinematic choices of its predecessors, the film feels simultaneously rushed and turgid. The inclusion of fan favorites Nightcrawler (Smit-McPhee) and Quicksilver (Peters) manage to serve as convenient plot devices or worse, contrived fan-service that detracts completely from the plot.It's really hard to get excited one way or the other about X-Men: Apocalypse especially in a year that simultaneously gave us a truly great superhero film in the form of Captain America: Civil War (2016) and one of the worst in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman. X- Men: Apocalypse isn't even the best X-Men movie this year; that distinction is deservedly bestowed upon Deadpool (2016) which called out the aging series for being too far up it's own a**.All said and done however, the newest X-Men movie still has a couple of showstopping performances. The talents of James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan, if utilized correctly next time, will assure that the franchises' best days aren't behind it. For now, those very performances saved this film from completely cratering to the ground.</fullReview>

The Last Stand was the best movie so far, but this one has taken the 1st place just because the story went perfectly. That Quicksilver scene was really impressive and exciting. Same goes for Wolverine too but that one does not play that much of a big role, at least in this film.People are generally not satisfied with the ending of the film but it showed us how powerful Jean is. Sophie Turner really stepped up in her "really important" role, too. Best X-Men movie of all time. 8/10</fullReview>

I can see a few plot gaps that may cause some to lower it to average 5/10 but only a few would rate it as low as 4.Thats it. Worth a watch. Do suggest watching previous x-men movies first in the film order. X-men / X2 xmen united / xmen united / x-men first class / x-men days of future past. Then this movie.Leaving the Wolverine movies separate. Just a suggestion from a movie buff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story doesn't really seem to have continued from the previous instalment, but that is how X-Men is able to entice both old and new audiences. Each X-Men movie has new characters introduced while still having the core characters at it's centre. The acting is great, as returning actors and actresses have already established their characters and know how to portray them. Those new to the franchise also do well and it's quite refreshing to see young faces portraying characters already established in the universe. Quicksilver's unique character personality really shines through, and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Not only does Peters do a great job with expressing his character, but the visual effects, editing and directing, all played a part in creating this and the rest of the personas.Speaking of visual effects, the action is very well done, and the effects for the superpowers are exciting to watch. The vibrant colours as well, add to the immersive feel of the movie. Having said all that, while it was cool to watch, it wasn't as exciting as the previous X-Men film. It was still interesting and I enjoyed watching it, but it seemed more like it was setting up for more things to come. It felt like it was lacking something, which I can't really pinpoint what exactly. The screenplay is well written and has many comedic lines which add character to the film. But the constant switching between good and evil was a little tiresome and predictable to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good bloc-buster, but too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I went to the movies in hopes that I will have a good time by watching this movie. Was it a good movie? In general, yes. The story is about an ancient mutant called En Sabah Nur who is thousands of years old and is like a parasite, going from one host to another in order to get their powers. So, one day in ancient Egypt he's being betrayed and entombed in a golden pyramid. Thousands of years later, he's accidentally awoken by CIA agent Moira (from DoFP) when she uncovers his resting ground. So, being the bad-ass villain that he is, he's goes on looking for "four horseman" to spread his will.While I liked some parts of the movie: of how Magneto resurfaced, namely. But I get the feeling that it was just too long movie. Don't get me wrong, it has everything: stunning visuals, cinematics, story lines, CGI etc. But it's jut too long and too overcrowded and at times you wish that the story would pick it's pace.Also, the defeat of En Sabah Nur was anti-climatic for me. However, it does pose some credibility to the future of the franchise with the current young actors.As well as, that En Sabah Nur while being this omnipowered presence, but... he was dull.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The superhero genre has gone through dramatic changes since Bryan Singer directed "X-Men" in 2000, and now finds itself in a precarious place. The city-level destruction that characterizes so many third acts has become visually rote and morally abhorrent. And how many more movies can we handle about white men given great power who churn out jokes and punches with equal aplomb? The genre desperately needs to diversify not just in terms of race and gender but also the kinds of stories on which filmmakers choose to focus. "X-Men: Apocalypse" should be a corrective measure, considering its ensemble allows for the opportunity to focus on popular female and people-of-color characters. Instead, it magnifies all the worst issues of the genre, serving up a story that would have felt dated five years ago."X-Men: Apocalypse" is a confused, bloated mess of a film. There are several films crammed into one, all battling for the spotlight, and none of them wholly work; there is really no central story-line or heart to the film. The first hour is almost entirely in service of setting up new players and establishing what the veterans are up to. Charles Xavier/Professor X (James McAvoy) is successfully running his school for mutant kids. Raven Darkholme/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescuing mutants, including the walking punchline Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) on her own, and struggling with being seen as a hero. Then there are the teen-aged Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) who are struggling to cope with their powers and fledgling attraction to each other. Sheridan and Turner seem to actually be enjoying themselves but their development staggers under the weight of everything else going on around them; Jean grappling with the dark side of her abilities is especially fertile ground. One of the few evocative scenes involves her having a nightmare which rocks the school and burns the walls of her room before Xavier comforts her. Even though she gets a big hero moment at the end, it doesn't land well, given how poorly she's developed. Singer doesn't offer the scant interesting moments enough room to breathe. He's too interested in hurtling to the next plot point, the next introduction, the next fight scene.The greatest sin of "X-Men: Apocalypse" by far is how terribly it wastes some of the greatest modern actors. Michael Fassbender can't give Magneto's story-line the emotional depth it needs. But could any actor distract from how that story-line embodies the most onerous clichéd in regards to the treatment of women in comics? How many more wives and daughters will be killed in these kinds of films in order to give a male lead some angst? As the movie's world-destroying, god-like mutant, Oscar Isaac struggles to make Apocalypse even the least bit menacing. How can an actor as charismatic and dynamic as Isaac feel so torpid here? The failure to make Apocalypse engaging is mostly the fault of Simon Kinberg's script. These operatic, world-destroying villains don't seem to work on- screen as they do in comics. Their motivations are? at best?confusing and nonsensical. They seem so disconnected from the world the heroes move through that they almost exist in entirely different films. Perhaps, "X-Men: Apocalypse" also exhibits the worst traits of these sort of stories in the comics, which can be damnably inert, nihilistic, and overcrowded on their own, before even being adapted for the screen. Despite Apocalypse's backstory and grandstanding, he spends more time imbuing his Four Horseman with power than wielding his own.The rest of Apocalypse's team are the smug yet forgettable Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and a young Storm (Alexandra Shipp). None of these characters are all that interesting but Psylocke and Storm embody the ways this entire series has failed its female characters; Psylocke is such a one-dimensional villain she seems two steps away from twirling a mustache. Singer and Kinberg are seemingly incapable of developing more than one female character at a time.There's also something deeply troubling about a series that trades in the language and ideas of the Civil Rights Movement without caring one iota about its characters of color. Storm is once again given very little to do. She has none of the emotional inferiority, swagger or complexity of her comic counterpart. Jubilee (Lana Condor) is such a non-factor she could be taken out entirely and nothing would change. Raven and Jean are slightly better served, but Jean's development is too inconsistent to leave much of an impact. Raven comes off far worse due to Lawrence's obvious disinterest in the role, coasting from scene to scene with none of her trademark charisma. When Raven reverts to her natural blue form (which is probably one of the worst translations of a character from page to screen in modern comic book films) her performance somehow becomes even more non-engaging.While much has been made about how superhero films rely on the destruction of cities in order to make the stakes higher for heroes, "X-Men: Apocalypse" takes this idea to the next level with startling violence. It isn't just one city that hangs in the balance, it's the entire world. The destruction in the third act is so wide-ranging, so cataclysmic, that it zaps the film of any tension. There is no sense of danger here, only the distinct feeling that nearly everyone involved is counting down the minutes until this whole affair is over. There is one scene involving the surprisingly fun Quicksilver (Evan Peters) that gives "X-Men: Apocalypse" one of its only visually interesting moments. He uses his super-speed to traverse through Xavier's school saving people from an explosion, as set to "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" by The Eurythmics?a confounding music choice, to say the least. Singer finds some physical humor and levity in Quicksilver's ingenious ways of saving everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible, but definitely the weakest of the 3 "new" X-Men films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a generally accepted idea that the 3rd X-Men film was the worse. Well, I have to say the same about the new semi-rebooted series. The film just failed to live up to its potential. Firstly, the villain was somehow wasted, even though Oscar Isaac did a great job. I remember watching the animated series and being intimidated by Apocalypse (even as an adult). The movie Apocalypse somehow failed to evoke the same reaction. I never really thought he was unstoppable like he was in the cartoon. Jennifer Lawrence seemed tired of her role and was phoning it in. Magneto had a great start, and I loved how they initially covered his reasoning for doing what he did, but then he just gets relegated to the background for the most part, and his reasoning for doing what he does at the end don't really seem earned like they did at the beginning. Things seem rushed near the end, and it seems they were just trying to pack in lots of cool things at the end and it gets a bit muddled. The Quicksilver scene is awesome, and is the clear highlight of the film (again). At the end of the day, it doesn't go full Transformers and highlight action scenes over story elements, but it was definitely leaning in that direction, which was a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was OK, but its not quite the Apocalyptic spectacle the trailers suggested</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like X-Men, I largely like what Fox has done with it, and I don't have a problem with Bryan Singer either. I liked the new batch of X-Men movies so far, and certainly X-Mens interpretation of Quicksilver was a tough act for Avengers to follow, and the former did it better.So watching the trailers for Apocalypse, and knowing the power of the subtitled character who forms part of the movies title, I really was expecting some worldwide destruction on an unprecedented scale.Alas, that didn't happen. In fact the worldwide apocalypse was a bit of a damp squib.I just didn't ever get the on screen power of what Apocalypse is supposed to be. The most powerful mutant ever, the one that can give powers or expand powers of existing mutants, but the movie felt more like a road trip of collecting some bad guys to help, and then not really being given the chance to wreak the havoc the character was capable of.Apocalypse the character didn't ever appear to be close to being able to cause the destruction he promised. Sure, Cairo got knocked about, nuclear missiles were fired into orbit, and a few guys got killed..... but where was the REAL menace of the character?Sure, he was powerful, but he should have been one that other mutants visibly were scared to death of.Quicksilvers scenes during the destruction of the mansion were the stand out, just like they were in Days of Future Past.Most of the characters were alright in their roles, Psylocke was the Captain Phasma of X-Men..... really oversold in the trailers and marketing, and then barely given any screen time. Hopefully due to events at the end of the movie, this will change in any proposed sequel.VFX were great, music was forgettable.I didn't dislike the movie, but it simply didn't live upto the promise of the bad guy, which is a shame, and I hope it doesn't end the franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just ten years after an event that forever changed history, trouble still lies ahead for both mutant and human populations when the original, all-powerful mutant En Sabah Nur awakens with a mission to 'cleanse' the world and build a better one. Naturally, this attracts the attention of Xavier, Magneto, Mystique et al who are caught in the path of his destruction. Lugubrious addition to the X-Men saga initially seems ambitious and exciting, but stumbles over its excessive narratives, provides very little in the way of character arc or development, and fails to overcome a feeling of redundancy. Livens up a bit in its third act, but till then it doesn't bring much of anything new to the table, nor does it provide an honest ending to resolve any of the series' long-standing continuity issues. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected with an unremarkable villain (7/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have high expectations from this movie. Amidst all the grandeur marketing for other superhero movies like Civil War and Batman v Superman, this movie had the lesser share of anticipation from the fans, which could be attributed to the fact that the trailers were quite dreary and uninspiring. Also, the movie currently holds a score of 47% approval on Rotten Tomatoes. So, critics seem to be divided on this one. That being said, I have stopped taking Rotten Tomatoes seriously ever since Furious 7 got a score of 81%I should mention that Days of Future past is one of my all time favourite superhero movies and was unanimously praised by fans and critics, so in this movie's defense, it was a tough act to follow.Possible spoilers up ahead!THE GOOD: Quicksilver: Quicksilver was one of the highlights of Days of Future Past, and the tradition carries over to this one as well. He has one incredible action scene, where he showcases the full extent of his powers. Pretty much the best part of the movie, if you ask me.The New Mutants: I really enjoyed the introduction of the new mutants like Jean Gray, Cyclops and Nightcrawler. This is a new iteration of these familiar characters from the first few X-Men films. The performances of the new actors are reminiscent of the previous films, yet stand out in their own way.Sophie Turner as Jean Gray was probably the best one of them all. She plays a conflicted yet incredibly powerful mutant, scared of her own abilities and I can't wait to see her in the future X-Men movies.Professor X and Magneto: James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are phenomenal actors and as you would expect, they continue to give brilliant performances as Professor X and Erik Lehnsherr.However, we didn't get to see a fleshed out ideological conflict between them, something which was one of the best parts of the last two films.Opening Scene: The first scene takes place in ancient Egypt where we get our first glimpse at Apocalypse, and his four mighty horsemen which kicks off the movie really well.Bizarre Mind Tripping Action Scenes: There are a few bizarre and trippy action scenes involving Professor X and Apocalypse, which I thought was a refreshing break from the usual CGI heavy climactic action scenes in summer tentpole movies. Keep an eye out for that.THE MEDIOCRE: Apocalypse: Apocalypse was unsurprisingly mediocre. The main problem with him was that his motivations didn't add up. For someone who is the titular character of the film, he just seemed like another bad guy with another clichéd world domination plan. I wish the movie could have done a better job explaining his actions. Why does he want to cleanse the world? If he has been doing this since the past several thousand years, it seems he's pretty bad at it, cause he's been unsuccessful at creating a better world every single time.Also, I wish they could have made him a bit more physically intimidating. There are several scenes where he is standing alongside the other female mutants, he is just as tall as them. They should have done the trick used in 300, and made him look like a 7 feet giant which would have definitely transformed his screen presence for the better.Perhaps the thing that somewhat saves this character from becoming any worse is his voice and Oscar Isaac's performance. This could have been a really cool character, and I really wish the writers could have done a better job with him.Psylocke: Psylocke is one of Apocalype's four horsemen portrayed by Olivia Munn, a character I was really excited to see, but sadly she didn't get the time to shine. She remained largely stoic and didn't get to say even a single dialogue in the entire film which is the consequence of juggling a plethora of characters in a 2 hour movie. I think Munn was trying to do the best, with what she was given, but the character just wasn't written well. It could have been any other XYZ villain, and that wouldn't have made a tad bit difference to the overall plot.TLDR: This is my score a few hours after the first viewing. It could change after the second viewing however.Final Verdict: 7.1/10It's a fun action movie with a stellar cast and lackluster villain. If you are expecting another Days of Future Past, you will be disappointed, but in its own merit X-Men: Apocalypse is a good time at the movies.P.S. There is a after credit scene which teases the antagonists of the future X-Men movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>27 May 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - X-Men: Apocalypse. This is the next chapter of the prequel story, if that sounds confusing, you're quite right it is. The film starts with a bit of history, way way back in time, then it jumps all over the place as it sets you up to bring all the characters together to the main story. Apocalypse answers all those questions you've been asking but ask many many more. A complex story, a web of cleverness and cast of characters each with their own mutant talent, range of emotions and code of what's right and what's wrong. I'm not going to comment on the plot in any way for fear of spoilers, suffice to say we are taken on an exhausting but exhilarating journey, hold on tight it's a hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb cast and immense villain help deliver a great superhero movie that ranks among the best in the X-Men franchise. The new characters make a welcome inclusion to the familiar faces we have already been introduced to in previous installments. The stakes are higher than they've ever been with Apocalypse threatening the world, forcing the team face there most powerful foe yet. Michael Fassbenders Magneto provides great emotional character moments and Evan Peters Quicksilver injects humour and fun into his scene stealing moments. There are some pacing issues, under utilised characters due to the big cast and the main villain is slightly underdeveloped, falling into generic 'bad guy' territory with his motivations. However, X-Men: Apocalypse is an epic summer blockbuster that's enjoyable, and sets up a bright future with new faces and stories to explore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "First Class" and "The Days of Future Past" and the the trailer had set my expectations high.And that is the reason that I did not find this movie as great as the last two. This is a good movie , but the story line was obviously predictable. There were no twists or "WOW" moments.It was a clean and steady flow of events, with just the required amount of action and fun. The main let down was "Apocalypse", for the hype that is given to the villain, I feel that the character was not strong enough to stand up to Charles and Co. But it is certainly not a bad movie and you do have to watch it in trailer. But do not expect great intelligence or kick out of it..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To begin with I had very high hopes with X-men: Apocalypse. One can look at the name and just look at the enemy mutant in the trailers and get set in top most gear, but my friends I would like to put a stop at that.Yes this review contain spoilers, the story is simple a new mutant is introduced which is all powerful and oldest of them all. If it were just that would have been enough but this mutant is capable of enhancing power of other mutants. He team ups with others to wage war on defensive mutants and humans in general, which has to be fought and overcome. The idea of such a mutant was not welcomed in my thoughts.I liked introduction of new mutants. More with reference to control their powers in given circumstances could have been added.Quicksilver action sequence was great. I personally feel Cyclops could have been come up with controlling his energy naturally all by himself.Still the comparison comes with other x-men movies. For me the movie was average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong with a bit too much drama, but much better than X-Men: Days of Future Past. A solid, if not standout comic book movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music of this latest X-Men movie sucks. Challenge yourself to sit through the opening credits sequence three times in a row without initiating a divorce. You'll see what I mean. The music's a characterless Hollywood wash, generic as can be, BUT the rest of this movie isn't. In fact, this latest X-Men movie isn't bad at all.There are lots of overblown and drawn out "screaming" moments--you know; characters charging up their powers in a dramatic moment while screaming "YAAAAAAAHHHH!!!" which, kind of, you know--elicits sighs and eye rolls after a while--but it's a comic book movie about angsty teens and homophobia. You can't judge it too harshly.A standout of this movie is Apocalypse himself. He's rad. Everything about him--the acting, the menace, the costume--it's all great. Will he replace Ivan Ooze as the best purple-blue villains of cinema? I don't know. I don't *think* so, I mean, it's hard to beat Ivan Ooze as one of the greatest movie villains ever. But this portrayal of Apocalypse is up there.The returning cast of the other prequel X-Men movies are all here and in good standing. I found Quicksilver to be more endearing this time around: not as annoying as his first appearance in the X-Men: Days of Future Something-Something (which was a bad, boring movie.) Everyone involved, from Mystique to Hank to Olivia Munn's pink moon boots are great.Except Michael Fassbender, playing Magneto. Fassbender, I find, plays the same character in every movie: kind of a breathy, non-blinking, quiet, teary, sad-faced posh Brit (I know Fassbender's German.) It's no better that Magneto, yet again, loses "everything" at the start of the movie and, once more, plays the villain with a victim card. But we've seen it before. It's the same problem that plagued the 2014 Spiderman reboot--telling the same story again and again and again. Yes, we know Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider and accidentally causes the death of Aunt Ben (whoops!) Seeing it on screen yet again is frustrating. Everyone knows about Spiderman's backstory, just as everyone knows Magneto's motivations... perhaps all too well. We get it. He's had a hard life and feels persecuted. We're meant to feel sorry for him. But, oh my God, guys, he's the same in every X-Men movie, and there's been like, ten of them. Do something different with Magneto for the next installment... maybe make him go insane and then become possessed by the spirit of Onslaught. Then he could act like Immortan Joe (Rad!!!) Or have him really get into D&amp;D. Maybe the next X-Men movie can be about Charles urging Magneto to move out of his basement. Or something.X-Men Apocalypse: recommended, but only if a.) you have insomnia comme moi, or b.) you can watch it for free at a friend's house with a basket of Rubic's cubes handy. And there are chips on the table.6.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In equal measure there's plenty to entertain, plenty that's bang average &amp; also potential tricks that were missed, so therefore it's completely understandable why it appears to have received such a middling critical reception.Now lets start with the positives, I thought the young cast showed great promise for future films with Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan &amp; Kodi Smitt-McPhee as the young mutants Jean Grey, Cyclops &amp; Nightcrawler respectively putting in memorable if brief on screen performances, Evan Peters is again truly wonderful as Quicksilver &amp; pretty much nails every line of dialogue with the best action coming from his special abilities &amp; proves to Marvel what a waste they made of their interpretation of the character in Avengers: Age of Ultron, that Xavier/Magneto dynamic is still very well done (if lacking further depth) &amp; always entertaining to watch thanks to the good work of James McAvoy &amp; Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence has glimpses of that Hunger Games pivotal heroine but they are all too fleeting, which can also be said for the likes of Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/Beast as he's given hardly anything to do &amp; it goes without saying that lots of characters kind of fall by the wayside (namely three of the 'Horsemen' Storm, Angel who literally does so &amp; Psylocke although I can't fault Olivia Munn) so there is certainly a case of mutant overload in play, also what was the point of that Wolverine moment in the film?! It should have been an awesome moment but I felt deflated after watching it, partially because I knew it was going to occur no thanks to the trailer &amp; also with how he was utilized it seemed a waste of his &amp; our time, Rose Byrne really could have not been in the film &amp; you wouldn't of noticed &amp; despite Oscar Isaac's best efforts his villain seems a bit generic &amp; is maybe slightly lost underneath all that makeup, also I felt an important character death moment was handled wrongly &amp; should've been utilized to better effect.So overall there's stuff to enjoy but equally enough to frustrate, so to sum up if we're talking where it stands this year among the big superhero teams ups, it's not as slick as Captain America: Civil War but it's more intentionally fun than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, also a further hello to Jason Isaacs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of "X-Men: Apocalypse" (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start of "X-Men: Apocalypse" (2016) I was worried that I was finally beginning to experiencing a degree of "viewer fatigue" in connection with the beloved franchise. This would be the ninth film since the X-Men first hit the big screen in 2000, if you count this year's "Deadpool," and its somewhat formulaic setup felt by-the- numbers. Once again, a diverse, earnest, international group of young people unite under Charles Xavier's leadership to combat an even greater threat than the one presented by the last film. (This time it's "Apocalypse," a Big Bad with truly godlike powers.) And they save the day despite their youth, their inexperience, their self-doubt or the suspicions of a prejudiced humanity.) How exciting can the arrival of Angel (Ben Hardy) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) be if these were already key reveals in past movies? And ? the cameo?There are script problems. The whole thing is cluttered with too many major characters. Many are thinly drawn; a few make inexplicable, major decisions that affect the plot. Fan favorites like Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) get too little attention to make their ardent fanbases happy, I think. The villain looks like a middle-aged and particularly grumpy member of Blue Man Group.And, yet ? I still frikkin' loved this. I'd grudgingly give it a 9 out of 10, simply because I enjoyed it so much. It's the X-Men. It's a big-budget, globally staged smackdown with great special effects, and it was obviously made by people who love the source material and tried to stay true to it, despite its inevitably campy nature and its implausibility. Characters like Havoc (Lucas Till) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) are fun to watch. (Am I the only one who nostalgically remembers the latter character from the 90's comic books?) There is even a really nice stab at self-referential humor poking fun at the earlier films.This movie had two things going for it that really made me want to see it a second time around. The first is Quicksilver. The X-Men movies will probably never equal the skillfully made blockbusters of that other Marvel universe, but I'll be damned if the franchise doesn't totally beat them out in rendering this character. (Yes, this is indeed the same character in the comics who inspired Scarlet Witch's brother in "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015).) Evan Peters brings great charisma to the role; the special effects connected with his action sequences are beautiful and goddam perfect. He's easily cooler and more likable than any other teen superhero I can remember ? and that includes Tom Holland's excellent new Spider-Man.The second thing that make me want to watch it again is the action sequences. The finale is damn fun. I think it must be difficult to write, stage, direct and physically perform a melee among a group of combatants with various superhuman abilities and varying degrees of power. But the climax here works. It's an entertaining battle that feels like it was lifted perfectly from the comics, and it ought to please fans of the genre.Anyway, I obviously do recommend this. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfactory But Not Superior To Any Other "X-Men" Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"X-Men: Apocalypse" is the third film in the prequel(ish) trilogy that began with "X-Men: First Class". Because of "reset" that the ending of the previous film, "Days of Future Past", set in motion, those of us who have followed the series since the original 2001 "X-Men" often found ourselves scratching our heads during this one. To avoid any spoilers, I won't elaborate on any specific scenes. But the X-Men franchise has always been plagued with inconsistencies and Swiss cheese plot lines. So that was no surprise here either. "Apocalypse" does its best to begin a new storyline while clinging to familiar characters and origins. I'm not sure it was hitting all of the marks it was striving for, but it is still quite entertaining and will surely appease its mutant-loving fanbase. I can't say that I loved it or, even that I hated it. It was satisfactory, but in no way superior to any of its predecessors. It was probably about 20 minutes too long due to drawn out sequences that added nothing to the plot or pacing. After a high-energy opener, there quite a lull before the action picked back up and that caused some impatience about halfway through. None of the characters (except for the villain) really carried the story so you had a lot of people to keep up with throughout. Quicksilver continued to steal every scene he was in and it made me wish he could have played a bigger role. And the Wolverine cameo was a disappointing and lackluster sequence. It felt like a vain attempt to put him in the movie at the most opportune time. Like finding the keys in a random getaway car, it was just too convenient. Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy the movie. I just felt that it was lacking in areas where it could have been greater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse - review: It's pretty damn good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of the X-Men movies, but I love X2, First Class, DOFP, and I liked Apocalypse.The opening action sequence was pretty breathe taking. When I first saw Apocalypse on screen, I thought he looked pretty scary, I thought his scrawny creepy old man look was scary, you could tell he was ancient, and I think it would've been interesting if Bryan Singer had kept the old scrawny look for the entirety of the movie; I just really preferred Apocalypse's old man look verse what he ended up looking like after the transference.The musical score is what really got me into the opening sequence. Once the music started playing, I was hooked. The action during the opening sequence was good also, it's pretty reminiscent of DOFP's opening, but I'll say that I prefer Apocalypse's opening just a tad bit more, and I think that's because the musical score was so good (it really set the tone). The only negative thing about the opening was its CGI; The CGI was so bad that it kind of took me out of the sequence, it also kind of took me out of the movie. The CGI basically ruins this movie, it makes me think, where did the budget go, and DOFP had better CGI than this; Honestly, the CGI looks so bad that its laughable. Maybe this movie was way too big for its britches? Studio's have this belief that the sequel always needs to be bigger than its predecessor, I however don't believe that. I ultimately don't care about the scope of a movie, I care about the story, and I care about the characters. If your movie can hook me with the story and characters alone, than you've already won the battle. The scope of your movie doesn't always need to be grander in scale, you can create something small, and you can make it seem larger than life without having to over do it. Yes, I know this is an X-Men movie, and its characters are larger than life, but the movie doesn't have to sacrifice its concept for an abundance of special effects. Frankly speaking, if you don't have the budget for it, than create something smaller, you can execute the same idea, but you'll just have to find a different approach for it.The ending action sequence was pretty dull and boring. The only exciting element during the ending battle was when Apocalypse tried to control Professor Xavier. Mcavoy's performance during that ending transference scene was edge of the seat suspense, I was legitimately concerned for the well-being of his character, and Apocalypse's rage/whinny baby reaction after the transference had failed was stellar.The only action scenes I liked where the opening and Ouicksliver scene, everything else was forgettable.A majority of the actors delivered good performances, yes this includes Jennifer Lawrence. I don't mind JLaw as Mystique, I just hate the fact that she's in the spotlight. When Rebecca Romijn played Mystique, she had her moments to shine, and she delivered, but she was never the focal point. The only reason Mystique is at the center of attention is because she's played by JLaw, in my opinion, that's catering to the actor. JLaw's Mystique is the perfect example of the actor revolving around the character and not the other way around.Ben Hardy (Angel/Arc-Angel) and Olivia Munn (Psylocke) are completely underutilized, their stories are insignificant and inefficient. Alexandra Shipp (Storm) was slightly underutilized, Singer should've given her more character to chew on, but she did a good job with what she had to work with, she ran with it, and it was pretty cool.Josh Helman (Stryker) didn't need to be in this movie, he just pops in out of nowhere, his appearance is warranted, but he's just there to set- up Wolverine's entrance.Lana Condor (Jubilee) is barely in the movie, but that's okay because the actor did what she could, she was great in the role, and I hope I see more of her in future X-Men movies. I think Jubilee had more dialog than Arc-Angel and Psylocke combined.Oscar Isaac (Apocalypse) was great, I was immersed in the character, and the actor's portrayal was spot on. Magneto has more to do here than any other character (besides Xavier &amp; Apocalypse). I felt for Magneto when his family died, I understood his reasoning for wanting to join the horsemen, and I liked that he went fully bad in this movie (sort of). By the end of the movie, Magneto betrays Apocalypse because he feels that he has betrayed his fellow X- Men or Charles, he thinks back to the events of First Class, and he has the realization that he has been hurting them or him all along. I liked that Magneto had his little moment at the end, but damn he surly does change sides fast. I thought Magneto changing sides happened way to prematurely, it really didn't hold any emotional weight for me, and I think it would've been better if he had died fighting Apocalypse or the X-Men. Honestly, where on earth can this character go from here, he shouldn't get a pass just because he saved the world, he also had a hand in destroying it, and him turning fully good doesn't fit the character's arc at all.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I had fun with it. Is it better than DOFP, no. Is it the worst X-Men movie, no. Does it have problems, yes. Would I add this to my good X-Men movie collection, yes because I think this movie is pretty good. X-Men: Apocalypse is definitely in my top five favorite X-Men movies, but yes this movie could've been so much better. If you're a fan of the X-Men movies, check it out because it's fun, and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another well adapted comic book movie, another misinterpretation from critics(minimal spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like BvS this year the critics don't know how a comic book adapted movie should be done. Here's my honest opinion about this movie: The good: I start with the good, because the bad parts are not so many as the good ones. So, the movie starts with an Apocalypse prologue and it's that powerful and full of tension like Bane's in the Dark Knight Rises, also the music is fantastic, watched the film in IMAX 3D and the sound was awesome by the way. There are another memorable scenes in the movie but I'll try not gonna disclose anything that happens in the movie. The pacing is really fast, and at times it might seem like a stupid movie or a mess of a movie, but it's not, and if you leave any expectations behind you'll enjoy the way this movie is made. Another great thing about it is that it introduces most of the "new" X-Men, and I say "new" cause Cyclops and Jean are well known. I really liked the way they introduced Cyclops, and you can actually see his struggle with his powers and maybe feel a little of what he was feeling. The battle scenes are cool, very simple yet very good. And yes indeed Quicksilver is again awesome, if you thought that his scene from DOFP was awesome, you need to see this one, absolutely brilliant! And the thing I realised I liked after the movie is that is very well adapted from the comics. It's literally a guy who's trying to lead the mutants into a new world, and the X-men must stop him. Oh, and I like to point the fact that unlike Marvel's new additions, this movie actually has a good humor, not exaggerated or misplaced, but very well added and executed(especially Quicksilver). And last but not least, the powers of the superheroes were showed brilliantly, especially Cyclops's and Jean's. The bad: Even though there might not be to much to say about the movie that is bad, I'll say what I've noticed. The main problem is that this movie is not profound. I mean you don't really feel the motivation of Apocalypse, because for a mutant of "God" sizes you would expect(or I at least expected) to have like a real profound reason for what he's doing. Apart from that there is nothing too memorable from him except his manipulations, there aren't any quotes either from him or the other actors, which is unfortunate, cause sometimes in comics we have moments like this. Next the way Apocalypse rises again is very weird, I mean he literally stays buried for 3000 years, but is not explained either how he survived or what was that caused his rise in the present, and this might seem to some of the people watching the movie very convenient, but honestly I didn't have that much of a problem with that, I mean it's a comic book movie.OK, and in the end let me tell you why critics don't like this movie or any movie too much adapted from comics. Haven't you noticed that critics like comic book movies to be filled with political things or social things, controversies, that's why they liked Avengers or Civil War, and especially X-Men 1 and 2, First Class, Days of Future Past. The critics like the comic book movies to feel like this actually might happen, or to feel real, which is not the case. And that's why every time comic book movies adapt very well the source material, and do not introduce politics or social things in their movies critics say it's c**p(see BvS early this year).So with that being said, this is my personal opinion, a subjective one, even though I tried to be objective, it's my opinion, you might like it, you might not, but this is how I think the movie was. I rate this with 8, cause it's a very fine addition to the X-Men franchise, and I like this franchise to go on especially with this new young cast they have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expect Fun, not Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is a very long movie that doesn't feel very long. It's not the kind of movie that is going to win awards or necessarily be remembered in 50 years, but it is the kind of movie that keeps you glued to your seat throughout, no matter how badly you have to pee or how much you want to get a refill at the concession stand. The movie has slower parts, sure, but it never really drags (which is more than I can say for Marvel Studio's "Civil War"). Nearly all villains lack depth in superhero movies these days and Apocalypse doesn't buck this trend, but he is fun. "Everything they've built will fall!!!" Is my favorite trailer quote of the year so far and the line is just as cool in the actual movie. All of the action is well done and the performances solid. Standout scenes include another Quicksilver foray in slow-motion and a slightly-extended cameo from an old friend. The climax actually feels climactic (gasp) and the ending hints at more good things to come in the X-Men cinematic universe. Is this movie going to change the way you view the world? Nah.Is it worth the money and time it takes to see it? Yes yes yes. If a movie isn't aiming for profoundly thought-provoking, it should aim for fun- a target that Bryan Singer and the team at Fox have certainly hit here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give this film kudos for trying to have a story, it just wasn't all that great of a story. There were good aspects to the story but nothing I'd write home about. The scenes with Peter Maximoff are pretty much the best ones in this movie. We talked about it after the movie we decided what this movie lacked was great characters, and Maximoff is a great character who saved the movie for us. I think the characters in comic books that are most entertaining are of the Spiderman and Quicksilver mold. Just fun characters who do things that allow the people making the movie to also have some fun and entertain the audience in ways that aren't just purely about the CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie fell short of what I hope for, and to compare it to the Captian American civil war, Cap. Blew the x- men away. I'm not saying this movie is not worth seeing but it was missing something, by the time it was over I was ready to go, I was kind of bored with the movie as a whole; however, as far as the CGI effects it was off the charts. But even the effects of x-men in my opinion fell short of Batman vs. Superman. I know there will be some who disagree with me but as far as the younger class x-men movies this one is at the bottom of the list. The only two characters that made this movie stand out were Quicksilver and Magneto. All the others came off as weak and the story line seemed to be jumbled up. Yet, giving all that I still rate it around a 7.5.</fullReview>

I wish wolverine made a longer appearance but when he came out it amazing! Can't wait for that movie to come out.

		<shortDescription>Just got back from the Opening Day matinée and...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...there were only nine other people besides myself in the theater!For once, however, I do not regard that as ill-tidings of a box office flop. Because as far as I could see, all ten of us enjoyed it, immensely. Everybody certainly stayed glued to their seats till the ending credits!Anyway; the movie begins in ancient Egypt during the 37th century BC. En Sabah Nur, the mutant Pharoah, is overthrown by some of his normal human guards who know that he is no god in the divine sense. Unfortunately, he accidentally gets revived in the 20th century by CIA Agent Moira McTaggart! More specifically, 1983 (ten years after the events of X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST).A lot of things have changed in that time. For one thing; Magneto has reformed to the point where's he a steel mill worker in Poland, with a wife and nine year-old daughter, Nina! For another; Mystique is no longer impersonating William Stryker due to the fact the real one has not only resurfaced. He's also somehow latched on to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in an uncredited farewell appearance in the role...if one is to believe all the advance rumors), once again! Of course, once again, mutaphobic humans (in the form of small town Polish cops) are responsible for the deaths of Magneto's loved ones. Persuading him to join forces with En Sabah Nur and the other Three Horsemen. One of them is a relatively new addition to the cast of movie mutants: Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Sexy blue leotard and matching thigh-high boots, included! The other two are a teenage Ororo "Storm" Munro (played by Alexandra Shipp) and a Warren Worthington III (played by Ben Hardy) somehow born twenty years earlier than the Angel character in X-MEN 3!**Unless the temporal divergence in the previous film caused Warren Worthington Jr. to inherit the angelic wings.I won't spoil the rest of it. Suffice it to say that the special effects and the social commentary, underlying the superheroics, are as top-notch as ever. My only nitpick--hence the one star deduction--is the hindsighted critique of STAR WARS: ROTJ. With all due respect to Ms. Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner)? There was nothing wrong with _any_ of the movies in the original SW trilogy! They were each equally good, as they were originally shown in theaters, from 1977 to 1983. It's only George Lucas' needless ret-conning, in 1997, that screwed them up! In short, then: go see X-MEN: APOCALYPSE. I guarantee you'll have a great time. Up to and including the rather...sinister epilogue.</fullReview>

If you watched DOFP and a big fan of Xmen, then don't even think about keeping your hopes high.. You will just get knocked out :/ If you keep your expectations low, then it is a pretty decent movie.The movie is interesting but I wouldn't say it is worth craving.. It has few ups and downs but you would love to finish the movie.. It will bind you to your seats..The last thing is: I liked that JLaw wasn't emphasized too much. This time it was Sophie Turner and she did her Jean Grey part brilliantly. Who would've seen that coming?? :vand Quicksilver tried a lot to save this movie :3 but Alas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS: I'm a huge fan of X-Men. They were the first super heroes I remember watching on TV. I love all the films even though they're not the greatest. On to my actual review. One of the main things that irritated me was the terrible CGI in certain scenes. Specifically the shipyard scene and when they were rebuilding the mansion. Another thing that bothered me was Mystique/Jennifer. She is not supposed to be leading the X-Men. She's not even supposed to be part of the team. Jean Grey. She's supposed to be 17/18 I think? She doesn't have full control of her power. How is she able to trick the minds of people without a problem? How does she fix Logan's mind? And at the end she turns into the Phoenix WITHOUT A PROBLEM. It makes no sense. She doesn't even flinch or faint. I thought Jubilee would have a bigger role than just a few scenes. I loved Storm and Psylocke. I would've liked to see Psylocke use her telepathy though maybe to find Xavier or something. The movie was funny in all the right places.</fullReview>

So when I walked into the theater my expectations weren't the best. I am always happy to see myself surprised in a good way though.An interesting powerful villain, a more human Magneto, and an allover strong cast with Nightcrawler doing a good job with the entertainment makes this movie a worthwhile watch.This is the strongest X-men movie so far.Sansa Stark is a bit of a distraction that is hard to shake, but the other characters are better casted.

		<shortDescription>Riveting and exciting, but a step down from First Class and Days of Future Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the first ¬X-Men movie was released way back in 2000 this mutant series has been quietly carving out its own piece of the cinematic comic-book pie, with both highs (X2, First Class) and lows (Last Stand, Origins: Wolverine) but a respectably solid overall output. This 'new cast' trilogy closer can't reach the heights of the franchise's best instalments, or its two immediate predecessors, although demonstrates just how thrilling and engaging this universe can be even when not performing at its peak. Centred on the eponymous ancient mega-mutant who wakes up after a few millennia to reclaim the world as his, the dramatic undercurrent is as compelling as the all-powerful villain (despite his underwhelming look) and generates a handful of genuinely intense and evocative scenes. A second-act tete-a-tete between Professor X and Apocalypse ? during which the latter is causing mass destruction accompanied by Beethoven's stirring Symphony No 7 (Algretto) ? is absolutely riveting, almost matched by a potent telepathic showdown within the climax. At this stage in the X-Men evolution there is also a certain level of competence that guarantees the action scenes will be nothing less than exciting and, with Bryan Singer at the helm, constructed and executed with endless ebullience and flair. The CGI struggles on the odd occasion, which is a bit strange for such a big-budget flick, however this is a minor blip amongst a collection of otherwise rousing set pieces that, just like in Days of Future Past, boasts a superb Quicksilver sequence that tops the list. There are a few missteps that weaken the film's lasting power though: bland henchmen surrounding the big bad, Wolvie's unsatisfying involvement, and an atrociously placed Stan Lee cameo that raises giggles at the most inappropriate moment. From the returning cast James McAvoy (Professor X) and Michael Fassbender (Magento) reliably bring the gravitas ? although Jennifer Lawrence looks a tad disinterested in her third time out as Mystique ? whilst Oscar Isaac (as Apocalypse) and Sophie Turner (Jean Grey) impress the most out of the newcomers. Undeniably a rung below the two preceding entries on the X-Men ladder, Apocalypse is still operating at a high enough standard to be thematically absorbing in addition to entertaining on a popcorn level.</fullReview>

The new characters were great although Nightcrawler's accent changed from time to time it didn't take me out of the movie. The old cast was great too. McAvoy and Fassbender played phenomenal. Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult etc. were also good. And the one guy that stole once again the show was Evan Peters as Quicksilver I think this scene was even better than the one in Days of Future Past and I would be so happy if he would get his own movie I think he deserves it.The movie still has flaws, I think that the movie was a little bit too long and the pacing wasn't that good. And yes it is a nitpick but I think it's kind of funny that this movie is set 20 years after First Class and the characters didn't age one year.I think this is a well made entertaining movie and you should watch it even if it has mixed Reviews.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Entry To The Xmen Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-men apocalypse is yet another superhero film to come out this year and is a fantastic follow up to the previous x-men movie days of future past also directed by Brian Singer.Essentially the x-men must unite yet again to stop a extinction level plan created by apocalypse. Now firstly I was skeptical going in to this movie as how apocalypse was going to be played out. However Oscar Isaac's performance gave the character a very menacing and powerful feel, which was hugely needed for a character that is said to be the most powerful mutant. Alongside him you have magneto who gave the best performance of the movie in my opinion and 3 other characters which were ultimately there to be muscle.Then you have the x men, and as in every x men movie you are introduced to new and old x men.The two new x men being reintroduced to the x men universe were Cyclops and Jean Grey. After seeing the movie I was sold on the two characters, they had great chemistry and it was fun to see younger x men helping out the x men from the previous movies. Which speaking of,Quicksilver. He is absolutely incredible in one scene, and throughout the movie he gives the comic relief where appropriate.To top this the effects and cgi were on point especially during fights. The plot was very entertaining, always giving you something to keep you entertained. Overall the movie was very solid with some issues along the way which can be overlooked for enjoyment.</fullReview>

What has this to do with the X men universe but it came clear quickly. The oldest mutant came from that era and he is back to conquer everything.This time the X men flick is full of action, not that much of talking going on like in the earlier flicks. And the effects used are awesome, especially when Quicksilver is doing his thing. That sequence is superb. There's even a bit of fun to catch if you look closely. But the villain too, Apocalypse is excellent too.Even as all characters are done by new actors it didn't bother me at all. This one delivered the real stuff. Open ending of course so here we go.

		<fullReview>I had so much hope for this movie since I have been a big fan of X men for years but I left the cinema wondering what the hell did I just saw.Pros: The first hour or so was amazing, Michael Fassbender was great, his acting was one of the best part of the movie. James McAvoy was decent while Jennifer Lawrence was one leg out of the door in my opinion but I blame this more on the script than her acting ability. Even Fassbender and McAvoy can't carry this movie on their own.Quick Silver and Wolverine actions sequence were great. I like it a lot.The young casts with the exception of Sophie Turner were good enough.Cons: The movie'script was so messy and pretty none sense. They should spend their time writing a decent script not pulling something out of their asses. I think it is time to loose Bryan Singer, we need fresh air for this franchise include new characters not the usual and getting boring characters.They have the strongest villain - Apocalypse and have one of the best actor in the business to play him but look at what we get! The only thing he did was broke the guy legs then he died! No major impact what so ever. The way he died was so anti climatic, I don't know why they name this movie after his name at all.Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was horrible, lack of facial expressions, mono tone voice, weird accent, squared face. Every lines that she delivered were so painful to watch, it was like she can't decide what accent she going to use in a sentence. She was not Jean Grey in my eyes. With mcAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence will not anticipate in the next movie which could be Dark Phoenix, I will not go waste my time and money on Sophie Turner's performance. They should recast if they want to make a new movie all about Jean Grey. If they don't have any good ideas for the franchise, I think they should let it rest for a few years till they can get it together again. Don't just make a new movie every year without any real contents, actions sequence are fun to watch but I don't want to seat through an empty and hollow movie like this again.</fullReview>

Apparently IMDb wants me to dig deep within my soul and come up with more filler so that I can post this review. So be it then. I think this was THE X-men movie we've been waiting for.

		<fullReview>When I saw the negative reviews for this film, I was quite worried. But, as it turns out, this was quite a good film.The acting in this film is rather mixed. It ranged from very great, like James McAvoy as Charles, and Michael Fassbender as Erik, to just good, like Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse, and Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, to just plain awful, like Ben Hardy as Angel, and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Most of the characters were well developed, and like all the other X- Men films, the scenes with Magneto were the best, and most emotional in the film. Some characters however, got the short end of the stick, particularly Jubilee and Psylocke, who had barely any screen time to speak of.The action was something I was quite worried about, but luckily, it far exceeded my expectations. My favourite action centric scene was a scene where Magneto's powers are amplified and he is able to control any metal across the globe, resulting in mass destruction worldwide. The climax of the film was also quite good, despite some occasional ropey CGI.The music was rather generic but pretty entertaining to listen to. The film was also full of "whoa, awesome!" moments, which I though both Captain America: Civil War and Deadpool were both lacking in.Overall, if you haven't seen this film, I would highly recommend it.P.S. Wolverine is awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rollicking Good Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a soft spot in my heart for the X-Men movies, for before IRON MAN and the "Marvel Cinematic Universe", there was the X-MEN. I loved watching Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan duke it out as Professor Xavier and Magneto with what was then a cast of young up- and- comers, Halle Berry, Famke Jenssen, James Marsden and an unknown by the name of Hugh Jackman. I enjoyed their adventures, even the much maligned 3rd movie.I was excited for the "re-boot" with James McAvoy and the great Michael Fassbender taking over with a new group of "up-and comers" including a relatively obscure actress by the name of Jennifer Lawrence. X-MEN: FIRST CLASS was a fun "retro" caper set in 1963. To be honest, putting both the "old" and "new" casts together for X- MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST was fun, but a bit over-stuffed and, if I'm going to be totally honest, the reliance on Jackman's WOLVERINE character was beginning to bore me.So, it was with some trepidation that I ventured into the movie theater to see X-MEN: APOCALYPSE. This was definitely the movie where the X- MEN try to out-Marvel Marvel. The "big bad" in this is an all powerful "god-like" entity (the titular APOCALYPSE) hell-bent on destruction of the Earth. Can the X-Men - including a large band of "newbies" as the younger versions characters we already know - band together to defeat this entity in what will more than likely be a CGI-fest? Or will director Bryan Singer sink this movie under the weight of the many, many characters and CGI that this film will require?I am happy to report that X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is a rollicking good time with a strong group of characters (including the "newbies") that leads to a satisfying ending that left me wanting more of these new X-MEN.Apocalypse starts 10 years after the events in Days of Future Past. That is, in 1983. Charles Xavier is running his school for gifted children, mutants are kept at arms length and are not highly regarded while Magneto has gone underground and is happily living as a husband and father. But, of course, these times don't last.Magneto is involved in an incident that further darkens his heart at the same time that the god-like entity Apocalypse is inadvertently released. It doesn't take long for these two to get together and it is up to Charles Xavier and X-Men to thwart their plans.McAvoy and Fassbender are strong as Xavier and Magneto, they clearly have grown into their characters and they are ably joined by Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult and all the "newbies" (most notably Evan Peters Quicksilver - a fun character introduced in the last film that is expanded on in this one), as well as the reliable Rose Byrne. Director Bryan Singer knows how to make these movies, so moves easily between character direction and big action set pieces, filtering both in enough so we do not get tired of either.The highlight for me in this movie is that this is the first time that all the X-Men had to COMBINE their talents to defeat the villain. In the past, each X-Man had to use their talents, but it seemed a series of individual climaxes combined to form the big climax. In this film, the X-Men need to come together and use their skills in tandem to win. I've been looking for this type of ending since the first film.Oh, and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is used sparingly in what is , in essence, an extended, vicious cameo that ably foreshadows what should be a bloody good time in the upcoming R-Rated (and last, for him) Wolverine movie.Is it a perfect movie? No. At 2 1/2 hours, the movie is a bit long. I could recommend a few places in the first 1/2 of the movie that could be trimmed up, but as the action kicks in, it is a fun ride with characters that I enjoyed rooting for and villains it was easy to root against. Also, the villain, Apocalypse, is pretty generic and wastes the talents of Oscar Isaacs. Since Jennifer Lawrence is now a SUPERSTAR, they give her character a much more prominent role than it probably deserves, but it's Jennifer Lawrence, so I'm not arguing. My final quibble, is that it is a bit dense in X-Men mythology, a fact that I enjoyed, but others might get lost in.My advice, roll with it, don't worry too much about the things that are going over your head. There is no doubt about who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. And the X-Men are, definitely, the good guys.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed, Others will complain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest installment of the X-Men franchise really surprised me. It had it all IMO. Action, drama, and some well timed comedy. The casting was well done as the story helped to transition to other (younger and cheaper) characters like Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Mcavoy killed it as Professor X again. Evan Peters as Quicksilver made the most with limited screen time. The story tied in with all other installments which is always hard to do with movies of this magnitude. Some negatives for me: Apocalypse. Not sure why he can touch a TV and learn the entire history of mankind. The Magneto, I see good in you, you're not evil, story line is tired and if he just had a hand in killing that many people I doubt he would be forgiven so easily. I can overlook some plot holes and nonsense as long as the rest of the movie is enjoyable, which it was. I'd see this movie again and look forward to future X-Men movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After DoFP, I was skeptical if the First Class reboot could go any further. Long story short, DoFP left so many open threads that didn't make sense that I couldn't keep them all straight. Apocalypse comes along and it was the nice shiny bow that tied up the hanging threads of DoFP. Well.. most of them anyway.Without giving too much away, Apocalypse is definitely a continuation of the First Class and DoFP timelines, so know that you won't understand much of it unless you've seen those films. You can enjoy it, sure, but don't expect to understand it. Like seeing the Avengers without seeing Iron Man or Captain America.Watching Apocalypse felt like I was watching the old Saturday morning cartoon series from the early 90s. It was nice to see Jubilee there (even if she doesn't use her 'powers') but it still left me wondering when they're finally going to bring Gambit into the picture. I suppose Colossus was off futzing with Deadpool. We even get to see Prof. X kick some ass which was nice however I won't reveal how.The end feels a lot like the end of Civil War which may be my only complaint. Without spoiling it, it also allows for the connection to the first 3 X-men in a plausible way. My only complaint might be that Weapon X was a program and not a man.In any case it's an excellent continuation to the X-Men saga that any superhero fan should go and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this movie in context and it's epic. See it as a stand-alone film, and you miss the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Promise me you'll find us...the X-Men...guide us."This was Logan/Wolverine's plea to a young Charles Xavier/Professor X in the previous installment of the X-Men franchise, Days of Future Past. That film essentially gave the franchise a fresh start, free of it's past mistakes (ahem,The Last Stand, ahem). Now, we get to see what director Bryan Singer can do with his second chance.It's 1983, exactly ten years after the future-changing events of Days of Future Past. Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is full of students, Eric Lensherr/Magneto is living low in Poland with a new family, and mutants, while not openly persecuted, still feel like outsiders.Along comes En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac (Poe Damaran, is that you under all that makeup?). He's the world's first mutant, buried in stasis in Egypt after his subjects betrayed him 5000 years ago. Now he awakens to a world that doesn't worship any one god (read this as 'him'), and he sets about to fulfill his name, with the help of his Four Horsemen (Magneto, a young Ororo Monroe/Storm, Psylocke, and Angel).Faced against the end of the world, Xavier and his students must band together and fight, as Charles states: "Those of you who have the greatest power, protect those who don't."This film is basically the X-Men version of The Avengers. Most people familiar with the X-Men films know who the major players will be, and here we see them as separate people with their own problems who will come together to protect the people of the earth (at least X-Men aren't squeamish about saying their team catch phrases on screen, unlike some.)Now, for those who are seeing this as their first foray into the X-Men universe: don't see this film yet. The plot will seem incredibly shallow without the character backstories that have been established, and in some cases rewritten, over the past 15 years.The reviewers who saw this early clearly did not have this mindset. However, I have to concede some of their points that, yes, the dialogue seems somewhat repetitive and dull at times, elements that are repeated from previous films seem cheaper and less fulfilling the second time around, and there was really no feeling of suspense. But honestly, this is a superhero movie, are there really any true shockers in those?In short, you won't regret seeing this film if you are a fan of the X-Men franchise. The last film erased their mistakes. This new one is not a new mistake, but they now have no room for error going forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why so much hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I really enjoyed Xmen : Apocalypse. And I honestly don't get why there were so many negative or mediocre reviews. There was one review in particular, that said the first 30 min were boring and was hard to get into (and keep in mind this was one of the few positive ones I watched) and I had no problem with the beginning. It set up a backstory of Apocalypse (which is kind of important) and it didn't spend too long that. We got to see how Cyclops got his powers. There is a cool fighting ring scene with Nightcrawler and Angel (and also at the same time find out what Mystique's been up to). Like, it was entertaining. Plus, most movies start off with some backstories/exposition before they jump right into the villain/battle scenes. I just don't see the problem there. There was a lot of scenes I enjoyed. I was really happy with Nightcrawler and was happy that he had a much more prominent part then what was led to be believed by the trailers. I loved the Quicksilver scenes as well. Michael Fassbender gets to do this really heartbreaking, touching scene that is so well done. Really well acted. And without giving too much away, there is a really cool Inception-like fight that happens with Apocalypse. I think that is the best way of describing it. But a just a cool and different way to take on the villain. And another thing that I like (and what I kind of like about Xmen as a whole) is that there is more of a darker feel to it. There is one scene with Angel that is kind of gruesome. Now that being said, I don't think it was a perfect film. I still enjoyed Days of Future Past more. Maybe even First Class. It could have maybe tightened up some story lines or not throw so many out there. As much as I like Wolverine, he didn't need to be in this. (And no, I don't consider this a spoiler as it is in the trailer). And also Apocalypse is searching for the strongest mutants to be on his side as the Four Horseman but like literally just chooses the first 4 mutants he comes across. That didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. But overall I liked it. At the moment, I would rate it an 8. Maybe that will change once I've had a chance to re-watch the previous films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not disappointing but not amazing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The X-men have been my favorite Marvel, no my favorite Superhero team for as long as I can remember so whilst I've been disappointed in the past with these movies I really had high hopes for this one. While it wasn't the AMAZING thrillfest I had hoped for it also didn't leave me feeling disappointed all that much either. What I'll try to do is break down a few pros and cons here.Pros: Evan Peters as Quicksilver once again stole the show. Not only did he solidify himself as a complete badass in this movie but he also delivered near all the comedic relief that a movie like this truly needs. You could also sense just how much he was troubled by the fact Magneto is his father but he's never known him as well. I feel like Peters has definitely done the best job as this character and I hope we continue to see him in future releases.Sophie Turner does an amazing job as Jean Grey. I love her from the Game of Thrones television show and she fits in wonderfully as Jean. She plays the character well and you can see how troubled she is by her struggle with the powers inside her and sense the closeness between her and Xavier. We also are introduced to Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler who was very likable and also added more humor to the movie.Fassbender and McAvoy do wonderful jobs as Magneto and Xavier once again and the on screen chemistry is just as good as their previous movies. You really can't go wrong with these guys as their roles.The action sequences are pretty great and the CGI doesn't feel overly done. They also made this film much bloodier when we see Wolverine as Weapon X completely massacre Stryker's entire team. Yes, I said massacre...he kills them all...violently.They take a dig at the 3rd X-Men movie. Yeah, they went there.Jean goes full Phoenix in this movie.Their is an after credit scene that sets up the next Wolverine movie.Cons: We don't see enough of the other 3 of the Four Horsemen. We know Magneto's whole story but we don't really see enough of Angel, Psylocke and Storm to know their stories and we don't even see them in action for long. These are supposed to be Apocalypse's soldiers and yet they don't seem all that tough even with him enhancing their powers.Speaking of Apocalypse, nothing about him even seems all that powerful in this movie. He clearly has the power to turn anything to dust yet he has to have people fight for him? Can he not do that to mutants because if he could he would just kill the X-Men right then and there and be done with it. Instead we see the horsemen fight them and lose fairly quickly and he has to put up a shield to keep their barrage of attacks at bay.I'm not sure how I feel about them throwing out Origins:Wolverine.So structures across the entire planet were just destroyed. Cities flattened by Magneto....and we're to expect the whole world just gets rebuilt after that? Sure Magneto and Jean magically rebuild the mansion from scratch but I imagine the world isn't just gonna quickly recover from that.Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Yeah, didn't do it for me this time. Sorry.Overall this was really worth a watch. It's not horrible but not amazing so it gets a 7 from me. I enjoyed it fully and thought my $9.75 for a 3D ticket was worth it. Weirdly though I went to the 2nd showing at 8:15pm the day before "release" and was the only one in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Professor X Lost his hair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was actually a lot better than I expected it to be. Okay, it is an X-men movie so I was going to see it within days of it hitting the cinemas, but a part of me was expecting it to be a little washed up and a little dull, especially since this is movie number 10. Well, as it turned out it wasn't ? it was really enjoyable. Mind you, don't expect it to closely follow the timeline as set out in the previous movies namely because, as we all know from Days of Future Past, the time line has been changed. This means that Scott Summers is introduced to the X-men in a different way (as opposed to how he was introduced back in X-Men Origins:Wolverine).As you are probably aware, Wolverine doesn't really make an appearance in this film (well there is an uncredited cameo, but that is about it). This is not surprising since Hugh Jackman is on the verge of hanging up his adamatine talons (he is getting pretty old). However, rumour has it that this is probably going to be the second-to-last X-men movie in the franchise, and I suspect that we won't be seeing McKellan or Stewart reprising their roles in the future either (most likely, if another X-men movie does appear, it will be Fassbender and McIvoy).In a way this is another of the origin movies, though here we see a rebooted version of the Scott Summers origin story, and the Storm origin story (as well as having Jean Grey and Nightcrawer taking lead roles as well, which is somewhat different from when Nightcrawler made an appearance in X2). What the movie does is that it sets the scene of what will become the X-men, though I have a feeling that the Brotherhood of Mutants may be something that has now been left in the alternate timeline (you will see why when we get to the end of the film).What we have is the first mutant ? Apocalypse ? waking up from a five thousand year slumber after a conspiracy resulted in him being buried deep in the Earth. Apocalypse has the habit of transferring his consciousness to other mutants, thus gaining their powers, and in turn becoming stronger himself. However he can also imbue others with his powers, thus strengthening them ? he is always known to travel with four lieutenants, who are known as The Horsemen. Thus when he awakens his first job to to find four mutants to be his henchmen.We also find Magneto has withdrawn from society to live in a small cottage in Poland and is working in a steal mill. I should mention that the film is set in the late eighties, thus continuing the Origins theme, which has set all of the X-men movies in the past (which was designed as a way of rebooting the franchise after a rather disastrous X-men III movie). However, the two movies that are referred to here are First-Class and Days of Future Past (though we do note that Steward and McKellan did revise their roles in the last movie).All in all this was a pretty enjoyable movie, and the character of Apocalypse was actually really well done. I also quite liked Magneto, who is still struggling with his identity and his place in the world. He doesn't necessarily come across as the stereo-typical villain, but rather a man with internal struggles, and one who was suffered pain because of who he is, and then lashing out in anger at a world that does not seem to care. As we know, the X-men franchise has always been one about power, and power struggles, and how to respond against persecution because of who one happens to be. This theme comes through into this film as well, as well as bringing along many of the other characters, such as William Stryker and Moira McTaggart, who have been staples in some of the other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forget how many X-Men movies there have been but this latest version is a strong return for the franchise and is close to being with the best as First Class (my favourite film of the franchise to date), X-Men: Apocalypse is a character driven, emotional and yet entertaining comic book movie that will indeed keep not only the fans happy but the audience either entertained or bored.Pretty much continuing after the events of Days of Future Past and while connecting to First Class, Charles Xavier leads the path for all mutants to be taught to control their powers and live in peace among the human race. We see the younger versions of the telepathic Jean (Turner), 'Nightcrawler' Kurt (Smit-McPhee), 'Cyclops' Scott (Sheridan) and especially the return of 'Quicksilver' Peter (Peters) who was in DOFP. Their chances of peace are tested when an ancient figure known as Apocalypse aka En Sabah Nur (played by Oscar Issac, who is unrecognized with so much make up on) awakens from an deep slumber to see that the world now doesn't rely or turn to the gods as his time had, so he recruits other mutants including Magneto and plans to destroy and rebuild life in his image, thus setting Xavier and crew to reunite and confront him in an ensuring battle for peace.What I loved about this film is that 'character' is taken to levels that made FC a worthy film. In particular the performances of McAvoy, Fassbender, Issac, Turner, Peters and Byrne are great and showcase the ranges of emotion and development to make their presence in the plot worthwhile. Lawrence was good as usual but there's not much for her to expand unlike FC and DOFP. The supporting cast handle well as well.In terms of story, it does balance itself with the themes of religion, faith, redemption and choosing our destiny and it does follow wisely in a 2 1/2 running time. The action doesn't kick in till the 2nd half of the story but it does take at least under an hour to make up for the 1st half of dialogue and character development (I say this only if you are expecting something that Civil War had done much better, but this is not the case). The moments of Magneto's story were pretty much spot on, we have seen the past of his life in the previous films and his established character but here we are given to how he copes in the world, where is often in a battle to fight to know where he stands in the world.Overall, it doesn't beat Civil War by a long shot (to phrase that, the best comic book adaptation of the year) but it does prove itself to be a better installment following DOFP and using the key elements of FC to make this a rare return to the strong point of the franchise. With some key strong performances, emotional tone and a lengthy climax it's worth a watch for the die hard fans of X-Men.Nick - 3.5/5 Jay - 3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn good entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, I liked it. Not loved it, but really liked it.There's no going around it. It's a CGI crap-fest from the first scene to the last. With that being said, most of it looked pretty good. A few scenes where I thought "Man, this is going to look bad on my TV." And some scenes where amazing and made me wish I'd seen it in 3D. It starts with a fast paced scene to set up what's to come. Then it takes it time introducing us to the new characters, and show us status-quo on old ones. This is probably not helping on the 2 hour 24 minutes run time of the movie, but some of the characters would probably feel a lot more shallow without it. Then, when it finally kicks in gear, there's no turning back. A lot of great action scenes and some CGI bullsh!t that looks cool, I guess. I don't know much about the phoenix saga, other than that Brett Ratner screwed it up in X-men the last stand. therefor I can't say how accurate or well depicted it was in regards to the comic, but to me it was handled well. The acting was great. McAvoy, Isaac and Smith-McPhee stood out to me as Xavier, Magneto and Nightcrawler. the others did a great job as well. Some in recurring roles and some newcomers. Like Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan as Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Jennifer Lawrence, however, is pretty much phoning it in at this point. She looked like she wanted to be anywhere but there. One of the scenes with quicksilver stole the show and was worth the price of admission alone. On the bad side though. In a market saturated by superhero movies, I'm afraid this might go down as just one more drop in the sea. It's great entertainment, but I'm probably not going to remember much of it in a month. Could be wrong though. Totally justifiable to spend your hard earned cash on, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but don't let that stop you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personal opinion, as these always are- if you're a fan of the X-Men films, ignore the critics and enjoy yourself, because Apocalypse is FUN!The movie picks up the threads of Prof X's and Magneto's story ten years after DoFP. Both characters are in a happier place - they're older, less inclined to fight, both living a measure of peace through their version of family. Until, as is always the case, it all goes to hell in a hand basket. It's a big, loud, colourful production. Silly costumes and explosions are a standard, much as they are in the comics. Also, cool superpowers x1000 make the fights pretty epic (and who are we kidding, that's part of why we pay the ticket). In fairness to the critics, it's a bit choppy, trite at times, somewhat over the top and too upbeat for the dark moments to hit as hard as they probably should. Apocalypse is undoubtedly the weakest villain yet (neither power-hungry and devious like Shaw nor cynically inquisitive like Transk, he ends up being the most banal of world-dominating super-villains in a while). But!For a fan of the franchise, this film feels a bit like coming home. It combines the hopeful youth that made First Class so good (and very successfully introduces the younger generation X-Men) with the high stakes, high profile, world-ending battles of DoFP. Overall, loose threads from the other two movies are (mostly) tied up, and you get a little bit of everything/everyone as the First Class generation conflicts draw to a close and leave room for the modern X-Men. Despite being flashy and titanic in size, it still manages to end on a simple, hopeful note similar to that on which the franchise reboot began.Thinking of seeing it? Expect an epic superhero film made mostly for fans of the franchise, with all the characters you know and love and the classic highs and lows of its genre. And obviously, spandex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Franchise Needs to End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three big superhero movies this summer thus far: Captain America, Batman vs Superman and X-Men: Apocalypse. Out of the three - only Captain American hit the mark. Like SVB - this movie lacks the characterization, humanity and story that lives in the other end of the Marvel universe.The acting is sub par. But in the actors defense, the script does not leave a lot of room for growth. None of the X-Men (or villains) are worth caring about.The script is terrible. The X-Men vs mankind theme has gotten so old. Where the Capt America, Thor, and Iron Man movies excel is because they are fighting for justice and to keep people safe. This movie (and the others) are basically always about the inner battle between the same group of mutants over and over and over. How many times is Magneto going to kill thousands (and he kills thousands upon thousands in this movie) and then Xavier going to say he sees good in him and suddenly he is back in the X-Men's good graces. Really? Magneto murdered thousands in this film and then walks away without being held accountable. Almost thought he was Secretary of State. Then the long-long-long over shot, silly, juvenile scene where Quicksilver saves all of the Xavier students from an explosion. My niece thought that it was funny - I felt that is was a drawn out mess and that the same message could have been shown with him saving a few children - rather than showing almost every single child in the school.Then, of course, we have to have a cameo of the worse X-Man in the franchise - Wolverine. The guy who went from comic book action hero to mass murder in the movies. The guy who kills without a conscience and goes on murder sprees. The guy (who if the writers wanted to actually write about why human and mutants are at odds) creates the fear and distrust that humans would have.After seeing this one - I thought "Batman vs Superman was better" and that was a mess.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Entry To The X-Men Franchise, It May Not Be The Best One But It Doesn't Deserve The Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Marvel clearly is the top brand right now, if you look back the X-Men franchise has been putting out quality movies since the early 2000s (except for a couple of sub-par entries but the less said about those the better). Since they re-booted X-Men with X: First Class, we've had 2 very good movies and expectations were high for X-Men: Apocalypse so the mixed response to it was pretty surprising. After seeing it first hand, it may not be as complete as some of the best superhero movies, but it still brings the excitement and the characters that you've come to enjoy watching every few years.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* X-Men Apocalypse starts off with the introduction to the title character as opposed to Charles or Magneto. In Ancient Egypt Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) rules as a living god. He was the first mutant and transfers his consciousness from person to person to live for centuries. There is a ceremony to perform the transfer but just as it's about to go down, his guards try to bury him alive in the pyramid. His followers are able to prevent him from being destroyed but he is entombed in the pyramid under layers of debris. He remains very much alive but asleep, waiting to be awakened.Next we catch up with Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). She's a one woman operation now and she is attending a shady mutant pit fight in Germany. The reigning champion is Angel (Ben Hardy) but she's there to rescue the challenger Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Nightcrawler doesn't seem terribly interested in fighting though, he's still a kid and doesn't seem to have a mean streak. He actually wins the fight (Angel's wings are partially burned off) but he escapes before things go south with Raven.As for our other 2 main characters, Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) has seemingly settled down as a steel worker in Poland. He has a family and is living the simple life when it is all thrown into chaos when he has to unexpectedly show his powers to save someone's life. Prof. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has his school up and running with some impressive new students in Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Gray (Sophie Turner) but he gets thrown back into the fray when Moira Mactaggart (Rose Byrne) happens upon the resurrection of Apocalypse accidentally and requires his assistance.Putting aside the talk about the visuals and the action, I think the point where this movie shines is the introduction of new characters. If you've watched the older X-Men movies or read the comics, you know who Cyclops, Jean and Nightcrawler are but their re-introduction is handled very well. They cast the right people in those parts and you connect to their struggle. The deeper message behind the source material has always been about exclusion because of being different and trying to find a sense of belonging and just like those earlier movies Singer knows how to get you to feel for these characters.Aside from all the talk about Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse you get some good performances in X-Men Apocalypse. Michael Fassbender continues to show why he's one of the best actors working. He's got a pretty dramatic arc and he nails it. James McAvoy, Rose Byrne, Nicholas Hoult all deliver typically good acting performances, they're franchise vets and they know what they're doing. Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan , Kodi Smit-McPhee and Alexandra Shipp were all cast well and they make you excited for where this franchise will go in the future. A lot of people ripped on Jennifer Lawrence and Oscar Isaac and I agree neither of them are spectacular. Jennifer did a decent job but she doesn't seem to have the same energy she brought to the previous movies. I though Oscar Isaac actually did a good job but he's dragged down by a really over-the-top character and having to perform under all that makeup, it just doesn't help. If you're a fan of Olivia Munn or Hugh Jackman don't get your hopes up too much, neither of them are in the film very long and they don't get much to do.While this movie brought in cool new characters and showed the continued adventures of our favourite X-Men, I do have to agree with the critics in that the ending isn't nearly as strong as the beginning and the middle of the movie. Most of the better scenes are watching the kids learning to use their powers and interacting with each other or watching smaller characters stealing scenes (just like Days of Future Past, Quicksilver steals the movie with his montage). When we get to the big battle at the end, it becomes CGI overload, characters make weird decisions for no other reason but to further the plot and you get some of the clichés that you were hoping the movie was going to avoid. I thought the action looked decent but it wasn't anything special and it didn't measure up to the promise I thought the movie had in the beginning. It was disappointing but it didn't diminish the rest of the movie for me.We've had 2 of the most polarizing and divisive superhero movies ever already this year. This one goes more down the middle. I feel like this movie took a critical beating because we've been spoiled as fans of the X-Men franchise. Sure, Apocalypse wasn't a great villain but was he that bad or did he just pale in comparison to Fassbender's version of Magneto? The setting of Apocalypse in the 1980s wasn't as prominent but does it just look that way because X: First Class did the 1960s so well? Maybe but that's up to you to decide. This movie is a lot of fun if you're a fan of this franchise. Expectations have to be managed though, if you're expecting X2 or X-Men: Days of Future Past, you'll likely be disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This board is run by movie marketers they hand out 10's like candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was just so so and that's sad because Brian singer is a great director.Sophie turner was just plain boring.None of the woman in this movie were other than unremarkable.This discussion board is taken over by marketers just like batman v superman was.One would have to have a complete lack of intelligence to rate this higher than five or six.The other Singer films are very good as well as his TV show House.Xmen first class was excellent and had a very good young cast.These new actors lack any charisma.Was it worth 7 bucks to see it at the matinée,yeah I guess,but you will forget it in a couple of days.Except for the special effects this movie looks like it was made by fan boys instead of filmmakers.The look on StanLee's face in his cameo says it all,he's supposed to look frightened and worried because of the earthquakes and chaos,but he's worried the franchise is going off the rails.This movie will fade away by next week and so far this summers big budget movies seem to be hit or miss.Civil war was epic,batman v superman and X-men are misses in my book,because special effects alone can't save a movie from uninspired writing.The next big budget ensemble cast movie is SUICIDE SQUAD and I can't wait, and it looks like DC and Marvel will have one great movie and on so-so movie. American movies are the best in the world at making special effects,no one comes close,but people are smarter and more sophisticated now and we deserve better writers.But watching this movie I felt like i've seen it all before and even the actors seemed bored with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Apocalypse Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After creating an another time-line to the X-men Universe in Days of Future Past, X-Men Apocalypse delivers a satisfying and interesting story along with presenting the new generation of the future X-men films.In the opening scene, we got to know more about who Apocalypse is and all the cult that supports him. After such impressive scene, it made me more anxious for the rest. In the end, I wasn't disappointed, just some directions which the film took that made me question about it.There's no doubt that Michael Fassbender as Magneto and James McAvoy as Professor X are the ones who gave the best performance. Specially Fassbender who in the first scenes are fantastic, specially one in the forest. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique also did a great job, but an issue that I had is the path which this character created through the films, because there's so much Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games movies in the mystique's personality that it quite a lot.Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse is incredible, the changes in his voice made the character feels much more powerful, the costume isn't as good as the one from the comics but it's quite OK. My problem were the four horsemen, the introduction of each one specially Angel and Psylocke is very interesting, because it shows a different mutant world that I would like to know more, even though it's the focus of the film. As the movie goes on, it's not given to them such importance and in the end, feels like they're just Apocalypse's stooges. The new generation is very promising, their arcs and presentations aren't very extensive, it's to the audience get to know the new faces of characters already known, as Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Storm and Jubille. A character already pretty established is Quicksilver, when he's in the scene, he steals it, particularly in his special scene which is just amazing and fantastic to watch.Due to the nature of the film, it's required lots of CGI. It worried me, because in some moments it was very perceptible, but overall, the special effects were really good, more so, when it was the powers' demonstrations. In the end, X-Men Apocalypse is a great movie to the a trilogy started in X-Men First Class. In regards of the action is one of the best, it falls in the drama aspect, except one or two characters who receive more attention, the others doesn't have a lot to work with in relation with their dramatic plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think that X-Men: Days of Future Past was a little better than this one, but X-Men: Apocalypse was not bad at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1983, ten years after Days of Future Past(Twenty years in the trilogy and yet everyone looks as young as they looked in the first film). Charles Xavier with the help of Beast and the reluctant Mystique must turn a group of students into X-Men in order to stop an ancient mutant and his minions, which includes Magneto, from wiping all of humanity out.All the actors were at their best in this film. Great performances, especially from James McAvoy as Professor X was really good. Michael Fassbender has a really good touching dramatic story.But Quicksilver turned out to be my fav mutant in this movie. They took what made him awesome in Days of Future Past and up it a level in Apocalypse which worked so well and was the best part of the whole film (even though Hugh Jackman does his cameo as the greatest X-Men of them all).The villain, Apocalypse himself I was not impressive with outside him driving the story. It was cool that Oscar Issac played the role as I'm a fan of his stuff, but once again, a superhero movie has a lackluster supervillain. I mean look at Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique who should have been a villain, but now they have to change the character altogether cause of her megastar status.I'm also still not so impressed with the way Bryain Singer handles Special effects. Anyway, it is a good flick, A lot of really cool comic book references, but at the same time a decent drama, It's starts out a little slow trying to fit everyone's origin story into the film, but in the end it's very satisfying</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As Days of Future Past, But Still Very Good and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, let's just say that if you aren't very familiar with X-Men or at least the 1990s cartoon series, you will not understand much of this movie. To you it will seem like a bunch of CGI, explosions, and random dialogue.However, to the medium to hardcore X-Men fan (not just Marvel fan, but X-Men fan), this movie is the one you've been waiting for. The movie tells the story nicely, but slightly different from the animated series. If you want a background, I suggest you check out the Apocalypse mini-series where Wolverine and Rogue played a much bigger part in fighting Apocalypse.Of the 3 recent X-Men movies, I would say this is tied for the first. DOFP is in a league of its own IMO.My only complaint is that they could have made Apocalypse use more of his powers. But, I do like how they gave his origin in this movie.Overall, the movie is extremely entertaining. I prefer this movie over Avengers 1, 2, and Civil War, but it really depends on whether you can handle violence - which this movie has a lot more of.8/10.</fullReview>

X-Men Apocalypse is definitely worth watching (and re-watching since it's so good and full of action) even if you haven't seen the other X-Men movies. I haven't seen the others either but after watching this one, it is now my mission to watch every single X-Men movie since I loved this one and can't get enough of the X-Men. Perfect cast, spot- on music choices, great visual/sound effects, and overall an amazing movie. I definitely recommend watching this movie and seeing for yourself; you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

Most of the negative reviews of these kind of movies are always people without an open mind who definitely don't review objectively. This movie is good and definitely worthy of the X-men title. It is not the best of the series, but not the worst. This movie is way better than 70% of all the movies in theaters.The villain is played very well by our Star Wars rebellion actor, Oscar Isaac. An actor which I had never seen before the latest Star Wars movie. A great talent that makes the movie really intense. Overall I give the movie a 7.8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-MEN APOCALYPSE REVIEW - Finished watching one of the most Anticipated Hollywood flick of the year XMen Apocalypse and i am thrilled. Kick Ass, Faadu, Brilliant, Outstanding and bla bla, in 1 Word (in Indian Language) K A D A K.... Certainly Best Xmen series film i've watched. Better than previous Xmen films, Avengers Series in short Best Hollywood Flick of the year 2016 so far. We usually don't expect Quality film making and script from Money making entertainers but if we get Good Script with lots of entertaining elements then we call that film a Classic and exactly same happened to me after watching Apocalypse. I don't call it a Classic but yes Film has surpassed my expectations and has forced me to watch it again in theater. Probably first Hollywood film of 2016 which i will watch 2nd time in theater. Excellent writing, Tight screenplay with zero loo breaks, Outstanding VFX and 3D effects and a perfect paisa vasool entertainer as a whole. Xmen Apocalypse doesn't disappoint you in any field. The main reason is its screenplay which is entertaining throughout for 145 mins despite very less comedy. Visual effects and 3D Effects are best for any Hollywood film recently. First half lefts you on interesting note which doesn't easily happen with other money making entertainers, and then 2nd half completely surprises you with Good worthy a perfect climax. Wolverine surprises in his 2 minutes cameo. Erik's son is surprising element because of its Lightning Fast speed super power. Overall i don't have any minuses to count, this is a Perfect Entertainer for Hollywood lovers. I'm giving 8/10 stars which is really high for this kind of Entertaining Genre film. Go for this one, if you're really looking for a perfect Hollywood Entertainer and i'm sure Film won't disappoint you.</fullReview>

When i was watching the first part of the movie i think that "this movie could be better than the days of future past" until it reached like 70% of the movie. It could be improved in the last 30% or 40% of the movie, The four horsemen appearance and part in this movie could be better and more exciting. at least improve the big battle part it could be better and more more exciting. If you're a x men movies fans you'll like it better because the reference from the previous movies are make it more enjoyable and there are characters from previous movies that make you understand more and enjoy it more if you've watched all previous movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Story/Great Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "X-Men:Apocalypse", starring James McAvoy-Victor Frankenstein- Atonement; Michael Fassbender-Steve Jobs, Haywire; Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, Garden Party and Oscar Isaac-Star Wars:Episode 7_The Force awakens, All About the Benjamins.I think this is about the 6th X-Men movie and the 3rd directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed Days of Future Past, X-men 2 and X-men. James returns as Professor Xavier, as well as Michael as Magneto and Jennifer as Mystique. Oscar is the bad-ass villain and I do mean bad-ass, as he plays En Sabah Nur, aka Apocalypse. Oscar is purported to be the original mutant, from back in the ancient times of Egypt, where he would feed off of other mutants and even absorb their powers which would make him even stronger. After an incident with some non-believers, Oscar is buried in a pyramid for thousands of years, until he is unearthed in 1983. And he does not like what he sees. He decides to just destroy the whole world and start all over, with a little help from his 4 horsemen- kind of like mutant henchmen-paving the way. Since this is 1983 you get to see some of the mutants discover their abilities from the beginning, such as Storm, Cyclops and Nightcrawler. And of course Stan Lee makes his usual cameo; but this time, he has his real life wife standing beside him. There is another X-Men cameo but I'd rather not spoil it for you-you may have already heard about it but it's better as a surprise. There is also a scene after the end credits which has something to do with the aforementioned guest cameo above, so don't leave too soon. Bryan has said that this is the finale of his X-Men story arc but don't worry, there is already talk of more X-men-and X-Force-movies coming. It's rated "PG-13" for violence, destruction and language and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 24 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

It was a great experience seeing in 3D in movie theater.I would also like to appreciate the direction of the movie. I've felt the audience of the theater responding synchronously to the actions, emotions, references and surprises in the movie. I believe it is a difficult job to achieve such response. I enjoyed the environment of the theater.Recommendation: # See in 3D and surround sound system # See with friends, preferably who knows related things, if possible # See in the movies if you enjoy the response of audience (may need to be geek, but in a tolerable level :P)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great addition to the X-Men franchise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this latest installment of the X-Men series. Apocalypse delivers with great action and an entertaining story throughout. The special effects were breathtaking and the story engaging. I've contemplated what resulted in the bad reviews and can only think that people demanded too much from the film. For me, it was a fun ride and a nice next chapter in the growing, repeating universe of mutants.Set in 1983, the story first flashes back to ancient Egypt when Apocalypse tried to transfer his body to a healing mutant that is similar to Wolverine. Oscar Isaac, who I enjoy in pretty much every role, plays the eponymous villain. He's mostly dressed up but he is dominating and frightening as he brings about destruction in the world. He recruits his four horsemen, including Psylocke, played silently by Olivia Munn, Storm, played by a new talent Alexandra Shipp, Angel, played by Ben Hardy. Magneto rounds out the four, Michael Fassbender returns as Eric Lensherr. He continues to be brooding but it's the same character we've seen in the two previous films.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not ashamed to admit I'm a big X-Men fan (especially the first two). There's something in the writing that makes it feel personal and yet global. I'm gutted to say that this time around the depth wasn't up to standard, especially after the triumph of Days Of Future Past. So much attention was paid to spectacle and not so much to the little details.On the plus side, the story and spectacle are very strong and impressive - Apocalypse is a terrifically terrifying villain bent on planetary destruction, and despite some fairly dodgey animation in places the action is gripping and impactful, and the finale is edge-of-your-seat tense!McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence still steal the show - but the new cast also do their part well (especially Tye Sheridan). However, like the other prequel movies, the character chronology is all over the place, which to a nerd like me is incredibly distracting. You can use the 'alternate timeline' excuse but that only gets you so far.The main point though is that it's enjoyable! The script isn't particularly funny or clever (except the very relevant Star Wars conversation), and some of the CGI is pretty bad, but the characters and action are fun, bright and explosive - enough to get you through the slightly too long runtime. If only Singer had made this his X-Men 3 with the original (and better) cast...4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, with the announcement of 'X-Men: Apocalypse' and coming off of the momentum that 'Days of Future Past' left me with... I was first extremely excited for this sequel. As time went on, announcements were made regarding casting and directions and as trailers were released, my excitement started to lose steam. As of yesterday before my screening of the film, I was prepared to rate this movie a 5/10 and was anticipating to be highly disappointed. I am more than happy to say I was extremely wrong. My early predictions had me hating what seemed to be Jennifer Lawrence/Mystique leading the X- Men. Upset at what seemed to be Xavier acting as a supporting role. Disappointed in the result of Apocalypse, and I probably had more negative anticipations that I can no longer remember. All of these early predictions were shot down. I enjoyed this film incredibly. From start to finish, I was locked in with every line, actions sequence, comedic relief, everything. I was satisfied with every actor/actress' performance INCLUDING Jennifer Lawrence, whom of which I have never been a major fan of with her portrayal of Mystique. Apocalypse was as bad-ass and powerful as I would have wanted and Oscar Isaac delivered. I am highly impressed at the way X-Men has handled their timeline altering and making it work well moving forward. And lastly, did you really think I would not mention my boy at least once? Wolverine's cameo (Hugh Jackman) was everything I hoped and dreamed for. There were small negative points and gripes I had with the film but nothing major to alter my overall response to the film as whole. I am happy to be proved wrong. 'X- Men: Apocalypse' was extremely entertaining and overall an excellent installment to the film series. I highly recommend a watch for the sleeper superhero movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward watching this movie. But The CGI effects must have been expensive, because it seems the production saved money on the actors and plot. Apocalypse, the first mutant, neither his exact powers, nor his origin story, how he became the first mutant is revealed. Fassbender, as Magneto and in some degree McAvoy are the 2 exceptions. "Sansa Stark" was a horrible miscast for Jane Grey. Liveless, anemic , her ability is to put her finger to the temple, not even that is believable.This movie isn't as bad as "Batman vs. Superman" but still, the stand-ins for Cyclops, Storm, even Nightcrawler horrible. Chubby Mystique is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is not as good as First Class and Days Of Future Past;It's a solid entry with a big ending! I really enjoyed Apocalypse but at times it felt a bit cheesy but the movie takes place in the 80's so they attempted to give it an authentic era feel. The beginning was a bit slow and by slow I mean that there's a lot of dialogue going on and that's because i think they wanted to built the character of Apocalypse. besides that there are tons of great moments, especially another fantastic scene with Quicksilver. another concern about the movie is that Apocalypse himself never feels threatening. When he shows up, he seems like you should be afraid, but by the end of the movie he seems under powered and you wonder why his followers worked for him at the first place. Also Angel and Psylocke could have been more central to the 4 horseman. the final battle was epic and ransom and characters had nice costumes too! to sum up it's a highly entertaining film to watch especially for the fans but for some others it might not pass!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always loved x-men idea and powers. So was excited for this one. Did enjoy the 3 trailers (Except for the wolverine spoiler). Before watching the movie I did read the critic reviews and was thinking how bad the movie must be to get such a low rating.Anyway, enter IMAX, and movie begins: First part where Apocalypse being buried and power transfer was really good (Background music was nice here). His awakening was also kind of good but not as great as the previous scene.Magneto in Poland as a steel worker felt little meh. But the scene where his wife and daughter gets killed and he holding them was very emotional. Fassbender acting was great here.Apocalypse recruiting horsemen felt little rushed without any depth. Angel getting metal wings was badass. Apocalypse disarming the world from nukes was neat.Oscac issac/Apocalypse felt badass but script around his powers and intentions was very bad which makes us less attached. James mcavoy/professor was damn good as usual. JL/Mystique felt lame. Nightcrawler had his moments. Quicksilver was an extended version of DOFP which was cool. Cyclops/Havock were okay. Olivia munn had few good moments but overall was underused. I felt jean to be okaish tough I enjoyed the phoenix form.Wolverine cameo was pretty good but involves gore. Climax felt underwhelming considering the scale of destruction Apocalypse wanted to unleash. There was no explanation why apocalypse just disarms quicksilver/Cyclops when he could have killed them with a wave of his hand.Magneto switching sides in the middle of world destruction based on few emotional words from mystique felt lame.Overall its a good movie don't believe the critics. It has nice wow moments. It does have bad stuffs but it's worth a watch in theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw early glimpses of the film, I thought Apocalypse looked a bit naff, but Issac played him well. I especially like the darkness he brought to the character. Was a really entertaining film, the opening scene was done really well and set the pace which never lets up for long. Plenty of action scenes and fighting plus the CGI wasn't over bearing or too obvious. I think the film was unfairly slammed by critics, a common critique was it had too many characters. I thought they had a pretty solid function in the story and weren't just thrown in like Ant man (Civil War)was seemingly kidnapped in a van and asked if he basically wanted to go on a mission that would put him on the most wanted list, which he did for no other reason because hes Ant man and hes funny. All in all a great edition to the X-men series, wonder how many prequels they will get out of it though seems never ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved it!!! Sure its not upto the standards of DOFP n definitely not even close to First Class but its really good!!!! I really don't get all this hate!!! Effect of living in a post MCU-era???People really need come to their senses and realise not every superhero franchise follows the nonsensical MCU format!!!! What is the general MCU format??? No story...no plot...no character development...just a bunch of ppl kicking asses and blowing up stuff from the word "go"...add with it cheesy one-liners n repetitive humour n thats it!!! Thats pretty much what 9 out of 10 MCU movies are all about!!! And what better way to compensate for a lack of true content!!!X-Men has always been different and in my opinion...better!!! This franchise has always been darker...more mature...more plot driven...more character driven!!! Every X-Men movie including this one has content good enough to hold its audience without special effects and over-the-top-action scenes!!! For how many MCU movies can u say this???X-Men: Apocalypse had me hooked from the first scene and kept me engaged throughout!!! There is very little to almost no action till before the climax but the content as usual is good enough to keep u hooked!!! N the action lovers needn't be disappointed...the last 30 minutes has sufficient to makeup for the whole movie!!! N that by the way is a real fight!!! Where both teams give in their 100% to take the other down!!! The airport scene in Civil war was more like a new form of bromance!!!QUICKSILVER WAS AWESOME!!!! Once again he ruled!!!! He was awesome!!! Did I say that already??? Who cares!!! I can just keep saying it!!!James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were amazing!!! This is another thing about this franchise...it gives more space to its actors than most other superhero movies!!! Loved Sophie Turner as Jean Grey cant wait to see more!!! I was a little disappointed in Mystique!!! In the last 2 installments not only did she play a pivotal role but her character was really twisted...conflicted...i think mysterious is the word!!! In this one its pretty one-dimensional...still way better than Black Widow though!!!Not to give away spoilers...there was a major cameo...lets say Weapon X...that I feel should have been handled better!!!One last thing...for the Civil War lovers who are complaining about the villain here...Apocalypse was about to destroy the world and did actually destroy almost half of it in the process...please remind me what did the Civil War villain Zemo do??? Right!!! Make Iron Man and Captain America fight...except wasn't that going to happen anyway...followed by their disagreement on the peace accords??? What did he really make happen that wasn't already going to happen??? Nothing!!! Which makes his character irrelevant if not useless...which makes Apocalypse a way better villain!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was pretty amazing, so f**k all the critics. I think that the critics see these kind of movies as stand-alone's. They miss the point that they are a part of a series and are meant particularly for the comic lovers. The basic idea of these movies is that over the years, the ever-so-popular comics have held us in trance, and now we can see the characters and their stories live on the big screen, performed by excellent actors (read ordinary humans). I think that's the kind of psychological trick that does it for the superhero/comic-based movies (I'd include Bond movies too). You can't judge it in the ways you judge a movie from the realistic genres. I think its high time specific critics developed for this genre or the existing critics to get an update on the 'criticizing'. The star, for me, as usual, was The Wolverine. The way the scene was built up took me back to the same for Dr. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (I know, too much romanticism, But it was a real treat to watch). I'll really miss him in the forthcoming movies, if Wolverine III is really the end.Sophie Turner (as Jean Grey) adds another jewel to her already dazzling tiara. She is quite an actress for her age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic comic book film that defies the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard some mixed reviews for this film and I don't really see where the negative ones come from because this is a fantastic addition to the X- Men films. The premise sees the film set 10 years after days of future past and an ancient mutant has woken up to destroy the world. James macavoy is back as professor xavier and he feels closer to the character then ever before. He does a great job as a headstrong leader that has to show strong mentality to the characters around him. Michael fassbender reprises his role as magneto and he is easily the most interesting character in this film as he tries to recover his life but he has the pain in his life that makes him drawn to apocalypse. Jennifer lawrence is back as mystique and she is great in the role. She provides a complex performance as the character that makes you care about her character. Oscar isaac plays the villain apocalypse and even though he is underneath allot of make up he delivers a performance full of depth. He is a charismatic leader that allows you to understand why his allies would join him. All the other cast do a great job too, quicksilver has lots of stand out moments and depth to his character. Nightcrawler, jean grey and cyclops also deliver great performances and are good characters. The story of the film continues this series of films very well as a new group of mutants are developed and grow. Even though the villains plot is pretty simple it works because of his depth and delivery. The script has a good blend of drama and humour like all of the singer X-Men films and it helps develop some of the supporting characters such as quicksilver and Cyclops. The style has some great action scenes that come straight from the comics and makes the stakes of this film seem huge. However, the pacing of the film is a little all over the place especially for the first 30 minutes where it tries to set up a few different plot lines and it feels a bit disjointed. Overall this is a fantastic comic book film that is amongst the best in this franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like the superhero movie-making crowd stopped trying a few years ago. The original X-Men movie went into many of the character's backstories and had a plot with plausible motive and execution. The team had to work together to figure our how to defeat the villain, who really wasn't a villain. And, they were normal people trying to make sense of and cope with extraordinary powers. It was a film beyond just the fighting. X-Men Apocalypse didn't really bother much with story and got right to the video game-like throwing magic around until time ran out then the villain got overpowered where he was not overpowered by the same magic before. For those just looking for good fight scenes, you have probably seen better fighting on the Mortal Kombat video game.Marvel had a golden opportunity with the Apocalypse character. When you have the first and greatest mutant who ever lived you can tell the greatest background story of all time. The background story basically came down to Apocalypse stealing powers, not using them in any smart way, then seemingly forgetting them when the clock ran out and it was time to roll the credits. I would have liked to see where Apocalypse came from, how he grew into the being he is now and when he got to the 1980's have more profound objectives than just destroying everything. Typically, "bad guys" are perceived as heroes by those that follow them, and are doing the right thing from their perspective. As a many thousands of year old being Apocalypse should have had an objective that was right in principle, but unacceptable in execution. Instead we got "Insert generic bad guy here?" So many character opportunities were missed out of uninspired convenience. Jean Grey, at this time a teenager, suddenly knew she was the Phoenix and how to control it. The Phoenix isn't controlled; it's released and should be a menace in its own right. If super powerful beings were to battle they should have told parallel stories of Apocalypse and the Phoenix and had them meet time lines. Also, as a side note, the fact the Quicksilver is Magneto's son was started but fizzled and never went anywhere. Could have been a great plot element there. Another opportunity missed.Cameos that fell flat: Wolverine with a different backstory (remember we are on an alternate time line). And, Psylocke, who is one of the great characters in the comics, at least looked the part this time, but ended up a shallow one-dimensional character. She was presented as a main character, but nothing at all was told about her and was more of a set piece.Probably more disappointing than the lack of story was the performance from the actors. X-Men typically has top rate actors that I like in other films, such as McAvoy, Fassbender, and Isaac. However, all of them just phoned it in this time. Jennifer Lawrence brought Katniss to the X-Men. Not sure if she phoned it in also, or if this is just her range.If you thought Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron were special effects cop outs you should skip this one. If you are fans of the X-Men comics there really isn't anything to see here either. I gave this one 2 stars simply because the Quicksilver slo-mo scene was cool, but that's about it. If we want better movies we need to stop supporting bad ones with our dollars. I'm sure Apocalypse will make gargantuan sums, but I'm confident that it won't be analyzed in college literary classes. As the claimed last film of the X-Men series Apocalypse does not close on an epic finally, but more of a slow painful death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe from the ashes of this movie? they'll build a better one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Does it ever wake you in the middle of the night? The feeling that one day, they'll come for you? And your children?" Wise words from the always questionable Magneto (Michael Fassbender) as he reminds Charles Xavier, not for the first time, that his school for gifted children will never really be safe from the true enemy-- humans. This a theme that runs through the entire X-men series, the fear of being different and how we as humans don't like what we have no control or understanding over.Director Bryan Singer, the only man that seems capable of sending the X-men franchise in the right direction, takes the reigns for what might possibly be the last time. This time around the team of newbie recruits are pitted against the most powerful mutant of all time, Apocalypse. So why, then, is he so underwhelming? Opening all the way back in ancient Egyptian times, Apocalypse is in the middle of some kind of transformation ceremony with a willing follower (Oscar Isaac), before all goes wrong and he becomes trapped underground for thousands of years. Flash forward to 1983 and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is hiding out after becoming an icon for saving President Nixon some ten years ago at the end of the last movie. Charlies Xavier (James McAvoy) is continuing to run his flourishing school for mutants and Eric 'Magneto' (Michael Fassbender) is living a quiet factory life in Poland with his lovely new family. There's also a bunch of new, and old, fan favorite characters that appear back in the X-men fold. The roster is still nowhere near as impressive as Marvel's Avengers movies.The action, as promised, is on a huge scale. But the problem is the clunky first half of the film, with unimportant side plots like the reactivated love between Charles and Moira McTaggart (Rose Byrne) that take away from the overall story and make you wishing the ultimate showdown would just happen already. And then when it does finally happen, you feel like it came and went with absolutely no feelings to see it repeated, just a simple "MEH".Among the problems with such ensemble movies as this is that new characters get introduced, leaving other characters to get lost in the storm. It's unfortunate here, then, that one of the characters that gets lost is Apocalypse himself. Not that there's anything wrong with the new additions to the team, but introducing them one-by-one makes way for moments of the movie where Apocalypse is nowhere to be seen. And in the scenes where he does actually appear, he just doesn't seem to hit with the kind of punch you'd expect from the first ever mutant and the greatest X-men villain of all time.Apocalypse seems like most of the on-screen Marvel villains from the last ten years, with little or no defining characteristics other than he hates humans and wants to destroy the world. Most of what he even says throughout the film is just overly long speeches with little oomph about the new age of mutants to come. Other than trapping people in walls, he doesn't seem all that scary. Even Isaac, as amazing an actor as he is fast becoming in Hollywood at the moment, seems to struggle with bringing out Apocalypse's true nature and power. He looks the part, but there's still something else missing. There's a couple of standout scenes that save the movie, one involving Quicksilver (Evan Peters) that surely beats his scene from the last movie and another involving an old metal-clawed friend of the franchise. But overall, the action is over-the-top large-scale destruction, almost like the kind from Man Of Steel that makes you think how you can ever go back after it. It's also darkly violent and sometimes a little scary for younger viewers, not that that's always a bad thing.Let's not forget the new additions to the team too; Tye Sheridan as a cool but frightened Cyclops, Kodi Smit-McPhee as a humorous Nightcrawler and Game Of Thrones regular Sophie Turner as an adequate Gene Grey. Then we also have three of the four horsemen; Oliva Munn as Psylocke, Alexander Shipp as Storm and Ben Hardy as angel-- all of whom are completely underused and not given the proper time to explore. All the regulars, not forgetting Beast (Nicholas Hault), are on as good as form as their previous installments.The movie does very well to add into the story the mutant's life-long struggle to be accepted, as both normal and heroes. But they're not normal. They're different, which is something that makes them feared and hunted throughout their comic book lives. Most of their threats come from humans more than any other villains, which is what makes Bolivar Trask from the last movie such a great villain. They will never be accepted, no matter what they do, and they know it. That's a hard truth to swallow.In the end, what's left is a movie that could've been so much better, a wasted opportunity to take a villain with such rich and powerful history and make him memorable. But instead he's easily forgotten about by the end credits. Yes, it is the end to Bryan Singers trilogy, maybe. But fitting? Certainly not. He chose to go out with a bang instead of trying to repeat the success, both story wise and villain, of the last movie. It was slow in the middle and rushed in the end, which only made things worse. If you're a die-hard X-men fan you'll enjoy it, but if you're not you'll consider it an average super hero movie. However, and let's be honest here, nothing can really be worse than the never-forgotten X-men: The Last Stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh my En Sabah Nur!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my En Sabah Nur! I had little expectation for this final X-Men film, yet it still managed to unfortunately disappoint. Having so much to offer, the film appears to have lost it's way and results in an unbalanced mess of plot holes and poor character development. It's difficult to not compare this to the recent release of Civil War but even if Captain American and Co. didn't come about, this is still a stand alone shame and misuse of some of Marvel's greatest characters. Jean Grey pretty much sums up the entire movie whilst discussing Star Wars (what is it with Marvel referencing Star Wars films all of a sudden?) Return of The Jedi confirming "the third one is always the worse." (For the record, RTJ is my personal fave of those three) Is this a reference to the actual movie itself? It's lacked emotion and the action was a poor show. Even with major Hungover Jackman's Wolverine making an unsurprising cameo, the fighting is clumsy, lazy, unimaginative and actually quite boring, which doesn't make sense when trying to showcase and reintroduce some X-Men characters. The CGI is some of the worse I have recently seen and though it's apocalyptic, it's resembles a badly edited version of a Roland Emmerich disaster movie that loses gravity of the situation unfolding. I think the studio spent most of it's budget on Quicksilver's extended time lapse scene maybe trying to recapture the success from 'Days of Future Past' whilst sacrificing the rest of the film's effects. Even the makeup slipped, and though I can appreciate it must be a hard job with characters like Beast and Nightcrawler, I do believe they scripted Raven to always be in disguise so to spare the blue paint for the previously mentioned two. Oscar Isaacs does a superb super villain but I couldn't help but think he would make a better Sith Lord if he wasn't already Poe. He's an egotistical wannabe God who, after a long sleep wakes up in our modern world, checks all our facebook statuses and catches up on Jeremy Kyle via an old TV, who doesn't appear remotely angered or surprised about our fall from greatness, yet decides the world needs culling. I actually understand where he's coming from.Sophie Turner does a good Jean Grey but I found Tye Sheridan's Cyclops annoying. Josh Helman returns as promoted Col. Stryker who actually looks more like Seann Williams Scott and James Marsden love child and Nicholas Hoult as Hank the Beast, a casting I'm still not sure of. I'm also undecided about Kodi Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler and Rose Bryne's MacTaggert's weird return which felt unnecessary and was just another filler to flesh out the movie; you could do away with her whole part; in fact, I reckon you could cut a third of the movie out without it ruining the storyline. JLaw doesn't actually look like she's bothered in this movie and her character does very little compared to what the trailers suggests, plenty of talking and very little action. (I still love her though.) McAvoy is great as Charles X and Fassbender's Magneto shows some torment but again, he can't seem to make up his mind to who's side he's on. Regardless of his final choice, I don't think it can pardon the largest death toll in all of the Marvel movies. Which, didn't have any emotional impact. Being very mutant concentrated, us meek humans get very little screen time for a world wide genocide, apart from a couple of silly snippets from around the globe, NYC getting torn up and the US superpowers sitting in their swivel chairs looking clichéd and completely stupid. It just felt empty and non-threatening which is really a major fail for an apocalyptic film. The four horsemen get over shadowed by Magneto which isn't a surprise and it just shows how flawed the plot is, elaborating on Magneto's recruitment. They just turned Psylocke, Storm and Angel into wimpy sidekicks and what was the point of Caliban, Jubilee and the Blob making an appearance, apart from filling out an already long enough film.What I did like was the nods to the Marvel and not so Marvel universe like the band Rush and Nightcrawler donning MJ's Thriller jacket. John Ottman's score was good, however the use of Beethoven's symphony No. 7 felt like a cheap copy of it's use in the film 'Knowing' when the world finally comes to a destructive end. There was part of me that wanted Apocalypse to win and lay waste to everyone and get it over with, only to be defeated in an anti-climatic ending, however, Jean Grey's eventual exhibit as Phoenix is pretty epic if not over dramatic. This was definitely a step back for the X-Men franchise and have lost interest. I still think DC's Doomsday would kick everyone's arse.

		<shortDescription>Forget what the critics say, this is great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I would like to say that I do not understand where all the hate for this film is coming from on both metacritic and rotten tomatoes. X-Men: Apocalypse is an amazing addition to the X-Men franchise; granted it is no X2 or Days of Future Past but still a worthy competitor.My only disappointment was that neither McKellen nor Stewart made any sort of appearance in this film, however, I cannot work out where I would be able to place them in the film.The characters are great and may I say that Jean Grey was mighty fine!! Quicksilver once again stole the show and his scene along with Wolverine's was definitely the best film of the film and was both exciting and humorous. And speaking of Wolberine's scene OMFG!! Although very very brief, the scene in which Wolverine chopped up a bunch of Stryker's men with extremely bloody results was executed (no pun intended) with brutal excellence. But to be fair, I believe rating this film a 12 was a very big push of the boundaries with many bloody and brutal scenes with the killing of both enemies and civilians throughout - but it seems that the superhero genre seems to push the PG-13/12A boundary quite a bit but Marvel could pretty much get away with anything.Apocalypse was not an amazing villain but he more than serves his purpose and is both menacing and cool, well done to the brilliant Oscar Issac.One thing I was really worried about was how they would James McAvoy bald so that he would be like the Professor X that we know, however, they pulled it off in a way that worked very well and happens almost seamlessly and they don't focus on it happening which is a good thing. I really liked how they handled Cyclops becoming an X-Man and thought he was one of the best characters of the film, however, the death of his older brother, Alex, during Quicksilver's scene did not to very much at all for his character arc.In my opinion, any X-Men fan will love this film as I did and should go and see it. Full of cool scenes and brilliant character development for Magneto who once again spends another film constantly switching sides due to some tragedy that has happened to him, but it was awesome anyway so it doesn't matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review X-Men: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the Metascore and the Rotten Tomatoes score, I seriously disagree with them. X-Men: Apocalypse is now Bryan Singer's forth X-Men movie and he's giving the franchise a new direction. The story is that after many centuries the Mutant Apocalypse returns and is threatening to wipe out the existence of human kind. He's recruiting Mutants like Magneto, Storm, Psylocke and Angel to his Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Now the X-Men must recruit them self again to stop him. You may think now is the same think over and over again but it actually isn't. The movie talks about the consequences that happened in the last X-Men movies and meanwhile introducing new and familiar characters. I seriously love the new young cast. Sophie Turner, Ty Sheridan and Kodi Smit-Mcphee are great in the movie. There are some flat moments especially the first 20 minutes are very hard to get into, but after that the movie keeps the story interesting and even gets better. And not forget to talk about the Quicksilver Scene, which is even much better than in Days of Future Past. For X-Men fans there are many references to the comics or about the 80's. And that's maybe the problem for some people who don't know about them. Especially in the End Credits, no one knew what that should mean or about what they are building up to. But for many Fans of the franchise it is the X-Men movie everyone wanted to see. It has my recommendation and I would give it a 8.7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since 2011, I've been praising Matthew Vaughn's "X-Men: First Class" as one of my favorite movies of all time. Witnessing X-Men: Apocalypse has still left me in shock at how the 3rd installment to the prequel trilogy has now made my 'all-time' list too. No spoilers ahead, but I will say this: WHAT A FINALE!From hearing John Ottman's 'Suite from X2' in the introduction to the new and equally hilarious Quicksilver sequence, this film really does have it all. Given you've seen "First Class" and "Days of Future Past", I strongly urge all movie goers to see this conclusion. The audacity critics have to slay this film is beyond me, they really have lost their touch. Please don't be another sheep in the crowd and listen to those morons, believe me, buy yourself a ticket and see how this piece rounds the series off well. P.S. This is my first ever review. If a man has purposefully created an account just to review this film, then you know it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The short: Average. Lots of SFX, a dull villain, a convoluted story-line and none of it matches previous films.The long: The X Men franchise has been quite disappointing overall. X1 &amp; X2 were both good, and then a dramatic nose-dive with X3. First Class was pretty good, and Days of Future Past was as well.The film suffers from an uneven quality of writing. Magneto. He's clearly a sociopath, but is he good? Is he bad? Is he even the same character from the first films? The same could be said for a few of the characters. Mystique, for example. Good? Bad? The mutant with wings: the same guy from X3? Who knows? For all his twisted character contortions, Fassbender does a good job as Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence is okay, but not great. James McAvoy again does well as Xavier. Olivia Munn looks smoking hot as Psylocke, but doesn't get much screen time.The villain is bizarre, purple and dull. And he wants to destroy the world. I'm getting a bit sick of world-ending villains. What's the sun-powered technology? Why is he a 3000 year old techno-looking mutant? Who knows? Maybe that's what he looks like in the comics, but it doesn't translate well to screen.Unfortunately, the franchise has also decided to go down the modern path of casting kids in big roles. I don't mean that kids can't act, but that it's now all about children and teenagers saving the world. Hollywood has had a taste of YA market money, and it's addicted. Whilst films with kids who save the world aren't necessarily bad, they're very light and shallow.So yeah, it's okay, but it's a bit crap too. Whilst you have to hand it to the writers for swinging for the fences, it falls short. We've seen it all before. Mutants vs humans. It's getting a bit stale as a plot line. Some good SFX. The really big scenes are a bit overblown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least we can agree the third part is always the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell you upfront, I always loved the X-Men series (just the films, never read the comics). Was also a big fan of Days of Future Past who has the same writer and director. But Apocalypse, what a sad mess. Making all the mistakes I hate about many recent action adventure movies. Compare the scene of Eric Lensherr in Auschwitz (X-Men: First Class) with the scene of Eric in Auschwitz in this new entry of the X-Men saga, and you might understand what I mean. When you start destroying cities, or most of the earth, you are drained of any connection. Bad guy Apocalypse is so powerful, you wonder all the way why does he need Charles to succeed with his evil plan. Too many characters not interacting until the end of the movie, with odd pacing and scenes obviously not cut in the order of the screenplay even the makers seem to have lost the overview of all the story lines. Also it gets harder and harder to connect the Prequels with the first Trilogy, even though Days of Future Past changed everything anyhow, especially The Last StandIn the end you must agree with Jean Grey (Sophie Turner is one of the few discoveries for me, since I have never seen Game of Thrones) who claims "At least we can agree the third part is always the worst" leaving a screening of Return of the Jedi. This pun directed at the The Last Stand (and one of the very few gags working, in the first X-Men entry drained of all humor) unfortunately also holds true for X-Men: Apocalypse, the third entry of the First Class trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'Batman V Superman' of X-Men movies. (Yeah, it sucks that bad)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just so you know where I'm coming from. I liked X-Men First Class and thought Days of Future Past was just okay. But this stinker is just bad. After 30 minutes I started looking at my watch and about an hour into the movie I wanted to walk out. Like Batman V Superman, this movie has just so much going on; it feels bloated. And did anyone else notice how bored Michael Fassbender looked in the movie? Michael Fassbender is the guy who plays Magneto and is usually an outstanding actor but he looked like he just didn't want to be there. Even during some of his emotional scenes he looks like he is just phoning it in. I'm guessing he is sick of playing the role. Anyway, the movie feels longer than it is and it isn't even watching it in theaters just for the action. And what is up with reminding us about Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique every five minutes? Even when she isn't on screen they literally show a picture or video of her. It isn't as stupid as watching Wonder Woman check her email but sh!t, the director should know better. Maybe the producers are to blame, I don't know. I just know that watching this stupid movie shouldn't feel like doing homework. This movie is a rental at best. Don't be fooled by the fanboys trying to act like the critics are wrong about this movie. I watched all of the X-Men movies and both of the spin off Wolverine movies and I'm going to straight up tell you, this movie is the worse of the lot. Does Quicksilver have a cool scene in the movie? Yes he does, but is it really worth watching a bad movie just to watch one scene? No, it isn't. Be smart and wait to watch it on a smaller screen. The only thing I liked about it was the last 2 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This... This movie is an insult. It is not even bad, it's more than that. I have seen bad movies, and maybe due to the insane amount of brainless superhero / comic book films recently, but this is more than simply bad. More than 2 hours of downright mind numbing, meaningless, cliché filled bull***. How the hell did this movie got more than 5 start is beyond me. After a few hours i seriously tried to find some good parts in this film, and don't get me wrong, there are good scenes in the movie, but the whole experience is just shocking. In the wrong way.You may be wondering if you should see this movie despite the awful critics, ignoring the signs you have been given. Don't. Or do, but at the end, you will most likely be just like me right now, wondering what the hell did you just see, why, and who the hell let this come out under the x-men franchise....I can't, and i won't... No... I have to take a shower...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overstuffed with So Many Things, Tolerable At Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a searing sense of humanity in X-MEN: APOCALYPSE's effort to thrust Magneto (Michael Fassbender), one of its key characters, into its emotional core. This allows a brief, but commanding moment establish a formidable ground to a film that aspires for enormous accomplishments. Yet these very same ambitions also seem to serve as malignant flaws that inevitably drags this Bryan Singer's desirous experiment into its very own apocalypse. While it stands with its impressive visual execution and incredible size? boasting one of the biggest character ensembles in superhero cinema?'Apocalypse' can only carry out ephemeral glories that can never compensate for the film's utter lack of structure. Ambition turns out to be this film's biggest threat.As compelling as descriptions might have made him appear, titular 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), doesn't seem capable to inspire the terror he seems to claim. For a villainous figure whose omnipotent power is meant to decimate civilizations, his efforts are mostly spent for futile chases that mostly involve expanding his network of mutants. At some point, the film shifts entirely on laying grounds for an apocalyptic battle that the narrative doesn't seem bothered to get to at a tolerable pace. Along the way, it constructs further story lines which it willingly abandons before any palpable resolution arrives. The film struggles to hold all its weight and extensions together, and yet it keeps introducing elements for which it has no evident plans to efficiently utilize. Much of this film turns out only trying to expand size, but at the expense of having a decent structure. Interesting characters get left underdeveloped, their backstories often written without congruence to the central storyline. And as it may insist, Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Professor X (James McAvoy)'s struggle runs on an emotional spine that mainly involves a campaign to retrieve Fassbender's Magneto from Apocalypse's hold. All these actors come out more powerful than their roles dictate them to be, defying the limits of their extremely poorly-written characters with strong performances that are enough to cover up for their characters' lack of development. A short but incredibly singular performance by Fassbender during the film's early minutes may be the spot where the film's sense of humanity is at its peak. Unfortunately, this distinction is relegated below technical pursuits. The ones with smaller roles are seemingly just too small to be served with affecting storyline, an apparent flaw in which Sophie Turner's Jean Grey fell.For all its narrative faults, a hope for some compensations may not at all strike as a bad idea. Singer, here, tries to build an immersive world where action sequences are filled with whizzing lethal beams and energy collisions. The one he creates inspire awe and paves way for breathtaking moments, but this is already as far it can get. 'Apocalypse', in spite of its elaborate designs, doesn't quite get past its mammoth aspirations. It has a lot of stuff going on but the film itself deprives them with space to breathe, and eventually seamlessly integrate with each other in the cosmic expanse that Singer ambitiously tries to construct. So, technical splendor and terrific action setpieces, aside, the only thing that actually makes this film commendable, is the sizable amount of reverence it has paid to the canon, making this Bryan Singer's biggest fan service to date. This movie is tolerable at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had the same problems as Superman vs Batman: -Casting - Story -Execution -CGIApocalypse cant turn things to dust or teleport and that annoyed me. As did the fact that he was tiny (as tall as prepubescent teens), not to mention the god awful makeup / voice. His voice SHOULD have been deep and angry with the metallic echo at all times, his costume SHOULD have been either: metallic exoskeleton OR Pharaoh attire, not Pharaoh attire with random tubes going into his head. His powers are that of total control of his body on a molecular level i.e. turning his hands into lazors &amp; feet into jump jets.Storm: Worshipped as goddess in sub Saharan Africa, not a punk teen with a Mohawk, they took her look from age of apocalypse timeline.Cyclops: Why in the hell is he a moody little sod? Not his character at all and the choice of actor was wrong IMO.Jean: Personally don't like that actress so meh. I don't like it how they made her all powerful.... she doesn't access that power till MUCH MUCH later in life.Angel: Heir to an American billion dollar company, not a German punk cage fighter.Magneto: sigh, character all over the place: let me kill everyone in the world! oh noes i was wrong sowi, let me help you and you will forget i tried to end the world.Quicksilver: No idea why he had such a big part, he's a minor character and where's his sister the scarlet witch?In essence this film feels like a step backwards. They did such a good job with first class I just felt rather disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is an enjoyable cinematic film and as with other X Men movies the special effects are so well done. The actors save this film from being a flop because the story line is not that great. It kind of plods along there are one or two great surprising moments but it just never really goes that deep but the acting and special effects and if you love the X Men story like I do make this fun summer movie fare. I grade it enjoyable but needs some plot reworking to be great. I love Jennifer Lawrence in this movie wow is she great. I see a lot of potential with the younger actors and their story lines as well and I can't wait until the next X Men comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, I'm not an X- Men Fan. And never watched any of the movies in full except for X Men First Class which I loved. However, have watched both the Wolverine movies and I liked both of them.So when my GF who is a big X Men fan took me for this, I had very low expectations and I'm happy to say I kept my expectations low.The movie from start to end is one bore. The concept of a super mutant from the Egyptian era is just too much to digest. And its sad to see a handsome actor Oscar Issac covered with layers of blue make up.Also, when story is going nowhere, Wolverine makes a cameo. Thanks for the cameo, half of the audience including me wake up and cheer.Brian Singer and his writers miss the bus when it comes to writing. The X-Men First Class had a fabulous climax of the X Men vs the US &amp; Soviet Navy with the Cuban Missile crisis in the background. Here, the climax is long and the picture shows a half destructed world of the 80s.On positives, there is a funny Quicksilver cameo which you have to watch. The performances are excellent because there is a talented bunch of actors such as McAvoy, Fassbender, Issac, Hoult and Lawrence at work. Its the writing that fails them.Strictly for X-Men fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3 first movies were great. So was the first Wolverine movie, Origins. Then began the downslide. First class was okay, the second Wolverine movie was a bit disappointing and "Days of future past" a letdown.So I didn't expect much when I started watching this. I was greeted by an awesome opening with great music, playing in ancient Egyptian. Majestic statues of old Egyptian gods, a huge pyramid, a ritual to turn their mutant god into an even stronger god. Wow. And that were only the first minutes.Then some of the Egyptians plot against their godlike leader and his mutant followers to make the pyramid collapse and bury them alive. Their plan works. Except for the part where the followers sacrifice themselves to save their king. He is held is some kind of stasis for a few thousand years, waiting for time to rise again.Once he walks the earth again, the villain soon gathers some strong mutants as new followers around him. The X-Men desperately try to fight him, but they are fighting on two fronts. Stryker and his mad scientists are also after them.Times never have been so hard before for the X-Men. Or everyone else, for that matter. The amount of destruction is even bigger than the one time Jean Grey turned into the "phoenix" and went on a rampage. But that doesn't mean that she can't save the day.Which is one of my few points of criticism. Her powers couldn't destroy Logan, but she could take down an ancient, almost almighty mutant who had lived a thousand lives and consumed countless mutants and their abilities (one of them being a significant healing ability).Second point of criticism: The Egyptian villain wants to destroy the world to build a new one. At one stage he gains control over all the nuclear missiles in the world. Now I know what you think: Game over, mankind. But no, that would be too easy. Instead of making them fire the nuclear missiles on each other he just fires every single one of them into space. Because! (Enter reason here, if you find one) Anyway, despite very few flaws this was an epic movie. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review ever, I am writing it to warn you that there are no redeeming qualities of any sort in this film. I'm pretty sure those who have reviewed it positively either work for the production company, are of an age included between 6 and 14, or consider cinema an entertainment park rather than a form of art.I'll start off by saying that I don't particularly like super-hero movies, but as an avid reader of the comics in the 80s and 90s, I feel a strange compulsion to keep watching them. Out of the whole bunch, I honestly felt that the X-Men franchise was one of those going through a period of reasonable health: after leaving the awful X-Men 3 behind, the last two films (first class and days of future past) were far from being masterpieces, but actually rather enjoyable when you felt like mindless American industry entertainment.This is Brian Singer's fourth x-men film, and by far what stands out the most is his contempt for the source material. It's as if he just wants to get things done as quickly as possible, cash his fat Hollywood check and go back to whatever he was doing before (which, judging by the fact that he was actually accused of sexual harassment by some of the male teenage actors of the first two X-Men films, may well be on the dodgy side). Some of the scenes are directed and edited so hastily you barely even register they have occurred, in a flurry of CGI effects that rather than "visualize the unthinkable" (which should be the purpose of special effects in general), make it absolutely impossible to determine what is going on.The actors (some cast only to please and attract the general public) stand around with serious or tragic faces in front of a green screen, occasionally exchange dire and banal dialogue of no importance whatsoever, and generally look as lost as the viewer to the sense of the existence of this horror.The villains (who of course want to destroy the world, what else?) first group up in a series of atrocious and hasty introduction scenes (the creation of Archangel, an epic comic moment if I remember correctly, is dealt with particularly badly. Metallica's Four Horsemen plays in the background, and the result is something that looks like it came from A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 - hair metal horror from the 80s), then proceed to stand around on hillsides in ridiculous suits that recall the super-aliens of Superman 2. Wasn't this the franchise that refused to dress Wolverine in yellow spandex?A five year-old playing on the floor with his action figures probably would come up with this entire plot within 5 minutes, so the fact that someone actually made money to write the script is shocking. The whole thing is beyond puberty, it's actually infantile. And ultimately, it's a film with many lessons about our times: 1. If you are Magneto, part of the hero elite, you can flip sides however many times you want, slaughter whole groups of people, threaten the planet, help the big bad foreign (voluntarily Arab-like?) villain, but equally get away with a hand-shake at the end, and a feel-good final laugh scene worthy of a Happy Days end-of-episode-let's make a joke and all laugh-scene. 2. If you have migraine-inducing effects, you don't need a director, a script, a decent cast or, finally, even an idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a lot of praise for the last X-Men film, which restored my hopes for the franchise. But this is a huge letdown in pretty much every way. This one takes place in the 1980s, following Days of Future Past (1970s) and First Class (1960s). Unfortunately no effort is made to show any aging for the characters who should be in their 40s or 50s at this point. They all look the same. Mystique we can overlook because of her power to change appearance but Professor X, Magneto, Beast, Moira MacTaggert, and (worst of all) Havok all look the same as they did in the film that took place in the '60s. To some viewers (and undoubtedly Singer and company) this might seem like no big deal, but to me it's annoying and points to a general lack of concern about the continuity of the films. Whenever I feel like filmmakers can't be bothered to care, I lose interest in the product.The continuity issues don't end there but they are just one of the many problems with this. You have an ill-defined and goofy-looking villain in Apocalypse, a towering and imposing figure in the comics that is played here by wimpy 5'9" Oscar Isaac in a poorly realized getup. He looks silly, to be honest. Far too silly to be taken seriously as a villain. The script does little to explain who he is and what motivates him. It's yet another example of an increasingly irritating trend in comic book movies these days, where the filmmakers act like every person watching is an avid fanboy/girl that has read every comic, seen every interview, and keeps up with all the news surrounding the production of a movie. It's lazy and I'm pretty sick of it.Most of the cast is fine but there are no standouts. Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, and Nicholas Hoult seem bored by it all. James McAvoy at least appears to be trying but even he is going through the motions at this point. Evan Peters repeats his performance as Quicksilver from the last film but the new has worn off some and it's less fun than it was the first go-round. Of the newbies, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nighcrawler probably fares best. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan, as Jean Grey and Cyclops, are inoffensive but dull. Ben Hardy is a forgettable Angel. Olivia Munn is wooden as Psylocke and dressed like some cosplayer. Alexandra Shipp shows potential as Storm but she's ultimately wasted in this.It's not a good movie but it's not something unwatchable, either. Bryan Singer's first misstep in the series. It's just frustrating to someone who enjoys the X-Men movies overall and wants the best for the franchise. The continuity errors, weak script, unimpressive new cast members, and pedestrian direction all do this one in. The climax is the movie's only action scene worth mentioning and even it's pretty blah. The sad thing is the highlight of this is Hugh Jackman's cameo, which is just a few minutes out of a two and a half hour movie. I don't know where the series will go from here with all the talk about most of the big names in the cast not returning in the future. The newbies introduced in this do little to instill confidence. Hopefully they take some time and get a great script next time. If not, this series is in a lot of trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst of the xmen series yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I learn about film the harder it has been to actually sit down and watch bad movies. There is an exercise called scene analysis. You break down everything that happens in a scene, and it allows you to see why a scene failed and why a scene succeeds. Once you get into the habit of looking at movies this way it become painfully hard to see why movies don't work. This movie starts out fairly well. You are immediately set into the plot. There is no waiting around on the movie. However the movie falls apart from there. The screen is big, it's big for a reason. We go to SEE something. In film it's called exposition. Where you see things or hear things to move a story forward. I read an example of this years ago. That makes total sense and shows why movies fail. When you see a good movie, it never entails two characters talking about the movie or the plot of the movie. That's what the big screen is for, to show us. The constant use of character dialog exposition in this movie is simply painful. No one wants to hear a character say "we have to get the bomb in the bank or it will blow up the whole orphanage next door and none of those kids will ever get to be adopted to a loving home" Instead, we want to see the the bomb in the bank, with the bank next to the orphanage, with some sort of character tie in or an orphan kid with a chance of being adopted. Show us, don't tell us! We came to SEE a moving picture. This kind of poor script writing is all over this xmen movie. It's painful to watch it once someone points it out to you. I must also comment on why they are always kidding bopping these superhero movies. Their audience is greater than 14 year old kids. It's like Hollywood misses that. It reminds me of spiderman constantly being some highschool kid, He was a full grown man and scientist in the comic books!! This in xmen is no difference. The how they aged and history setting part just falls flat as they come in as it reduces the movie to a teeny bopper movie. Lastly the acting in this movie. This might have been the worst one yet. Please for the love of god someone teach sanza stark how to act. She is horrible in this. Is she simply type cast into the same, scared naive role in everything she does? She simply stands out in this movie like a crap stain on a beautiful white rug. She was by far the worst possible person to put in this movie. Not only for the movie, but frankly her career. As the script was never going to sell her as a more dynamic actress. And why is wolverine in this movie. There is no continuation or story line of him that makes any sense. He was already in the other 2 movies that were "retro" but yet he's here again trapped in this thing. Just no concept of continuation in the series or the story lines. The script on this movie is about a 2/10, the acting about a 4/10, the special effects were OK but nothing mind blowing. Some of them actually looked pretty hokey like the brooklyn bridge in New York. 4/10. I feel bad for the x-men series. It has such great potential and possible story lines. But it has been destroyed by Hollywood drivel poor acting, and awful script writing. It needs a real remake. You can't look at movies that got it right like deadpool and then come back to this one and say they are even close to the same level. Save your money, this is a flop.</fullReview>

There's plenty of action and excitement. However the plot is vague and more than a little convoluted and slow-moving at times. Also some of the heroes (notably Storm and Angel) get very little screen time. Also Cyclops comes across as a bit of a jerk. Worst of all in Nicholas Hoult who is just terrible as Beast...and yes I'm aware he's played him before. Way too thin for the role. However the rest of the actors are all good in their roles. Also Wolverine pops up briefly. His sequence is VERY bloody and violent--way too much for a PG-13 film. By the way it adds nothing to the plot. I'm guessing he was put in just to satisfy the fans. All in all a good film but "Days of Future Past" was better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'X-MEN: APOCALYPSE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 9th film in the 'X-MEN' movie franchise; including two 'WOLVERINE' films, and a blockbuster 'DEADPOOL' flick. This chapter finds the outcast Marvel superheroes taking on an ancient mutant, named Apocalypse, and his team of four 'Horsemen'. Apocalypse was just awoken from a very long sleep, and he now wants to take over the world; by destroying all the humans. It's up to the 'X-Men to stop him. The movie was directed by Bryan Singer (who also helmed 'X-MEN', 'X2' and 'X- MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST') and it was written by Singer, Simon Kinberg, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne and Evan Peters all reprise their roles (from earlier films); while Oscar Isaac, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn, Alexandra Shipp and Kodi Smit-McPhee all join the cast. It's received less than stellar reviews from critics, but it has performed well at the Box Office (thus far). I enjoyed it, but I also found it to be kind of disappointing.En Sabah Nur (Isaac), also known as Apocalypse, was a powerful mutant in Ancient Egypt; who was betrayed by his people, and entombed alive. He awakens in 1983, and decides the world must be destroyed and rebuilt. The ancient mutant then recruits four new lieutenants, to help him; including Erik Lehnsherr, also known as Magneto (Fassbender). Erik recently lost his family in a tragic accident, so he's easily manipulated by Apocalypse. Mystique (Lawrence) discovers what happened to her old friend, Erik, and enlists the rest of the X-Men, to help her save him (and the world).I'm a big X-Men fan; I grew up reading the comic books, and I absolutely love the other Bryan Singer helmed films. Sadly, he kind of missed the mark here. It's still a good movie, but there's just way too much going on. There are so many characters, and the movie would honestly be pretty hard to follow; if you're not previously familiar with the material at all. I still enjoyed it, but it is way too ambitious. Hopefully the filmmakers can learn to minimalize what's going on, in future installments.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7RzcKeZWWA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Class is still the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had moderate expectations for Apocalypse. I'm not a big fan of the first X-Men Trilogy but since First Class, in 2011, I've grown to like this franchise very much. First Class was and still is the best of the bunch for me. My moderate expectations came from the fact that I believe Days of a Future Past fell a bit short in comparison with FC, but I still enjoyed it a whole lot. Bryan Singer is not one of my favourite directors and since he established this franchise, I guess his films lack the boldness and freshness that Matthew Vaughn brought to the series. Now it's time to review Apocalypse. The first sequences of it were mind-blowing. Egypt, an old Apocalypse putting his consciousness on a newer body, the False God fighters and the colapse of the pyramids were just amazing to watch. Then it settles a bit and starts building-up to the final clash between Apocalypse and the X-Men.Despite roughly being 2 and an half hours long, I never felt it was dragging or boring. The action scenes were great and the more character development bit were fine. A big shout-out to the casting team : both Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner were impeccable as the new Cyclops and Jean Grey. Oscar Isaac as I feared was only average as Apocalypse and the new actors didn't bring much to the table - Olivia Munn is sexy, yes, but not much more than that. Magneto, Prof. Xavier and Raven are the standouts once more. After three entries I feel connected to their characters in way I'm not with the others. Charle's and Erik's ideological fight drives the plot as it did on the previous films and Apocalypse gives more attention to Michael Fassbender's character pain and grief. Fassbender is really the best of the film. He acts so perfectly. He truly is Magneto. Above else, he is Erik Lensherr. Evan Peter's Quicksilver continues to steal every scene he's in and the slow-motion sequences are one of the best bits of the film.Plotwise, its what you'd expect from a big super-hero blockbuster. Simple and clichied, but it still works for the fun factor. We're gonna see this film to be entertained for 2:30 hours and nothing more. Its a popcorn flick and its what you think it is. Oh, and there's a very very sweet cameo in the middle which blew my mind. I just don't know if it deserves the RT rating. Its certainly better than 49%. But will it be alongside Wolverine 3, the last we see of X-Men in the future? I hope not. Specially, if another director with fresh ideas is on board.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bryan Singer wasn't able to follow in his own footsteps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the end, director Bryan Singer wasn't able to follow in his own footsteps after the formidable Days of Future Past. He delivers an overstuffed movie with poorly developed characters. And obviously my intro was a hoax because superhero fatigue looms heavily over this movie. Though it's not all bad; X-Men: Apocalypse is colorful, funny at times and ballsy. It's a spectacular film that's more appetizing to comic book fans than movie fans, but will still get the general audience excited for sequels.X-Men: Apocalypse is the movie equivalent of a: "Study" buddy Pretty to look at, casual fun, proper entertainment. You'll probably see it again at some point. You know?If you're in the mood.Suitable for: Anyone who needs to know how Charles Xavier turns bald. Not suitable for: movie critics</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse makes up for a dull villain by providing a new batch of mutants and some fun action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's fascinating about history is that even though the Ancient World had claimed large empires from Rome to the Greeks to the Egyptians, we still know very little about it as much of the evidence is either lost, destroyed by time, or is still under the sand waiting to be rediscovered. I took a trip to Scandinavia a while back and learned about the Norse gods that the people worshiped and said to have built the lands. While it's easy to dismiss the images and ideas of these "gods" as morality created for Scandinavian society, part of me does believe that the ancient world may have worked differently then the modern world does. Perhaps there was some magic centuries ago.The X-Men are a series of characters that you could argue are like modern day "gods" with their mutant powers. Like the gods of the old world, they could take either side of good or bad, and were controversial with the government. Their movies have done well (especially First Class and Days of Future Past) to reflect this while making it a fun blockbuster for everyone. The young mutants face their biggest challenge yet when the first mutant returns in X-Men: Apocalypse.We begin in Ancient Egypt where the world's first mutant En Sabah Nur, or better known as Apocalypse (played by Oscar Isaac) rules as pharaoh, along with four other mutants as his "four horsemen" until he's betrayed by fellow worshippers. He's trapped in a tomb for centuries, until he's accidentally woken and uncovered in 1983 where he decides that the human race has no place in this world. He recruits a young Cairo pickpocket, a then unknown Storm (played by Alexandria Shipp), along with a man with bird-like wings Angel (played by Ben Hardy), and telepathic energy manipulator Psylocke (played by Olivia Munn), and eventually, a heartbroken and cold Magneto (played by Michael Fassbender) to become the new Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.Meanwhile, Charles Xavier (played by James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy/Beast (played by Nicholas Hoult) has been successfully running his school for mutants, but is reluctant to call them into action. He's put his focus on students like Scott Summers/Cyclops (played by Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner) and Jubilee. So it comes as a surprise when Raven/Mystique (played by Jennifer Lawrence) comes to the school along with a teleporter Nightcrawler (played by Kodi Smit-McPhee). They see how much of a threat Apocalypse is and join together to stop this guy from destroying everything.This movie had A LOT to follow up with, considering that Days of Future Past is one of the best super hero movies around. X-Men: Apocalypse does provide a bigger world that's taken advantage of. The introduction of Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Jubilee, and Storm are welcome to this younger franchise, as they bring some new insights on what it is to be a mutant from different perspectives. I even liked the newer villains that were used?except for Apocalypse. They try to give him these big powers and a cool make up design, but he is a dull and boring to hear from. You'd think that a centuries old pharaoh would have more to him then evil.The best performances are still the original four (James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jenifer Lawrence, and Nicolas Hoult) who continue to evolve their characters.The action scenes do provide a lot for the X-Men to play around with. The final battle itself goes on a little long, but it did give us plenty of different mutant powers at use. Much of the story does rely on knowing what happened on the last couple of movies, so I'd defiantly say to start with First Class before coming to this.I'll give this seven Julilees out of ten. While the scope and weight isn't as large as Captain America: Civil War, X-Men: Apocalypse was a fun addition to the growing franchise. I'd say give this a watch, but if your not familiar with the X-Men, then go back and watch the others first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bryan Singer should no longer be allowed to direct X-Men movies, if not all movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I loved about films like _X-Men_ (2000) and _X-Men: First Class_ (2011) was the way they lifted "comic book movies" out of the realm of the cartoonish. They were smart, complex, and cool, and made me even more proud, in a sense, to consider myself a comics person. _X-Men: Apocalypse_ is big step backwards, I'm sad and really annoyed to say. This movie is a big step backwards for Bryan Singer, too, I believe. His abilities as a director seem to be--seriously--diminishing, not growing.In theory, all the elements seem to be there for an awesome super-hero movie: a compelling tie to history, the complex interactions of a host of interesting characters, the giant budget. But what we end up with is tons of awkward pacing, who-cares attempts at drama, and dialogue that swings between melodramatic, shallow and flat. In the end, it just seems like a great waste of resources on everyone's part--from the actors to the audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What happened to the X-Men movies?!This is garbage, from the cheap 90's looking intro, through the poor POOR acting from the younger less experienced actors up to and including the more experienced... the magneto singing, to the jaded plot and re-used ending.The movie takes a dig at X Men - The Last Stand, stating that the "third movie is always the worst", but this is definitely the worst one yet. Even worse than the Wolverine movies and Days of Future Past... complete let-down.The young case in particular really annoyed me... special mention to Sophie Turner, who can't act in Game of Thrones, but yet, we're gonna see her in a lot of movies now because of it's popularity.Unlike many, I thought the trailer made it look terrible and waited for the torrent, I don't think it could have been better in a theater.Just silly... X Men, X2, First Class and Last Stand were my favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The whole movie is one long build up to a ho hum battle that brings nothing new. None of the new(old) characters are explored or flushed out, with possibly the exception of Cyclops. As far as the "first class" characters, their interactions from the first two movies are totally missing here, its like they didn't even know each other. The Wolverine scene is forced and really doesn't jive with the rest of the films if you think about it. All and all not what you had come to expect based on the first two films. I will give the new actors at least some kudos for trying, the older cast looks only half interested at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not An MCU Movie, Needs to be Negatively Reviewed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People mocked those who claimed there was a conspiracy to negatively lampoon any comic book movie that wasn't a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie after all of the negative reviews of Batman vs Superman (which I haven't seen anyone give me their own opinion they didn't just parrot from some big "professional" film critic and a movie that I only saw pacing problems with in the first hour).But this movie is the proof that there is some kind of attempt to crush anything that isn't the MCU.Civil War relied on a gaping plot hole at the beginning to make the plot work, and no one had any issue with it.I can't help but think that if The Dark Knight came out this year it would have insanely negative reviews and a low score on Rotten Tomatoes with negative reactions to Heath Ledger's Joker. You know, since it wasn't the MCU.X-men: Apocalypse was a great movie. I'd write a more in depth review, but I don't have a lot of time and I just got back from seeing the movie and have to leave for work soon. But I guess since it's "Not the MCU" you're considered "not a true fan of cinema" if you liked this movie. Considering how if you say anything negative about the MCU you have to watch all of your friends bring up Rotten Tomatoes or Meta Critic so they can read out loud what their favorite critic had to say to "disprove" what I said about those movies.I know someone will see this and get upset that I am implying there is an attempt to crush anything not part of the MCU, but you think it's impossible?Disney has the money to pay off critics. Especially since the figure that if they can crush the competition (DC) and crush the Fox X-men movies, they figure they can get the rights back to those movies.Because Marvel Studios NEEDS The X-men. Time is running out and while Marvel is going to be losing their big names, DC will be giving us classic characters on the big screen who have never gotten their own movie.So I say Disney has paid critics to crush anything Non-MCU. Non-MCU Marvel movies so they can get the rights back to them so their universe isn't carried solely by Spider-man and a bunch of D- listers. And crush DC to keep the competition at bay while they get their ducks in a row about how to keep their shared universe afloat after they lose all of the characters that built it.And let me address the "plot holes" I've seen mentioned in this movie. Most of the plot holes aren't plot holes. Because you have to remember, this movie takes place in a new timeline after Logan changed history in "Days of Future Past." So "Why is Nightcrawler an X-man at the end, they didn't meet him until X-2 in the 2000s." Well, this is a new timeline, so now they met him earlier."Why was Mystique an X-man at the end? She's always been their enemy, look at the first 3 movies!!" Well, new timeline, she never became the killer she was in the original trilogy, so this new Mystique is an X-man and is an Anti-Hero."Why did Angel have metal wings? He didn't have them in X-men: The Last Stand?" Because NEW TIME LINE."Why didn't we see Jean and Scott in X-men: Origins Wolverine if she was the one who freed him?" Did you not hear the NEW TIMELINE PART?Seriously, this movie has been picked apart and picked apart and all of the issues people have are only there because they ignore that the last movie altered the timeline so now the events of the first 3 movies and all of their spin-offs NEVER HAPPENED.Seriously, maybe people should show a little more scrutiny to the MCU. Because if you take the "Critics love it, I gotta love it too" goggles off and pay attention you'll see that every one of those movies is full of huge problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A jumble of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is very little cohesion between parts of this movie and that is its biggest problem. Parts are mostly OK, but, they just don't fit together.Mystique is not very, well, mystic and Jennifer Lawrence does give the impression "oh, just this one more and I'm out". OTOH, James McAvoy seems to be really getting into the Professor X thing, giving the impression "I wanna do this for a long time". In a movie that is rather dim (but not really dark), there is one fun and light sequence w/Quicksilver. I could go on, but you get the picture.There are other problems. The main villain, actually an interesting one, as we're rather tired of Magneto, is not explored at all. He's just this powerful ancient mutant with a God complex, who likes to give silly speeches. Why the hell does he take 4 horsemen? Why not, say, 6 or 28 (perfect numbers)? Why does he want to destroy the world, doesn't he get that he can read everybody's email now? Tap into every webcam and see what his subjects are doing? Isn't this his "dream time" to rule the whole planet?Speaking of (not) exploring, there's Psylocke. We've seen more of Olivia Munn's action in promotion videos than in the movie itself. The only thing she brings in is an interesting part of the fight w/Beast. Otherwise, she just crowds things up, and doesn't even look so good (again, she's much better in promotion videos).Sophie Turner's take on Jean Grey I actually like. But, she's so different from Famke Janssen, she should have gotten much more time to explore that difference.From the story POV, you really don't feel the threat of destroying the world. Never mind that it's not quite clear what does Apocalypse need of Magneto, as he seems perfectly capable of destroying the world on his own, but, you basically know well in advance that he will fail and that Magneto will have another identity crisis.Maybe it's time everybody stopped trying to make another "Avengers" movie. There's stuff that makes X-Men interesting and different than other comic book groups, so their movies should stick to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing from Script to Special Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse, the follow up to X-Men: Days of Future Past, is finally here, and frankly i'm disappointed. The film suffers from a plethora of problems, and struggles to limp through which is shocking considering how great Days of Future Past was. X-Men: Apocalypse is entertaining, but suffers from terrible special effects and post production, and a very weak villain. The most sad thing about this film is that it had so much potential to be great, and just took a long walk off a short pier.The biggest advantage this film has going for it is it's super talented cast, who show up and give it their all, despite a weak script. Lawrence, McAvoy, and Fassbender all make this film as entertaining as they can, and the action sequences are fun to watch. However, the script has serious problems, many of which are too hard to overcome. Put frankly the story isn't well crafted at all, it's choppily thrown together more resembling a set of disconnected scenes following each other not a story.The film's biggest crux is it's special effects and post production. This may sound odd, but they are, in some cases, so bad that they are distracting. The dialogue is one major problem, as clearly there was a lot of ADR (Automatic Dialogue Replacement) or dubbing, and it often doesn't match the lips or doesn't sound like the actor has the rest of the movie. Above that the special effects, whether practical or digital, looks bad. The CGI isn't very good, the sets are noticeable and flat, Apocalypse's makeup is obvious, not very good, and distracting.On that note Apocalypse, the titular character is one of the movie's biggest weaknesses. Noted as one of the comic's coolest villains with an unflinching belief in darwinism, the film's villain more represents a shell of that. Oscar Isaac isn't the problem, as he gives the performance his best effort, but the character has weak motivations at best, and isn't all that menacing or memorable. A product of a lazily crafted script where the character that binds it all together has no real dimensions and is essentially a flat shell of a cooler idea.It's ironic that Fox spent almost 200 million making Apocalypse, and spent just under 60 million on Deadpool, a far superior film. The best way to describe X-Men: Apocalypse is a mixed bag, because it's not a terrible movie, but it's not a very good movie either, it's just mediocre. The film is obviously the product of a poorly crafted script, which is a shame, because it could have, and thus should have, been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The good, the almost and the mutants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year superhero movies are something that is almost an obligation to talk about. Batman V Superman created almost a war between poles. And I 'm at the side that liked a lot the movie. It was the movie I was expecting but for many things when I watched I was sure that many were going to be against it. The movie is dark, intense and Batman focus (yes, the weakest part is the Superman character, I hope soon they can fix that) If we talk about Capitan America Civil War the thing is more in balance, a good dramatic curve in the first half, with all the elements that brings motivations for the conflict. And then a little relief, a good presentations for all the heroes in a battle made for all comic fans. Then the tension and action comes again and the result is a great movie made with a formula that is well received for a great amount of viewers. Batman V Superman was bitter, Captain Civil War was more friendly. But let's go with the X-Men. I was expecting a lot, Synger's X movies are great and this was supposed to be another star. But for my point of view something happened. A lot of low interpreted characters, an art direction, costumes, special effects and other elements that for moments made me thought I was watching a TV pilot. Yes, costumes that made thought that I've seen better cosplay in comic events. Psyloche, Nightcrawler, and The Beast for example, it seems that they were taken out of a Halloween party. The CGI effects are low for a movie like this. Lack of render hours or talent?. The plot is simple, buy Singer works for made it boring and "complicated" with too much characters and information, and sub plots not so interesting or well closed. I think almost every director has a lower point in his career and in my opinion this is Synger one. But for all the people out there, the formula has many of the components that the mass is going to like, so don't worry I'm sure millions are going to love it. Aren't Hollywood movie formulas made for that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X Men: Apocalypse Movie- 4.1/5 Ost- 4.4/5 ******************************************************************** ******************************************************************** ****************************** The movie revolves around the revival of the Ancient Egyptian 'God' named 'En Sabah Nur' who claimed to have manifested on numerous gods like Lord Rama, Krishna etc. James McAvoy reprises the role of Charles Xavier , Michael Fassbender as Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Raven , Nicholas Hoult as Beast, Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert , Lucas Till as Havoc and Evan Peters as Quicksilver. En Sabah Nur (AKA Apocalypse) gets resurrected from underneath the ruins and gathered his four companions according to the New Testament. After the consequences of X:Men: Days of the Future Past, there had been an alternative time line where new mutant origins such as Cyclopes, Nightcrawler and Jean Grey are shown. The cameo appearance of Wolverine ( Hugh Jackman) makes the movie 'complete' because without him, an 'X:MEN movie is not possible'. As usual, there is also a special appearance of Stan Lee. The movie is filled with mixed emotions, shifting sides from good to bad, comic elements and obviously action. The CGI effects used in the movie is just mind blowing. After the success of Deadpool, Captain America: Civil War, Marvel is giving a tough competition to DC Comics(as of 2016). Being a COMIC ENTHUSIAST, I would like to recommend every movie lovers to go and watch the film as it is SUPER ENTERTAINING. It's a 'must watch'!Subhayan Bakshi Narula Institute of Technology</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-X-Men: Apocalypse is a 2016 American superhero film based on the X-Men characters that appear in Marvel Comics. It is the ninth installment in the X-Men film series. Directed by Bryan Singer, with a screenplay by Simon Kinberg from a story conceived by Singer, Kinberg, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, the film features an ensemble cast starring James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, ancient mutant Apocalypse awakens and plans to take over the world, so the X-Men need to stop him and defeat his team, the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse.--Critical response: -On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 59%, based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 5.8/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".-Mike LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review, calling it "a thinking person's action movie" and complimenting the movie for its high stakes. Bruce Kirkland from the Toronto Sun gave the film a positive review, acknowledging "Piece by piece, Singer fits this ninth film in the franchise (which includes Deadpool) into the X-Men universe like a master puzzle maker. He does it so well, at least in terms of storytelling, that the X-Men franchise still has a vigorous future." -Mike Ryan of Uproxx gave the film a negative review, noting it felt redundant and stale, writing, "I get it: Life is hard for mutants. We all get it. It's literally the only thing mutants ever seem to talk about. It is odd that other superheroes seem to get to have some fun, but never the X-Men. Here we are, 16 years later, and everyone involved is still sad. It feels repetitive." Scott Mendelson of Forbes noted the series felt repetitive, writing, "X-Men: Apocalypse is the kind of weightless, soulless trifle of a bore that makes comic book superhero movies look bad and makes me not look forward to the next installment." --Sequel: -In May 2016, Kinberg stated that the next X-Men film will be set in the 1990s. Kinberg has talk about redoing The Dark Phoenix Saga and Singer did want to do an X-Men movie in space.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>S-P-O-I-L-E-R-S Ahead !!!I don't know why people hated this movie so much. In opinion it was really a great movie. But not up-to the level of X-Men Days of Future Past. First 15-20 min of the movie was about Apocalypse. It was kinda disappointing because I want to know why Apocalypse want to destroy human kind what instead it just show me humans hated him and betrayed him. But after that movie started catch its speed. For me the show steeling moment was Eric's loss. That moment was so powerful and emotional that it could even make a cold hearted person cry. Michale Fassbender acting was just awesome. Action sequences were pretty damn awesome. Like the Days of future past again Peter steel the show. But my fav was the Wolverine berserk mode action scene. Awesomeness of that scene was unspeakable. In that 10-15 min scene Fox fixed all the wrong they did in the X-Men Origin Wolverine movie. What I didn't like in the movie were Apocalypse, his horsemen character motivation. Well Oscar Isaac did a great job as Apocalypse but what I didn't like was they didn't treat him like Apocalypse. As far I know Apocalypse is one of the most powerful super villain, he can shape shift he can project energy blast, telekinesis and many more powers that makes him a god like being. But Peter beat him like he is nothing. All other horsemen except Eric has no character motivation. I mean why would Psylocke(Body Guard), Angel(Fighter) and Storm(Thief) want to destroy the world. So basically this movie is not a bad movie which some people claim that it is worse than the Last Stand movie. Bryan Singer did a great job. Great casting of character.In my suggestion if you are a X-Men fan you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse review (spoiler free).Director: Bryan Singer Distributor: Fox Cast: James McAvoy, 2 time Oscar Nominee Michael Fassbender*, Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence**, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Sophie Turner with Ben Hardy and Evan Peters, Kodi Smit-Mcphee.Plot: With the emergence of the world's first mutant, Apocalypse, the X-Men must unite to defeat his extinction level plan.After X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) being probably the best in the X-Men series and still is it made all the other X-Men films look pointless. Director Bryan Singer who made three other X-Men films returns with the ninth in the series (including Deadpool) which started back in 2000, 16 years later he directs an entirely new cast.X-Men: Apocalypse may not be as good as Days of Future Past but it is still an enjoyable Marvel film, Charles Xavier (McAvoy), Eric Lensherr Magneto (Fassbender), and Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) all return for the third and last time and those characters leave the series with a bang. With the re-introduction of Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Smit-Mcphee), previously played by Alan Cumming and Jean Grey/Pheonix (Turner cast because of Game of Thrones), previously played by Famke Janssen the X-Men series seems to be continuing on a massive scale even there are seven previous films.This film has plenty of action and a sort of origin story with the new characters including the first ever appearance of En Sabah Nur a.k.a Apocalypse (Isaac), who is the first ever and most powerful mutant the X-Men have ever faced.Here are some points why I think this is one of the must see superhero films this year: New Characters: Although most of the characters have been seen before for example Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, Storm etc. the film also introduces new characters and they are (only two), Phsylocke played by Olivia Munn and Apocalypse played by Oscar Isaac previously know for Ex-Machina (2015) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). These two new characters make a big impact on the film and on the heroes themselves.CGI good and bad point: CGI is the main component of this film because you think superheroes it's going to be massive amounts of CGI. The CGI in this film literally makes buildings crumble and entire cities get destroyed by the shear might of Apocalypse. In some parts of the film the CGI looks a little incomplete there are few parts where it is unnecessary especially during the main battle where you can clearly tell it is a green-screen. Other than than the CGI is well used and well just a great component.One bad point: Apocalypse in the comics is an all powerful being that all of the X-Men fear even the more powerful ones, but in the film he is powerful but in my personal opinion I feel they picked the wrong actor, Oscar Isaac doesn't play evil well and that's a bad thing because I had really hopes for that character.Take the two good points into account and this is actually a pretty good superhero that does fall a little flat granted but that happens, if this was Singer's X-Men 3, if only he had made X-Men 3. Not nearly as good as Days of Future Past but still a decent addition to the X-Men franchise and hope that the X-Men series still lives on for years to come.Verdict: Enjoyable addition to the franchise with an immense ensemble of characters, but doesn't live up to the brilliance that is Days of Future Past and Apocalypse called have been played better. 8/10 Excellent.*Best performance by an Actor in a supporting role 12 Years a Slave (2013), Best performance by an Actor in a leading role Steve Jobs (2015). **Best performance by an Actress in a leading role Silver Linings Playbook (2012).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse does just about everything right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't get the harsh critic on this movie. Created an account here just to make my positive review about it. Some spoilers might occur.OK, here goes: I was a huge X-Men fan in the 90's. Collected just about every comic that came out in Finland from 84-96 (classic Claremont era). So X-Men have a place in my heart, even if in the last decades I have been occupied with other stuff. But when it comes to superhero stuff, I love the X-Men.The movie opens with a great scene, that introduces our cool antagonist. The music is epic. Title scene has also a classic X-men movie style, 3D works fine. Already hooked.Soon after we're introduced with a lot of old and new characters and the plot gets going. The two plus hours after that are a roller-coaster ride - not a dull moment. Editing this all to a coherent piece of entertainment is an achievement on itself. The story never loses its momentum while ascending to its literally groundbreaking finale.Big thumbs up to John Ottman, for both editing and great music score.Apocalypse is shown as a real, threatening bad ass - a worthy opponent to all of the most powerful mutants out there. Isaac does a great job under all that paint.One minor issue I had with the way Apocalypse was brought to life, but that just about it.Highlight scenes were aplenty, and just about every character gets a moment to remember: Eric, Angel, Jean and Scott and of course the mind bogglingly great action scene with Quicksilver - an instant classic.The casting is overall perfect, special honorary mentions to Isaac, Peters, Sheridan and Turner, and of course the "older" stars. Singer really knows how to put characters first, but without sacrificing the story or action. There are subtle touches of humour and grief combined with poignant drama.Special mention for the special effects, and I liked how the early 80's were presented.I would put this up to as the second best in the whole X-Men movie universe, just behind X2. Of course, to fully enjoy the subtleties of this movie, one needs some extensive X-nerdiness. For some random movie goers this might appear as a noisy, messy special effects opera. Their loss.The third one isn't always the worst!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another mediocre X-MEN movie by Brian Singer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the X-MEN saga and acknowledge that Singer made a very good job with the first two movies (specially X2 ); but I still consider X-MEN UNITED (directed by Brett Ratner) one of the best of the whole series (the movie was more expensive but even under-performing; made more money than the first two; and is still the second best of the series. Singer left X-MEN to pursue Superman; but failed and his next two movies as well. He finally returned for Days of Future Past (a huge commercial success; but as a movie far less interesting the previous installments. However; smartly Singer joined past and actual main characters in one movie and that underused trick help the movie become the highest grossing of the series. In another smart move; he end Days of Future Past with a hint of Apocalypse; the most beloved of the X-MEN comics; grating a lot of attention and expectation on this one. Well sadly this time; Singer imagination run out and the movie become a very poor mess. A lot of characters with poor development. QuickSilver (Evan Peters) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are the only ones to give some humanity to their characters. McAvoy, Fassbender and Lawrence do what they can; but the script does not help. Byrne and Hoult (and the rest of the cast) has very little to do and look uncomfortable. Even Oscar Isaac fails to create a good baddie.In terms of special effects; things are not that better. Lack of imagination is everywhere. The final fight; seems copied of older movies and the FX and digital images look cheap.X-MEN interest on the saga is based on the characters. McKellen and Steward or Fassbender and McAvoy as Magneto and Xavier can carry a movie by themselves if they let them; but in this case their characters are secondary to a bunch of new mutants and a bad guy none of them interesting or close to charismatic.In brief; it could have been the best X-MEN but lack of imagination made it the worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Bryan Singer's Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While having enjoyed X-Men: First Class and Days of Future Past, I had mild expectations for this to be a good film. It seems Marvel has made it a point in creating 2 dimensional characters and knocking them down further and then some. Fassbender and McAvoy are great in their own regards. Erik's Polish story arch was a good emotional touch but It felt as there was nothing more to him after that part ended. Where do I begin with Apocalypse. He comes across as nothing but a weak parasite feeding on others, more like a wannabe teenager wanting to be in some cool kids's entourage. After thousands of years in hibernation (due to his own failure), he comes back only to repeat the same mistake in what seemed like a day. He posed no real threat to the X-Men as all Marvel stories have a tradition of doing. The visual effects were laughable in parts, especially when Apocalypse starts to tear the world apart (Cargo ship containers).Bryan Singer successfully abolished "Superman Returns" in 2006. He has tried to do the same to X-Men but has not succeeded entirely.This is a very forgettable movie along the likes of Age of Ultron, Green Lantern, Civil War and the Spider-Man movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- The good: Bryan Singer makes a fantastic superhero movie, the scenery and special effects is far above my expectations. After watching the two previous XMEN movies i had high hopes for this one and it certainly was not a let down.* minor spoiler:- The Bad: Bryan Singer leaves Psylocke (Olivia Munn) in the corner and i will never forgive him for that. How can such an important character within the XMEN be left out in the cold by such a degree. Im not saying it drags down the movie as a whole because its still a fantastic piece of entertainment. But im sure saying that Olivia deserved better, and i hope for the sake of being a true superhero fanatic that someone will give her justice in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>closes the second trilogy of X -Men with a golden key .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse is further proof that critics don't know anything, the film was very wronged by critics, all the X-Men movies, this is the most faithful in comics, both visually, and in battles, it seems that the Singer has learned, the cast is great, the performances of the young actors are very good, the boys very well their characters I vi speak in detail of each , the CGI in the film is good, the more you in some scenes several bug fixes, the beginning that tells a little about the origin of this Apocalypse, join the best movies based on comics, and the final battle is very good, the soundtrack is another strong point, now talk about each character. Professor X/Charles Xavier-as always James McAvoy in delivers a Professor X excellent, he is a key piece of the film, Apocalypse wants his body to take control of the minds of all people. Magneto/Erik-Magneto has the most dramatic arc of the film, he loses his wife and daughter, and the scene is very strong, the performance of Michael Fassbender in my view is the best in the film, the scene that Magneto uses his powers to remove all metal from the ground is excellent, this time shows what Magneto can do Mystique/Raven-the trailers gave us the impression that she would be the highlight of the movie, fortunately isn't, she's important role in the film, more has this entire featured. Jean Grey/Cyclops/Nocturne-these three characters have a great chemistry, it's great to see the Cyclops be well represented, Tye Sheridan sent very well, Sophie Turner's beautiful and powerful as Jean, and Kodi is great as Nightcrawler, who along with mercury and the comic relief of the film, the three, especially Cyclops and Jean have key roles in the final battle they sent the actors. Angel and Alex Summers-the two mutants who were killed, Alex has a very important role in the destruction of the mansion, Angel had great prominence, more. Storm and Psylocke-unfortunately did not have the prominence it deserved, especially the storm, more when they steal the show, beyond the visual to both be really faithful. Moira/Jubilee/Striker-both have small roles, mostly the Jubilee which has few lines, Striker and Moira's interesting roles in the narrative. Mercury-as well as in the previous film, steals the scene, the scene of the mansion with the song Sweet Dreams is memorable, Evan Peters is excellent. Hank Mcoy-has important role, helps many mutants, and have a good fight against Psylocke Apocalypse-the villain of the movie that was very challenged by its visual, is simply the best villain in heroes of 2016, he's imposing, powerful, has an excellent voice, Oscar Isaac makes a great acting, I really liked your motivation, surprised me this villain. X-Men Apocalypse is in my opinion the best movie based on Comics of the year thus far, powerful villain and intimidating, good performances and mutants with highlights well-earned (Cyclops finally is well represented).

Returning to the fold a return to form is director Bryan Singer who helmed the first two X-Men films and aforementioned Future Past and his collaboration with scribes Simon Kinberg, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris keep things lively and decidedly bent to a darker tone (not a complaint what-so-ever) with some true crowd-pleasing sequences including (Spoiler Alert) a save-the-day Wolverine (the always welcome Jackman) and an outstanding mix of humor and gob-smacking visual effects involving Peters' smart-aleck Quicksilver literally saving the day set to The Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams Are Made of These" ; indeed they are in the best of the series thus far!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't agree with the critics on this one, they're wrong. This movie has some issues, i know, but overall, this is very entertaining! The movie starts off on a high note, with a spectacular sequence set in Egypt that blew me away, and i mean BLEW me away! it felt like an adventure movie of some sort! After that action-packed opening we start to follow Xavier and Magneto and all those familiar faces that once again, shine. The stand out of this movie, on my opinion, is McAvoy. The guy is great! He creates such a reliable Charles, and he is just very likable! There are new faces, of course, and they all do a pretty good job with what they're given. Sophie Turner in particular, her Jean Grey is very, very good. There are these amazing set pieces throughout the movie and some really magnificent scenes. One in particular being the Quicksilver one, which is indeed the best i have ever seen from him. Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse is fine, although coming across as a bit cliché. Overall, this was a fun movie, and yes, it has a lot of structural problems and some pacing issues, but just don't dismiss this movie, while not great, it's pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie got a lot of negative reviews from critics, but when I saw it I thought it was fantastic.Now, like every film, this movie had some flaws, but to me there were few and far between. The first being the lack of Jubilee. They kind of hyped up that she was going to be in it, but if I remember correctly she only spoke once or twice. The other issue I had was the running time, which was pushing 3 hours. If you're looking for a quick 90 min. movie, you're out of luck. My last complaint was the death of Havok, who was by far my favorite X-Man in both the comics and the film. He's witty and funny and he's got a lot of charm, and I will admit I was sad to see him go.On to the good! The CGI in this movie was fantastic, and I honest felt like it was real. The acting was sincere, and the casting choices were phenomenal. I loved seeing Mystique on our side, and I loved seeing the school filled with students. In this film, Mystique really takes charge and helps when the Professor can't be there. I was impressed with the new actors and actresses playing Scott Summers, Jean Gray, and Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler was amazing in this movie, so if you're a fan of the character, definitely check this movie out.All in all, this movie was really good, despite the critic reviews. If you're looking for a great X-Men movie, then look no further. This is yet again another slam dunk in the X-Men franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a kick-ass edition to the X-Men series. The mutants in this were intense with their powers. Some more than what is seen in previous movies. The opening and end scenes were awesome. But everything in between was steady. There was not the usual climax in the middle of the movie that one would expect. It was enough to keep the build up for the end of the movie, and it gave it a stronger finish.Wolverine had a small role, but he was more fierce and vicious with his appearance than ever before.Apocalypse could have been a bit better though; he was not doing much when he was on screen. His powers were not exemplified to his full capabilities as he was in the cartoon series. Magneto was stronger than he ever was in his older age. Mystique and Beast were not anything special in this story. Cyclops is still a douche who needs to stop wining all the time. Storm... Why was she from Egypt? Quicksilver and Nightcrawler were hysterical! The world now knows how Professor X lost his hair, finally. Arcangel was better before he received his superior powers.It was cool to see Jean Grey use her power as the Dark Phoenix. It tied well to the story that happened in the future in "X-Men: The Last Stand".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this X-Men movie is really good. I don't see what the big deal was when Rotten Tomatoes gave this film 47% critics views cause 74% of the audience liked it. Of course one flaw in this film is that Quicksilver is played by a different actor other then the one who played him in Avengers Age of Ultron. That's got to make some people in the audience mad. Still Quicksilver is a really cool character. I also think the plot is good cause the X-Men weren't just dealing with an all powerful mutant who has lived for thousands of years. They were dealing with a mutant of a god who thinks that destruction and chaos are the best solution to solving all of the worlds problems. With the help of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto though they were able to destroy Apocalypse with a big blow. Another fact about Apocalypse is that after he dies is that he can regenerate in a new body and can live on again. I also see that some people expected a lot more in this. Still this movie is pretty good and isn't half bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid entertainment in a sea of other superhero films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1983, an ancient mutant awakes to reclaim the Earth. Only a handful of inexperienced mutants can stop him and his newest recruit - the powerful Magneto. Director Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse has the synonymous superhero city-level destruction with amazing effects, yes it feels a worn but the focus remains on the popular characters and their relationships. It magnifies all the best of the genre, serving up a solid story that remains pin sharp clear throughout. The Valley of the Nile opening is the most interesting of the film, Singer conjures up a Stargate, Gods of Egypt hybrid where we're introduced to the excellent Oscar Isaac in almost unrecognisable make up as the mutant Apocalypse. Notable is Death played memorably by Monique Ganderton, one of The Horsemen who saves Apocalypse allowing him to recruit some familiar mutants later. These include Angel (Ben Hardy channelling the late Heath Ledger) and a young Storm, Alexandra Shipp. Olivia Munn's Psylocke has an edge and a costume in which she steals every scene.The series time resetting and continuity malarkey aside there are many anachronisms littered throughout - t-shirts, glasses and locations etc. that were not around in 1983. Also there are 'fridge logic' instances, for example Magneto should be about 50. Between First Class and Apocalypse, 20 years have gone by but many of the characters remain youthful, Magneto should be about 50 having being around 10 in 1944, Rose Byrne's Moira MacTaggert appear to not have aged a day and so on.There are several films crammed into one and it works thanks to the central friendship story-line that's heart to the film. After the visually fantastic opening the first hour establishes what the characters have been up to, the latter half is then a face off between the players. World-destroying, operatic mutant, Isaac (who is somewhat a Tom Hardy acting chameleon) makes Apocalypse menacing. Simon Kinberg's script keeps Apocalypse engaging retaining a comic feel even though it is nihilistic at times. Debatably indifferent, Singer and Kinberg never allow Apocalypse reach Nolan &amp; Synder's bleakness or the polish of recent Avengers and it's Marvel movie counterpart outings. There's fun to be had, Quicksilver (American Horror Story) Evan Peters gives X-Men: Apocalypse one of the most memorable scenes where he uses his super-speed to save students and a dog from an exploding mansion to the The Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'. For die-hard X-Men fans Hugh Jackman's Wolverine cameo restarts his original story with a gruesome killing rampage. The acting is what you'd expect for a cast boasting such well known faces. Grappling with the dark side of her abilities Sophie Turner's Jean Grey even though given little to do until the action packed closing is a good addition. Mystique played again by popular actress Jennifer Lawrence never quite matches her older counterpart, Romijn. Likewise Cyclops, Tye Sheridan doesn't meet Marsden's presence. James McAvoy as good actor as he is still can't shrug off Patrick Stewart's Xavier shadow. Whereas Michael Fassbender gives Magneto's story-line the emotional depth it requires especially after his family are murdered. Finally Nightcrawler - Kodi Smit-McPhee learns to hone his powers and is a great addition. The characters are all interesting but Psylocke and Storm embody the way this entire series has changed its female characters; giving them emotional integrity, swagger and complexity as much as possible in a sea of other characters. In all the special effects, sound design, costumes and amazing sets X-Men: Apocalypse gets close to evoking the friendship nature of the comics. It also reflects a morally grey rather than black and white view of the world without endless rain and gloomy lighting. Yes, there's a Stan Lee cameo and of course there's a anti climatic post credit scene which follows on from Wolverine's aftermath. Overall, Singer's back to basics story and fast pace in a wash of other recent superhero films offers (by the skin of its teeth) enough new thrills to pass the time with. Worth watching for Issac's troubled Apocalypse and Ganderton's small pivotal role alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men ApocalypseBryan Singer seems to have the Midas touch when it comes to X-Men movies. Not to mention The Usual Suspect being one of the best films from the 90s. This makes me excited for the remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea which will come out next year. Charles Xavier played by James McAvoy is once again almost perfect in the role I have some issues with how they wrote the movie but his performance was up there with Michael Fassbender as Magneto. Once again their friendship seems to play that card of "oh I'm your friend, now your enemy, now your friend again." Which is getting old.Jennifer Lawrence did seem a bit off, but not as drastic as some professional reviewers out there are saying. She's not Robert De Niro, she doesn't just make movies for money.I wish Hank McCoy spent more time as Beast and was actually a Beast. It was never on point for me. Nicholas Hoult was still a good Hank though.Moria Mactaggert, played by Rose Byrne, was just in the way. Like Lois Lane from BvS, she didn't need to be in the film. Bleh.Jean Grey and Scott Summers were my favorites of the film. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan were great. Sophie is great in Game of Thrones and Tye was great in Mud. I can't wait for Ready Player One where he plays the Parzival. Oscar Isaac plays En Sabah Nur, he played the role they wrote well. That being said the character that Simon Kinberg and Bryan Singer wrote was way off point. Imagine Deadpool with his mouth sown shut. Yeah it's almost that bad.Verdict: Worth watching. I enjoyed it more than Batman Vs. Superman and the post credits makes me excited for the next in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>En Sabah Nur ? The ancient mutant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last I am happy, X-Men Apocalypse is all I wanted to see and Bryan Singer just delivered the same. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but after a long time it was a straight forward Good vs Evil fight. This was the 4th in line most anticipated superhero movie after 'Batman Vs Superman', 'Deadpool' and 'Captain America:Civil War'.Being a Superman fan I never took it kindly the defeat and death of Superman, Deadpool isn't my kind of superhero and as I have mentioned in my previous review that Cap wasn't so righteous in that movie which I always liked in him.Anyway the starting of the movie and introduction of En Sabah Noor in ancient Egypt back in 3600 BC was really cool. I wish they could prolong that part as it quickly ended with him getting buried under the enamours pyramid.The whole idea of projecting Mystic as some kind of hero (or heroine) is beyond me as the first 2 prequels showed her in a complete different light and there was no indication about her volatile and complex relation with Magneto. She was always shown a very loyal subordinate of Magneto. Not sure if it is because of Jenifer Lawrence is playing as Mystic/Raven.James McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender as Erik / Magneto are fantastic. Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy / Beast and Sophie Turner aka Sansa Stark as Jean Grey were cute, Jenifer Lawrence as Mystic maybe hot but not so engaging. Actually Olivia Munn as Psylocke looked hot and better than her. Quicksilver and Nightcrawler provided the much-needed humour in this saga.The only regret I have is that my favourite villain Apocalypse aka En Sabah Nur did not get as much as screen share as he supposed to have. I am always fascinated with the idea of a Villain being all powerful (Like Galactus in Silver Surfer or Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon). They should have shown him more powerful, but I am not skeptical about how Jean in the end got the better off him. As Professor always believe Jean's powers can't be measured and always should be in check for greater good.I would rate this one as 7.5/10 and will advise all the movie buff to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good sequel but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am gonna say that the movie was somehow up-to-the-mark. Bryan Singer's Days of Future was able to capture the mutant magic much flawlessly which according to me made it the best X- Men movie till date. Yet this sequel wasn't able to do so . The plot was a bit haphazard, as there are many interlinked stories in them, overstaffed with so many things yet highly entertaining. I seriously missed proper interaction between the characters. Screen time for a few characters (AM NOT GONNA NAME THEM) could have been increased. Now coming towards the positive side, I must say that the actors gave real effort even when there was no proper chance of acting. As usual the VFX was rather outstanding. The most positive factor of the movie is the 3D. X- Men Apocalypse was filmed with 3D cameras resulting in superb 3D visuals. From the Opening Titles till the End Credits, you feel as if you are really there which I simply missed in Marvel's Captain America Civil War.Lastly I must say that X-Men Apocalypse is highly entertaining and watchable even with some serious flaws and plot holes (I AM NOT GONNA SPOIL). According to me, I advise y'all guys to watch, cause its worthy. P.S - Don't' compare it with X- Men Days of Future while watching cause DOFP is the greatest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Apocalypse, that is a new beginning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that the X-Men franchise revival started with X Men First Class. It followed by a not so great The Wolverine (I liked it though!) and then the most complicated, X-Men Days of Future Past set the tone. Bryan Singer has worked hard again to make the people forget the debacles of X2 and XMen-The Last Stand, it is totally evident when in this movie, some characters after watching the 'Return of the Jedi', come out saying at least we can agree the third ones are always the worst :-) But the film raises many questions and also it is completely up to the individuals whether they will like the movie. There are many reasons why X-Men would have evolved the way it has now. The veteran actors' age and their commitments to the long-term projects are the primary ones. Although the way the franchise is moving now is somewhat questionable. We have the introduction of all the characters once again and now there is a lot more grey area. Of course even the movie making has evolved in the years and the hero- villain concept is simple like it is used to be. Although X-Men Apocalypse directs its focus on one main evil character, Apocalypse the story around the rest of the characters evolve around them choosing between good and evil. With this film, we are back to the Xavier academy, with more advanced learning facilities and a sponsored and designer Ray Ban eye gear for Scott Summers which is a clear indication of the new age film making. The visuals are a treat to watch, especially the ones from the past Egyptian Era. Action is great as usual and there are some fun moments added here and there to live up to the MARVEL brand. Yes the villain's ideology is very stale 'building a new world' and what not, but isn't that what every apocalyptic movies are about?The roles of both Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy get eventually sidelined by the fascinating characterisation and performance of Oscar Isaac's apocalypse. I loved the costume design and make up for him although I thought there should have been more clarity around his mutant powers. I can't say much about the new young actors except Evan Peters and Sophie Turner who have quite more to offer as Quicksilver and Jean Grey. Our dear Sansa Stark looks more and more beautiful grown up. Having occupied more screenspace both in XMen first Class and Days of Future Past, Jennifer Lawrence may have slightly a lesser role to play here. I loved Michael Fassbender as magneto and he is no less in this film also. I am slightly critical about the characterization of Charles Xavier here as it falls somewhere between powerful and helpless. Olivia Munn is in for the glam quotient and boy she is hot! I found X-Men Days of Future Past to be slightly complicated because it wanted to reverse everything just in a span of single movie and it was hectic. Although I eventually read about it and understood it better. X-Men apocalypse is much more simpler and entertaining to watch. But somewhere at the corner of your mind there can be a psychic voice saying, "It may have been better".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse is really awesome. Being a die hard X-Men fan, I was hyped for this movie and I, sure as hell, wasn't disappointed. The performances were commendable, especially Michael Fassbender's, and nobody underplays or over acts a role. And I really did not have a problem with Apocalypse's portrayal in the film, contrary to what most of the critics and moviegoers experienced. Singer and Isaac were both aware of what Apocalypse needed to do and they did justice to that. Some scenes (or, shots for that matter) rise above expectations. Such as, Quicksilver's evacuation and his fight with Apocalypse (despite being short). Storm, Psylocke and Angel didn't have much to do other than standing beside Apocalypse and giving "the look". And just when you thought the film is slightly dragging, you get Wolverine! And that was a really electrifying cameo, I'd even say that Wolverine's 2 mins were better than Spidey in civil war.The reason for why this movie is better than civil war and BvS is simply because it is executed properly and no one ever feels out of place (Yeah, even Jennifer Lawrence) and no character is shoved down our throats and comes outta nowhere. Singer and Fox knew what they were going to do with all the characters (There are quite a lot) . And the CGI was actually cool, I have no idea why people criticized that though.Lastly, please do not listen to the irrelevant criticisms thrown at this movie, most of them are because of the fact that marvel doesn't own the rights to X-Men . Go to the theatre and enjoy yourself for 2 and a half hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has received, in my opinion, fairly unjust reviews. Right from the get-go it is set up as a much darker entry to the X-men saga than any other film in the franchise, after just two minutes of run time already we see a man reduced to sack of broken bones, something the franchise would never previously dare to do. Other than the much darker moments there are also some much improved character writing and casting, I feel that Tye Sheridan, Alexandra Shipp, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee were perfect for their roles and added a much needed depth to the characters that was not present in the previous cast simply didn't have. Also, Michael Fassbender gave an absolutely outstanding performance as Magneto and no trace of his real accent can be heard like in "First Class" and despite the disappointing design of Apocalypse himself, Oscar Isaac's performance shone through the questionable prosthetics as he delivered a truly chilling and menacing performance. I believe that the only things that dragged this film down were the fairly predictable plot and the fact that it was released so soon after the outstanding Civil War possibly resulting in increased expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-men: Apocalypse it's a good continuation of the x-men franchise. It's not as good as X-men First Class but still very entertaining and fun to watch.The new actors ( of cyclops , jean Grey and nightcrawler ) absolutely nailed the their performances of the characters and the returning cast also did a great job impersonate their roles.Even Jennifer Lawrence impressed me with her performance of mystique most of the time...but not every time ( there are still some parts she annoyed me )This movie has the tone of X-men 3 ( That's not a good thing ) for the first 27 minutes but thankfully after a scene involving Magneto, the movie changes tone and becomes really damn good.Let's talk about Apocalypse now. There are times you wonder why he is doing what he is doing, and you pretty much don't care about him but they're also times the movie make you feel absolutely terrified of him.But of course i can't forget this "one" scene in the movie. There is a scene in the movie that's so freaking amazing and can't even describe how awesome it is. It's probably one of my favorite scenes i've ever seen in a movie. And of course it's the new Quicksilver scene. :D It's so well made from the cinematography and the choreography to the music playing during the scene.I give X-Men apocalypse 9/10. ~ Could have been better? Yes. But that doesn't mean its not good. I Went to saw the movie with pretty low expectations and i was not disappointed. ( But if you over hype it before seen it you'll probably leave the theater disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected! definitely best x-men movie so far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see it with lowest expectations. I figured, Civil War and Dawn of Justice were ones that were supposed to be best this year. I WAS SO WRONG! Fox nailed it this year! Deadpool will most likely be best secondary movie (compared to Suicide Squad and Dr Strange), and without a doubt - Apocalypse was best Main movie these three companies had to offer.I am surprised rotten tomatoes are against this movie as well (but after Dawn of Justice, I stopped paying attention to that. It's most definite - they are working in Disney's favor, not in favor of quality) ). If you go to see this movie, you'll get: * Amazing soundtrack, best one out of all x-men movies (along with Deadpool - best soundtrack in comic book movies so far award goes to Fox); * promising new actors(Cyclops, Storm, Jean... well Jean was least promising, but it's only start!) who will without a doubt replace old trio we all grew up with;* Amazing story line. They asked right questions, as always - you can pull parallels with our world with no trouble. Heck, throughout movie, on moments I've felt I wanted Apocalypse to succeed. That's sign of how well written movie is; * Some funny scenes. Some seem forced, which is downside, but most scenes with Quicksilver had me laughing my butt off;* Whole movie is what we waited for. All characters are AT THEIR BEST, THROUGHOUT whole movie. Unlike in other big two, characters don't get weaker and stronger on moments; * AMAZING BATTLES! And after such a long time, fights that I remember from cartoons were finally translated to big screen. Especially Xavier's fights. God, I didn't even knew how much I desired those until I saw it happen. --- When ya sum it up - it's best X-men movie ever made. And if we have post credit scene in mind (you'll might need to google it, I know I did), boy they can build A LOT now... we can get at least 2, 3 more QUALITY x-men movies. Whoever took charge for these new x-men, KNOWS what they should do. Downside exists. Downside is definitely that if you haven't figured out time-lines until now, you're gonna have some trouble. Even if you did, on moments time-line can be bit hard to get. Romance isn't really something none of superhero movies (Except Deadpool) manages to deliver. That's something what might break the tempo for you. And lastly, if you've seen more than just one trailer, there's a chance you'll feel few moments are spoiled for you. It's best not to watch more than one trailer. :) Rating 9/10, downsides don't affect it way too much, but they exist. It doesn't change fact that it's best X-men movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all if I am going to speak about the director Bryan singer he directed and assisted in writing XMEN , X2 and then came back after ten years with Days of the future past also can't forget The Usual Suspect one of Hollywood's greatest film that inspired a lot of movies around the world including Egypt. I found out that Bryan singer is breathing XMEN and his love for the characters is felt while watching. I heard before that Hollywood focuses on the villain because its a rule of some = if the villain is great the hero will be a legend and it's the first time through my watching of comics specially XMEN to find out that it's not about the power you got its about how to control it and use it in doing good things or fighting evil. Bottom line I enjoyed the movie like a roller-coaster ride that got me scared but still wish to go for a second ride. X-Men: Apocalypse as all comics that got many characters joining forces is talking about friendship and above all the most important four letters word that could change your life H O P E .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a lot of people shouting why the other person is wrong. Which leaves me in doubt about people scoring 10 and other people scoring very low.... and basically the reason why I'm writing this review.I went to the cinema yesterday and I've a HUGE fan of anything with Marvel since I was 10 years old and that is 30+ years ago. I know all stories, read all comic etc. BUT a movie is not a comic... it can and never will be. Upfront I'm very positive towards this kinds of films.Looking at this film and comparing it with "days of future past" it's a lot less.... Is it a bad movie?? no, I will watch it again for sure. But is it a great movie?? no..... I walked away discussing right after the movie asking myself it if was good... and I couldn't say yes.... In my opinion it was just to much going on while personalities had not enough depth to make it work... The start of the film felt way to slow, while in the end it was nearly blowing up the screen and it was hard to catch up on what was going on.Yes the movie was nice, but not nearly as good as the previous movie, so everyone giving this a 10, I have a hard time to understand that...because you cannot score a 12 for "days for future past". And lets me honest that it was plot, story and movie wise a LOT better movie... It's a fine movie, but simply not great...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Spectacular as First Class or DOFP ; but still good though.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched this film yesterday night and I think that it doesn't go head to head with its predecessors... Mathew Vaughan's and Bryan Singer's last movie "First Class and DOFP" are still my favorites. But that doesn't mean I didn't like this one though Bryan Singer this time somewhat failed to deliver that entertainment and Chills which he gave us in his last one.Positive points :---1. Quicksilver again stole the show in this one they topped that slow motion DOFP's kitchen scene with there Slow motion School Scene in this one. And this Is what I much liked in this one. MY FAVORITE SCENE OF THIS MOVIE.2. Wolverine's Cameo though it was very good but i didn't think it was needed. But it can may be set up Wolverine 3.3. They showed some mutants past and origins which I much liked.4. Apocalypse was good.Negative:--1. Character Development was lacking.2. Movie's length was bit excessive.3. No proper screen time to all characters. In CA:CW one thing which i liked was that all characters got a shining scene of them everybody was looking awesome because of it. But this movie like BvS lacked that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely wasn't a disappointment, it was as good as it was expected to be. X men apocalypse is arguably the best x men movie fighting with days of future past. The characters were great in the movie despite wolverine not showing up for even 10 minutes, this actually allows the movie to show off the other x men characters. Being a bigger fan of x men like professer x, this was my favourite part of the movie as this is the x men movie which finally shows off mystique and quicksilver as true badasses. Overall this movie doesn't have many things bad about it at all, but most things in this movie are good. It's a very enjoyable film and one of the best marvel movies that have come out so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story has been stretched with the introduction to past live mutant. Could have been better if born of a new enemy from the present instead of past was pictured. Enemy dialogues were quite god opposing and freaky. Quicksilver entry could finally bring some laughing faces in that serious ambiance. Wondering why wolverine had this short play, may be he was weaker for that part of x men or there is something more fir him in the later parts. The thing that really disappoints me was the play performed by magneto which has covered a good length in this whole drama yet had little time to play as an opponent. Conclusion : Good story don't expect more in such non reality plays.</fullReview>

All the actors were amazing, they did justice to their roles and It is nice to see the characters that I liked in a new way and it was not at all disappointing!! Before ending this, If I don't tell about the CGI in the movie, I would not be doing a wrong thing!! The graphics were amazing and one of the best effects in the recent past!!

		<shortDescription>The best X-Men movie with the new cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some mixed reviews about this movie I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to see this one in cinema. I was a teenager when the first X-Men movies came out, and I liked them a lot back then. But now I'm almost 30, so it's not that often I go to see superhero movies - I've missed Deadpool and Captain America - Civil War this year (and Batman V Superman was big pile of sh*t to be honest). You could say I've lost my faith in superhero movies - or maybe I have grown up.But I decided to give this movie a chance. Mainly because Michael Fassbender whom I have enjoyed as Magneto and because Oscar Isaac is the main villain in this movie. And those two actors are the best thing this movie has to offer.The plot is entertaining, and the movie opens with epic scene from ancient Egypt. The movie makes Magneto even tragic character than before and Isaac's Apocalypse is probably one of the coolest villains of all time. Apocalypse is scary and vicious at the same time. And I gotta give it to the makeup department; Oscar Isaac is very nicely transformed into Apocalypse.And now I'm going to give some minor spoilers, so don't read ahead if you have not seen the movie yet.We get to see how Storm got her white hair and how Prof. Xavier lost his hair. You might have never thought about those two things, but after seeing what happened to their hair, the mystery is finally solved (at least to those of us who have not read the comics)! If you remember the movie X2, you might remember the dam where Wolverine was held. So when this movie goes to a dam with same looking wintery scenery, you just might get some goosebumps. You guessed right: yes, we do have Wolverine!!! For about two awesome minutes Hugh Jackman is slicing up people. That came as a surprise for me because I had not expected him.X-Men: Apocalypse introduces many new faces and does a good job doing so. Quicksilver has also "his scene", and it's a lot better than in Days of Future Past - and that scene was great too.I don't think there is much to complain about in this movie. Well maybe Sophie Turner as Jean Grey. I don't like her in Game of Thrones, and I didn't like her now. She's just not that good actress. Too bad they're probably ruining the future X-Men movies with her.This movie is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight Rises (I know, it's DC and this is Marvel). If you have hard time choosing between this and Captain America, go see this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Age of Ultron of X-Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year in super heroes so far: Deadpool Awesome, Dawn of Justice Entertaining but could be better, Captain America Civil War Fantastic and X Men Apocalypse?.satisfactory.Following on from the previous brilliant X men films Days of Future Past and First Class, X-Men Apocalypse raises the roof several times to a whole new realm of action, destruction, and of course mutants. Now Xavier's school for mutants has become a proud established academy with many students, but a new threat has risen from the earth. Apocalypse rises to bring about a new earth and kill all life but with the help of four rogue mutants.To start off, X-Men Apocalypse defiantly promises what it delivers in the trailers and on the posters, so for the fans looking for what they see in the trailers is exactly what you get. However, this isn't a super hero masterpiece, but it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Probably not the best out of the X Men series, but impossibly no the worst. I would call this the Age of Ultron of the X-Men universe, or the better version of Man of Steal (associating with how much destruction there is).Before I talk about negatives I will go over positives: good performances by cast (especially Sophie Turner), good direction of narrative to an extent, great score, entertaining, hype building, explosive, slightly funny, and cool use of costume.One of the main problems at the beginning was that there was too much going on, and there are numerous stories going on a the same time so it gets quite crowded. Not just with the story but also characters. It tries to pull focus on too many characters which makes it kind of each person gets their time in the spotlight feel. It is also far too long, which doesn't make you bored but does slightly drag on a bit.I will also say there were moments which I call were awkward tense moments. This is when there are brief moments in the dialogue which try to be significant but are not delivered correctly. For example in Force Awakens when Ren and Rey are fighting and he mentions in a bad delivery 'I can teach you the ways of the Force' One of the strong but also weak points 0f the film is its very strong use in visual effects including CGI and editing. This consists of some remarkable scenery to be admired, but it is very repetitive and could make one dizzy.Overall X-Men Apocalypse is very entertaining, and is fourth out of eighth' place in the series. I understand its hard to always top the previous film, but this still doesn't quite reach the momentum of Future Past or First Class, but is still very good. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the best superhero movie of the year. I would like to see more overpowered people in Marvel movies such as Sentinela, Thanos, Galactus... Great move by putting someone as powerful as Apocalypse in it :). Well, talking about that, it would be pretty amazing to watch a movie of Sentinela in it, he is one of the most amazing superheros forgotten by Marvel. One of the very few things that I didn't like about the movies was that Sansa Stark is Sansa Stark! Its hard to see her as an Xmen hero. Also, Havoc didn't have to die so soon, we almost didn't see his amazing powers, I was a little disappointed with that. The rest of the movie was very solid and I keep thinking about the Xmen getting in the same movies as Avengers since they look like to be in the same universe. Actually, I guess that everyone wanna see they together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great, but ruined by botched ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Huge fan of the comics here. As X-Men: Apocalypse began, the opening scenes instantly took my breath away. DAMN good!! Apocalypse's subsequent awakening (due to the meddling of Moira MacTaggart!) and search for his four horsemen were also pretty great. I loved seeing Scott Summers and Jean Grey. All the great stuff with Magneto was also nearly perfect. The movie builds up to its climax for a long time, and it's all good (though not quite perfect) - but once the climactic events begin in the second half of the movie, it all goes off track. First Apocalypse sends all the world's nuclear weapons into space - a cool sequence... but, we think he is going to use them; use the raw power they comprise. Instead he just throws them into space, so humanity can't use them. Even though he clearly wants to destroy most of the world. Doesn't make sense; it deflates the inflated audience expectations. Next, in the true climactic fight, nobody's motivations are addressed in the least. Magneto changes his mind, and soon after some of the horsemen do, too, but we don't hear why! We hear no reasoning of any kind! It's a fight in which the good guys practically only win the day because most of the bad guys decide to switch sides for no adequately explained reason! It's as if the movie just suspended its storytelling, gave up on all characterization and just relied on nothing but visual spectacle to wow the audience and carry the climax.Sadly, it doesn't work. Another of the main things that doesn't work is when Jean Grey "phoenixes out". The flame bird looks great and all, but the whole point of that character is that she is transformed by the change - and she wasn't! Not in any way at all! This was really annoying! I was so excited about what she would become now; whether she would break out as Dark Phoenix or at least just Phoenix, but nothing at all happened except amping up her power level. There was no effect on her character. That is almost as disappointing to me as the last time they botched the Phoenix story, namely in X-Men: The Last Stand, where they just had her standing around and doing nothing. WTF?!X-Men: Apocalypse had too many characters. Storm and Psylocke in particular got hardly any real development; we didn't hear their motivations and except for Storm at the very end, they didn't get a chance to be heroes. Mystique also had very little to do in this movie. She brought news of Magneto's change, and she brought Nightcrawler with her, but she didn't have much else of consequence to do. Her power level was too low to influence the final battle. They should have done more with her, and shown us what connection she had with Stryker, as per the end scene of the previous movie. A lot of the problems with this movie seem to be caused by having had to make it in a damn hurry. They should have waited a year and spent the time working out a better story.Still and all, with all the action and cool characters, this is still a damn good-looking and entertaining superhero movie. I still rate it an 8 out of 10, even though it's best in the beginning and just gets weaker from then on. A good thing I haven't mentioned yet is the music. I really thought the music worked very, very well in this movie.X-Men: First Class (2011) was an astonishingly great movie; 10 out of 10. Days of Future Past (2014) was also fantastic; so many great details and a very cool and complex story: 9 out of 10 stars! Sadly, X-Men: Apocalypse is yet another step down from that level; it's a furious chase movie with a weak plot and villains whose motivations aren't explored in any detail, and some of whom (Magneto!) changes allegiance for no apparent reason. Such a shame! I really expected better from Simon Kinberg after the extraordinarily well-made two previous X-Men movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not up to Days of Future Past, but Overall Decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acts as a direct sequel from the ending of Days of Future Past, Singer continues the main themes of family, struggling to accept oneself and the challenge of letting go of the past in expanding this ambitious mutants universe, though slightly mess up but it is still a competent film. It starts off at a fine pacing with several pieces of subplots to reintroduce the old members, decently surface the villain but due to overloading of stories to tell, there's a lot of flaws especially at the final act as well as some underdeveloped new characters. The story still focuses on the three main characters - Xavier (Professor X), Erik (Magneto) and Raven (Mystique), all deliver promisingly just as previous installments that leads to a very engaging chemistry together with powerful scores by John Ottman, visually stunning effects and a number of fun moments delivered by both Professor X and Quicksilver (although the latter seems to steal the attention much better in two major scenes). The theme of hope might not be quite resonant this time and it might not be the best entry in the trilogy but overall it's more humanly emotional engaging and certainly one of the quite successful superhero trilogy reboot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And From the Ashes of Their World, We'll Build A Better One!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this is Singer's 4th addition to the X-men franchise, it's hard to watch it without making direct comparisons with his previous instalments and whether he's still able to add anything else to the franchise. Whilst Singer does cover familiar ideas in this film, it never feels stale with the themes of social acceptance resonating as strongly here as they always have before and Singer still succeeds at creating new exciting sequences in to the franchise. Taking place after the events of Days of Future Past and still using cast of First Class, a new enemy awakens after resting for thousands of years known as Apocalypse, played by a very intimidating Oscar Isaac whose presence constantly dominates the screen. He's a being who believes he's a god, as he has become seemingly omnipotent having gained many mysterious powers over his several lifetimes including the ability to increase the powers of other mutants. He uses these powers to attempt to bring together four followers and destroy the world in order to start a new empire where only the strongest survive. In many ways Apocalypse is the polar opposite to Xavier (James McAvoy). Whereas Xavier unlocked the potential of mutants like Magneto through helping them reach serenity, Apocalypse uses their pain and suffering to mould them in to warriors he can control to bring the earths destruction. It's Apocalypse's want for control and his power to destroy that unites the X-men to stop Apocalypse and once again save the world. The first 30-40 minutes of the film are quite clunky, with the film jumping all over the place to introduce all of the various characters in to the story. It has to catch us up with all the older heroes after a 10 year gap between films, whilst also introducing an entirely new young cast for some of the most iconic X-men like Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Because of this the first act of the film does feel rather slow, but once the film gets going it never slows down until the end credits, being well paced whilst moving swiftly between action set pieces and combining multiple story lines. Fans of Quicksilver (Evan Peters) will be glad to know his role is much larger than it was in the previous film and once again he ends up delivering some of the biggest laughs in the entire film. There are also several great new additions to the franchise. Tye Sheridan re-establishes Cyclops in to the franchise at a point where he's far from the natural leader that we saw from the original X-men trilogy and adds some much needed charisma to the role. Whilst Sophie Turner doesn't have the same hypnotic element that Famke Janssen bought to the role, she does bring to life a far more timid and uncertain Jean than what we've seen before, with the film also setting up some groundwork to redo the phoenix saga in a future film.Also Fassenbender once again has another great outing as Magneto, whose own hatred further sets himself down the path to villainy that he's been forced down since his parents were first murdered. He goes on a very painful journey within the film, with Fassenbender adding a great deal of anguish and tragedy to his character once again. His story also has several great stand out moments, including one incredible sequence where he destroys the remains of Auchwitz, another reminder of how those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. However with such a large cast to use there are some characters who don't get the time that they needed. For example, whilst Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is funny and has a few good moments in the film, there's nothing near the scale of the Whitehouse sequence in the introduction of X-2. Also this is probably the weakest outing for Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Whilst her character arc was one of the strongest aspects for both First Class and Days of Future Past, here in spite of her prominent screen time her role seems so tagged on and unnecessary that she probably could have been removed from the film and it would have been none the weaker because of it. Similarly, new characters like Jubilee (Lana Condor) and Angel (Ben Hardy) feel entirely unnecessary and receive absolutely no character development.Once again there's another show stealing Quicksilver sequence (this time to the tune of Eurythmics - Sweet Dreams) which is just as funny and creative as the one in Days of Future Past, but also adds a dramatic element in to the mix. Singer also found a great way to visualise Xavier and Apocalypses battle of the minds, in one thrilling sequence that see's Apocalypse grow in to a giant to overpower Xavier.(POTENTIAL SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE 3rd TRAILER) However the biggest show stopper in the film is in the weapon X facility and Wolverines (Hugh Jackman) escape sequence. Whilst he's only in the film for a few minutes, this short time does better justice to the character than the entirety of Origins was ever able to, finally unleashing feral Wolverine in a brutal hallway fight that leaves a mass of dead bodies left in Logan's wake. Though one drawback of X-men Apocalypse is that it is a film for those familiar with the franchise only. Unlike Days of Future Past, which could appeal to both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike, Apocalypse relies a lot on its audience knowing about plot lines from past films, such as being already familiar with characters like Stryker and Mactaggert. But so long as you're familiar with the franchise, this film delivers with some great action pieces whilst following in the tracks of Days of Future Past by adding new life in to the franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the cynicism?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men has stood firm over the last few years alongside its major competitors and has, in my opinion, produced a series of quality films. This one is no different, and doesn't deserve the majority of the criticism to which it is subjected. Whilst the film is flawed in places, it it definitely worth a watch and a worthy inclusion to the franchise. Structurally, it is rather muddled, with a few pacing issues but nothing major. Several characters are stand-outs, such as Nightcrawler, Cyclops and another fantastic rendition of Quicksilver by Evan Peters. Wolverine's brief appearance also lifts the film and will certainly entertain fans. Others, on the other hand, drag the film down. Oscar Isaac, whilst an excellent actor, gives a surprisingly un-menacing performance as Apocalypse, and Angel is near useless and, despite his supposed power, remains in the background and rather irrelevant. Bryan Singer has, once again, given his audience an entertaining, awe-inspiring, if a little confused film, and excellently introduces younger X-Men for a new generation. If you are a fan of the X- Men, or superhero films at all, you wouldn't be making a mistake by seeing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining film from a Smart Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I would like so say that I don't understand some of the negativity towards the film. We have had some really great super hero movies in the past that is causing people to set their expectations way to high. This film is what you would want from a superhero film. Lets get the problems out of the way now. The four Horsemen were underused, no denying it. The development of Apocalypse could have been better executed. Finally (and this one is more of a personal assumption and may not turn out to be a problem) Mystique's ending. The movie ends with Mystique seemingly taking a teaching role at Xavier's school. However, Jennifer Lawrence recently stated that this would be the last time she portrays the character. Now we are not going to be getting another full on X-Men movie for quite some time which means their is plenty of time for her to change her mind. Now on to all the good stuff. First, Sophie Turner as Jean Gray. I was a little worried when I heard she had been cast for the role. This almost completely went away when I first saw her on screen. Turner delivers a convincing and emotional portrayal of a young Jean who is unable to control her powers. Next is Quicksilver. Now since I don't want to give away too much I will be vague. All I will say is that Day's of Future Past just had one of its scenes topped. Now one of the most emotional scenes in the film is when SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER, Magneto's family is killed. The moment it happened everyone in the theater knew what he was going to do to the police. There is an Easter egg as well that no one seems to have noticed yet. Magneto uses his daughter's necklace to kill them all, but if you look closely at it, it is the coin that he killed Sebastian Shaw with in revenge for his mother's murder. Finally, I loved the way that Wolverine was used. Just a little cameo instead of taking the whole movie which was a smart decision. Now, the building up of the new X-Men is beautiful. We are so used to powerful and experienced Mutants at this point that is was nice to see them as teenagers again. Finally, when Charles tell Jean to let her power loose, was simply great. The not so subtle hint that it was the power of the phoenix was a great setup for what may be in store. Overall it is a great film. Not the best X-Men film by any means. That title belongs to X2 or Day's of Future Past. It still a bunch of fun and you are only hurting yourself by not seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated all X-Men movies but this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I really didn't hate all the X-men movies, but none of them are what I thought were Awesome! X-men are my very favorite.... except in their movies. That being said, to me, most of the X-men movies either messed up story lines, made them just boring or had little to offer but a 10 sec fight scene. The latter movies like Day of Future Past or First Class have been better, but still not great. Don't get me started with Wolverine... wow..still mad about that one. So going into X-Men Apocalypse was kinda of dread moment for me. I was hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. So my girl and I went to matinée. And I was surprised how much I liked it. The movies starts strong and keeps a good pace. It was definitely not call it boring. There are plot holes and weak character development, but with all the movies they have done, you get most of the characters. CGI is pretty cool Action is decent, not the best but good Comic purist will hate it (with good reason and bad) Superhero movie fans I think will love it Acting fans: 50/50 Olivia Munn fans, sorry she was really under utilized X-Men fans: well, you have to judge for yourself. Wolverine fans... I won't spoil it for you, but... I was happy. The best thing I can say about this movie is that they seem to be going in a right direction, which leaves me with the new invigorated sense of hope for the X-Men franchise. Deadpool and X-Men Apocalypse have introduced 3 more characters that were in X-Force, in Deapool, Angel and Psylocke. Days of future past had a brief character in Warpath and there is Wolverine. That means you have 4 out of 6 characters for X-force. Come on Fox, and X-force R rated would be insane, learn from the future success of Suicide Squad and the great success of Deapool. Hope you all enjoy X-Men Apoc as much as I did. nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They got some of it wrong, but what they got right was thrillingly fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with an x-men movie is that someone is always going to complain. For one, you have the comics and then you have the movies. Some would say the only similarities are the names of the heroes. But then, there are so many different versions/timelines of said characters in the comics that its kind of strange to complain that the movies to match them enough. I am sure the biggest complaint that your typical hardcore xmen fan will have is that their favourite villain, Apoc, was not done nearly well enough, and you know what, they probably have a beef. But the rest was done so well that you can overlook this and really enjoy a great movie. I would even go to say that if Apoc was done in such a powerful way as you might expect, then he would have to have met his end in an equally or more powerful way, and there's really only on hero capable of that and if that hero did that, well, there would be no where else to go for that hero really afterwards.Anyway, thoroughly enjoyed it, this being a fan of the comics that never read the comics hardcore.One more thing though, has to be the most violent of all the Marvel movies to date, lots of people meet their end in a not very nice way, not too visual, but visual enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics are weirdos this movie ROCKED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics are really tuning out when it comes to summer blockbusters and it's such a shame. I was a little worried going into this movie because of all the bad rap it's got right now. But to my surprise, it was AWESOME. And I think critics are trashing this film because they just don't care, they think it's repetitive and it's pandering to fans of the characters. I'm glad it it was made for the fans of the comics, cartoons, whatever form you grew up with, because in my opinion this is the best live action adaptation to date of the X- Men characters. But I wanna make it clear that I don't think it's better than First Class as a movie, or Days of Future Past for that matter, but it's still really good. In a bloated year of comic book movies this is one that feels the most familiar but still fresh. The X-Men franchise being out of Marvel's hands is saddening to a certain extent, but it's nice to see it provide something different from what we expect in the Avengers. My friend and I both agree it's nice to have a more balance of drama and humor in the X-men films rather then having constant humor like in the Avengers, now I'm not saying I didn't like this past month's Civil War, I really enjoyed it, but it's nice to move the focus to a more dramatic conflict and less on the one liners. There are a few problems I have that I want to address first before I describe what I love about the movie. My first problem is the four horsemen, I feel it was rushed and completely left open with not enough details. Magneto was really the only one who made sense to me why he would join Apocalypse, because with Storm, Pyslocke, and Angel you just don't get to know them at all. They play off more as henchman rather than famous characters that we know. My other problem is Apocalypse wasn't used to his full potential, I think Oscar Issac did a great job with what he was given, but his lines feel repetitive and corny at times. His powers are unexplained, I'm not too sure what exactly he can do and it would've been a nice touch to just see what other powers he's capable of. On a more positive note I LOVED the urgency they showed with him, I really felt like there was a sense of danger finally which is a hard thing to find in the MCU. With the stakes being raised, it adds the tension and I feel that's severely lacking in most of the Avengers films except for a few scenes obviously. It's nice to see everyone from First Class reconnect and reflect on the memories from that film because it adds a sense of closure to that generation of mutants, especially between Xavier and Erik. While the new generation finally join the X-Men for a potentially awesome sequel in the 90's. I have no complaints there, I loved Jean and Nightcrawler, and I thought Cyclops did fine. Quicksilver was freaking great as you might expect so I hope to see him come back. There's so much I want to talk about but I want to keep it spoiler free. But let's just say everything they hint at in this movie got me so amped up that the next X-Men is on the top of my anticipation list. If you haven't done so, BUY A TICKET TO THIS MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

I have never had any but, I had the straight to VHS movies and watched all the series..So,Im not too familiar with the comic plot line of the movie so whatever way this may stray from that did not affect any opinion of the movie-nor would it normally if a movie strayed from original plot. I would recommend this movie to the person that enjoys super hero movies to begin with and who wants to watch a movie just to be entertained. That is just my opinion in a sea of the majority held 'nay' votes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fassbender, Isaac, McAvoy, Lawrence, &amp; Peters are just a few of the incredible cast members in this film. There are moments when all of the cast has a chance to shine, which is an accomplishment given the amount of people on screen. You cannot be blamed for entering the cinema and expecting spectacle to completely eclipse character development in this film, however the characters and their motivations are not neglected. There are also no plot holes (as many people have stated). Even a character as grandiose as Isaac's Apocalypse is presented with plausible reasoning for his actions; typically, its tough to justify the "I want to destroy the world" plot, but it makes sense given his history.Most importantly, you can follow this film without being a comic aficionado.If you liked Days of Future Past, this will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Over Stuffed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately, X-men Apocalypse doesn't live up the standards of the more successful entries, such as Days of Future Past and First Class to name the most recent. If I had to sum it up in one word, I'd say overstuffed. Which is harsh, but as a Bryan Singer helmed X-Men Film, I expected more - Bryan Singer might be losing his touch. The film is about a near god-like mutant, the first ever, and his quest to destroy the world. But first, onto the good stuff. It is safe to say the highlights of this film mainly revolve around Quicksilver. His scene is brilliantly made, and took months to complete - this could be a reason for some of the other issues of the film. It is incredibly inventive, fun and Evan Peters is a golden bit of casting in this role. I only wish we could see more, as Quicksilver's potential return is the only reason I anticipate the next film. Michael Fassbender's acting is superb, and it is evident to see this in a couple of scenes - you'll know when you see them. James Mcavoy is also charming and funny as Charles Xavier, and I wished there were more scenes between his and Fassbender. Other highlights include Nightcrawler, Angel and Wolverine, although the first two should've gained more screen time. It's worth noting that Angel is a much more interesting character before his transformation. Now the bad. As previously mentioned, it is overstuffed with too many characters. There isn't enough time for them all. Personally, I didn't really connect with the new team that well (Cyclops, Jean and Nightcrawler) but there are still some good moments between them. The four horsemen are possibly the biggest example of this however, with Psylocke and Angel not saying much and whilst Storm has a few more lines, it does not take long for any of them to join Apocalypse. It feels rushed and follows a similar problem to Batman V Superman. Magneto is the only one of the horseman that I enjoyed seeing, as I've already said, as he is the only one who you feel any emotion towards.Other problems include some of the special effects looking a tad weird, although overall they quite good; too many flashbacks to First Class (reminds us of a better film); Sophie Turner's American accent wasn't convincing at all to me, probably because I'm used to her British accent. But a big problem with this film, is a problem which I actually enjoyed seeing - Wolverine's Cameo (not a spoiler its in the trailer) Wolverines Cameo scene was completely unnecessary in the film, there is no reason for it to take place, or for Stryker to appear, other than to shoehorn Hugh Jackman in. This time taken up by this film could've been purposed to serve as more time with new characters (preferably the Horsemen) and I feel like it was a requirement from Fox to put it in, although Singer does his best to make it work. The only benefits of this scene are to highlight the premise of an R-Rated Wolverine movie - Wolverine really cuts soldiers down, there's a lot of blood for a PG-13 rated movie. I should just mention this is a violent film, there's people getting crushed, burned alive, folded and beheaded, so just warn any younger viewers of this. Finally, Apocalypse is a really mediocre villain - his power is amazing to watch, end even though it feels like he can do anything, you realise that because of the ending to Days of Future Past, that everyone makes it out okay. There isn't really much development for Apocalypse. Whilst story arcs are absent with a lot of characters here, Apocalypse's is simply to destroy the world and that's it. Overall, X-Men Apocalypse has some fun moments (watch out for Quicksilver), some emotional moments and some decent action, but is ends up with too many characters with too little character development and a lack of sensible structure, with too many scenes not being necessary, and character motivations not explained to evident. It is worth a watch, but maybe not worth going to the Cinema .Nick Will Charlie Paul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apocalypse: "You follow blind leaders."While X-Men: Apocalypse isn't quite as strong as 'Days of Future Past', with the storytelling and it's twist &amp; turns, but it's still a solid entry in the saga. I have to admit, I was surprisingly entertained with this movie which I didn't expect going in, since I wasn't expecting much with this movie. I had more fun with this than 'Civil War', and yes, I just said that and I'm not taking it back. The movie has it's flaws but at least I never bored watching the movie.James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and all of the other supporting cast were all great in their roles. I felt the emotion, the depth and the unexpected humor from the characters. Now when I think about it, all of the X-men characters in this and the past movies feel like actual characters to really care for. The movies themselves feel like actual movies and not just superhero films.Oscar Isaac is such a terrific actor and I will always look forward to his next movie. In this film, Isaac plays Apocalypse (main villain of the film) and he was a pretty decent villain. He was very menacing with his own presence that actually made him quite treating, even tho he's motivates of destroying the world has been done before many times with other villains. Apocalypse isn't terrible or a weak villain as many critics have said, but I wouldn't rank him as the best one. I mean give Oscar Isaac a break, he had to act in all that make-up on him and he did the best he could, so there's that.Some of the CGI in the film was very noticeable in a few scenes. But the effect's are not like that all the time, as there are many cool effect's in the film that did make me go "wow".The movie dose take awhile to get going and I don't mean it was slow or anything like that, but I couldn't really care for what's going on in the first 30 minutes. But as the movie went along it started to get going and each scene was better as it went along.Overall: X-men: Apocalypse is a very entertaining superhero movie that has it's pros and cons. I was surprised of how much I enjoyed this movie and how engaging I was. Oh, and Quick Sliver once again steals the show with an amazing slow motion sequence that easily tops 'Days of Future Past' slow mo scene. I can already tell a lot of people are going to be mixed with this movie after seeing the audience reaction (so far), but that's just opinions.P.S. The film itself is much better then what the critics are making it out to be. Maybe it's because of the endless amount of superhero movies that are coming every week now. 'Civil War' is still being fresh in peoples heads. I mean the movie literally came out a few weeks ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the latest cash grab in the Xmen franchise with pretty low expectations, but I never thought after "Days of Future Past" that things would sink so low.What a complete mess! From the multiple megastars phoning in their crappy lines ( see Fassbenders genuine tears as he contemplates the damage this film will have on his reputation during the appallingly cringe worthy "IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME" scene), to the unnecessary and drawn out back stories on characters that have already been introduced in previous films.Apocalypse is a villain who spends so much of the movie taking crappy rejects and making them his "horsemen" before spouting drivel about building new worlds as the one true god, that by the time it comes to the show down, no one really cares anymore.The real villain in this movie is not the green lantern-esque "Apocalypse" but rather the writers of this trash who subject us to line after line of grating dialogue not even fit to make it into an episode of power rangers.It's a big fall for the franchise that not even the contracted appearance of Wolverine can save.No one, bar the enthusiastic Quicksilver, gets out of this one with much credibility intact.Absolute rubbish!!</fullReview>

I'm assuming the movies overall score is primarily awarded for mere aesthetics; to which one must wait long periods of time to see. Best part, Apocalypse the character, convinces a posse of 4 to follow him: 2 teenage emo's, a cougar, and magneto. Sounds like an all out apocalyptic brawl to me... Not so much. Well, it fell short, even remotely close to a chicken fight, let alone, apocalyptic. Time to drop the act and move on from this sequel. Unfortunately, it saddens me to compare this classic to anything else, but, I'm getting the feeling this sequel is following the Fast and Furious exaggeration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to critics! This movie absolutely popped my brain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been a trend in Hollywood lately, several trends in fact. One of these trends is the overproduction of mindless or crass films, which sadly, are usually the ones that are well received and make a lot of money. X-Men Apocalypse is not dumb Deadpool, or an action-packed Civil War film, which was thin on plot and high on action. I loved Civil War but X-Men Apocalypse is a different animal all together. X-Men Apocalypse is a very theological film, full of wonderful writing and deep, insightful character arcs that make you consider the human condition.X-Men: Apocalypse makes you realize that being transcendent doesn't mean you have more knowledge than everyone else, or that you are smarter. It means that you grew past your own inner torments and don't let the pains of your past affect you and your future. It's also a bit dark, darker than any other Superhero film I've ever seen, including BVS. The Magneto scenes in this movie made be cry my eyes out, they were that disturbing! That's all I'll saw without spoiling anything, but man, I don't know how this film didn't get an R- Rating. I saw a lot of people walk out of the theater with their kids and I don't blame them. But anyway, back to what made the movie great.The acting by Fassbander and McAvoy. As good as it gets in the genre. Then we have Singer's excellent direction, and brilliantly paced story, which had a good blend of character driven drama, humor and of course, an excellent plot. However, some of the sets looked cheap at times, and I had wished that the film had more extras during the action scenes. Luckily, whenever Apocalypse did something terrible, we'd get a news report every now and then, which helped you realize that so many people were indeed affected. Speaking of Apocalypse, Oscar Issac absolutely stole this film. Say what you want about his look, but man, Boris Karloff move over! He looks just like him! I thought he was scary as hell and had some of the best lines in the film. He kinda had that Darth Vadar thing going for him for a while, and I actually agreed with 90% of his philosophy about humans and our destructive behavior. It saddens me to see so many people dislike this brilliant piece of cinema. I agree, that it was a bit more plot driven than the last movie, but hey, some of the best science fiction novels are plot driven. I don't mind theology every once in a while, we need more of it in Hollywood, and like BVS before it, it seems like people cannot stand esoteric films anymore. And that my friends, is a tragedy.9/10. One of the top 3 best X-Men films of all time and a top 10 favorite of mine. Don't let critics shape your opinions!</fullReview>

The plot is interesting, but the weakest links in the movie is the villains. Oscar Isaac did a OK job as the main villain. But the 4 horsemen( expect for magneto ) for forgettable. Quicksilver was fantastic, just loved every scene that he is in. ( expect one annoying theme)His Slow-mo scene is great. The movie has good humor, its has good action. Wolverines scene is also a fun action sequence. The movie has its flaws indeed but they aren't that big or annoying to destroy the movie. This movie made me hungry for more. It will be very interesting how they develop some of the new characters. ( and i would love to see quicksilver in a standalone film). I can't understand why this movie has got some big negative critic. Overall a fun superhero movie, if u are x-men fan u will enjoy it.

		<shortDescription>'X-men Apocalypse' is an episode of an X-men cartoon brought to life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If 'First Class' was the prequel/quasi-reboot that refreshed the franchise for a new decade and 'Days of Future Past' was a celebration of the history of the entire X-men film franchise...then 'Apocalypse', the concluding chapter of this loose 'prequel trilogy' is Bryan Singer finally taking the X-men to its roots as a comic- book spectacle, something which a significant portion of the fanbase has been clamouring for, to varying degrees, since the very first X- film hit the silver screen. And it would be unfair to judge 'Apocalypse' without taking this into account...As a work of cinema, 'Apocalypse' pales in comparison to its two immediate predecessors and of course Singer's original two films. But as a comic-book fantasy brought to life, it more than delights! There are no themes, overt and subtle, of discrimination and evolution and destiny here (well, there are somewhere in the background, but they are hardly of any importance)...what this film does have is the X-men valiantly flying into battle to literally save the world. It does have bright, colorful costumes, tons of continuity references to films and comics alike, mindblowing SPX, and an extended cameo by a certain franchise star that will no doubt have the audience cheering. And that's fine! Not every comic-book film needs to be a 'Dark Knight' or even an 'Iron Man'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>."X-Men: Apocalypse" Closes the Trilogy With Many Visual Effects, Drama and Quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Singer, Apocalypse and Quicksilver compose a film about the cataclysm.After four films based on Marvel's comics, Bryan Singer firmly demonstrates is owner of the best of the powers of the "X-MEN".One decade after "Days of Future Past," Professor Xavier's young students must confront the villain more powerful and fearsome of the history, located in the pyramids of the ancient Egypt, close to El Cairo.Oscar Isaac plays Apocalypse - unrecognizable after his work in "The Force Awakens" as Poe Dameron or "Ex Machina" as "Nathan", using blue makeup, boots with heels, prosthesis and a heavy costume that turned recordings into something hellish- a supreme being who over the years has absorbed the powers of many mutants, after 80 years sleeping under the Egyptian pyramids is accidentally awakened and seeing that his world is praising false gods decides to destroy the human race completely.Singer decides to resume the franchise after "X-Men: First Class" in 2011, this brings back to the mutants better known as James McAvoy's Professor X, Michael Fassbender's Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique and Nicholas' The Beast, joining to spectacular cast, new and talented youths to the team.Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner from "Game of Thrones"), Storm (Alexandra Shipp) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit- McPhee) are juvenile interpretations of mutants already seen in the previous films, they give you a touch more fresh and comical to each character while still retaining the essence itself. On the other side are the four horsemen of the antagonist, Psylocke (Olivia Munn), a renovated and young Archangel (Ben Hardy), Storm (Alexandra Shipp) and the very famous Magneto (Michael Fassbender) faithful to his master, until a certain point.A luxury cast bought 20th Century Fox to project for the fourth time to the "X-MEN" franchise, nominees for the Oscars, winners of Oscars, nominated for prestigious awards increase the expectation of the fans, and from what I saw, action and drama are present in each framing.This is a tradition, this is an addiction, this is a necessity. Once more the fabulous Evan Peters' Quicksilver runs a masterful slowdown scene in the scene, with many jokes, action, happiness and perfection. Since the moment that the scene becomes slow and a bee appears next to a flower, we knew what it was going to happen, the music plays and all goes to hell. It's so amazing. I think that Quick has been established as one of the best X-Men, becoming like the actors for the film, like the water for humanity, he's a necessity in the saga.Throughout the film, it also presents a pleasant and surprising cameo - in the full sense of the word - you know who we are talking about, despite being short and very bloody, the man does his job and leave.Bryan has worked a little more than sixteen years with the mutants, his knowledge is obvious to mix so many characters in a different age and yet provide a coherent, articulate and outstanding story. Relations and changes of the characters are also highlighted. The merit is not only to Singer, It's to entire team."Apocalypse" might not be the best superhero movie to the public child considering that is very dark and sinister, but it can be pure entertainment for infants and adults, something not will like much the fans because the film replaces the lack of genuine entertainment by tons of action and CGI. Opinions are mixed, but it is irreproachable do not say that the film is worthy of receiving the name "Apocalypse".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to see it from the zero point, this includes the opening titles.The story combines biblical historiographical edgings and messianic, with some traces of modern conspiracy theory,that give the argument a solid and intriguing background.In the meantime, it appears Wolverine with a ruthless and bloody intervention.Comes a character who was this today "capped" but from now becomes a figure mythical and unavoidable.The actor who plays shod like a glove, He played a memorable role, if not endearing, that will remain forever in the retina of the spectators.And talking about nonexistent characters, I mean "Quicksilver" (For us agree that except for comic fans, nobody gave $ 2 per Quicksilver, and from now enshrined as an almost obligatory figure of the saga. Very welcome the revival of this character, and its interpretation by Evan Peters). As I was going, it is the scene of 'Sweet Dream's of Eurythmics. Without fear or exaggeration, It is one of the best scenes in all cinema history, but the best. And without doubt, it is a landmark that will remain in history and that marks a before and after in the world films.On the other hand, the villain of the film is really intimidating, because it embodies nothing more and nothing less than the figure of God.What more can I say? The film is long but very bearable. Charls Xavier and Magneto impeccable, with the rest of the characters in his fledgling side. In total, it is not perfect, but worth watching if only for the scene 2 'arrival of "Quiecksilver" because alone all palms, laurels takes, and is a 10 Absolute. Bravo "X-Men Apocalypse". Viva "In Sabah Nur", Viva "Quicksilver", And death all Detractors of the film. (Mental shortsighted.).PS: Added 5.22.2016. I must clarify and recognize that I am a fool for it. He had not seen "X-Men Days of Future Past", had happened to me, and I saw her just now. Having seen before, maybe it would have slowed a little surprise effect that generated in me the scene of Quicksilver, but not much, I still think it's the best scene in movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing so many bad reviews from many sites (f.e. rotten tomatoes) i was a bit afraid to see the movie. I went today to see the movie don't listen to these people and go and see it. The movie is GREAT. It's not as good as Days of future past but it's WAY better from Civil War. In this movie again Evan Peters the show as Quicksilver making me laugh my pants of with those tricks and Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, she nailed it. The special effects were awesome and the final battle with Apocalypse was perfectly done. Thank you Bryan Singer for giving us another great installment of the X-men franchise and reminds us why this the best Marvel comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bryan Singer does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep if you are a fan of the previous x-men movies made by Singer , i think you will love this one. The story begins with the introduction of the Apocalypse character, although brief it just tells you how he disappeared for all these years and after millenia he awakens once again from followers that sprung once again with the last incident of the x-men saga.The small details of the film gave this movie a thorough and realistic (as it can be) atmosphere which i really loved, the action is explicit especially in the final half hour , very detailed and really well done. Apocalypse in my opinion was well made and he really was very powerful. I bet their are many Easter eggs to be found in this movie and their is one really awesome cameo that i loved ( not saying to spoil it :P) , the scene with Quicksilver is indeed 10 times better that the one in the last movie! Fassbender was awesome once again so was McAvoy. The only drawback of the movie for me was for about 15-20 minutes around the beginning to middle of the movie i got slight bored cause it seemed that it dragged too much , but the feeling was quickly vanished !! I recommend this movie to all the X-men fans, and not listen to the movie critics and see for themselves if they like it or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable, but I still liked DOFP a little more. Slight spoilers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't argue with the special effects. That's a given. Michael Fassbender brings such depth to Magneto's character; he truly is an anti-hero. They spent quite a bit of time building Magneto's character in this movie. Again, no complaints.I felt that DOFP had a much more developed and nuanced story line compared to Apocalypse though. Still, it was nice to see Mystique/ Raven grow up and mature into a more responsible adult. I think what I enjoyed the most about this film was the casting of Jean Grey. Perhaps it's because I'm an avid Game of Thrones fan and really like Lady Sansa Stark, but Sophie Turner brought Jean Grey to life from the comics. THIS was the Jean Grey I've been waiting for - not the one that Famke Janssen played in the earlier series of this franchise. This younger Jean Grey is smart, resourceful, and still learning to use her powers so she's understandably unsure of herself at times. Also, I always wondered what would happen if there was ever a showdown between Phoenix and Apocalypse... *hint hint wink wink*.There was a smattering of character development that carried over from DOFP, particularly with Quicksilver and Havoc's younger brother, Cyclops. I was most dismayed with the casting of Olivia Munn as Psylocke though. There's just something about her that did not add any complexity to the story. Maybe it was the screen writing? The only Horsemen that was interesting was Magneto - the other three were really just a supporting cast. I guess there simply wasn't enough time for Storm and Archangel to shine. Even the action scenes were quite minimal, I thought. Overall: predictably formulaic but still very, very good nonetheless, with the acting of Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy, Sophie Turner, et al. And of course, moments of comedic relief provided by Quicksilver (that scene at the mansion was fantastic!) I'd watch it again - of course other people will be quick to rip it to shreds. I never take critic's reviews seriously. They're paid to be faux bourgeois and if you don't agree with them, you're considered a heathen and intellectually inferior. Whatevs. Go get yours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest entry in the X-Men franchise and is about the first mutant who after being asleep for a long time is awakened into the modern world. A world which he believes to be lead by blind leaders and thinks it should be destroyed and recreated as he sees fit.Firstly - I loved this movie.I've seen a lot of mixed and negative reviews from critics and some audiences but I honestly cannot understand why... While Apocalypse's motivations in this movie were nothing new or groundbreaking, a simple coherent story is sometimes much more enjoyable than a complex incoherent one and I found that to be the case here. The characters (who are mostly cast as younger versions than we've seen previously) were absolutely brilliant. Each actor played their part superbly and this was by far the most interesting line up of mutants in an X-Men movie yet. The fact that there were so many characters in this movie and yet they still managed to deliver a story which was both easy to follow and entertaining, is a credit to the film makers as we've seen previously what having too many characters in a movie can do. The special effects were perfect and I honestly didn't find a single scene where the CGI was weak and felt like it took me out of the moment, which was impressive because a lot of special effects and green-screening was used to create this movie's settings, environments and mutant powers.The score and sound editing were also great in this movie and Apocalypse's digitalised voice was menacing, especially with some of the great lines he delivers.This movie was a comic book fan's dream, having lots of X-Men easter eggs throughout the movie and just the right amount of fan service to stroke your inner nerd without being too in your face.One thing I have to say is it was absolutely fantastic to finally see the X-Men geared up (albeit too briefly) in suits that were much closer to their comic book counterparts rather than the standard all black leather get up they are usually stuck in. I hope Fox sees how awesome they looked and decides to use these suits for the next movie.The one criticism I thought of while watching this movie is the fact that they show Apocalypse as having the power to manipulate matter itself (eg; he turns a few people into sand) yet while he is fighting the X-Men he doesn't use this power once... He fights them physically, using some of his other powers but really, couldn't he just turn them into dust? Anyway, it's a comic book movie so you shouldn't think about it too hard...If you haven't seen Apocalypse as yet, don't believe the critics and go check it out for yourself as I found it to be a hugely entertaining ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse was what I hoped it to be! While I haven't read what the (professional) critics have written about the film (and to be fair, I don't care) opinions and reviews from the fans have been extremely positive. There's been a lot of implying that Jean Grey's scene at the end is better than the whole Avengers franchise, or that Logan's cameo is better than the whole Avengers franchise. I can't help but agree!X-Men: Apocalypse is taken to some pretty epic levels, yet it seems effortless. The X-Men franchise is full of amazing, intriguing stories, and I don't think the writers have to dig too deep to find a story hey can make as epic as Apocalypse. Think about Days Of Future Past. X- Men manages to make these kind of stories while Avengers franchise seems to be slowly building to some kind of really epic movie, and that process is infuriatingly slow. Pick up the pace, Marvel!The writing is as good as it tends to be in superhero movies. There are few moments where the thrill is built up so well it takes your breath away. For example, when Scott Summers' abilities activate. You know exactly what's going to happen but you really feel how intense the scene is. It's just fabulous. The plot itself is decent. The greatest thing is the villain, because he seems impossible to beat, which gives it even more thrill. Of course typical plot devices are used, like the antagonist team gets one from the good side and is about to use him in their diabolical plot, just like in X2, but even though that is extremely familiar trope to those who have been following X-Men since the beginning, all of us worry so much for the character - unless you are heartless and don't understand why hurting him or using him is horrible.Is there something I don't like about this movie? The dialogue was sometimes extremely clumsy, especially when Charles Xavier first mentioned Moira. That kind of clumsy "schoolboy with a crush" dialogue would not suit sir Patrick Stewart, which makes it sound a little tacky. Also bringing back Moira was amazing, but it seems like the writers tried to make it seem like "yup, professor X is straight and nothing's going on between him and Erik". Whoops. that didn't work: their chemistry is too good. But I have to say my biggest annoyance in the film is this: there are a few characters that I thought seemed cool: they are new, and they have a lot of potential. But nope, they were killed to make another character develop again. I don't think creating new characters only to kill them is a good way to go. Even I can think of other ways. What if he had lived alone, humans realised who he was the same way, and tried to capture him, being more brutal, so he'd see that oh yeah, humans are still that bad. I just didn't see the need to introduce us to new characters and have them killed five minutes later.Usually it's annoying when X-Men franchise brings in new mutants and it's hard to keep a track of them. That has happened in, like, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and in the future of Days Of Future Past. Apocalypse gives us new mutants, except they aren't new. Scott Summers is back, so is Jean Grey, Kurt Wagner, Angel and Storm. Now we haven't seen all the new characters in movies before, but they are still familiar from comics, like Jubilee and Psylocke. Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner Kodi Smit-McPhee and Alexandra Shipp are phenomenal in their roles, some of them are better than the original adult actors, and I look forward seeing them in the possible next X- Men movies. Most of the old actors and actresses are just as good as they've always been. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender can't really compete with Stewart and McKellen, but they are extremely talented and good choices. Evan Peters makes this movie so much more delightful as Quicksilver. Avengers couldn't compete with their Quicksilver, Evan Peters is charming and so is his character. Oscar Isaac was fearsome and amazing as En Sabah Nur, but he has the problem many people in CGI filled superhero movies have: their face is covered up with all that technology. I like seeing the faces of actors and actresses, that tells a lot about their skills, but CGI is slowly killing this.True, I don't really like CGI much anyway, but I think this film is 80 % CGI. They couldn't do most of that stuff without it, so I don't think I can complain.X-Men: Apocalypse pulled me back to the fiery pits of X-Men hell. This movie has everything I love about X-Men movies, apart from ethical questions. In X-Men Apocalypse you can't choose sides, because who would be on the side of a guy who wants to destroy the world? The X- Men movies tend to have several categories for villains, but at least this time the villain wasn't a human being who hated mutants, like Stryker in X2 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Apocalypse is closer to Sebastian Shaw: a mutant whose goal seems to be to genocide but let the strong individuals live. X-Men: Apocalypse is intense in the perfect way, epic because of the story and the villain, and simply amazing. While there were less than perfect moments worth a good eye-rolling, as a whole this movie was astonishing. This film is the reason why I will always prefer X- Men over any other superhero franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Stakes, Colossal Destruction, but no weight to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"X-Men Apocalypse" is the next film after the clean slate we got from Bryan Singer's much acclaimed DOFP. The previous did a great job at hard resetting the franchise in order to puff some fresh and newfangled air for the franchise and remove some of the plot holes that have been bothering the X-Men franchise. But what Apocalypse does is be quite simplistic or average at best, we see a lot of landmarks and infrastructure getting destroyed and a whole new cast and much potential from Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse and yet it ends up being trite and feels flat and lackluster with just a couple of standout scenes.Before you rip this review like the rest of the reviews out there, there are some aspects to this film that emerge to at least save for the dreary undertones. Like the already much talked about Quicksilver, he gives the film a way to bring in some fun and hilarious moments and his scene in the Xavier house is the most well made and aesthetically stunning in the whole 2h and 24 min run time. Once again the scenes with Fassbender's Magneto are the most emotionally driven ones in the movie. It goes to show that he has one of the most striking character arcs that has ever been explored in the whole X-Men saga. The old characters like Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler reintroduced are spot on and have minimal flaws to say the least. In its core as well, is a film that doesn't take itself that seriously at times and realizes how campy the 80s was. So it's not fair to say that this film wasn't fun or enjoyable, or that it lacks any spirit of exuberance. For the film's flaws, it really is quite similar to what went wrong in Age of Ultron and if you liked that film then you'll probably like this film too. The film suffers with a villain that is average to really below average. For someone who is called Apocalypse, has lived for a thousand or more years and is really god damn powerful, he doesn't pass as menacing or even evoke a feeling of dread or trepidation at all whenever he becomes present on the screen. He also is literally just evil for the sake of being evil, sure he's maybe a whole lot of a better villain that Ultron (just maybe), but the parallelisms are still there, like the reason why he wants to destroy the world is because they both looked in the media and current and past world events and thought that it was all bull crap and wanted to make a new world. Part of the reason why he felt lackluster was that there was so much thrown in to the film and some even felt like it was just there for the sake of being there without really needing to be relevant to any character arc or subplot at all. You have the introduction of young Scott Summers who we see is not in control of his powers and that's about it so he goes to Xavier's School of Gifted Children, and then he meets Jean Grey in such a clichéd way. We also get to see Nightcrawler once again since X2 and he seems just thrown it there for the sake of being there too. After their introduction, they had to cut back to Magneto, then had to cut back to Apocalypse recruiting the horsemen as well. The reason why Days of Future Past worked was because they only had 1 then eventually 2 narratives to focus on. It was 1. what was happening in the past with Wolverine and the First Class cast. and 2. what was happening in the present as they were protecting Wolverine, and the second narrative wasn't given much focus until the near end of the film. Every subplot and character arc in that film felt relevant, while in this film it just didn't mesh well together. You also have inconsistencies with Apocalypse's powers, one moment you see him taking down a group of people with just a hand move. Then you see him calling out someone instead of just using his powers to kill everyone else in his way or literally rip out a wall to get to him himself. Instead Apocalypse's screen time and everyone else's screen time are wasted in favor of average sequences with no pay off in the final battle except for a show case of their powers, what they can do, and basically defeating the villain and saving the day because we all know that a handful of them survived in the end of Days of Future Past.Verdict: 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn Near Perfect ! Singer delivers with X-Men once again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely astonishing from start to finish, with very minor problems! This is one of the most excellent examples of a movie where you shouldn't listen to the critics' opinion. Apocalypse gives the perfect amount of story arc and character development that you've come to expect from the prequel franchise, as well as giving a perfectly balanced dosage of mind blowing and astonishing action and excitement, that is actually sometimes "beautiful" to watch. Finally, a Marvel villain done right! Whilst his reign of terror may feel a bit short-winded, in that he rises to power, does some stuff and then BOOM the X-Men finish him off, Apocalypse does manage to create himself as what I felt was a genuine threat to the protagonists and thus, you feel engaged throughout the development of the character and equally fascinated to see both his rise and fall. The casting of the young X-Men was in a word, solid. Most notably Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, who essentially outshines the other new students of Xavier's school. Jean probably goes through the greatest development of all the new characters and endeavours into one of the most central journeys of the X-Men franchise, in that you should allow yourself to be accepting of who you are and be true to yourself. The movie shines a light on this well, so that by the end of the film, Turner brilliantly executes everything you want to see in Jean Grey, primarily her awakening to her total badassery and courage and in the final showdown of the film, her collaboration with Xavier in defeating Apocalypse brings it all to life in the greatest pay off for the both the characters and the movie itself. Arguably this has made young Jean to be more compelling and strangely, a more developed character than older Jean from the original trilogy.I wouldn't be doing this movie justice without reviewing Quicksilver doing his thing. Arguably, Quicksilver's running scene in Apocalypse felt much more ambitious than the one in the previous movie, just because of how central it was to the story and that the makers of the movie are finally acknowledging of the fact that if he stuck around for the second half of Days Of Future Past, he would've been just a simple deus ex machina and solved all their problems too quickly. With his scene this time around, where Xavier's school is blowing up and he has to save everyone inside, it is genuinely as astonishing as it was originally in DOFP! Fantastically filmed, intense, and all round just well done. Whilst I will admit it is hard to determine whether his scene from DOFP is better than this one, just from a film making point of view, considering the one in DOFP seems to me like it was made from a much more practical stand point, it doesn't make the scene in Apocalypse any less credible. But forgive my ignorance, if I'm just totally wrong considering I don't know anything about the production of this scene.Wolverine's cameo is a prime example of how to create hype and anticipation, whilst not striding away from the movie you're currently trying to produce, it works perfectly. Simple yet effective. The way Wolverine leaves the movie is a fantastic way to have the audience asking questions and then is even more so topped off with the post credit scene. It might finally be a good stand alone Wolverine movie.Now there are indeed problems with the movie which I will now touch upon, briefly. Mystique is only as central to the X-Men prequels as she is, literally because she is played by Jennifer Lawrence. I have absolutely no problems with her as an actress or on a person level, love me a bit of J Law. But her Hollywood status as one of the biggest actresses in the world is getting in the way of time that could be spent showing or developing characters that need it. She keeps going on the same journey of wanting to be accepted in society, whilst the new characters are just showing it better. Her on screen struggle should be over by now and they're just trying to find new ways to keep it going, it should of been wrapped up in DOFP and been done with, though Lawrence always does a terrific job with what she's given, but it's just a bit of an inconvenience for the franchise now. Secondly, Magneto. Again, Fassbender, absolutely terrific and all that, the character's story of living in Poland and his family and all, is very interesting. However, I feel like Magneto is very much just used as a character that swaps between being "good" and "bad" whenever the story demands him to do so and it's irritating. I get that Apocalypse caught him at a bad moment in his life and that's why Magneto joins him, but if the same situation happened to Xavier and he was called upon by Apocalypse, would he have gone with him? No. Because he isn't considered a villain in the franchise, but Magneto is. As much as it is cool to see Magneto joining the X-Men to defeat Apocalypse at the end of the film, it's showing him to be vulnerable to anything and anyone and it doesn't make sense considering his character. Also, you know from older Magneto, he's just gonna turn back to being bad in the future anyway, so why should we feel anything towards this "heroic" and "character altering" moment?Overall, fantastic and in the days of modern cinema in which audiences except so much of all big franchise films, this one definitely delivers with an ideal runtime that feels nowhere near like what it actually is and a really satisfying execution that actually pretty much surpasses expectations. How has this only got a 7.7? The X-Men franchise stands strong, well done Singer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 because I would watch it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay so I had to review this movie because there are lots of different opinions. I say go watch it, you will not be disappointed because this movie is great, since the beginning of the movie you'll be amazed at the scenes and all the epic scenarios, you will be seeing new stuff and quality so you can forget about the in-a-hurry-due-date-last-minute-editing that is pretty easy to recognize and ruins allot of movies. It is all you could expect from a superhero movie plus it will have scenes you won't forget, it is the best than many inside its own genre (blockbuster superhero movie) and best of the last 2 x-men movies because I swear they really did a good job, it has something that we all appreciate from movies: that it was well thought from beginning to ending taking care of small details that if they didn't you would be thinking (I wouldn't have directed or added or cut that way), during the entire movie. Also like in any superhero movie it has lots of fanservice with decent effects and I gotta say Bryan Singer did well delivering it all to comics fans the way they wanted on this 3rd installment. I know lots of superhero movies are released lately these years and that can cause you to get tired of the same old hero-villain formula, let's face it they are all pretty much the same, they just change characters and add more action scenes and there's a point where your brain just gets numb! from all the similar explosions and fights and cheesy lines, but in this movie I assure you that won't happen or maybe a little because Hollywood doesn't know when to stop the action the thing is that they chose well what to put and not to put, or maybe was luck, anyway to conclude: if you like x men you will love this movie, if you like superpowers you will love this movie, if you expect quality watch it, deal with some flaws in acting and character background but that's it this is the end of my review. I thank the level of production and directing for delivering something that was great to watch for a superhero movie this year again... If only they would be constant with this in all superhero movies and not just rely on the story or that it is marvel, but oh well that's why I'm here to point out when they did a good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following the "X-Men: Days of Future Past", director Bryan Singer returns with "X-MEN: APOCALYPSE". It's not a bad movie but without the fun, the special effect and action of its predecessors. The too many characters are the film's main problem and I think this movie is made for the fans of the franchise. Unfortunately Bryan Singer proves that he no longer has any interesting X-Men stories to tell and maybe he must stop here. In few words, some of our favorite characters are wasted in this X-Men franchise. No surprises here, just a seen-it- before feeling. It is the weakest of Singer's recent trilogy, but not without its engaging moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, what Bryan Singer has done for the X-Men universe could be considered one of the greatest feats of story weaving I have seen in modern film. For over 15 years he has been creating stories about the same characters, put into similar situations, but finds a way to make each more memorable than the last. At the root of what I found impressive about Apocalypse is the character driven plot. While there was plenty of action in the second half to please the casual movie-goer, the first half was more intriguing to me, because I was given a chance to see these characters before they really became who we know them to be. With a new ensemble cast, characters are tweaked and fiddled with, enough to make them fresh, but not enough that they don't have the same soul as the characters in the original trilogy. In an altered time line, before the X-Men were officially formed, they face the most powerful mutant ever to walk the earth, known as Apocalypse. At times I didn't understand his motives for wanting to wipe out the human race, but the only thing that really mattered was that he would stop at nothing. In the early moments of the film, we are "introduced" to younger versions of characters, and the actors who portrayed these characters, especially Sophie Turner, did an outstanding job. I felt the same way towards these characters as I did to their older selves, and noticed the same flaws and strengths that help each throughout previous films. At times X-Men: Apocalypse seemed a little overlong, but I never felt that I was watching a pointless scene. The X-Men movies have never had quite the same level of hand to hand combat that I've seen in recent films such as Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but that was never intended to be the focus of the story. The focus of the story is the story itself. While I don't think it quite lived up to Days of Future Past, the strong, character driven plot, and Singer's effortless way of connecting time lines makes this a film I will definitely see again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I'm saying this but I have to say the critics are so wrong on this one, I don't know if they are bunch of Disney/Marvel Fanboys but this is so much better than the average Avengers crap they rate 90%.A much maturer take on Comic Book characters and story with a lot of focus on characters and their relationships rather than having an ensemble for the sake of it. You don't see Magneto, Xavier or any other throwing in a one-liner in the middle of fight, this movie is rock solid, though there are some weak points but nothing like they make it look like with RT score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie of all others movies of X-MEN. Cyclops finally appears in this movie. All the characters shows their powers and their greatness. I recommended this X-MEN, i hate the others, because they are not showing Cyclops. This movie reminds of the cartoon series in 90's. The music was also great. I hope to see more X-MEN movies like this one, THE FINAL BATTLE WAS BATTLE , and not like the latter movies. I know that has no relation to the comics unfortunately but it was good story. Tye Sheridan and Sophie was a perfect choice for Cyclops and Jean Grey roles. We see them involving to a relationship a yeah and talk to each other. Hope all fan of Cyclops, like me , to enjoy it !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid entry into the series, but not on par with its two excellent predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the latest installment in the X-Men franchise and the third film in the rebooted series. While not on par with its two excellent predecessors, I still found it to be a solid entry into the series. However, I recommend seeing the original two films first.In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakens from a millennial-long sleep and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen; Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Archangel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse plans to create a world for mutants only. It is up to the X-Men, lead by Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), to work together and prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.Filled with all of the explosive action and comic relief one would expect from the franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse unfortunately falls a bit short of being equally as good as the two great films that preceded it. The story would be hard to follow unless one has seen the previous films. With that said, I still really enjoyed the film for what it was. I particularly enjoyed the way that it expended on Magneto's story and showed how he just wants to be accepted for who he is, despite his mutant powers. I also really liked Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones) as the young Jean Grey. However, it is Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who steals the show in some of the funniest comic relief I have ever seen in a Marvel film. I can only recommend this film to those who have seen all of the previous X-Men Movies, if you haven't then I say watch them first.I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top X-Men movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REVIEW (Non-Spoiler): X-Men Apocalypse does justice to the X-Men franchise, the film is consistent with it's plot, performances and action. Oscar Issac has done a tremendous job as Apocalypse and he might the next best X-Men villain after Magneto. James McAvoy and Micheal Fassbender have done it again, the duo has good chemistry and balance.Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg did a great job of juggling around all these characters, giving all of them their moment to shine. The new actors added to this film work really well and portray their characters in a new light. There are places where the film could improve, this film has so much potential for greatness. The only drawback of this movie is to be released couple of weeks after Captain America: Civil War. With all that said, X-Men Apocalypse is a good, serious drama with right doses of action and humor. This might be in one of my top 5 X- Men movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another year, and another great X-men movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"X-men: Apocalypse" is the second movie directed by Bryan Singer, who back in 2014 also made the critically acclaimed "X-men: Days of Future Past". This year, fans and critics where exited to see if the movie could hold the high standards as its predecessor. To me, the movie delivered the way it should. For starters: Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr AKA Magneto ? wow, what a strong performance that guy brings to the screen. In the first act of the movie when we are introduced to the X-men cast, 10 years after their clash at Cuba, we meet a happy and peaceful Eric who now lives a normal life in Poland, settled down with both a wife and a daughter. Working at a steel factory (of course) Eric really tries to lay low since the world first took notice of him in "X-men: days of future past". However, an accident at work forces him to use his powers and reviling himself to his co-workers. Soon after begins the witch-hunt, and the rumours of a wanted mutant in Poland travels fast. It doesn't take long before Eric finds himself out in the woods surrounded by the Poland police and friends, accusing him of being the man who can bend metal. With the police holding his daughter as hostage, Eric chooses to give himself up in exchange for his daughter. All of us at the theatre who saw what happened next, we all felt a cold chill running down our spines. Eric's story managed to work as the most emotional part of the movie, and gave us enough reason to see why he would choose to join Apocalypse's army of terror and destruction, which makes him a good antagonist to follow. If we take a look at Oscar Isaac and his role as the Apocalypse, it really wasn't that impressing to me as I would have hoped. I don't know if it was because of all the make-up he had on, the robotic voice or the neutral facial expressions he would make in every scene, but it gave me a feeling that anyone could have played Apocalypse if they had to use the same amount of practical effects as Isaac. The Quicksilver slow- motion scene was amazing, and I actually think it topped that last slow- motion scene we saw of him back in Days of future past. The finale battle between Apocalypse's squad and the x-men was great. It was nice to see McAvoy as Xavier being the guy giving out some of the punches to the antagonist, instead of always being the one taking them. The fight sequence Xavier had in his mind was awesome, and he actually did better than Fassbender, who for the most part of that finale battle choose to isolate himself in a big metal bobble and not take part in any of the action. Overall, great performances from all the X-men cast. Nicolas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy did a solid job as always. It was great to see some new young faces who also delivered: Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler, Sophie Turner as Jean Grey and Tye Sheridan as Cyclopse also made themselves at home in the X- men franchise. The story was well executed, and Bryan Singer has managed to make yet another great X-men movie. And before I end ? what a great Wolverine scene, that really saved the second act of the movie for me and made it much more entertaining to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least We Can All Agree The Third One Is Always The Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you already know your film is gonna suck, do something to change it and not just whine about it within the film!First of all, a prequel should be what it claims to be. Preceding, previous, "what happened before". The storyline in this film diverges greatly from the canon of the original movies, in fact making some of this events impossible.The cast is made up of brilliant actors. Unfortunately none really get to show it because animation and special effects and action have now taken over this franchise as well. There is not a single scene where Fassbender or McAvoy could have lived up to their potential. Evan Peter's was purely comic relief and his appearance just a cheap copy of his last one in Days Of Future Past.The X-Men movies always had a wonderful depth to it, mutations being representative of any "otherness" in our society. Now this film about "false Gods" feels like American anti-Islam propaganda. Very disappointing!And last but not least, product placement ruined what was left of the film. Hank McCoy says he made special glasses for Cyclops yet we see the big fat lettering of RAY BAN in every single shot of Scott that follows. The same goes for the scenes that advertised Coca Cola, Michelin,... it was almost as horrible as in Jurassic World.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear, where do I start?You would imagine with the success of X-Men Days of Future Past they couldn't go wrong with this one. Sadly, no. They did go wrong.The movies starts of okay, paced itself well, introducing characters. But after awhile you seem to find yourself lost within the movie due to all the characters being jumbled up. The focus of the movie got lost halfway. And from that point out onward, the pace of the movie felt really draggy without any real movie tension in between. The fighting scenes were...meh at best. The could have done more with the fighting choreography. Some of the lines in the movie are really cringy, especially the jokes. The CGI for the most part of the movie were wonderful, but there are some parts that looked cheap and tacky - as if they didn't really care about the production value. To conclude, it was alright.</fullReview>

I've seen people claim that it pushes too much into the movie, and even tho there is a lot going on it's done in a coherent way that makes sense.The movie in terms of scale is incredible. You really get the feeling that these mutants are essentially gods. It has a huge emotional heart to it with serious tear jearkers at some points, yet also manages to squeeze in great humor and subtle references to fans of the comics. (I won't reveal what they are but it's pretty big) All I can say is that in terms of emotion, action, scale, and tension this movie is by far the best in the franchise. I mean they are facing essentially a god and it's hard to comprehend how they will ever manage to defeat him. Just go out and watch it it's deferentially worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

Despite the feeling that the series may have run its course, the current helping does not in the least bit disappoint. The themes are obviously not original ( can they ever be in this genre?) , and the audience may at some point in time may experience some deja vu , but it does not act as a dampener.The film makers cash in on Wolverine's popularity yet again by including a cameo, much like in the previous movies .

		<shortDescription>More of the same from Singer. Whether that's a bad thing or not....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a name like Apocalypse you've got to expect big things. The true definition of the word expects to exhibit destruction of biblical proportions and that's exactly what we have been promised here. Our gang of misfits are up against the first mutant that ever existed and the most powerful, or so they say. Imagine people's surprise when pre-release set photography showed their supposed ultra-baddie looking like Ivan Ooze from the Power Rangers Movie. Under the heavy prosthetics lies the superb acting talent of Oscar Isaac, a man with enough grit to pull off a truly menacing antagonist but, thanks to their overzealous make-up team, the movie took a worrying turn before it even had a chance to hit the screens. Bryan Singer announced that this is a 'monster of a movie' and that audiences have not seen 'this level of destruction in any previous X-Men movie'. That may be the case but has the monster he created come back to destroy him? We catch up with our heroes seven years after the events of Days of Future Past. Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy's (Nicholas Hoult) School for Gifted Youngsters is thriving with new editions; a pale and lifeless Jean Grey (Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner), a lovable and creepy Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and the all- American reject Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan). Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is now a mercenary, picking up stray mutants who are being abused by humans and sending them into hiding, a far cry from the slippery assassin given to us from Rebecca Romijn in the original trilogy. She's a hero in the eyes of other mutants and greatly admired, especially from an impressionable Storm, played here by Alexandra Shipp sporting a pretty cool Mohawk. Unfortunately for Shipp, her Mohawk is all that's cool about her as she barely gets the opportunity to shine. As the great Deadpool once said, 'These timelines are so confusing.' Thanks to the events of Days of Future Past, this movie is set with an alternate timeline giving Singer the green light to reintroduce characters who existed in the previous movies. Olivia Munn plays Psylocke, a mutant who is clearly a lot older in 1983 than her first appearance (played by Mei Melancon) in The Last Stand which was based in present day. Ben Hardy received a lot of attention in the press for his portrayal of Angel (mainly because he looks cool), a role taken by a Ben Foster who, at the time, is younger than the likes of Storm and Jean Grey. And Raven is a good guy now! Who knew?! The reintroduction of the prominent characters in the series immediately becomes premise for constant nods to the original trilogy, something Singer was annoyingly guilty of in Days of Future Past. He's not necessarily doing it because he likes to blow his own horn but because he finds out what works for his movie and milks it for all it's worth. Quicksilver is a prime example of this; Evan Peters stole the show last time with his quick quips and hilarious slow-mo action sequence aptly played along to 'Time in a Bottle' by Jim Croce. Well, he's back with an equally hilarious, extended scene and a few more lines this time around. However, after the initial reintroduction, it's almost like Singer doesn't know what to do with him and what seems like a prominent story line fades into the background with the rest of the "new editions".That brings us to the main man himself, Apocalypse. Singer's decision to put Isaac in a suit rather than have a fully rendered CGI version of the character (like Marvel's Thanos) is so that he can fully interact with other characters on screen but the size of his character makes him less than impressive. It's not just the fact that he looks ridiculous, they don't impact on what makes him such a serious threat. Apocalypse existed as a God amongst men for centuries before some of his followers buried him alive in a tomb, only to be rudely awakened by a snooping Moira McTaggart (Rose Byrne returning to her role from First Class). He has the ability to transport his body into other mutants and with that picking up their powers along the way. The idea of Apocalypse should be terrifying but what we're given is another unimpressive, run-of-the-mill, bad guy set up to be defeated by an untrained team of kids and a pep- talk.On a positive note, while we all complain about movies that contain too much CGI, in reality that is why we watch these movies, so that we can see what cannot be done with average special effects. X-Men are certainly good at that and you will not be disappointed with action sequences. Any fan of the series will enjoy this movie for the gratuity of it and they have certainly spent money and time building their apocalyptic World with some exceptional visuals.On the way into the cinema a friend of mine told me that he was, 'a bit superhero' d out' and at the moment I'd be inclined to agree with him (Gasp! Shock! Horror!). What we expect as an audience to is to be entertained in new and exciting ways but if all they can do is churn out the same movie with a slightly different cast then, in that respect, audiences are going to lose interest. X-Men: Apocalypse is not as bad as the critics make out if you can accept that this is a comic book movie made for the sole purpose of pure, unadulterated, nonsensical entertainment and you can look past Oscar Isaac's horrendously silly costume. Ivan Oopocalypse. Sorry, not sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An X-Men movie that needs a look in the mirror, or a better editor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film itself is good, though storyline minimalist and motivations rabbit-from-a-hat style, it is 'saved' by a few good (though inconsistent) performances, and classic comic-book visuals. My favourite part in this one was too-cool-for-school Quicksilver, who gains a little depth (though considering what usually is at stake in these movies, the comic relief is usually a deeper role than meets the eye.-Before I go any further, I'll just say my opinion on the film is basically like comparing the original X-Men scene of Eric in the camp, with the new remade version: I think the original is vastly superior, especially emotionally, if only because the 'comic book pretense' of the new approach is holding them back from a heartfelt depth-My feeling on this is that they don't always follow through on a good idea - I think the Rogue version was better as it bridged the original relationships when they had to help each other, though the payoff with Jean's return was equivalent but not as connected to the desperate situation.Seeing how the timeline 'returned' was one of the biggest emotional payoffs for fans obviously, having seen characters die one by one fighting in the future (twice), but Apocalypse just doesn't pack the same depth. The emotional truths or even character archs are quite bare in this one, with most performances and concepts falling flat (even the actors seem to be distancing themselves from the storyline - Jennifer's freedom fighter is stale, and Fassbender's conjured-up life is shallow to the point where seeing him in the iron mill is more interesting than having a family.The film's main motivation is to see how the characters would react with a major villain strolling into-shot, and in that regard the movie was a success - X-Men as a series has a lot to give in terms of storyline chemistry, but of course this needs to be given the care and love of it's predecessors. The storyline is weaker than First Class (having little thought for collateral damage or even civilian representation), but Oscar as EnSabahNur was a successful enough distraction from what was lacking in shallow/ thin character weaving. For example Storm showing up next to the bad guy being little more than a shell of a person (contrary to the assumption of being in Africa and using her powers to manipulate the weather as in the traditional character), and Nightcrawler inexplicably being (yes an emo) included in some ridiculous fight club - which if done right could have been a successful reference to Logan in X-Men, but too many fumbles and shallow details make this fall flatter than Spider-Man's wrestling antics.Finally - the best part of this film is the simple continuity of basic chemistry and roles formed in previous films Ultimately the film could have done with using details from past outings to enhance it's emotional focus and flow within the film (the Auschwitz scene was a good mention here, which helped boost the essential theme of the film - power and domination, the return of Moira's memory was a solid emotional reference, all paling to the flashback of the origin of Charles and Eric's friendship). However it lacked the ability to invoke the set-ups presented in Future's Past which were particularly relevant - the 'lost' future that is essentially wiped away now, involving Jean etc and the emotional journey Charles went on in light of the phoenix saga would have made a brilliant few seconds in enhancing the mind-battle. They seems to be taking the genre into a more skin-deep direction, which disappoints after the last film especially. Some real headway has to be made in character development (which it does touch on in Jean's nightmare scene etc, but the fact remains that this is not a comic-book, you can't gloss over everything and hope the audience holds onto something flimsy when it doesn't effect other areas - the phoenix and 'unleash the power' is an undercut to whatever the previous film achieved). Whatever happens next, they just need time to assemble the pieces properly (they're only human after all, heh), allowing characters to step into a reality more than seemingly 'welcome to Xavier school, care to try the danger-room?' type approach. As long as regulars like Nic Hoult and (duh) James McAvoy are around, this shouldn't be a problem. For the next film, I think they should actually consider doing another future-based movie, in the same region as Deadpool seemingly is - with Cable etc) - as after such massive destruction and unmasking of 'these guys are mutants' that Professor X tried hard to prevent in the past, it's only natural that a witch-hunt would be accelerated in this timeline. I would suggest that a storyline similar to X-Men 2's mind-control be a good stepping stone for character chemistry - perhaps like the Ultimate Alliance 2 game's nanites etc.</fullReview>

The movie was not so good match compared to its predecessor Days of Future Past however the actors gets engaged themselves very well (including new starcast, Sophie Turner, Tye Sheridan). All the thematic interest and character dimension that's defined the best of this series falls away for a conventional action display. The final battle sequel was not so convincing. Instead of using 3D graphics, Singer used wide shots for every X-man battle. Overall, the movie was not matching its previous films, however Singer manages to still make it watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book-wise, X-Men has always been my favorite. I was introduced to them at a very young age and have always been a fan. Movie-wise, X-Men are starting to fade. Still better than most movies but no longer able to keep up with the high bar set by other movies in the MCU. There are only so many huge and cataclysmic events that can be foiled before it becomes routine. As a quote I read once stated: "If miracles happened everyday they wouldn't be miracles." The nemesis of choice in this movie was Apocalypse and his goal: world domination (of course). Along with Apocalypse we were introduced to some new characters (Psylocke and Jubilee) and reintroduced to a couple of other characters (Storm, Angel, Cyclops, Jean Gray and Nightcrawler). The point in showing any character should be for displaying his/her skill set. Since the majority of the characters had already been seen at one time or another between X-Men (back in 2000) and X-Men: Apocalypse there were no real surprises with what the characters could do. If any character made me giddy it would've been Quicksilver and the demonstration of his abilities.Besides the rehashing of characters the story wasn't that compelling. Apocalypse claims to be God and wants to dominate the Earth. He frequently references himself as a deity and refers to mutants as his children. It was overly dramatic and unoriginal. I don't know if this movie is the last of the X-Men before being laid to rest but if it isn't; they need to dig deep for the next installment.</fullReview>

I have a few problems with it but in general it was a huge surprise for me with how much I enjoyed it. X-men movies have always had a formula with following a subliminal message of civil rights and discrimination. This movie doesn't follow in those footsteps and tends to be more of just a regular superhero movie. Nevertheless it still can compete right up along side with Civil War for how entertaining and emotional it was.X-men Apocalypse although less mature, doesn't have the greatest structure with plot, and has a few boring scenes. This movie still manages to be good with its amazing characters. Check out my video for a more in depth look at it. No Spoilers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand that not everyone is going to enjoy this movie, and that's perfectly fine by me. Not everyone has the same taste. I'm not gonna defend this movie either. Sure, I might be some kind of x- men film fanboy, but I can understand that it's just a dumb movie. So, I'm not sure if I like this movie a lot more than most people because I didn't watch any of the trailer, and I hadn't really been told anything about it ever since it was first announced, but it doesn't matter to me. There were good qualities and bad qualities to this movie, as I'm sure there is with every X-men movie. Whether or not you agree with my views isn't my problem. I enjoyed the movie enough to at least give it a positive rating. So here's what I like about it. The acting was good like every other movie in the series. Even if the effects in this movie aren't as good as the other movies in the series, none of the CGI looked awful except in the first scene of the movie. The story was something I was down for, and I never felt bored or turned off even if the script drags at parts. All I can basically say other than that, is that it's an enjoyable movie over all, and I'd watch it again just because I enjoyed it. However, there where some problems... *Spoilers* So, the X-men movies do a pretty good job of standing out as their own movies. You know they're all connected in the same universe, but they stand out as stand alone movies most the time. Apocalypse is probably the most shoe horned of the franchise. Unfortunately, this movie does show a lot of flashbacks to first class, and references other movies in the franchise. Why? First class is a movie that stands alone, why can't you too? During the first half, Magneto has a wife and daughter. Am I the only one who thought this was also shoe horned in? Killing them off is what you should have expected, because we need Magneto to be the villain again somehow. To the movies credit, I did feel a slight emotion for magneto when it this happened, because Micheal Fassbender did a good job handling the emotions, but it feel apart pretty quick, and I honestly forgot about that scene. The scene with wolverine was alright. The whole time I felt it was shoe horned in, like a bunch of other things in this movie. This is a shoe horn movie, with a bunch of your favorite actors in it, it would make scene for it to have the ratings it does. Anyways, that's just how I personally feel about it. If I were in a room with a group of friends, and we were deciding what movie to watch, I wouldn't suggest this movie, but if one of my friends suggested it, I'd be down. Why not. It's worth seeing if you love the X-men movies, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. 6/10.</fullReview>

But, while I sat and found myself being entertained and enjoying the two and half hour experience, it won't matter over time. Those looking for something new and unattached to any franchise aren't looking for a film like this. Those who find the X Men franchise to be on stable footing, and don't feel that it has worn out it's welcome yet, will feel satisfied with this last X Men ensemble film for a while. Bryan Singer has an adroit approach to this X Men comic book movie genre. He can create very human perspectives to fantasy stories. If there is one great flaw to this film, is that he created a moment that was too human, too raw in emotion to overcome. And that is early in the film when we find that Magneto had settled down with a wife and daughter, Minor Spoiler Only to see them murdered in front of his eyes, destroying his life,End Minor SpoilerAnd finds that destiny cannot escape him. For the audience, that moment where Magneto decides mankind is out to destroy him, is such a human moment, it is hard to transition to the comic book tone from that point on. Tonal shifts in a movie should not be taken lightly. Again, this is a part of the reason the film feels lackluster after the first act. Oddly, no one is to blame for this reaction. It is the same reaction I had to the Hobbit films coming out after Lord of the Rings. And the same reaction to seeing Terminator 5. The same tropes that are canon with these franchises have little new to offer, and is harder to excite the audience. I have always liked the slick production design, and have embraced the younger cast with the X Men films recently. The scripts are smart, the human conflicts are well executed, and the action scenes are well paced. So there is nothing to fault this outing, and I predict over time (assuming they will give the franchise a needed rest) that this installment will feel right in place with the others. As for the longer running time, again the pacing kept the story rolling with enough momentum to forgive going over the two hour mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems to get a lot of hate from critics,and I can understand why.I am a huge X men fan,and this movie doesn't quite live up to the quality of the previous one.Its a good movie with an outstanding cast,but overloaded action take away the focus.This movie is long,very very long,about 2.5 hours.The villain,En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse,is portrayed nicely by Oscar Isaac,who is barely recognisable under loads of make-up.The story is not really that good,but son movies are saved by their talented cast.The actors are bot given enough time or development,and the focus is always on the action and a totally clichéd villain.A God who wants to make the world better and/or destroy it totally with the help of Magneto,done nicely by Michael Fassbender.Jean incinerating Apocalypse by using 'the full extent of her powers is like...God.If you did it before,maybe some of the runtime would have been reduced,huh Jean? This movie passes the bar by the skin of its teeth.They passed this time,but we're clearly reaching the end of the line in this franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews unless i have a great grade to give or a very awful, but for the first time i decided to write a review along with an average note. Why? For starters the movie isn't bad, its pretty darn entertaining actually, has some very emotional moments, some awesome action scenes, some great cinematography and music, some quicksilver, and it was hella ambitious in scale, and it actually was. So with all that said, why only average? Well, Days of future past is more than a good superhero flick, is an amazing film, everything about that movie was good, what Apocalypse tries is to be bigger than DOFP, and while it is it just doesn't work. DOFP felt just so much important even tho there wasn't a godlike ancient being trying to eradicate the human race. The movie is great, go watch it, but i just hope they try to make movies as good as DOFP, thats exactly where the bar should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie very much, although it wasn't quite as good as I expected. Still, it was time well worth spent, and it is a movie I will certainly be purchasing when it comes out on Blu-ray. It had action, humour, and drama. I thought that the story was good, and the characters solid. Quicksilver was my favourite, which isn't a surprise as he was in the comics as well. I didn't think that this movie was as good as "Captain America: Civil War" or "Deapool", but I did like it more than "Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice". Not that I didn't like that movie, I just think that Marvel do a better job, whether it is with Disney or Fox. If you like super-hero movies please see this movie, I don't think that you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men always has an edge over the competition by utilizing the rich relationship between Professor X and Magneto, also diving into the nature of mutant as the struggle for acceptance. All of these elements are still present, but they feel watered down to accommodate an omnipotent villain, which ironically a gimmick used by other superheroes and one the X-Men was superior of. It follows many characters this time around, and even though it's a chance to showcase these champions, it may a bit too much. Focus shifts between the younger members such as Jean Grey and Cyclops, veteran heroes and new rising antagonist. It can be a bit hectic at times, but luckily the acting prowess brings them to next level.James McAvoy and the older actors provide already established presences, a special credit for Michael Fassbender for one of the better performances in the movie. Younger ones deliver a commendable works as well. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey has the fitting look, she appears to have immense power, yet still restrained and doubtful. Also, the fan favorite Evan Peters as Quicksilver is always a welcomed addition.The problem lingers in the repetitive theme, both from previous X-Men movies and other superhero flicks. Many of the scenes feel rehearsed, for example, the secret facility infiltration, new secret life or sudden death. These feel as though they are deja vu and the way they are presented is all too similar, perhaps for nostalgia effect, but if that's the case the old feel is not a boon for the movie.Furthermore, some of the characters inevitably have less screen time. The antagonist side relies too much on the Apocalypse, and the supposed Horsemen are not beyond ordinary henchmen. This is a bad news for Storm, a key member of X-Men, who seems just dragged around from scene to scene. The rest are just there for one of two cool sequences without having much dialogues. Apocalypse himself is the typical god complex villain, he might be overwhelming at first, but that effect will wear off. However, Magneto is still the quintessential antagonist, although he has the second seat this time. All the set-up eventually brings many colossal showdowns, the movie is good at this, Quicksilver and Nightcrawler will definitely be a crowd-pleaser.For all the doomsday talk, it treads the path of many similar heroes. Still, the culmination of characters and capable actors playing them, as well as smooth animation, keep X-Men a collectively presentable gallery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gotta hand it to Bryan Singer. He knows the subject matter like it is the back of his hand. You may be watching a full-on superhero romp about mutants, but you can also feel it in your bones that the movie transcend to a different plane subversively. Just substitute mutation with the current hot-button issues like xenophobia and racism you will see a very different movie. Singer understands ostracism and social prejudice so well that his X-Men movies feel like veiled shout-outs of misunderstood people. In X-Men: Apocalypse, he has made another entry in the franchise that has brawn and brains and a whole lot of dazzle. I had a feeling that I wasn't just watching a summer popcorn movie but something relevant and important. The script is whip-smart and manages to juggle so many characters, both old and new. In one funny moment it takes a clever dig at Brett Ratner's abomination. The characters have link to the past and the future. There is pathos of the Shakespearean level and tragedy of the Greek magnitude. This is yet again a Defcon One "End of the Earth" scenario with the Adam of all Mutants, Apocalypse. The chap may be buried under a ton of blue makeup and housed in a blue strait-jacket, but his quiet menace shines through. This is a villain with a capital latter "V", well-established, religious connotations all around and his motivations thoroughly well-drawn. The action set-pieces are well done with no hint of repetitiveness. I mean we have all seen Magneto and Prof X strut their stuff but it never feels old with the tweaks incorporated. For example, Gotta love how they up the ante with the Quicksilver scene, easily one of the highlights again. If I do have some quibbles I would have to say the runtime could have been shorten (I really felt the full 2h 24min) and the final climatic smack down is exhausting to watch (it felt like it will never end). I have read some of my favourite critics' reviews and nearly all of them didn't dig the movie. Their reasons are exactly the polar opposite of what actually worked for me. This isn't as effortless and fun as X-Men: Days of Future Past, but it comes real close. 3.5 / 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The x-men movies evolved over the years, and that's a good thing. There is so much potential left en there is so much more to tell. If you have not seen X: First Class (2011) and X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), I highly recommend to see both before watching this one.The movie starts a little bit weird, with Egypt people taking of their masks and there is one guy who grunts weird. I thought, no please don't let this high budget movie be filled with bad actors. And luckily, besides Alexandra Shipp, it wasn't.X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) has little action sequences in the first half of the movie. The first half it is about building up a story what leads in the second half to all the action we are used of this kind of movies. I was afraid the movie would feel a bit cartoonish, but that was not the case.From all the characters I like Evan Peters who played Quicksilver. This guy should get his own Quicksilver movies. He is so hilarious. It is a shame his relationship with Magneto did not have a satisfied ending. But maybe that will come in the next movie. At least I hope so.Good movie, worthy to be in the line of the x-men movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of how mutants become stronger, how they unite and betray one another in a fight against an ancient Egyptian God that aims to destroy the world and rebuild from ashes."X-Men: Apocalypse" is filled with my favourite stars, and I have been looking forward to watching it. The story is a bit slow paced because there is a lot of detail to be told. How each mutant comes about, and how they befriend, familiarise and cooperate with each other is told. There is a lot of background story, and at times I think the story could be a bit faster.Fortunately, the film is filled with very good visual effects, such as the scene of the College exploding. That scene showcases the great visual effects achieved by the team, and provides comic relief in an otherwise tense scene.For the post credit scene, there is a bit of a pause between the end of the credits and the post credit scene, which made the cinema goers wondering if they sat through the credits for nothing. After watching the scene, that thought did cross my mind, unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-men:Gods from Egypt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the critics from Rotten Tomatoes left the movie in the first half hour or were just jerking off to Storm. She was hot though. Not going to lie.X-men Apocalypse. Third in the prequel series. So the whole scenario takes place soon after the events of DC. Humans and Mutants have started to bond together whereas in rural parts, mutants are still hated upon and are used as circus freaks. The advent of the 1st mutant known as En Sabah Nur has put the existence of humans in jeopardy and it's center are the X-men and the Four recruits of Apocalypse.The story is fairly simple. A dark mutant who has transferred his consciousness from time to time and has wreaked havoc when ever humans grew stronger than the mutants. This time he is back again and he goes on to recruit his four followers so that he can get back to being the ruler of the world. The only people who are going to stop him are the X-men. So on one side Apocalypse begins to recruit Storm, Angel, Psylocke and finally Magneto. He enhances their powers to make them almost invincible. On the other side we are introduced to the ones who are going to become the X-men. I'll give it points for not stopping to show how each of them are recruited. Everything keeps flowing in a parallel time-line. Apocalypse comes to know about Xavier and his power and he understands that he is his next vessel because through him he can control humans and mutants alike.The pacing of the movie is not very fast to be true. It takes a lot of time to bring us to the midst of things. I had a major problem with the placement of the humorous scenes and the sad scenes. One of them was the death of Alex Summers. We get this next awesome QuickSilver scene and right after that Alex is dead. The humour doesn't seep in and that is why we can't exactly sympathize with Scott because his brother has just died. One of the emotionally strong scenes was the death of Erik's family. The scene was also reminiscent of a scene from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' but obviously more riveting. Plot points like Stryker shows up to take away Mystique, Beast, Moira and Silver seemed a little forced so that we can get the cameo of the Wolverine and yes, so that they can get a jet. One of the most down-points of the movie was Apocalypse. His presence wasn't as deadly as it should have been. The apocalypse of the world took way too much time. If he had made the four horsemen to go to different parts of the world(because he travel from one place to another) and made them cause destruction that would have posed a much more of a challenge for the X-men.Acting wise almost every one is on their A-game. Now we have another funny man on the X-men, NightCrawler. He was aptly characterized. In the comics he was always quipping, but not very smart things. He really stole the show. Sophie Turner more or less plays a mutant Sansa. I liked the new Scott. Olivia Munn hardly talked in the whole movie but she looked great. The new Storm will be good in the upcoming movies. Jennifer Lawrence is Raven Everdeen(hope that is self explanatory). Returning actors like McAvoy and Fassbender and Hoult are amazing as usual. Fassbender a bit more especially because of that scene in the forest. Angel's character was forgettable and he died too, so that's that. Stan Lee doesn't have a funny cameo this time. Oscar Isaac was tremendously under used. I know he is a great actor and he plays negative roles very well but this just didn't click for me. Hugh Jackman will be missed considering that cameo. Hope we could have had at least 10 more movies of him as Wolverine.The movie is not anything epic because the standards are just getting higher and higher. It definitely propagates the plot forward but doesn't satisfy considering it is almost an end-of-the-world movie. First Class also had the destruction of the world in it's center and it had more stakes and more heart than here where there is a God trying to cause destruction. I am happy that the new lot of actors portraying the iconic characters from our childhood will do it justice and hope upcoming sequels solidify the X-men universe better</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I am a fan of X- Men series this one disappoints me a little bit especially after Days Of Future Past which was by far the best X - Men movie and one of the best comic book movies . Apocalypse was more menacing in trailer than in the movie because he doesn't do anything in this film rather than giving powers to his Horsemen . First half of the movie is pretty slow and I think that they went too far to build up hype for Apocalypse which he doesn't stand up to . Its the second half and Quicksilver that made us to watch the movie . Quicksilver is the best in this movie I mean all his scenes are well made especially his entry . All the actors did their job perfectly , its their roles that I think were short. Like Four Horsemen should have been more terrifying but they didn't do anything except Magneto . Second half is definitely worth a watch for visuals and characters because everyone gets to shine and has its moment in second half and now I come to the cameo , yes The Wolverine , his scene were very good and he was shown as the animal as he is in comics , more ruthless and more dangerous than he has ever been in movie which I think was very good for him because its what Wolverine is . All thing this movie does is that it is very good to eye but nothing exceptional . You can sure watch it but with not so much expectation but I'll say watch this because of Quicksilver because he is the only one who can make you enjoy this movie .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Third Movie's Not Always the Worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Days of Future Past played on our nostalgia by giving us the original cast back, Apocalypse holds the trend by introducing younger versions of them. Jean Grey, Scott Summers, Ororo Munroe, and Kurt Wagner are back, but as teenagers. The core of Xavier, Erik, Raven, and Hank return once again to keep the 'preboot' foundation alive, while Quicksilver, Moira, Alex Summers, and the younger Stryker return as well. And yes, Wolverine too, although in a slightly extended use to his nod in First Class.Unfortunately, Apocalypse doesn't spend a particularly great amount of time introducing brand new mutants and characters. I was really excited to finally see a live-action Jubilee given her long overdue spotlight. I remember her fondly from the 90s cartoon. Unfortunately she's little more than a cameo used to make sure you know you're in the 80s. There's also Psylocke and yet another Angel (I've lost count now), but neither of them are played as anything more than bodyguards, which is pretty much all the Four Horsemen are. Furthermore it kind of quashed the surprise and tension when you pinpointed exactly which horsemen would betray Apocalypse before the movie even started. The lack of development also unfortunately extends to the hyped return of Moira from First Class. Once we hit the third act, I found myself wondering why on earth she was reintroduced in the first place, as she holds absolutely no use beyond a small comical exchange with Xavier early on. For some reason that gives her a right to tag along, where she just sits there and does literally nothing the whole time.Apocalypse himself was a bit of a two-sided apple. On one side, there's no denying Oscar Isaac's ability to play the villain really well. He offers probably the strongest Super-Villain this year (which isn't saying a lot compared to the super-lacklustre Ajax, Lex Luthor, and Zemo we've had so far). Isaac has a way of bringing a godly gravitas and sense of real threat to Apocalypse which was impressive. It was sorely needed because physically, Apocalypse is a bit of a letdown. As talented as Isaac is, he just isn't tall or bulky enough. It felt a little off when Magneto looks him in the eye and they're as tall as each other. The somewhat tacky make-up job doesn't do him any favours either.The rest of the cast do admirably as well though. James McAvoy's Xavier sounds a little lazy and not bothered during the film's opening monologue, but he re-engages afterwards and brings back that young Xavier that could almost be a young Patrick Stewart. Jennifer Lawrence is on par with her previous outings, neither showing improvement nor any sign of slacking. Most the praise belongs to the new cast members. Tye Sheridan does a pretty good job of the young Scott Summers who's just coming to terms with his uncontrollable lazer eyes, and Sophie Turner is a perfect fit for Jean Grey (although her American accent sounds a bit off at times). Kodi Smit- McPhee is completely unrecognisable as Nightcrawler though. Hats off to him. Obviously though, and for the third time in a row, Michael Fassbender is the star of the show. Magneto is again offered arguably more character development than any other character, and Fassbender puts it to good use. Time and again he is the highlight of the movie.Apocalypse is probably one of the most action-orientated X-Men movies around, certainly the most action packed that Bryan Singer has personally directed. He took on quite a large bite for Apocalypse though, requiring an epic and bombastic approach to the fight scenes. Apocalypse is pretty much a god after all. I can't say it's fully successful, as there weren't any particularly memorable clashes (unlike Nightcrawler's attack on the White House in X2, for example), but what we get certainly does the job, without any of this silly zoom-in and shake the camera crap blockbusters are getting increasingly riddled with. It was also really cool to see the unstoppable Apocalypse tackled more than just physically, as Xavier takes him on mentally while everyone else is hitting him with all they've got. It finally takes a hint of what's to come to finally beat him, but I won't spoil it.The effects are hit and miss just like Apocalypse himself. I've mentioned his make-up and costume, so I won't talk about that again, but there is a lot of CGI here. Some of it works, some of it doesn't. Smaller, more intimate uses are great, like people being swallowed up by walls or Apocalypse's growth in the mental battle against Xavier, but the grander moments are let down by a lack of clarity. For example, there's a moment just before the third act where Apocalypse disintegrates a city in order to build a giant pyramid. The screen just gets filled with indiscernible dust for a few minutes as you try to figure out exactly what's going on. It's unfortunately not an isolated incident.Apocalypse was a worthy and enjoyable addition to the X-Men franchise. I look forward to seeing the younger versions of these classic characters return once again, but beyond Wolverine 3 and the Deadpool movies, I feel pretty happy to leave the X-Men movies here, if it comes to that. It wasn't the best the franchise has to offer, but it was far from the worst as well. Thankfully it's self-fulfilling, tongue-in-cheek prophecy of "the third movie is always the worst" didn't come to pass. I give Apocalypse a respectable 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame, I was highly anticipating this movie but I left the theater...less than thrilled with the result. We begin the story with a quick backstory on Apocalypse. The story then shifts forward to the 80s where we get a lot of different introductions to new mutants, and old. Magneto is revealed to be living a normal life but his subplot felt unnecessary to the story, even though a great scene resulted in it. Xavier is finally settling in with the school and Mystique is running around being a hero (huh?). Once Apocalypse resurfaces, he begins to recruit his 4 horsemen and attempt his plan to take over the world. The rest of the film follows. This movie features some great action, an interesting villain, and a surprising amount of violence. So why didn't I love it? Well..We're introduced to SO many different characters all at once that there wasn't really anytime spent on actually developing them. Funnily enough, we got most of the character development from those we already know so much about. The writers try to connect a lot of what is happening in the movie to the sequels but it doesn't really work when there are already so many inconsistencies. I enjoy Jennifer Lawrence but Mystique leading the X-men seems ridiculously out-of-character. Sophie Turner seems really off as Jean Grey and Tye Sheridan didn't really sell me as Cyclops, then again I blame the writing for that one. Psylocke, Storm, and Angel, all seemed replaceable and weren't even remotely memorable since they feel thrown into the story. Quicksilver was great but his storyline twist felt a little tacked on. A lot of the comedy fell flat and was forced at times. The romance subplots felt underdeveloped and their is a serious lack of chemistry between Cyclops and Jean.In the end, I just wasn't impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With it being the 9th film to date in the series, and the fourth superhero film to come out in 2016, X-Men: Apocalypse had a difficult task in keeping the genre and franchise fresh. While it struggles with some of the same problems as most of these superhero ensemble pieces do, Apocalypse serves as both a satisfying conclusion to the second X- Men trilogy and an exciting beginning to the next chapter.Bryan Singer returns to the franchise once again to direct, as do James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Evan Peters, and Rose Byrne. Newcomers include Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler, and Alexandra Shipp as Storm. A strong point in all of the X-Men entries has been the acting, and Apocalypse is no different. McAvoy and Fassbender perfectly portray Professor X and Magneto as the two opposing viewpoints to the mutant situation. Unfortunately, they don't get as much screen time together as the two previous entries, but that makes their scenes together that much more special.As far as the newbies go, while they weren't the central focus of the films, I really connected to Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Nightcrawler provides some comedic relief and Angel doesn't really serve any purpose in the film, but Scott and Jean were handled well, especially the ladder. Being that Sophie Turner didn't completely prove herself till the last few seasons of Game of Thrones, I was skeptical of her going in. But Turner did a nice job at balancing the immense power of her character while giving her a relatable appeal that made Famke Janssen's performance so great.The introduction of Apocalypse was also a tough sell. Adapting the character from his comic-book counterpart is one thing, but I was pleased with how smoothly his origin fit into the film. It's hard finding a villain that can one up Magneto on a scene to scene basis, but Oscar Isaac's titular villain does just that. Perhaps seeing a bit more of him would have served the story more, but his short and significant scenes with each of his four horseman were enough to sell me on his ominous presence.I think some of the faults of the film involve the overabundance of characters the film decides to focus on. Every X-Men film is an ensemble piece, but 'Apocalypse' tries its hardest to do service to so many characters, and sometimes it can be a little messy. I don't think there are even scenes I really disliked, but there are some that feel unnecessary. Overall, the film succeeds at so many levels it's hard to be disappointed in the outcome. The X-Men films have always been one to pull and tug on emotions that other superhero films and blockbusters fail to do, and 'Apocalypse' definitely does that. For all of the explosions and disaster that Apocalypse causes, it still feels very personal to the X-Men, and I can certainly appreciate that type of storytelling. A little bit of extra care to the script and direction will lead to a much tighter film next time around.+Sophie Turner's Jean Grey+The newbies are handled well+Introduction of Apocalypse+Fassbender and McAvoy are once again powerhouses-Overabundance of focus on too many characters8.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse is a great X-Men film and managed to keep me enthralled until the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is set ten years after Days of Future Past and follows the return of the first mutant, Apocalypse, as he gathers his four horsemen to take the world back for those that are more powerful than regular humans. Only Charles Xavier and his team of mutants can stop the inevitable Apocalypse before it's too late.I haven't been an X-Men fan for long, I must confess. I first saw an X- Men film when I saw The Wolverine at a drive-in in 2013. Then, I went with my dad to see Days of Future Past in 2014. Since then, I've seen every X-Men film except X-Men Origins: Wolverine (for obvious reasons). So I'd like to think I know enough about the X-Men to say that this is a really great movie.Let's start with the acting. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender continue doing fantastic jobs as Professor X and Magneto, and the fact that they've had two movies to be on screen together, they help bring an extra dimension to the fight with Apocalypse considering Magneto is one of his horsemen. Speaking of Apocalypse, Oscar Isaac did a great job and he was extremely menacing as Apocalypse. Even though some say he's too short to be threatening (what kind of complaint is that?), he managed to make me believe he was going to tear the world apart. Tye Sheridan does a great job as the new Cyclops, and really made me believe the struggle he was going through. My one issue is Jennifer Lawrence, but not in the way everybody else has a problem with her. I like her acting, and I think she's fine, but that's just it. She's fine. Nothing special. That's what bothers me. But whatever. Rose Byrne returns as Moira which made me happy as she was one of my favorite characters in First Class. Nicholas Hoult also returns as Hank, which also made me happy. Basically, the cast is overall pretty great.I thought the action and the CGI were extremely well done. I could tell exactly what was going on, and there were a lot of vibrant colors going on during quite a few of them, which helped my enjoyment. The music, by John Ottman, was absolutely stunning. The score in the opening sequence with Apocalypse is one of my favorite superhero scores ever, because it was so menacing and really helped sell the idea that this is an ancient being. The script was pretty good. I mean, coming from the guy who also wrote The Last Stand, it works pretty well. Giving Magneto a reason to be a dick this time around really works, and it makes the film that much more powerful. A lot of new characters are introduced in this film, and Kinberg's script balances them extremely well. Everything felt really well balanced, and that's surprising to me considering the track record of some recent superhero films. Bryan Singer returns again to the directing chair, and as usual, he does extremely well. Some of his other films aren't as good, but I've always liked the X-Men films he's been involved in.My biggest issue with the film is essentially the final 10 minutes. Nobody dies. I don't know if that's really a huge spoiler at this point, but only one person dies in the entire run of the film, and that's it. Everybody else lives, and I feel like it's a bit of a cop out. I've noticed this trend more and more, and I hope it dies out, because a film where only one person dies and it's not even a main character really doesn't feel like a movie that should be taken seriously with high stakes.Also, one more thing I almost forgot to mention: for all the fans of Quicksilver's scene from Days of Future Past, his scene in this film is much in the same vein, and it even tops it in my opinion. Sweet Dreams, for sure.Overall, however, X-Men: Apocalypse is an extremely well-done superhero film. Is it as good as Deadpool or Civil War? No. Is it as bad as Dawn of Justice? No. The acting was superb, the action and the CGI all looked brilliant, the music was absolutely stunning, and the script and direction all worked too. If you're looking for a fun time at the movies, this one gives it to you. Fear not, X-Men fans, the franchise isn't dead yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I enjoyed it, but I can see why the reviews are so mixed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw X-MEN: Apocalypse last nigh and went into it with high expectations. Even though I was not disappointed, I was not blown away at all. While still a very enjoyable movie it is not put together well. Things seem rushed, the new characters besides Jean Grey, Cyclops and Nightcrawler felt very rushed. Olivia Munn's character Psylocke had about 6 lines, Storm's introduction was very fast, and Angel may have 2 or 3 lines in this movie. Apocalypse wasn't a very good villain, he was a boring character, you don't really know what his powers are, and he just doesn't cut it. The character had lots of potential, especially since he was played by Golden Globe winner Oscar Isaac but the way the film played out just didn't work. There are lots of pros though, like the Quicksilver scene, The opening pyramid sequence, Sophie Turner did pretty well as Jean Grey, MaCavoy and Fassbender are great as Professor X and Magneto, very good visual effects, good humor, and the Wolverine cameo was cool but clearly to setup the upcoming Wolverine movie in 2017. The final fight scene while entertaining felt a little Last Standish. Don't get me wrong this movie was better than The Last Stand but it is noticeably worse DOFP. And I had a smile at the end because everyone survives and we see the X-Men in their new suits and it clearly says there is gonna be a new trilogy. The new cast is very good and a new X-Men movie has been confirmed with this new cast, hopefully Fassbender, Macavoy and JLaw all resign to play their characters, but I'm excited to see what this new cast will bring us. X-MEN: Apocalypse was a fun summer movie and I'd recommend it to any X-MEN fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow for the first half... Worst script in the whole series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't want to give too much away. So here's the summary:1. The first half of the movie is too slow. I understand the narrative and all. But it was like the story of Eric and the story of En Sabah Nur are from different movie. Somehow they mixed these two stories together, along with the bits of X-Men. So it didn't come out as smooth as it supposed to be for Bryan Singer's movie. 2. Way too easy on recruiting/finding four horsemen. Did it mean any first 4 mutants will be the chosen ones? It looks that way. 3. I'm not sure if Psylocke has any line in the whole movie. Her power looks awesome. But she's the only one wearing skimpy outfit, while the others wear armor.... sexy, I know. But it seems strange.4. Wolverine as a special guest. Great fight scene though.5. This one is a little disappointing affair for fan of Bryan Singer like me. But it was X-Men. No matter how bad or good people say about it, you'll watch it anyway. So judge it yourself. For me I'd give it 6.5 stars. But there's no half point here. So 7 it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Superhero Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year has been a host to multiple superhero movies, from several different studios. If you're reading this, you probably say Batman Vs. Superman, and Civil War. I am making a rather bold statement that X- Men Apocalypse is an all around better movie than both of those pictures.Our story begins in ancient Egypt, with an altogether menacing scene. I don't really know what it was, but Singer &amp; Co. did an excellent job portraying Apocalypse's power and menace through the cold open. Apocalypse is ultimately buried alive, by a collapsing pyramid, and the movie moves on.What follows is one of the most engaging opening credit animations I have ever laid eyes on. The camera moves down a tunnel or vortex of some sort, while passing landmark references to important historical events. A swastika here, a sickle and hammer there, and TADA! we are now at present day.One really enjoyable thing about this movie was its rising action, which may have been more enticing than the film's finale. Much of this hour long period was spent recruiting. Mystique finding heroes, and apocalypse finding his four horsemen. Something distinctly magnificent about this leg of the story is how diverse the heroes backgrounds are. You have Scott Summers, a High School student, Angel and Night- crawler, enslaved cage fighters in Germany, and Storm, a young Egyptian street thief. While not every character has an equally progressive development, you do get a good sense of who they are, and where they come from. Angel, who is more or less silent throughout the film, undergoes an astonishing transformation at the hand of Apocalypse; metal wings erupting from his back, while "Four Horsemen" by Metallica plays powerfully. This was a stylistically brilliant scene. Another such instance, is Apocalypse's seizure of cerebro. The Credit for this goes to James Mcavoy, who expertly broadcast through dialogue, but mostly facial expression just how powerless he was. The world's strongest psychic, with a computer amplified ability, is still nothing against the mighty El Shabah Nur.These scenes are all spectacular, but what really ties the movie together is the underlying political tone. This is not as strong as those of "First Class" which centered around the Cuban Missile crisis, and Days of Future Past, which centers upon Nixonian America, and even explains the issue behind the famous Watergate tapes. This time around the subject is "superpowers", the global kind that is. Ironic, I know, considering the franchise's subject matter. Early after his reawakening, Apocalypse discovers how the world has come to be dominated by a few extremely powerful countries, and the state of Mutually Assured Destruction that the population now lives in, because of he existence of nuclear weapons. Interestingly, instead of launching them into earth which would indubitably complete his goal of tearing down the current world order, he launches them into the stratosphere. If there is a drawback to "Apocalypse" then it would be the lack of character development. Many heroes are brought into the equation, and the movie is unable to address a subplot for all of them. Personally, this isn't a big deal, because Magneto's backstory is extremely powerful, but I understand why this will turn some people off to the movie. While shirking on some storytelling aspects, Singer completely nails what I believe to be the most important aspect of film making, especially in this genre: Aesthetic. While not necessarily well combined this movie is a collection of decidedly epic scenes, that make it a cinematic force to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Super hero movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved X-Men Apocalypse, I thought that X-Men Apocalypse had Awesome Action and Amazing acting a movie could have that made made X-Men Apocalypse a dramatic movie. I thought that QuickSilver was a very fast and cool character and I felt that Nightcrawler had a little more personality than X-Men Apocalypse. Magneto made me feel more sympathy for him, but he was also a very strategic and formidable villain and Apocalypse was a very ruthless and immensely powerful God-like villain. Apocalypse was a unique character that thought only the strongest should survive and thought that there was no room for the weak. X-Men Apocalypse started very compelling and then started to get more and more intense. The movie has much higher stakes, making it one of the best X- Men movies. X-Men Apocalypse may not be perfect, but I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't often that one word can sum up the screening experience of a movie, especially when going into the film, one had lots of hesitations that stemmed from the questionable trailers. Prepare yourself for the heaviest of the X-Men movies future or past. Probably the best feeling to take away from this one is the storytelling quality of the cartoon paired with Bryan Singer's unparalleled handling of what is arguably the most successful Marvel franchise over the decades (that may be changing with the unprecedented popularity of The Avengers). While some may describe this movie as a failed attempt at reliving the glory days of the X-Men, I venture to say that there is enough evidence to support this being a strong third movie. As much as I enjoyed the movie--and do not mistake me, I did--there was a LOT going on in this movie and it came close to failing to effectively and successfully tell A complete three-act story. Just like in Batman v Superman, where Warner Bros bit off more than they could chew, 20th Century Fox came close to making the same mistake. Thankfully, the story was just strong enough to drive excitement and thrill through the minds and bodies of the audience.X-Men: Apocalypse is the third movie in the Bryan Singer reboot (fourth installment if you count the original X-Men movie from 2000). The world of Ancient Egypt was once the center of the universe; and in that great empire, there lived the original mutant (Apocalypse, Oscar Isaac). He grew in strength and power to the point that he ruled the world. After several of his fellow Egyptians betrayed him in attempt to bury him alive, he was cast into a deep sleep hundreds of feel beneath the surface. Due to a dedicated group of followers thousands of years later, Apocalypse was awaken and he has set out to reclaim the planet as his own and raise his children. Determined to build his mutant army, he begins to recruit the most powerful X-Men including Storm (Alexandra Shipp). When Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) encounters Apocalypse while in Cerebro and is captured, the still-fractured X-Men must go to great and nearly impossible lengths to rescue him and save the world. Teaming up with new student Scott (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Quicksilver (American Horror Story's Evan Peters), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), and Havoc (Lucas Til) will battle Apocalypse and his four horsemen including Storm, Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), and Magneto (Michael Fassbender).What a cast! The quality of talent in and of itself is an outstanding accomplishment and is responsible for a great deal of the success of the film. Writers create characters and directors craft them, but it is the actor who ultimately brings the characters to life for the silver screen. Each and every actor is an excellent match to their respective characters. In addition to the actors we have been introduced to in past films, the newcomers quickly cement themselves in this and future movies. With so much material and less than three hours to deliver a movie that could be on par with the previous two and The Avengers films, it was vitally important to have an impressive cast that could win you over instantly. There simply wasn't time for an actor to grow on you or to decide how you felt about a particular character. Each actor needed to his a homerun as soon as they stepped out of the dugout. I paid close attention to Sophie Turner because I was only familiar with her from Game of Thrones, and I just wasn't sure how I would feel about her as one of the omega class X-Men (Jean Grey). Oh, I knew she looked the part, but could she pull it off??? And the answer to that is a resounding yes.Much like Captain America: Civil War, X-Men: Apocalypse is nothing short of a superhero extravaganza. And although they are similar in many respects, there are two completely different tones in the respective movies. Are they both serious? Yes, but the former also includes comedic relief sequences and dialog (and yes, if you read my review, I found those to be poorly handled but I am not going to revisit that tarmac scene or the annoying Spider-Man in this article) while the latter retains the serious tone throughout the movie. However, it is successful in not becoming a parody of itself as was the case with Batman v Superman. I will state this: Civil War does boast a dynamic plot that flows smoothly the whole time, whereas Apocalypse flows smoothly most of the time, but at others, it does feel a mite bumpy. We could discuss symptoms of the problems all day, but the root of the problem is simply trying to tell too much story in one movie. To be honest, I have a felling that I am going to decide that I like X-Men more but that is likely because, in all fairness, I grew up with the cartoon. What works for X-Men, much like Captain America, is the fact that the audience does not need to be familiar with the comics in order to enjoy the movie. Singer makes sure that anyone who enjoys high concept comic book superhero action movies will enjoy this film. Well, that is, unless you happen to be a die-hard comic book aficionado. This movie is simply exciting and visceral.Memorial Day weekend will either be dominated by powerful mutants or caricatures from the other side of the mirror. Although X-Men will probably not perform as well as Civil War, I don't think Alice has a chance of topping this quintessential summer blockbuster on the unofficial start to the summer. Unless you live here in Florida where summer started in March. Haha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too tough to follow Civil War...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This X-Men movie doesn't bring anything more to the plate. It still feels like Marvel's baby brother. Not as strong actors, a weak script, bad characters' origins... It's a good action/superhero movie with a couple of great scenes, but it's just too ridiculous in some parts.Now let's get into details. First of all, the bad characters. Psylocke is pathetic. There's 0 origin, she doesn't have her psychic powers as opposed to the comic, she has like 4 lines, and so is just as useless as Bishop was in the previous X-Men movie. Angel is utterly ruined. In the Age of Apocalypse comic books and some follow ups, he's a HUGE part, he's supposed to be Death... But here he's just a jerk kid with no past, no motivation, who gets killed easily. Rubbish. And by the way, Apocalypse is supposed to NAME his horsemen (Death, War, Famine, Pestilence). Nothing here. Storm is kind of OK, but you feel like he picked some weak mutants for the job, apart from Magneto.Magneto by the way has some OK scenes, but the arrow thing ? Come on... Who wrote this ? It's ridiculous. One arrow, two kills ? In real life you can't pierce two bodies with a small wooden arrow and a small wooden bow... Plus there's no Wanda Maximov in the Fox's universe so it's a bit ridiculous to have Quicksilver (which is great again) without her.Apocalypse and Xavier are OK, Apo is a good villain, but again, the script is just poor. You had 3 acts in Civil War. In there, it feels like only one act. Remember the teaser with Mystique supposedly training the X-Men ? No it's not a second act as I was waiting for it to happen, it's just the epilogue... So it feels short, mainly because you have to introduce all those characters and put in some cameos (Wolverine's cameo is quite bad frankly). When they start fighting, there's like 20 min left in the movie... The whole Weapon X thing should have been removed. This is an Apocalypse movie...To me, Beast and Mystique were disappointments again. I still believe the Mystique from the original movies was better. Here she just feels too weak. As for Beast, it's mostly the costume and makeup. It's just ridiculous. He's too thin, and bright sky blue...Amongst the new characters, Cyclops is OK but nothing great there. His origins are too long, he still isn't a leader, and his brother's death feels out of place. Nightcrawler is basically just a tool to teleport the team and they didn't have time for his origin story... In the end, the best scene of the movie is obviously the Phoenix scene, that'll give you chills. They've done it well, but we kinda expect it.All in all, it's never gonna become a classic. The script is too weak, they don't have enough background to built on. Coming out AFTER Civil War makes it feel so small in comparison... I mean we wanted the AGE of Apocalypse. Not just Apocalypse barely doing some damage in Cairo... The horsemen are terrible, but you get 30 seconds of Phoenix... It could (and SHOULD) have been a lot better. X-Men movie fans will probably love it for that phoenix scene, or for the "grandeur" it sometimes displays, and Fox gave them nice little carrots here and there (Wolverine, a bald Xavier, Magneto and his concentration camp past...) but it's just not enough for me, I need a good script. The whole film takes place in what, a couple of days ? Again Civil War had time to develop, with the incident in Lagos, then the accords, then the escape, the fight, the villain etc... etc... Here, it's the origin of everyone, for like an hour, then Apo collecting his horsemen and convincing them at the speed of light (what a sweet talker...), then a 15 min fight. The end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great new start for the x-men franchise, the young actors do a great job portraying their characters which they will sure enough grow even more into the roles. The movie is long at 2hr46min but it draws you in so well, &amp; keeps you interested to where it seems like its over too fast. The movie had loads of emotional as well as loads of action packed scenes &amp; doesn't just focus on one character. In the end i see a lot of bad reviews, but in all honesty i loved this movie any flaws are easily looked past if you truly appreciate someone even bringing the X-Men to the bring screen. Overall i feel this movie was a great reboot that will only keep getting better if Singer directs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To all film critics: pull yourself together, this is an action movie not a drama movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film critics in general praise Days of Future Past and give negative reviews to this movie. The most common criticisms against Apocalypse are that the movie is stuffed with new characters, overloaded with action scenes, and there is a lack of depth for both characters and storyline. And I think if I am looking for depth in a movie, I won't watch an X-men movie. Apocalypse is very entertaining. If you are expecting a movie which is insightful or educating, there are a lot of movies produced with that purpose.&#xfeff; To sum up, it is laughable to me that the professional or serious film critics judge an action movie using standards which should really be used on drama films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming Back with a Mission</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ending half-frustrated by the latest entries involving my favourite super heroes, it's good to see that someone in Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to put together a great comic book action film. With the Oscar Isaac providing a solid center for the ultimate mutant/villain, this side of Voldemort, we have a troop of very talented people making return appearances, some promising newcomers who are more than welcomed to return in the newer entries, and my hat off to the fact that we have one screenwriter, keeping the vision focused, and the action tight despite the story going on for quite a while. It is commendable that it's a very long movie and not two parts, a trend that turned many of us cold.Here is one intimidating villain, one that could easily destroy just about anything crossing him or in front of him. His origins are unclear, but he/it appears to be powerful enough to run a tight ship back in the golden days of Egypt. He has positioned himself as the supreme "God" and is apparently in the midst of a renewal/recharging cycle when a little coup-d-etat manages to recover the freedom for that civilization, and in a quieter, subtler note, it appears to lead to its decline and that of the entire world.Isaac's villain is a marvelous and intriguing creation for he is no angel and no demon either, and he has more human qualities than many human themselves. He is also very centered in what he wants and needs, and his plans are precise from the beginning. He needs to rebuild his empire and seeks the best of the mutants to achieve his goals. He is also generous in providing them with the energy and support they need so they can do a good job. His choices are interesting, and he knows how to appeal to them. It is at this moment that we wonder what his true nature is.He comes close enough to achieve what he sought to do because he's a great commander. His presence is enough to rattle a few nerves and inspire fear even in the most powerful of his adversaries. It helps him that some of the mutants are not sure on how to use their gifts, and it takes several tries and some confidence building situations to make them take charge.In the end, the day is saved by an unexpected presence, and one of the most satisfying qualities of the film is that these teams work as real teams, providing each other with the strategies and tactics as needed. There is very little display of ego or emotional trauma. It's a dirty war, and it has to be fought to the end. Prepare yourselves for a great roller coaster ride and be sure that the X-Men are coming back with something even more exciting next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The X Men series has had it's share of ups and downs, from the highs (The brilliant X2 and Days of Future Past) to the forgettable (Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine). Presumably the last film for returning director Brian Singer, the series will no doubt continue on without it's creator, but it's hard to see the quality continue to be this good following his departure.The cast is excellent. Returning Michael Fassbender as Magneto is even better, because he has more to do than in DoFP. Despite the title, this film is more about Magneto than Apocalypse. Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse was fantastic, it's rare that I find a comic book villain genuinely intimidating. Likewise McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier faces his biggest challenge yet. I loved how the ending brought the series full circle, even if X Men and X2 now make no sense if you watch them straight after Apocalypse. Even with the time traveling shenanigans of Days of Future Past changing events, Nightcrawler's introduction makes no sense compared to his appearance in X2, and Alexandra Shipp's Storm looks and sounds nothing like Halle Berry. But considering the lukewarm reception to Berry's portrayal, maybe that's for the best. And considering that the timelines and character changes are at this point so convoluted that Deadpool is now making meta jokes ("McAvoy or Stewart?"), perhaps it's best not to get too wound up about the whole timeline thing. This is minor carping though. The action and special effects are top notch, and Evan Peters steals the show with another crowd pleasing Quicksilver scene. My second favorite comic book movie this year, bested only by Captain America: Civil War. Kudos, Brian Singer, once again, you have taken this series to another level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put my reviews very short as you might see in the future. Anyways..I was very skeptic how they could do something better than THE Quicksilver scene from Days of Future Past. But.. they actually manage to do a scene that is even more epic and hilarious. It was very visual experience and most of the CGI have been done very well. I had kinda mixed feeling from En Sabah Nur since I waited it so much. And I really wanted it to be overpowered as he should be. I had some things I didn't like that much and some things I liked a lot. Don't want to spoil anything and since this is spoiler-free and quick review I list pros and cons to bottom.++ Michael Fassbender as Magneto: (Maybe the best thing in the movie!) ++ Quicksilver as goofy and kinda overpowered character ++ Visuals + James McAvoy as professor X + Storm +- En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse (as a character, powers kinda felt limited) +- "New" Scott Summers (kind of a side character) - Stryker ( I didn't like the "young" Stryker at DoFP and not in this) -- Psylocke (kind of a boring character with no bigger meaning) -- Jean Grey (you'll see if you haven't yet)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More doesn't always mean better. This time however it works well. X Men: Apocalypse is massive digital effect swarm, but surprisingly the story doesn't get buried under all the effects. Story is set on 80's during cold war era. Picture of the time has bring freshly to set, although it won't bring all the cliche's of that time to silver screen. The iron curtain and cold war era has brought well on set. Somehow the story reflects nicely that period manly world, but surprisingly strong women are the last and only hope for the human kind. There are of course some weakness in story. There are so many characters, that story have difficulties enough to no-one's background. Maybe that is not a big problem here. Massive effect rumble is so beautifully implement that there is enough spine for weak story. 3D is executed spontaneous well. The story is not extraordinary, but movie's razzle-dazzle is so entertaining and beautiful and collection of great young actors and actress satisfy easily. Limits of movie madness is tested on this movie. Does it means that we have finally reached all what these digital effect movies has to offer? I don't think so as long as people are ready to pay price of a movie ticket to see them.Movie is typical summer blockbuster movie. Massive effects, action combined to a light story makes people to wander to ticket window. And there is nothing bad in it, you pay the price easily, especially when it has produces so well, than this is. Shameless entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five years ago, in 2011, When director Bryan Singer released the movie, x-men first class. As a fan of all the x-men movies and all of the franchises related movies (Wolverine's). i enjoyed the movie, but what kept reappearing in my mind was, "where does this movie belong?". i wasn't sure where this movie was meant to fit in the time-line. was this movie a reboot? was this movie a prequel? Did this movie even know what it was?. There is a big stigmata against reboots and prequels ever since the star wars franchise expanded beyond the confinements of George Lucas's original Star Wars trilogy. But...Bare with me, This movie is amazing. For you to fully understand the x-men universe and the time-line/story, i truly recommend that you the leave "x-men origins: Wolverine &amp; The Wolverine" out of your watch list, and... treat those movies as standalone, non continuity, pure entertainment movies. Because they are good movies, their just extremely confusing when you try to piece the x-men trilogy with those movies and then the new movies (first class &amp; days of future past).Yes! Days of future past does incorporate time travel from the time period of the original movies (think more current, modern times, 2000s, mature grown up x-men), to the 1970s! But its to stop everything bad from happening in their future before it has even begun. Apocalypse, picks up a few years later in the 80s, after the events that happened in days of future past. This movie is very very good! i personally rate it 8 out of 10! How about you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes and Sharknado has a 82% and you believe all those idiots? X-Men Apocalypse is the best of the X- Men Prequels i'm not saying that Days of Future Past or First Class were bad they were good too but this one was by far the best. Nightcrawler is amazing and he's as good as Alan Cumming was back in X-Men 2: United , Psylocke? well she doesn't talk that much but she's good and Storm well i like Halle Berry better but she's good too Scott &amp; Jean were amazing and as good as the Original actors i thought that Angel was good too. The only character that was totally off was Jubilee she did absolutely nothing but i'm fine with that. But let's talk for the villain was Oscar Isaac a good villain or a bad one? well he's not 100% Comic Book accurate and he's not that tall but my god the dude killed it he was amazing and every time he started talking i got some goosebumps also the Stan Lee cameo is probably the most serious one and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was freaking badass if the next film is like that cameo here it will definitely be the best of the Wolverine Trilogy. I also loved just loved Quicksilver's scene he is such a cool character and please stop hating on Jennifer Lawrence she was fine more than fine. I enjoyed this film so much just like i did with Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Deadpool and it was far far better than Captain America: Civil War just because those jerks in Rotten Tomatoes gave it a lower score than The Last Stand that doesn't mean that it deserves it the film was amazing go see it now. Another amazing thing was the soundtrack it was superb and the original theme is back as for the effects that some people had a problem with it they were fine. It was pretty cool that they used some flashbacks from the previous films also. I hope they make another film except Wolverine 3 i want to see what happens next. And by the way even if you agree or disagree with me on this review just remember this Superman Returns got better reviews than X-Men: Apocalypse i mean what the f@ck? X-Men Apocalypse is Awesometacular!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid X-Men movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...For a long time i felt like X2: X-Men United was the best comicbook movie i had ever seen, but both Marvel and Matthew Vaughn have raised the bar significantly, so now I feel like Bryan Singer tends to 'play it safe'. And that's what he does here with X-Men: Apocalypse. It is a good film. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender continue to be a tremendous Xavier-Magneto tandem, and Oscar Isaac is a solid villain. Evan Peters' Quicksilver steals the show (again), but Sophie Turner's Jean Grey is a surprisingly intriguing character. They handle Jean well. It is also nice to finally get Scott Summers on the team, as he is the quintessential X-Man. That being said, Olivia Munn is underwhelming as Psylocke, and they really waste Archangel. Jennifer Lawrence really mails this one in, but I feel like there just isn't much left for them to do with Mystique, outside of killing her (which they SHOULD do.) Overall a solid film, and worth watching if you are an X-Fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore Critics Ignore Rotten Tomatoes: Best SuperHero Movie of Recent Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X Men: Apocalypse is really epic. Specially those who are comic book fans and have watched the X-Men Cartoons will love this movie and understand why its the best Superhero Movie of the Recent Times. It does fair justice to the Comic Book Series and also the animation series (obviously deviations are there but minor).Just loved the movie and was beyond my expectation. It takes you to the edge of the seat since the starting scene. You will not feel bored for a single moment in this movie. The character building is superb specially for Magneto and how his character juggles between good and bad.Ignore the Critics and Rotten Tomatoes, because most probably they are wretched souls who never got the chance the hold a comic book in their hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>days of future past was really original and new. and i get why some won't go along with this one, but i can guarantee you that even the director didn't mean to make this one even remotely similar to the previous entry of the franchise.there's a whole different story here. it's a true ensemble movie of the year. way past civil war or dawn of justice(even though i loved both of them)in the most straight way. just because it actually is good vs evil, with naturally good characters and naturally evil ones. in this movie you won't have to choose a side. except of magneto of course, but we're already used to accepting and loving his character just the way he is.and of course quicksilver! AWESOME! in the most literal way. at one point he even laughs at APOCALYPSE, before kicking his ass.this is a true x-men movie with full elemental range of mutant powers and it's awesome. but i really hope they make the next one more calm an sophisticated with character development, because they physically won't be able to make a movie with more mutant action.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best X-men movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is without a doubt the best x-men movie ever made. I am a huge X-men fan since my early childhood (love the comics and 90's animated series) and my number one heroine is Jean Grey. I love almost every super hero comic (Marvel and DC), but the X- Men are my number one. This new X-men movie gave me the same happy and excited feelings the comics and animated series always give me. I love the 80's start and that they are coming in to there powers. Apocalypse is great, Magneto is great, Xavier is great, Mystique is great and so on. And finally they got Jean Grey right! She is portrayed amazing! I was excited during the whole movie and completely lost track of time. I'm gonna see this movie at least 2 more times in the cinema. I really loved it. Can't wait for the new trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The X-Men are back in the sixth movie in the X-Men franchise and the fourth to be directed by Bryan Singer. While this is the end of the second X-Men trilogy, it also feels like a new beginning. The main thing to understand with X-Men: Apocalypse is that you shouldn't listen to most of the critics lambasting it for its vast number of characters and story lines. Even though there is a lot that goes on in X-Men: Apocalypse, it's all emotionally engaging and most importantly, fun.X-Men: Apocalypse takes place ten years after the events of Days of Future Past in 1983. The world's very first mutant from Ancient Egypt, a being named Apocalypse who thinks himself a god, awakens from suspended animation and sees how the world has become without his leadership. Apocalypse sets out to destroy almost the entire Earth to start humanity over anew, with only those pesky X-Men standing in his way. In a nutshell, that's the entire movie, but what gives X- Men: Apocalypse its emotional resonance is the fact that it is the sixth X-Men movie.This is a direct sequel in the way that The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars. The movie makers don't waste time reminding us who these characters are or what they're doing, they simply assume we've watched every other X-Men movie. While there might be a few passive fans of the franchise who do not like this approach, as a fan who has seen all of the X-Men movies multiple times, I was on cloud nine practically the entire runtime. On top of that, this one and Days of Future Past feel like the movie makers are finally embracing the more comic bookish nature of the X-Men. There are a lot more fantastical images in this one that look and feel as if they were taken straight from the pages of the comic books, and as a comic book fan, that's just icing on an already delicious cake.Overall, I absolutely loved X-Men: Apocalypse and it's my personal favorite superhero movie of 2016 so far. I know those are fighting words, but all of my favorite X-Men are represented in this movie and shine brighter than these movies have ever let them shine. From the teenage reintroductions to Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Nightcrawler, it's like Bryan Singer was reading my mind Professor X style to deliver the X-Men movie I've wanted for years.I give X-Men: Apocalypse a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mother of mutant resurrected to "clean" the earth by destroying the entire civilization. The X-men once again have to come together and fight the powerful Apocalypse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do you feel if you were an outcast? An outsider? Feeling unaccepted and being labeled as a freak. I believe only few people able to understand how does it feel to be a mutant, and yet, this is the most important element that gone missing in the last installment of X-Men movie "Apocalypse".As the man who brought this issue when he set up X-Men installment back in 2000, Bryan Singer tended to put aside the major issue when the movie was firstly introduced, or maybe he felt that he had to move forward and assumed that mutants are more welcome in 2016. So, when Nightcrawler (blue mutant with tail and cool bang) were out with his new X-men friend, Scott and Jean, to watch The Return of the Jedi, there's no scene about other movie goers reaction to see mutant among them, considering the movie set in 1983 (check the year when Return of the Jedi being released). Please notice when the movie set in 2000 it opened with argumentation between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr about mutant existence among "normal" people. It goes on until X-Men III : The Last Stand. Brett Ratner still continued to divide the mutants in two.Apparently, when the main issue has been put aside, we only focus to the next best thing happen in this movie, the fight between good guy and the bad guy. I didn't recall anything new in that movie as I have seen all the tricks. Cerebro? Check! Metal control? Check! Shape Changing? Check! Laser beam? Check! Even the cool slow mo? Still cool but check! Wolverine cameo?Yes! Check and check and check! Cards were on the table and honestly I was bored that I barely hold my yawns.So, what new? Nothing. None. It's actually exactly the same world extinction but retold in different perspective (enemy). If you want to compare, just watch X-Men III: The Last Stand which most of critics said that Brett Ratner was the destroyer of the franchise. I wonder what the critics would say now to Bryan Singer, the Apocalypse? Well it fits with title of the movie.And it's funny thing to know Bryan Singer also hated the third installment of the previous X-Men series. Maybe it was because not him who sit on the director's chair, or maybe he just hated Brett Ratner? I don't know, but clearly Jean uttered it on the scene after she watched the third movie of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, she concluded her argument with Scott: "The third (movie) always stink!" Well, if Jean could read people mind, I believed she spoke on behalf of Singer's thought about X-Men III: The Last Stand, or if I may add, Jean also spoke on behalf of me, that this third movie of the new X-Men is stink (Considering X-Men: First Class is the first movie for the reboot of the franchise).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this movie for quite a while but aside from the teaser from after Days of Future Past, I've kept myself from the trailers, so I went in not really knowing to expect.What I got was slightly disappointing. I think the movie had the elements of a good movie but it didn't really come together. I think some of its main problems, contributing to this, are:1) Too many characters. It was great to see many familiar and beloved characters - I love Storm, Nightcrawler, Angel and so on - but the consequence was that they got almost no screen time, especially as Mystique, Xavier, Magneto and Jean Grey/ Scott Summers got a big share each. This gets to the point where I had trouble empathizing with the characters because they had no screen time: Magneto's family? Who gives a hoot, we knew them for like two seconds (the girl's powers were interesting - I was pretty mad they killed her off so quickly for that reason alone). Havok's death? Whatever. It was given little reaction on-screen and while we knew him from former movies, it wasn't like he had tons of focus in those either. To be honest, I just didn't care about the characters in this one.2) Not striking the balance between what the audience think they want and what they actually want. The worst offender is Mystique- screen time. I like JL fine, I like Mystique fine, but they've really just showed her in there and turned up the screen time even when her part in the story isn't really interesting or meaningful. Many will probably disagree with my other borderline offender: Quicksilver. I love EP as an actor, I love Quicksilver as a character, but he is very powerful in this universe so it feels a bit forced that he doesn't just mow anything and everything down. His role in this also felt a bit forced, evidenced in that it went nowhere in the end. Like with Mystique it feels like it's mostly an audience/ money grab ("the" Quicksilver scene was still the best in the movie, of course, but everything else about his role felt pretty meh).3) The script felt clumsy at many points. For example, I know we have to introduce characters and the audience have to get to know them in short order, but it felt forced a lot of the time - Jean's introduction got on my nerves especially. Storm's wasn't really any better (in general I think she got an undeserved nerf and we never got to see her use her powers in any awesome way - another issue when there are too many characters. The big ending battle was long but no one really got to shine).These things combined with things like Apocalypse/ En Sabah Nur spouting off endless clichés and the effects not really being great most of the time (my sister's hypothesis was that the budget was blown on Quicksilver's scene - I'm inclined to agree) ended up giving me a movie that wasn't really BAD, it just wasn't up to the standard that the first two set, making it disappointing.It had elements of awesomeness but it never came together in the way I wished it would. I would still see it again and will probably see the next one (even though I'm not a big fan of Jean and Scott and this one sets them up to have big roles in the future) but I probably won't see it in the theater as I did with this.(Also, Sophie Turner is a fine actress, but I could not see her as Jean in this - all I saw was Sansa).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best superhero movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I was so afraid that I'd be disappointed. Luckily, I was not. This X-Men has surprised me the most. Actions scenes are thrilling, music is magnificent, CGI as well. Acting is great, James McAvoy has outdone himself. Probably the best superhero movie of the year so far. I'm not sure why Rottentomatoes criticized it so badly. It keeps your attention because there is so much going on throughout the movie. The mutant I liked the most was definitely Quicksilver(Evan Peters). Funny character, with his own scene(which was my favorite) who kept the excitement of the movie to it's end. TL;TR Good and exciting movie. Characters are awesome. Go and watch it, don't look at Rottentomatoes or any other site that has written bad about it.</fullReview>

The critics are being too harsh on this movie just like BvS and both movies were awesome. Go in and form your own opinion. The story was nice but predictable. The action scenes were amazing. The CGI was much better than Deadpool and Civil War. The characters were really well introduced. Bryan Singer didn't disappoint. The ending was a little cheesy but OK. The movie build-up is good and keeps you interested. This is the 3rd good X-men movie after Days of Future Past and X2. Oscar Isaac acted amazing as APOCALYPSE. But the show stealer is QUICKSILVER. QUICKSILVER stole the show single-handedly. AMAZING. Bryan Singer understands Quicksilver better than the producers at Disney. Don't't rely on critics, they get paid to bash a movie. Go in and have a good time because it is a good movie.</fullReview>

Loved the story, Magneto was great, liked his back story in the film. I thought that Apocalypse was one of the better villains, although his power wasn't really shown in the film as it is in the comics. The new younger xmen characters all did the characters justice. Really liked nightcrawler, thought he was one of the better portrayed Xmen.The film was well timed, liked the pace leading up to the final conflict. I would quite happily see it again.

		<fullReview>As a huge fan of X-men movies I thought that this movie will not be 10/10, because the last one was AMAZING, but I was wrong. The graphics and the story were excellent and as always James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were on top of their game. And Quicksilver scene was (like in the last film) maybe my favourite out of all scenes. Quicksilver in X-men is definitely better than in Avengers. As a person who has never read X-men comics, I was really fascinated by new background information about some characters. Also, I was really sad that Havok died and WHY QUICKSILVER JUST CAN'T TELL MAGNETO THAT HE IS HIS FATHER. I hope they keep making amazing movies and I can't wait for the next movie to come out.</fullReview>

I was sceptical of this entry at first as this would be 100% Bryan Singer with no production assistance from Matthew Vaughn but after what I watched I must give credit to Bryan Singer for delivering a brilliant entry to the First Class trilogy.The European pro critics have gotten this wrong in everyway way specially the Metro Newspaper (London) review, very disappointing to read such negativity which could easily influence potential audience fending them off from viewing the film.I truly hope the US audience will view it with a more open and less constricted mind to the European audience and see how great this movie really is.9/10</fullReview>

Quicksilver got the screen time he deserved, Nightcrawler was perfect and finally Cyclops was done well!

		<fullReview>I read a review of X-Men: Apocalypse giving it 6/10. It said it was tired, needing new ideas.I've just seen X-Men: Apocalypse. I LOVED it. Up until now X-Men 2 was my fave, but Apocalypse knocked it out of the park.What's more, not only do I think Apocalypse is the best X-Men film yet I'm going on record and say it's the best superhero film of 2016.It's easily better than Batman V Superman and honestly, whilst I loved Civil War I came out feeling something was missing. Maybe my expectations had been too high, possibly expecting more than Marvel was willing to give...Apocalypse though feels like it's giving us everything it has. Quite frankly I feel that the Apocalypse character has laid down the gauntlet and Thanos will have a tough job to top it when the MCU tackle Infinity War.I'm not expecting everyone to share my opinion (I'm sure a lot will blindly rate Civil War higher)... But dammit, I think X-Men: Apocalypse deserves credit - it got my adrenalin pumping and at the end I was buzzing for more.20th Century Fox may not have a clue how to handle Fantastic Four but it just nailed the X-Men.</fullReview>

Best Xmen movie by far because it's not centered around Wolverine (as good as Hugh jackman was the movies were awful) and everyone in the main cast got to play a part.The villain himself was worthy but the choice of minions not so much.Purely on an entertainment factor I put this above both BvS and Civil War. Both of which I gave a 7 for different reasons. This does not try to be overly epic or blast open a door to a series of new movies. It gets an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright so this is my first time writing a review on IMDb, just for the sake of this particular title.X-Men: Apocalypse has a slow start in beginning, a lot of characters had to be introduced so a lot of background stories were re-looked here and there. It was pretty hard to follow at first but slowly everything makes sense towards half-part of the movie. Then comes the climax.... I was so immersed by the action packed scene with my mouth wide opened. (plus PLENTY of goosebumps). CGI was top-notch. I mean we are talking about the world-coming-to-an-end-destruction-scale AKA. APOCALYPSE. Kudos to the effects team!!!NOW, the casts. Simply marvelous NEW X-MEN (Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm etc etc.) Quicksilver stole my heart in every hilarious scene he is in, as per Days of Future Past. Few heart-wrenching scenes came from Magneto (Michael Fassbender) as well. All cast played their parts well be it major like James McAvoy or minor like the NightCrawler kid, they cant obviously fit every character into 144 minutes *too many*Point is, this movie is not overly-done. I can tell that everyone in my cinema were so thrilled and satisfied at the end-credits. You MUST watch this flick if you are one true X-MEN fan. P.S: Do not compare it with Marvel/DC/other superhero movies as they are not relevant. Just sit back and enjoy OK? :-)</fullReview>

CGI smeegi, really nay-sayers, the faults were so minimal, you'd need to be going to see the film for the sole purpose of showing the world what an amazing negative force you are(trying to be polite here folks). Really, come- on the movie was pure fiction for comic book lovers and anyone who loves sci-fi. Brian and the cast did an amazing job of providing 144 minutes of pure eye popping entertainment. The X-MEN story continuity was well maintained and the material was as close to the original comics as one could do in a 144 minute movie. SO all, do yourselves a favor and ignore the critics who prefer you to see horrible real life snotty dramas with political correctness and sexual orientation shoved in your face and buy yourselves a ticket to see this genuine entertainment spectacle.</fullReview>

They complained about it having too many characters, but that may have been the best part for me! They're all well known characters, so if you watched the other movies, that's not a problem at all. I loved Scott and Jean, and I never liked Halle Berry as Storm, but this new actress is great as Storm! I wanted to see a little more from her and also from the Angel and Psyloche, but other than that, I had plenty of the characters in a good way. I believe this is my favorite X-Men movie so far, and it was the closest to the 90's cartoon I used to love watching, and actually how I got to know them. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

It evolves much on character emotions. Another recommendation is that, one must understand history a little. On what is happening in cold war or who is "Ra, Yahweh, or Visnu" like what apocalypse said in the trailer. Then, only you would understand that this movie is big. It is not just the fun light heart superhero movie. Watch out the performance of Apocalypse! The actor is awesome</fullReview>

That was exactly how it was meant to be, it was accurate. It was how I'd imagine the story being. I think a true xmen fan will see what it is. To the avid novice film goer maybe not but to every critic in the world on this film, they can go lobotomize themselves because this film wasn't for them. Every character got a fair crack considering there was so much going on. There was a little story to each one at least and all got a fair shot with their powers. This film was bang on finally singer is fixing the what others have messed up.Only little notes tho, when will they stop underwriting jubilee for god sake! you might think she's annoying but she's part of the furniture and should be treated as such. finally a proper phoenix in Jean Grey! (although not mentioned at all in the film so technically not a spoiler) Bit of a waste killing havoc and arch angel (which they only called angel) but then nobody would die. The only thing I didn't like about days of future past is that they silently killed off all those interesting xmen from first class without a good explanation except that they were "tested on" and weren't used any further. But as i said before to wrap up this is finally pointing in the right direction anyone who hates this movie please jump off a cliff! because this film isn't for you its for the true fans and everyone else can jog on !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honesty disheartened looking at all of the bad reviews on this film, I've just come back from it then and thought it was absolutely amazing. Apocalypse is an outstanding villain, and the new team are fantastic. Quicksilver for me again stole the show, as well as Nightcrawler. Magneto kicks ass as well, one scene stands out for me with him in the film.Overall, I think critics take films way too seriously at the minute. This film is visually and physically appealing, funny and a great action film. Films are expected to be flawless, it's a 12A rated superhero movie for goodness sake! It's a must watch and a great addition to the prequel series, it doesn't ruin the series at all and it helps to establish a few of the characters from the other 2 films. Please ignore the critics.Remember to stay after the film as their is an after credits scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the reason why you shouldn't listen to the critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the title say, this movie is Apocalyptic. The destructive is great, and it's awesome. My expectation for this movie was quiet high and this movie has done it very well, even though Days of Future Past felt slightly better. Actually I'm a bit surprised when people get confused with the story at the beginning. When you already saw the other X-men movies, the story won't be that hard to understand. The beginning was to introduced the villains and re-introduced some mutants from the first trilogy, and then the conflict started to rise. The best part came when Quicksilver did his scene, just like he did in the Days of Future Past, but this time he got more part.But there's also some shortage, like the conflicts and the problem solving are quiet simple, and there's some CGI that looks cheap.Overall, this movie is worth to watch. Forget about those critics for being too serious because it's very enjoyable and entertaining, and that's the movies are for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much more than expected - Superlative in every aspect (3D 4DX Screening)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It felt incredible to have experienced such an immersive and overwhelming movie that left me with a proud emotional impression. I'm in danger of gushing I know, stay with me though. We have already had some thoroughly enjoyable and brilliantly done comic based movies this year. The Director Bryon Singer has done it again, only even better this time round. All the characters were reminiscent of the animated series out in the 90s and noughties, and all the better for it too. The story integrated into previous movies, without discord and, had a non linear tact. This enriched the film with a dexterity so easily missed in many action movies of the last decade. I felt warmed by the emotional connection the characters radiated. They reflected proud performances. The pace of the film was well structured. It avoiding the drudgery of some action flicks that, seem to bore with a non stop barrage of blurry over the top action. No, X-Men: Apocalypse was action packed but also engaging and endearing. The various characters were introduced steadily and propelled the story in a cohesive manner. A lot has been said by dullards, about the CGI content being more invasive to the film, than complementary. I can confirm this is how to do it. All effects were not just believable but felt natural and realistic. So much so that in many parts I felt the CGI was perhaps the best I have seen of any movie and, a testament to what is possible with time and effort. Apocalypse is a fine deployment and not as over the top as I was expecting. Quick silver nearly steals the show as he did in the previous movie, but quickly harmonises into the story. I didn't expect to like McAvoys Xavier as much as I have but he really does plug into the role like a charismatic semblance. McAvoy does integrate into the part like a continuation of where Patrick Stuart could have come from before being older. Sophie Turner from the Game of thrones fame is captivating as Jean Grey. Amazing casting credits to the new Cyclops too. Plays a troubled teen learning the hard way to be a bad ass good guy. Even Wolverine plays his part in a non centralised way but owns the scene in a way that is intriguing.This film has it all, and repeat value is massive too. I could see this film many many times before having too much. The opposite of Batman Vs Superman. More emotionally engaging than Captain America: Civil War.I saw this film in 3D 4DX - it adds more dimension to film. Sometimes (like in Batman vs Superman) the 4DX isn't used well enough to justify the extra expense and actually distracts from the film. Not in X-Men: Apocalypse the 3D is smooth and deep. The 4DX is immersive and compliments the engrossing nature of this utterly epic film. The director has delivered so much more than expected, it makes me want him to have a go at doing a Transformers film so the Michael Bay effect can be finally washed away. At the end of the film is the usual intro to another movie so wait for it and you'll see last credits say this film had 15000 people employed in its making and it really shows too. Amazing and superlative in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. THIS IS X-MEN.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with other reviewers here. How the critics have got this one completely and abjectly WRONG. You absolutely must go see this film if you are an x-men fan; it's astonishing.The newcomers are wonderful. Sophie Turner makes an excellent Jean Grey (perfect in fact), and although I really didn't think anyone could replace Famke Janssen well in the role, it's happened quite automatically here.Mystique's role is not overplayed, and the villainous aspect of her character that's more prevalent in the source material is no longer missed; in fact, I quite like this Mystique now. Also, make no mistake; her presence does not overshadow the other characters in any way, which is something I think a lot of people were worried about. On the contrary, every character shines quite brilliantly here. Some of the more B characters don't get a huge amount of backstory, but that's to be expected in such a large universe of characters. This is especially true in a film with this monumental villain, a secondary arch villain, and seven or eight major X-men players, not to mention the core of Xavier, Storm, Jean, Cyclops, Magneto and in other places ? Wolverine. So the critics are completely off base there again.Oscar Isaac's performance is fantastic, and contrary to what critics have spouted, his on screen presence is not diminished by the makeup and costume; it is merely enhanced. The sonic affects on his voice create a visceral experience, and elevate the character to really menacing proportions. Apocalypse's design looks perfect in most places. It's not so great in just one or two moments, but it honestly doesn't matter ? either way, this villain's transfer to the big screen is truly excellent. His commentary about the iconography and false promise of modern western culture struck a note that I frankly think has gone well over critic's heads. I mean, can anyone name a supernatural villain who actually wanted to launch nuclear weapons into space? Excuse me, but this is pure genius!The tension between him and Xavier as the film moves forward is riveting. His towering, overpowering presence during the psychic battle is awesome, and his mocking taunts here really bring the character to life ? even going beyond the comic book. Jean's eventual entrance into this battle ? coming to Xavier's rescue ? has to be the most heroic moment in the entire franchise.Throughout the rest of the film, expect lots of great, explosive scenes, lots of intimate character building moments, and another highly memorable, sweet moment between Logan and Jean (during his excellent, extended cameo), which is truly beautiful.The emergence of Phoenix, finally, after sixteen years, is more than welcome. It has to be seen to be believed. Apocalypse's last words, "all is revealed" upon seeing Jean's power unleashed ? this simple sentence is a work of genius, incredibly layered and with huge subtext. It's the perfect juxtaposition between a false God, who, in shock, speaks these words when he is presented after all that time with a young girl who could potentially have the power of a true God.So who wrote the line? Singer? Kinberg? Tell us!The scene also really gets to some truths about the original X-men team that were absent to a large degree before. For instance, we see just how close Jean is to Xavier. She is referred to as his 'star pupil' at one point in the Ultimate series I believe, and I think that sentiment was always there in the original book too. They truly have a very special, very unique bond, and it's paid homage to here in a really beautiful way.This is a truly wonderful addition to the X-men franchise. Can't wait for more. (And thanks Singer, Kinberg, Dougherty, Harris, Donner etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had its flaws, but still a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend and I watched this movie in the theater a week ago. To be honest, neither of us are up to date with the X-Men film franchise. Example, for me I've only seen the original trilogy and the Origins: Wolverine. I've seen parts of First Class on a friend's computer. As an viewer watching X-Men: Apocalypse, I was "introduced" to younger versions of the classic characters we all know. I am actually surprised to see the younger versions of these characters portrayed well. I'm really impressed with Sophie Turner's take on the character Jean Grey, originally portrayed by Famke Janssen. I can clearly tell Sophie has studied Famke's performance in order to keep the character consistent in what we've already know about Jean Grey's personality. The only thing I had concern was that there were so many main characters it was difficult to identify with each character. I felt I really didn't care about the other characters with the exception of Michael Fassbender's character Magneto. Spending so much time with the characters I felt that it slowed the movie down. I personally like slow movies, but for a movie like X-Men: Apocalypse (or any superhero action movie for that matter), I felt the pacing could be picked up. However, at least it was done by director Bryan Singer. Watching his films featuring an ensemble cast I felt overall he handled them well, giving each of his characters enough screen time even though at times like I've mentioned above it slowed the pacing down. The action scenes in the last part of the movie were done well overall. There's a sequence involving the antagonist and Professor Xavier battling each other both, but not in a physical sense exactly. You'll see when you watch. Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad movie. It just that it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case of same-old same-old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following Matthew Vaughn's enjoyable franchise reboot X-Men: First Class (2011) and Bryan Singer's mind-bending follow-up Days of Future Past (2014), the latest entry into the ever-expanding world of the X-Men that began back in 2000 promised - according to writer Simon Kinberg - a scale and scope on such a level never before seen in a superhero movie. While the latest villain to face Professor X and his crew certainly ups the ante by offering the threat of global extinction, X-Men: Apocalypse suffers mainly because we have seen the likes of this before, after all Ultron threatened the same thing just last year in Marvel's Avengers sequel, and Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay have been doing this since the mid-1990's.Apocalypse just doesn't offer the same sort of unique strangeness that assisted Days of Future Past in being the best entry since X2 in 2003, nor the impressive grip it kept on its large ensemble of super- beings and superstars in First Class. When it all boils down, Apocalypse is simply a tale of good vs. bad, introducing a hefty influx of new characters and old (with many of the latter re-cast with up-and- comers) in the process. The threat facing the wheelchair-bound telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his School for Gifted Youngsters this time is the first and most powerful mutant of them all, En Sabar Nuh aka Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac). When we first meet him, Nuh is in Ancient Egypt where he is worshipped as a god. Fearing his power, his worshippers betray him, leaving him entombed within a collapsed pyramid and killing his Four Horsemen.In 1983, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), the shape-shifting mutant, is in East Berlin rescuing teleporter Kurt Wagner aka Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) from a human-run underground fight club and its winged champion Angel (Ben Hardy). Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is hiding out in Poland with his wife and child following his attempt to assassinate the President of the USA ten years previous. Charles is still running his school, which has added some interesting new recruits in fellow telepath Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Scott Summers aka Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). When Apocalypse re-awakens and decides that humanity has lost its way, he sets about recruiting his four new Horsemen, including Magneto, to help him destroy the world and rebuild it with him as its leader.Anyone who loved Quicksilver's scene-stealing appearance in Days of Future Past will no doubt appreciate Evan Peters' extended role here, as he is again central to an impressive set-piece that is equally playful, inventive and exciting. For a movie with such a grim outlook at stake, it ironically works best when going about its business with a sense of humour. In the dramatic moments, its fails to offer any real impact, almost completely ignoring any religious undertones that would have made the film infinitely more interesting, and covering familiar ground in terms of Charles and Erik's somewhat rocky friendship. Although Isaac gives it his all, it is the young actors that are the standouts. Turner, Sheridan and Smit-McPhee manage to both channel the actors who came before them and making the characters their own. Hopefully then, the franchise is in safe hands moving forward (there are no signs of it stopping), but for now, Apocalypse is very much a case of same-old, same-old, and not much more than a relatively entertaining way to kill 2 and a half hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In fairness to X-men Apocalypse, it wasn't specifically this film that forced me to sign up to IMDb and start writing a negative review. But it was the movie out of a list of 2015/2016 superhero films that brought the kettle to the boil.Avengers - Civil War, Batman V Superman, Fantastic Four, TMNT to name a few have been very disappointing and just demonstrate what Hollywood have to offer these days. SWEET FA!Who can blame them though, they do lazy story telling, add in a bunch of CGI, get Chris Hemsworth and the 'Squad' nice and big and there you have it! A Modern Day Superhero Movie which everyone sits down, pays and watches FULL WELL KNOWINGLY ITS ALL THE SAME SH*T.This isn't hatred towards superhero films completely. Look at the Dark Knight Films and compare them to these films. I will just do that right now with X-Men..So the Villain can really make or break a film it's fair to say. And the motives behind that villain can get you on- board for a film or do the opposite and make you lose interest. The Joker gave us exactly what you need from a villain. Motive. Did Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse? Nope.Or how about all the explosions, laser beams, being hurtled against a wall at 100mph or even dropped from the skies. You'd think surely there'd be more damage to the characters than entire Urban Infrastructure. Nope, not a scratch...well..maybe a scratch, but it's gotta look realistic right!?X-Men carried a ton of good actors with Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy both doing what they can to bring this film to life. But the best movies, and I'm talking classics, are generally films that don't include huge fictional monsters. If these actors with such potential really want to reach that top A-class list to join the likes of Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks...it's time they stop agreeing to be in films that have already been done over and over and over again.Hollywood - Bring something Fresh to the table!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled. Bloated. Uninspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class was a highly refreshing take on the origin stories of the significant members of X-Men universe. A reboot of the series (sort of), it made really effective use of the provided clean slate to put up a thoroughly gripping tale that delivered on all fronts. Three years later, X-Men: Days of Future Past followed which allowed director Bryan Singer to return to the franchise he himself brought to life back in 2000. And it didn't just succeed as a worthy sequel to First Class but also served as a fitting conclusion to the original X-Men trilogy.What impressed me most about Days of Future Past was the remarkable balance it exhibited while juggling different timelines, in addition to its exquisite handling of the arcs of multitudes of characters, all carried out without compromising with the entertainment factor. The post-credit sequence in that movie did tease an ambitious storyline for the next instalment and that's what X- Men: Apocalypse is. But this time, Bryan Singer fails to duplicate what he pulled off so seamlessly in his last venture, for Apocalypse is a muddled, bloated &amp; uninspiring second sequel that works only in bits n pieces.The story of X-Men: Apocalypse takes place in the 1980s, a decade after the events of the last film. Charles Xavier (Professor X) has created a haven for his students in his school, enrolling troubled mutants like Scott Summers &amp; Jean Grey. Eric Lehnsherr (Magneto) is living a low-profile life in Poland with a family of his own, while Raven (Mystique) has kept herself busy over the years, freeing enslaved mutants from their captivity. But all of them are brought into conflict when En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse, the world's first mutant, awakens after centuries and, disillusioned with what the world has become in his absence, decides to destroy &amp; remake it.Directed by Bryan Singer, Apocalypse opens on a promising note, for the prologue set in ancient Egypt that covers the tale of En Sabah Nur is intriguing, brilliantly shot &amp; brims with excitement. Even the segment dealing with Eric's life in Poland is quite fascinating but the remainder of the plot fails to keep the interest alive as it delves into a familiar territory and ultimately finishes on a dull, predictable &amp; uninteresting note. Simon Kinberg's screenplay isn't up to the mark either plus it appears as if he wrote the script in a hurry by skipping over deeper character introspections &amp; proper polishing of the final draft, just so that the film can make it to its theatrical release date.Production design team once again does a stellar job at recreating the given timeline. Cinematography aims for a darker tone than its predecessors, the desaturated colour palette adds a grim vibe to its frames, and although the entire picture is encapsulated with an overcast feel, the images retain its sharpness &amp; clarity. Editing is a total mess, for its 144 minutes of runtime is severely felt during the second half, many moments end up overstaying its welcome as the plot meanders over trivial stuff, and overall, the different subplots fail to merge into a unified whole. Visual effects is state-of-the-art stuff yet much of it comes off as nothing but empty spectacle, and even John Ottman's score is a letdown for the most part.Coming to the performances, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult &amp; Rose Byrne return to reprise their respective roles of Professor X, Magneto, Mystique, Beast &amp; Moira MacTaggert and all of them exhibit greater comfort in their character's skin and play their part convincingly. McAvoy &amp; Fassbender once again stand out from the rest, Lawrence is no slouch either, while both Hoult &amp; Byrne do a capable job with what they are given. Also returning to the fold is Evan Peters as Quicksilver and he pretty much steals the show with another swashbuckling slow-mo sequence but this time, he's beaten by Hugh Jackman whose cameo as Wolverine is a major highlight of X-Men: Apocalypse, in my opinion.The new additions comprise of Oscar Isaac (En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse), Sophie Turner (Jean Grey), Tye Sheridan (Cyclops), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Nightcrawler), Olivia Munn (Psylocke), Alexandra Shipp (Storm) &amp; Ben Hardy (Angel). Playing what's supposed to be the most powerful mutant to surface on the big screen so far, Isaac is totally wasted in his role as Apocalypse fails to live up to his image, is never for once intimidating &amp; is just another addition in the long list of clichéd villains. Turner is more Sansa Stark than Jean Grey here, Smit-McPhee is downright hilarious and plays the comic relief part to near-perfection, while Munn chips in with a strong input. But since she isn't given enough screen time, she is unable to fully explore her character.On an overall scale, lacking the freshness of First Class and creative delights of Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse is the weakest chapter of the three, and it ultimately is to this prequel series what The Last Stand was to the original trilogy. Having directed three films of this franchise previously, this is the first time Singer has struggled to put up a gripping tale about mutants on the film canvas. Not everything is a disaster here but some little refinements in the script would have resulted in a wholly different &amp; better movie. Taking too long to set all its pieces on the board, providing no depth to its new set of characters (especially the main villain), ineffectively handling the arcs of returning characters, putting more emphasis on CGI spectacle &amp; overloaded action, further fractured by its terribly written climax, and downright mediocre in content, X-Men: Apocalypse continues the long-existing Hollywood tradition of finishing a trilogy on a weak, underwhelming &amp; frustrating note. Watch it only if you want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously not the worst comic book film ever (we've all seen Green Lantern)BUT.... too many characters to follow, the whole movie felt disjointed, they tried to pack too many back stories in when it was not needed.All the new fresh faces were pretty cool (goodies and baddies) Quicksilver again was awesome, if anything they should have used him more. Mystique was basically Katniss Everdeen for the whole cowing film! She was probably blue for around 45 seconds in total. McAvoy and Fassbender pull off Professor X and Magneto perfectly, it'll be sad if they do not return in the franchise! So, Apocalypse himself, the dude, actually a bit of a pansy, gets all his horsemen to do all his dirty work and just stands there with both hands raised addressing the public for the majority of the film. And whoever designed his costume will probably come to regret it in years to come.Overall, the film was OK, with the cast that they had and the budget this should be one of the best films of the year however it falls short. First Class was awesome, Days of Future Past was even better, Apocalypse though.....I would probably wait until it comes on Netflix.Last but not least.........Hugh freaking Jackman!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to comics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critics have not been too generous with this latest addition of X-men's prequels, sequels, reboots and spinoffs. The dissatisfactions expressed have generally been valid: too crowded, insufficient character development, usage-fatigued mega-disasters, unconvincing pseudo depths, among other faults and flaws. One fair question though: what does this movie really want to achieve. Would the modest desire be simply to bring the comic book to the movie screen, as suggested by my summary line? In view of this, rather than reinventing the wheels with the generous space alloted by IMDb, I would simply use it to have a crack at organizing the proliferation of character and events with a view to jocking the potential audience's memory when time comes to see the next instalment (production plan, if any, not yet announced). Space allowing, I'll perhaps add a few words on selected members of the cast.After the reboot-cum-prequel "X-men: First Class" (2011) came "X-men: Days of Future Past' (2014). This third McAvoy-Fassbender corroboration, "Apocalypse", is more like an alternate sequel to "First Class" than a sequel to "Days of Futures Past". The best support of this view is in the motif-like reference to "a beach in Cuba" (the iconic conclusion of "First Class"), culminating in Xavier restoring the memory of Agent Moira Mactaggert.I counted a total of 13 significant mutants, which is one more than the number of superheroes in "Captain America: Civil War". But forget the number. In "Civil War" the 12 superheroes are divided into two camps, locked in titanic battle. Here in "Apocalypse", there is no symmetry. Here is how things go.The chief villain Apocalypse is an Egyptian demigod awakened after 3000 years sleep, as Moira discovers to her horror, to destroy the world. Angel and Nightcrawler, who have had their respective small parts before, are first seen here as gladiators in a fighting rink in Germany. Rescued by Raven, who is a free agent at this juncture, they take separate roads. Nightcrawler follows her to the School for Gifted Children where she intends to rejoin Xavier, albeit temporarily. Angel degenerate into an alcoholic delinquent, but is soon sought out by Apocalypse, who collects also young Storm (and turns her hair white in the course of enhancing her power) and Psylocke (who had such a forgettable part in "X-men: The Last Stand" that I have absolutely no recollection of it whatsoever). Meanwhile, Magneto working in a factory in Poland has his identity accidentally discovered, consequently ending his idyllic life with the killing of wife and daughter by the soldier coming to fetch him. Predictably, he becomes another collection of Apocalypse and, together with the other three, makes up the Four Horsemen in Biblical fashion.In the School for Gifted Children, Professor X, with Beast as right-hand man and Havok as another assistant, carries out his noble task of education of mutants (and eventually also normal children, as he intimates later in the movie). Upon arrival, Cyclopes (introduced by his brother Havok) recognizes a kindred spirit in Jean Grey, two mutants agonizing over the inability to control their respective power. Then, as aforementioned, Raven brings Nightcrawler. Finally, Quicksilver who made quite an impression in "Day of Future Past" joins the rank, arriving in the nick of time to save all the students from a collapsing and exploding campus (Apocalypse's handiwork, needless to say) ? all except one, and no spoiler here. Have you counted 13? Don't bother. I am not counting.What follows is all but predictable: good ultimately triumphs over evil, with some characters converted from evil to good at least until the chief villain is obliterated. It looks like there is room left for a few words on the cast. If you are kind enough to read on, please have the IMDb cast page ready for flipping back and forth.McAvoy and Fassbender together anchor and carry the rebooted series and will continue to do so. Lawrence has a key role to play here but there are some suggestions that she will fade out. Entirely as a box-office gambit, we see Jackman in an uncredited brief appearance which, however, is much longer than his two-word-dialogue appearance in "First Class". Hoult and Bryne I suppose will carry on, and likely Evans as Quicksilver. Of the newcomers, the obviously more dominant roles are Tye Sheridan as Cyclops and Sophie Turner (a very familiar face of Sansa Stark if you follow that TV series) as Jean Grey. I have left Oscar Isaac last because I don't think we are going to see Apocalypse the villain again. Still this talented, versatile actor brings to this character a little more than the stereotypic writing calls for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything they've built......will FALL!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'X-Men: Apocalypse' is the 9th 'X-Men' film (Deadpool and The Wolverine included), and the 4th directed by Bryan Singer. As much as I wanted to love this movie, it still fell short of what it's capable of.1. The story itself does come with intrigue as an ancient and the world's first mutant; 'Apocalypse' (Oscar Isaac), is awakened in 1983. He intends to cleanse the world by causing it's destruction with the help of his four powerful mutant horsemen: Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Angel (Ben Hardy) &amp; Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Apocalypse is also out to possess the world's most powerful mind, that is Charles Xavier's (James McAvoy), hence the X- Men, lead by Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), must stand against a God and prevent worldwide destruction. If anything else, the film keeps you engaged enough to wonder how it will all end.2. Character development is lacking, especially when it comes to Mystique. For all the cool action and acrobatic fighting this character does, it's completely abandoned in this film. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't seem to be invested in playing Mystique as she was before, which is a big let down. Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are clearly the most dedicated, with the latter giving a more outstanding performance. The film features more mutant characters than the previous ones, and it's obvious that a proper balance wasn't found since we never really get a solid grasp of the new and younger mutants.3. As for 'Apocalypse' himself, Oscar Isaac portrays him as a cold and menacing entity for the first third of the film, but it's not long until we realize how one-dimensional he is. The suit he wears is interesting enough, but his head and face was a failed attempt by the make-up department. For being the most powerful mutant, he barely puts up a strong enough fight against the X-Men as he is blasted and impaled to his death. As far as villains go, Apocalypse feels less threatening than Bolivar Trask (Days of Future Past) and even Ajax (Deadpool), when he shouldn't have been, which makes his involvement in this film even worse. 4. Nicolas Hoult (Beast) and Evan Peters (Quicksilver) also return, followed by a handful of newcomers. Younger versions of; Cyclops, Jean, Storm and Nightcrawler are introduced, but only to indicate their existence/involvement in (possible) future films. Hugh Jackman has a short segment in the film where he once again portrays the infamous 'Wolverine', except this time he's under control as 'Weapon X'. Jackman's participation in this was obviously a bridge towards his next and final 'Wolverine' film, as well as fan-service to entertain the audience with a little bloody action.5. The action is only impressive to where we've seen it done before in the same franchise. 'Quicksilver' in particular has a similar sequence like he did in the previous film, where he rescues all the students as the X-Mansion is destroyed. There are too many sequences where it's CGI and not character driven. The images of cities and monuments being destroyed is impressive visually, but it goes on to an extent where you lose interest after a while. Things are not as chaotic as 'The Last Stand', but you would have hoped that the film-makers learned and not repeat past mistakes. Bryan Singer does a competent job, but yet he fails to surpass himself, making this the weakest 'X-Men' film under his direction. I personally hold 'Days of Future Past' as the greatest 'X-Men' film thus far, so I'm still interested and have high hopes for this franchise moving forward.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually great...Storyline poor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will make it short...this movie was visually great and the acting by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Oscar Isaac was awesome.But as usual we have a Marvel movie that does not quite stick to the comic. Apocalypse is supposed to be immortal and invulnerable. So, I was surprised that he had to transfer bodies and that he was defeated. Bryan Singer could have have written a different ending to make the movie more interesting.We have mutants that powers were enhanced to their full potential by Apocalypse and yet were easily beaten by these little inexperienced children.For once, I would love to see a movie where the human race actually gets defeated and mutants gets to rule. Charles X needs to grow up and realize that the human race will never accept mutants and we cannot live together in peace. Humans needs to realize who's boss and submit.Isn't that how the world is since day 1. Submission to those who are the most powerful. Food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passable run-of-the-mill superhero fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ensemble of mutants spanning generations are involved in this likable but clichéd comic fare. Here, the mutants have to fight the first mutant of them all, En Sabah Nur, an ancient Egyptian supervillian played an inexpressive Oscar Isaac who's lost under the layers of CGI.En Sabah Nur- also known as the titular Apocalypse- awakes from his millennia long slumber in his pyramid where he was entombed to find that non-mutants rule the Earth and have the vanity of to call their political entities "superpowers". The movie builds to an inevitable crash-bang-wallop conclusion; and with the other recently released superhero movies focusing on the collateral damage from their squabbles, the increasing levels of destruction in the finale feels incredibly lightweight. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender add an element of gravitas to the acting but the cast are hampered by the script which involved clichéd lines and self-referential jokes which fall flat. And with a running time well over two hours, it is a baggy and bloated affair.With the three spring comic-book blockbusters now released, Apocalypse slots in somewhere between Civil War and Batman vs Superman in the pecking order. It's an acceptable film, but if you are an X-Men fan looking for character development and some substance beyond the surface level spectacle, this is not it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've loved the X-Men since I was a kid with the comics and the awesome animated series but I have a love/hate relationship with these movies. I love being in the universe but I hate the inconsistency and completely skewed timeline of these movies!First and foremost, Apocalypse looked horrendous! Absolutely 100% sh*t! The design on his face was done poorly, his voice didn't fit the character, it looked like he was always sweaty and he looked like he was painted a different colour. At least characters from Marvel Studios like Ronan and Gamora looked like they were actually that colour!Apparently Jubilee is supposed to be in this movie ? could have fooled me! At no point is her name ever mentioned, she has only a couple of lines and never uses her powers! So very disappointing!I was quite disappointed in Angel/Archangel, his timeline was ruined by this movie and also Psylocke, who felt like she was just in it to look pretty ? never mentioned her name and we got no story at all.Can we please just go one X-Men movie without Wolverine! All these little cameos that don't really serve much purpose.There were good moments in this film, like the new additions to the cast, and bad ones too, namely Apocalypse!It was awesome to see the Danger Room and to see the characters in costumes that seem to have gotten some inspiration from the original comic and cartoon versions.I will watch it again, probably buy it on Blu-ray but I always have to wonder; what would Marvel Studios do if they had X-Men!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So the era of big budget messy comic book films continues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not Bryan Singer's fault. I love the usual suspects and the first two X-Men films. I can definitely see a leaky script and studio meddling here.I don't get it? Why does every comic book film since the advent of the Avengers have to be these poorly paced bloated CGI messes? And are we really following the messy continuity and character arcs of First Class ?Re-watching Singer's first 2 films I realised how brilliant they are and how much I dislike everything since. Those first two films basically showed us how less is more. I found it strange how back in 2000, when comic-book films were still finding their footing, Fox decided to adapt one of Marvel's longest running and convoluted properties of a team of superheros where the roster constantly changes. Especially with a relatively low budget considering what they cost now. But it worked, since Singer stuck to limiting the characters, grounding the story and stylistic elements and focusing on the main themes of persecution and prejudice. And they hold up really well.It was unfortunate how the first two films focused a little too much on Wolverine. But hey, the character is the most popular and he serves a purpose so it really never bothered anyone. However for this new reboot/prequel series, I DO NOT CARE ABOUT MYSTIQUE! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER HAPPEN! STOP TRYING TO MAKE HER A PIVOTAL CHARACTER! I don't care that the studio got Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence to play her. She is a shapeshifter, what good is that going to do when you are fighting a demigod who can bend reality?Oh yeah the villain, Apocalypse. He is your generic villain that wants to end the world while ensnaring other mutants to do his bidding while he speaks in a Buffalo Bill monotone. What you expected a villain on par with Ian McKellan's Magneto or Brian Cox's Stryker who were actually layered and multi-dimensional? And yeah Fassbender's Magneto is so all over the place? What are his ideologies? What are his convictions? Why is he still on good terms in Prof X even though he paralysed him and dropped a baseball stadium over the white-house only furthering the fear of mutants? Usually I moan about character development especially with a film that features an ensemble cast, but actually some were done right. Jean Grey and Cyclops were actually pretty interesting. We see them young and trying to develop their powers, although still they have yet to explain why Cyclops can't control his beams while his eyes are opened (hitting his head in a plane crash). And Jean Grey is mostly a telekinetic so why did they focus on her telepathy so much? The Quicksilver scenes were awesome as usual with his slowed down perception. One character who I felt somewhat got the Shaft was storm, as early in the film she became Apocalypse's underling. She is one of my favourite X-Men and is very powerful but we don't see her use them in a useful way.The pacing. There is one sub-plot which came out of nowhere and was used for fan service. And the many of the Mystique scenes.Ultimately this suffers from Age of Ultron syndrome. This is not a bad movie. Nowhere near the mess of Batman vs Superman. However it does not have the balance of Captain America Civil War. It is still another CGI orgy. In the end I really like the first two Singer films. They were so in tune with the themes of the comic book and didn't really care about the look so this film is not my cup of tea. If you like the flashy stuff and not really care about character dynamics then you should be fine with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to read all the negative hype a movie gets, and then go into the movie with a clear mind without being persuaded, even a little, by what you have read. That's why it's better (in my opinion) to stay clear of any sort of review linking to a movie you're about to see, especially one you are dying to see. That was the case with X-Men: Apocalypse. Even though I don't necessarily agree with every negative review written about the movie, I will say that I agree that it's above "BVS", and below "CA: CW". The biggest culprit for the movie being somewhat lousy is the acting. I didn't think any of the younger versions of the X-Men (Cyclops, Jean, Storm and Nightcrawler) did any particular good job, and in no way did any of them look like their older "movie" versions. Olivia Munn looks beautiful, but her acting was pretty bad, and the funny part is she didn't have many lines. Ben Hardy's "Angel" was very unlikable (for the wrong reasons), and added NOTHING to the movie, except a cool look. Even "X-Men" veterans, McAvoy and Lawrence, were not as good this time around. Their performances felt very forced, and just corny. Oscar Isaac did an excellent job as Apocalypse. Even though I've only read a handful of comics, and I was a fan of the 1990's cartoon, I thought this version of Apocalypse carried through very well. The calm and subtle vibe he keeps through most of the movie is more frightening than anything. His powers are incredible, and I also love the explanation of how he received all his powers; it totally makes sense. His voice goes from being soft to booming, which is what everyone was hoping from the character. He's menacing, which is why it kind of sucked that they killed him off that easily. I was expecting a lot more fight than what we received. Once more, Evan Peter's "Quicksilver", steals the show. From his very first scene he's amazing. The five minute "mansion scene", was incredible and hilarious. What's great this time around is he's not all humor. Sure, a majority of his part is comic relief; but he also has his serious moments which helped flesh out his character more. Other small things I loved: Jackman's cameo, not as "Wolverine", but as "Weapon X". For the people who wanted the blood crazy, berserker Wolverine, this one is for you. The helmet he's wearing; his outfit of straps and nothing else; this felt like it was ripped right from the comics and cartoon and I freaking loved it. He has a total of zero lines, and his scene was bloody fun to watch. Speaking of straight from the comics and cartoon: The costumes at the very end, Mystique's and Cyclops's, will make every X-Men fan happy. Even if their acting was sub-par, the homage to the costumes in the end was well appreciated. Besides some un-impressing acting, some bad CGI, and some very corny dialogue, the movie is very fun otherwise. Enjoy the good moments, and try to bare through the bad ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The third one's always the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this isn't technically the 3rd film in the ever expanding X-Men franchise, but it is the 3rd in the prequel trilogy, and it's hopefully the last. X-Men Apocalypse is about the alleged first mutant who wants to "cleanse" the Earth and keep alive only the strong. The X-Men try to stop him, and the film starts in Ancient Egypt and this is never a good sign as the plot has too many strands which makes it rather complex. This isn't a criticism as all the plot elements are nicely brought together and overall the plot is OK. Michael Fassbender returns as Magneto and his character is seen in a different light in the 1st act; it's good character development for Magneto. Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy do what you expect them to do, which is put in good performances. They aren't challenged as the script is nothing special but it's certainly not the worst writing I've seen.So what I've said so far suggests the film is mediocre and this is true but it needn't of been. The part of the film, leading up to the final battle is actually pretty enjoyable. It moves along well and I was really getting into the film. Couple this with Quicksilver's scene( the best part of the film by a mile) and it looks like a grand finale is in store. However, the finale is very predictable, as you could easily guess what was going to happen and there was no intrigue there at all. It was very standard action movie CGI stuff, so I actually found it pretty boring and it really spoils the good work of the rest of the film. It feels like the film builds to a climax that isn't what is should be: it's just a CGI, seen it all before fest. Despite this, the newcomers Ben Hardy and Sophie Turner excel in there roles and show why they should be in more blockbusters in the future.Overall, the decent script and decent acting can't help X-Men Apocalypse which loses it way in the final act, even though the promise was there. The predictability of the finale and the CGI heavy action really make it boring. I'm all for action scenes but this needed to feel more realistic (if that's possible in a superhero film) and more physical. I enjoyed parts of it, but it could of been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat collage of the whole series, despite structural flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm happy to say that I quite liked it. It's not great, and I'll get into the criticisms, but there's definitely quality to it, making it worth the ticket. I'll go through the things I liked, the things I didn't and try to end this with a summary. No spoilers here."X-men: Apocalypse" could easily be called "X-men: Everything". It crams so much in one movie that it's almost like a collage of the whole series. It's not just about fighting a villain, and all the themes/elements we are familiar with are there. When you add gritty violence for a PG13-movie, plenty of '80s nostalgia plus nods and tie-ins (some of them being quite smart) to the other movies, we have a lot to soak in. It feels like a celebration of the series. Plenty of fan-service to be had, including the very last shots of the movie. This installment resembles a comic book or the cartoon series more than any other X-men movie before.The already cluttered timeline isn't tampered further. "X-men Apocalypse" lets the audience enjoy what they get without further complications, while paying respect to the previous films as well. It also manages to be its own movie while still setting up a certain fan-favorite storyline towards the end. The fact that it holds together without totally breaking apart is an achievement.The sheer amount of material demands a slow build, and it takes quite a while for "X-men: Apocalypse" to hit its groove. So much to do, so many characters, so many beats to hit. For me, it kept getting better and better towards the end. The last 40 minutes are devoted to action, but unlike what I heard, it isn't just idiotic carnage. The battles have narrative and emotional elements to them. This is what I always loved about Singer's X-men movies: the action is part of the drama, never full-blown noise and fury without any purpose or weight. It's all charmingly confined, and the scale is only huge on the surface. Politics and military are left out, which is a plus.The main newcomers to the cast were good! Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee were immediately likable and convincing. Considering that they play some of the most beloved characters in the universe, the happier I am for them. If these three continue making these movies, I'll continue to see them. Oscar Isaac was good too, although the heavy prosthetics and some clumsy writing weren't helping. He had to be better than what he was given. Fassbender, McAvoy and Peters are solid professionals, even though the writing for their characters fluctuated throughout the movie as well. All three, especially Peters and Fassbender, got to steal some scenes. Nicholas Hoult is his likable self. I'm still not sold on Jennifer Lawrence, but thankfully the movie isn't centered around her as much as I feared. Overall the cast was more than fine. I've always liked Tom Sigel's cinematography, and this one is no exception. The colors, the lighting, shot composition and camera-work overall are handled very well. I liked many of the sets, and generally the film pleased my eye, looking like a movie should. John Ottman composed his best score yet. The familiar theme music is there, but I recognized an entirely new theme too, and it worked beautifully in its simplicity. The craft of cinema is well represented.On to the criticisms. The pacing feels clunky and the narrative disjointed. The amount of material requires a lot of juggling, and "X-men: Apocalypse" struggles to find its tone and focus. It doesn't have a tight core to it. It does what it's supposed to do and gets significantly better towards the end, but some of the impact is lost. There are so many transitions that sometimes otherwise good and emotional moments do not pay off in the grand scheme of things.The writing. There are (luckily) many really smart moments in this film, but when the writing is bad, it's noticeable. The dialogue as well as the narrative scene composition can and will feel tacky, blunt or forced at times. Oscar Isaac's Apocalypse is good at best, but sometimes he's reduced to a bunch of clichés. While I like the endless conflict between Xavier and Magneto, they had forced moments too. The movie didn't always "earn" them, and I was reminded of the JFK scene from "Days of Future Past" a few times. Things are handled well enough overall, but screenwriter/producer Kinberg should probably stick to producing.Familiarity. If you are hoping for X-men to tackle all new themes and plotpoints, prepare to be disappointed. It's all very familiar. I didn't mind it, and I'm impressed how they still managed to make these old themes and tie-ins feel worthwhile, but you have been warned.Characters. Some characters are just henchmen or appearances without depth. It's hard to avoid in an ensemble movie like this, and it's not a problem in an already long movie, but fans of many characters will be left wanting. Also, nobody seems to age! I can forgive that in movies like this, but it's a bit weird.To summarize: "X-men: Apocalypse" is a compilation of all familiar X-men themes in one movie that somehow manages to stay intact. It's not tight, it's got some dumb bluntness to it and it can't juggle all the material perfectly, but it's still an ambitious effort and a quality ensemble piece. Some individual, powerful moments and performances carry the movie when needed. Not nearly as good as "X2" or "Days of Future Past", but nowhere near a failure. Recommended for fans of the series and especially the cartoon. Very re-watchable, will buy on blu-ray. I hope Bryan Singer will return to this franchise. If not, at least he tied all the movies together, one last time. Fox, you know what you set up with this one. Don't screw it up. Again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Good Scenes Doesn't Make a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very afraid of this film. I read a couple of critics about it and they said that this is the worst film of Bryan Singer's carrier and the worst x-men movie of all time. The critics were partly right.Probably the worst thing in X-men: Apocalypse is it's extremely slow beginning. When you watch a superhero movie, you expect non-stop action, like in this year's Captain America: Civil War and in the new x-men trilogy: X-men: First Class and X-men: Days of Future Past. The beginning is extremely slow paced, there is only that much action such as in Thomas Alfredson's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and in Terrence Mallick's The New World. The acting is awful. Jennifer Lawrence and Oscar Isaac are look quite untalented in this film. Bryan Singer is a great director (if you won't believe it watch The Usual Suspects or Valkyrie) but he missed the point with this movie. Although there are some good points in X-men: Apocalypse. The scene where Quicksilver save almost everyone from a collapsing building is amazing. Evan Peters really did a great a job. The visual effects are stunning, especially in 3D. Unfortunately, we only get a bit of it in the end fighting scene. Finally, there is a very good cameo from Hugh Jackman. It's sad that Marvel financed this movie a lot more than Deadpool. The worst thing is the action-shortage in it. You can watch it, but it's definitely not worth the price of a cinema ticket.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why be different when you can look like everybody else?" Nightcrawler (the blue-hued teleporter) questions Mystique (the also naturally-blue-hued shapeshifter) in X2, to which she pointedly responds, "because we shouldn't have to".In The Last Stand, Storm, at learning that non-mutants have developed a cure that permanently suppresses the Mutant X-gene, cries, "a cure for all mutants? But we don't need a cure. Since when have we become a disease?"And yet, yet there are others who feel quite differently. Those who will give anything to feel 'normal' and are only too willing to give up that which makes them special. Because just as there is no doubt that innate (and often intimidating) extra-ordinariness renders a mutant as formidable, so too it is certain that it makes one aberrant in the eyes of others, such power-possessors only just about managing to outpace vilification, then rejection, social ostracization and even the threat of extermination.Which path then should the gifted choose for themselves? Should one live as a proud pariah or eternally condemn oneself to the fate of inert impotence? The question itself poses a seething paradox, because even if one were to pick the former things won't ever grow easy, the risks attendant with pacifism or aggression, the only two approaches available, then springing to life, accentuated further by the one immutable dimension to the mutant conundrum: the inability of humans to rise above their prejudices.It is these emotionally resonant thematic threads that have since its inception set the XMen series apart from other superhero productions, interwoven as they are through deftly layered and penetrating allegory: the omnipotent thesis being the trials and inner conflicts of social misfits, the discrimination and dilemmas faced by minorities, be they ethnic, sexual, religious or whatever. Should a people assert the right to coexist under the umbrella of a proud and distinct identity or should they always aspire to blend in with the mainstream? Is society hardwired to fear those who look and behave differently? Is it possible to convince people to think in a manner that runs counter to their primal instincts? Apocalypse is a great spectacle, as are all the XMen movies without exception. But let's be honest here. Really honest. It is not the best film of the franchise, the thus far unsurpassed one being Days of Future Past followed closely by First Class and X2. And this is chiefly down to the fact that this latest instalment, save for Magneto's backstory, which in retrospect appears tired and stale, fails to pose any searing questions or to explore the though- processes and predicaments of the characters. Instead we're served just another superhero movie populated with a galaxy of CGI-enhanced mutants, whose motivations despite the actors' tremendous performances (especially from the latest entrants), fall emotionally flat. What's more, whilst the previous two instalments in the series drew on historical events in the time-period in which they were set (Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam War), Apocalypse could well have occurred at any time period. The film is none the richer for being set in the 80s. The plot is straightforward. In 1983, the mutant Apocalypse, having amassed the powers of many other mutants over millennia, awakens from a slumber and vows to destroy mankind and take over the world. With the help of his Four Horsemen, Psylocke, Storm, Archangel and a broken Magneto, Apocalypse plans to create a new for mutants-only world. As the earth convulses in doomsday throes, the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier work together to prevent Apocalypse and his team from succeeding.The performances are as usual all superb and the CGI eye-arresting. But the two performances that stand out are those of Jean Grey, whose perceptivity and latent vigour were brought alive to pitch-perfection by Sophie Turner, and of Quicksilver, played by Evan Peters, whose comic relief was so good that I will re-watch the film for just his scenes. I had high expectations from Oscar Isaac, but it seemed like his acting talents have been overmasked by CGI, so much so that he appears as generic a villain as any and his actions are the less menacing for it. Nevertheless, the closing battle scene is as grand and edge-of-the- eat nerve-racking as one might expect of an XMen movie; but do note that its enjoyment and understanding, as of that of the film's as whole, will be compromised on for those not familiar with the events and characters of the previous XMen films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such high hopes ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the X-Men movie I was waiting for. Apocalypse has always been my favorite X-Men villain. I've been waiting to see them do one with this Xavier and Magneto, but introducing the real X-Men team (namely Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, Archangel and Psyclocke among others). This one looked epic. Xavier with his signature bald head, a real powerful villain like Apocalypse. They had rebooted the time-line so they could really do it right. It looked like everything was falling into place for the perfect X-Men movie. So where did it all go wrong?Was it just that Apocalypse makes a bad cinematic villain? He was always my favorite ever since I was 8 years old and I first started reading X-Men comics. Maybe he just doesn't fit into the Singer universe. I admit he may be the most "cartoon evil" of the x-men villains. And some argue he's way too overpowered. But he's also really interesting. Being the first mutant, he's very old. His Darwinist philosophy takes Magneto's Malcolm Xish ultra leftism to such an extreme that it becomes ultra right. This is why you would never see Magneto join with Apocalypse. It's horseshoe theory at its finest. Singer missed an opportunity with that. I don't think he really understood Apocalypse. As soon as he learned all there was about modern humanity by touching the TV I knew I was in for a rough two hours.But I don't think Apocalypse was the primary problem. There were many issues I had with this film. It really seemed like they tried to squeeze too much in to please everyone. Too many characters especially. The sad thing was that these were the characters I was waiting for. Cyclops was always a favorite of mine and none of the films (or cartoons for that matter) had done his character justice. I was really hoping that maybe this time they'd finally get him right. And while I admit they did do a better job with him than before, he's still not the Cyclops I know and love from the comics. Making him the younger brother of Alex was their first mistake. And making it that his powers originated one day in high school and not in a plane crash was their second. Cyclops is a mutant born of tragedy. There's a reason he's so haunted.Psylocke was the worst of all. She looked good, but she was basically just a costume with a psychic sword. No character to her at all. And what was with Archangel? I don't know who that metalhead was, but that was not Warren Worthington III. It's as if Singer didn't know the characters' histories, just how they looked on the covers to the comics.The other characters weren't as bad, but still off. Storm was acted well but seemed way out of character. Nightcrawler was overpowered, but okay. And I don't want to get into too much detail without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say if they're going to retry the Phoenix saga and this time get it right, I think they already messed it up in this film because, once again, Brian Singer doesn't understand where the Phoenix power comes from.But I can forgive them for changing the characters as long as they manage to still make a good film. But I still can't get behind it. Why? Well one more thing that bothered me was how no one aged in the 20 years since First Class. They could have at least put some gray in their hair. They could have had Professor X go bald naturally. Instead he goes bald because of some weird scifi reason that's never explained or even acknowledged. It just seemed like a very minimal amount of effort was put into details like that. Jennifer Lawrence rarely wore her blue skin. Beast rarely ever was Beast. It just felt like they didn't care all that much. Things like that I can't forgive.All the negativity aside, there were some good moments to this film. I really liked the Quicksilver scene. Fassbender and McAvoy had great performances as usual, even given the weak script. There were also some great scenes with the younger X-Men. It reminded me how great it would be to have an X-Men TV show centered around the school. And Apocalypse, though they didn't get him right, still makes for a cool villain regardless. I enjoyed parts of this film. But overall ... not good. I think the main reason was stated in my first paragraph. The bar was set way too high. First Class and Days of Future Passed were great movies and they were setting us up for the X-Men film we all were waiting for. And ultimately, they couldn't deliver it. It was a huge letdown.With the right planning, an Apocalypse film could have worked. Marvel Studios could have pulled it off. But Marvel Studios knows their heroes. They may take liberties with the plot, but they stay true to the characters. A villain like Apocalypse is something you build up to. And a team like the X-Men has as rich a history as the Avengers and requires just as much build up and planning. This is why the Deadpool film was so good. It focused on one character while introducing only a few other X-Men. You can't introduce too many new X-Men at once. You need to introduce them slowly in separate films, THEN bring them together in one big one. Marvel Studios knows how to make a superhero team movie, Brian Singer, take note. If you try to throw it all at us at once, you get a film like this, or like X-Men United.The best line in the film was one Jean Grey said while the younger X-Men were walking out of Return of the Jedi "The third one's always the worst". How sad but true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I appreciate their efforts in making this film and that has provided work to over 15,000 people. But I can not help from telling my own point of view. This guy Magneto would be an ideal worker in a huge iron deposit collection or any other metal, in a scrap yard. And all the other characters would be best to entertain preschoolers, especially those in those centers for children with special needs. Why in every film they must to destroy this world to build a new one? I agree that this world is far from perfect but still... they really do not have anything better to do? Why complete destruction? Seriously now, wouldn't be better to eliminate only the terrorists, the corrupt politicians, the pedophiles, murderers and others like them? Three stars only because the beginning was promising. But the content... I close with the same Magneto: if he is the father of one of the characters, wouldn't be possible that the woman with the sword to be my mother, just for a day or night? I'm an orphan, no father, no mother...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best X-Men film to date; I cannot remember the story of any others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts strong; amateur-Egyptologists will be creaming their jimmies as the villain of the piece and his cronies hand out MK fatalities like clementines at Christmas. In truth, I cannot remember the story of literally any other X-Men instalment going in to this, despite having ostensibly viewed them all at some junction. This one, I feel, will stick in the memory. It stands in stark contrast to it's recent super-hero competition in the form of Civil War, which suffered from a very disjointed and poorly-edited jaunt into comic book obscurity. Apocalypse feels congruent and the through-line is easy to follow ? light touch references to Reagan and the Empire Strikes Back accompanies a tasteful display of 80's fashion ? the 80's aesthetic pays dividends. Dialogue is often hokey but forgivable when you consider the subject matter and it's comic origins. Overall, it was a decent 2-hour time sink that hit more often than miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen every one of the X man movies and the spin offs. The last X Men movie Days of Future Past effectively rebooted the franchise. This means that the characters and their powers may not be quite the same as we have come to expect. I suppose this does add an air of unpredictability, but it does mean that you can become distracted at certain times.Anyway the latest X Man movie sees the worlds first and most powerful mutant reawaken. There's no surprise that he's a bit hacked off and in need of restraint when he starts to vent his anger.As is the case with most X Men movies, this is pretty entertaining although certainly not the best of the franchise. As such it's probably one for the fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually spectacular but underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this latest instalment of the X-Men reboot/prequel franchise, X-Men: Apocalypse had my quite excited. I thoroughly enjoyed both X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days Of Future Past so I figured this third film in the series is sure to deliver.I won't go as far as saying that I didn't enjoy this film, because I did. The effects were flawless, the action sequences were amazing and it was great to see a little bit more about the history of the X-Men. However, the movie left me feeling slightly underwhelmed.Played by the always engaging Oscar Isaac, the main villain in the film lacked motivation for me. I found that whilst I knew what his aim was, I didn't truly connect with what his motivations were. I also felt like there was a huge amount of 'filler' scenes in the lead up to the climax, which had me a little bored. Not only this, but being a stickler for consistency and details, there were two things that bothered me which may not have even registered to any other (sane) human being.Firstly, Sophie Turner plays a younger version of Jean Grey who you may remember from quite a few of the previous X-Men films (played by Famke Janssen). Granted I haven't seen the previous films in a while but I can't really see the resemblance there ? this was particularly bothersome to me when all other characters' prequel counterparts were cast so well. It may be a little nit-picky but I can't change the fact that pathetic things like this annoy me.Secondly, we come to be introduced to an early incarnation of the character Storm. I won't spoil the film for you but all I will say is that she is meant to originate from Egypt yet miraculously when we come to the 'modern day' X-Men, Storm (played by Halle Berry at the time), has a pretty clean cut American accent. You may recall my previous qualms regarding Marvel and the astounding evolving of accents at super- speed in my review for Captain America: Civil War. Again, something that most people won't bat an eyelid at but it's the details that are overlooked which disappoints me. It gives off a vibe that the filmmakers just didn't care enough, and in turn, why should I care about this movie and the characters that reside within it's realm?Other than these small intricacies, I will still maintain that it is an enjoyable film and I do anticipate what's in store for the mutants in films to come. I just hope they at least get their accents right in the next one?motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ranking 'X Men: Apocalypse' alongside the other X Men films, it's for me third weakest. Better than 'Last Stand' and 'Origins' (though even they had merits), but not in the same ball park as 'X Men 2', 'First Class' and especially 'Days of Future Past' (also preferred the solid if yet-to-find-its-feet-feel first film) and only just slightly under 'The Wolverine.' There is a lot to like about 'X Men: Apocalypse'. It looks great, being very slickly filmed and photographed, production design being grittily atmospheric yet audacious, smoothly edited and with effective costumes and make-up. The special effects are of extremely good quality too, the much applauded big Quicksilver scene being particularly note worthy, and there is not an overload or underuse of them. John Ottman makes a welcome return to the series and his score is one of the more memorable and fitting (with that for 'Days of Future Past' getting first prize for the most) of the series since 'X Men 2'. The script provokes thought and doesn't make the mistake of rambling, while the action is dynamically choreographed, thrilling and emotionally charged on the whole.For effective scenes, highlights do have to be a suspenseful and very arresting opening sequence and particularly Quicksilver's super speed life-saving scene, which is one of the series' most jaw-dropping. The story starts off really well and is very diverting with anything with Magneto. There are some terrific performances here, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender (whose character writing is the meatiest here) especially apply here and they make keep the story on point and from completely derailing. Sophie Turner shows off Jean Grey's conflicts and flaws very effectively and touchingly, while Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, Nicholas Hoult continues to be fine as Beast and Hugh Jackman makes a ferociously charismatic cameo.Was mixed on Oscar Isaac (heavily made-up and unrecognisable) and Bryan Singer's direction. Actually Isaac's performance as villain Apocalypse himself is pretty decent and effectively menacing, but it's the clichéd and underwritten way in which Apocalypse is written that prevents Isaac from doing anything that special with the character that stops me from feeling more. People have said that Apocalypse here is more Ivan Ooze-clone than the character of the comic book, and it's easy to see why they would think that, this said Isaac does do a good enough job with what he had. Singer is at home in the style and the action, but when it comes to making the characters and story completely interesting and giving depth to them he isn't quite as confident as he was before, competent and stylistically classy but a bit bland.'X Men: Apocalypse' suffers from being rather too overcrowded, with a fair bit going on and with lots of characters but effectiveness of executions varies wildly. Some good characterisation and great scenes, but a lack of constant dread and urgency and too many characters given short shrift, though nowhere near as badly as in 'Last Stand' and 'Origins'. The pacing is diverting at first but starts to drag once the plot gets more rambling and more bogged down by content. 'X Men: Apocalypse' includes comic relief and romance and they don't come off well, the comic relief is very goofy and at odds tonally with everything else and the romance is completely under-developed.Jennifer Lawrence clearly looks bored too in a complete waste of Mystique, and Olivia Munn is underused and basically just eye-candy in a role that has little depth to her if at all.In conclusion, uneven but still decent. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

If the memory is eliminated from human after each return of the "God" to the earth, what makes the followers keeping on calling the "God" back; If not, why these followers insisting on calling back the "God" to restart the civilization by massive destruction, as the price is so huge. 2) why the "God" need to find teammates, seems he can easily control the human minds (a fact here is he fires all the nuclear to the sky through invading and control the mind of the soldiers)3) the "God"'s intention is destroy the current civilization, seems firing all the nuclear weapons down to the earth is ten times enough to destroy the earth, why he is so stupid. 4) why the "God" is easily be betrayed. what is the motivation of his "teammates", seems not clearly presented.5) finally, why the "God" is defeated without even sweat, a girl who overcomes her inner fear become the last straw of the "God", hard to accept.6&#xff09;I had thought our Magneto is a faithful men, but he had a bastard; and his bastard are eager but reluctant to tell him the truth.....why why why.....even in face of the destroy of the earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Younger versions of the Xmen come together to battle the most powerful mutant in the world, who has been trapped and sleeping since 3500 BC. For me, going to the movies is always a fun night out, but this wasn't necessarily a fun movie. There are some great sequences and some yawn inspiring dialogue... "Use your Powers!" Some really good acting gets lost in poor camera angles and cinematography.The editing and direction seem to weigh down what was probably a decent script. There was probably a better movie there, but the editor didn't find it. This movie suffers from the same meandering that plagued Last Stand. The over-use of CGI, especially in the final battle sequence didn't help either. Characters that are wasted: Magneto, Angel, Jubilee, Havoc and definitely Jean Grey. Characters that shine, Apocalypse, Cyclops, Quicksilver(when he's not spouting awkward dialogue). Worst chemistry between James Mcavoy and Rose Byrne, surprising given how well they worked in First Class. It's worth seeing just for a few standout sequences though, especially another great quicksilver rescue and a psychic battle of the minds. Miscellaneous thought, the opening night 3D viewing I attended at 730pm was almost empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Marvel X-Men movies have been overall a great success, especially the previous two before this, First Class and Days of Future Past, this was the third film to feature the principal characters in their younger guises, directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns, Valkyrie). Basically powerful En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (Ex Machina's Oscar Isaac) is the very first mutant, he rules ancient Egypt until he is betrayed and entombed alive by his worshippers, but he is preserved. In 1983 (ten years since the events of Days of Future Past), Apocalypse is awakened, believing that without his presence humanity has lost its way he decides to destroy and recreate the world, he recruits mutants and upgrades the powers of young Cairo pickpocket Ororo Munroe aka Storm (Alexandra Shipp). Metal-controlling mutant Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is living in Poland with his wife and daughter, authorities attempt to capture him, his family are accidentally killed, he retaliates and kills the men, Apocalypse approaches the disheartened Erik, reminds him of his past in Auschwitz, and recruits him. In East Berlin, shape-shifting mutant Raven Darkhölme aka Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) is investigating to find other mutants, she finds an underground fight club, she rescues Kurt Wagner aka Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who can teleport, moments after this Apocalypse recruits and enhances the powers of mutants Warren Worthington III aka Angel (EastEnders' Ben Hardy) and Elizabeth Braddock aka Psylocke (Olivia Munn). Scott Summers aka Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) has developed mutation, shooting optic beams, he is taken by his fellow mutant brother Alex aka Havok (Lucas Till) to the X- Mansion in Westchester County, New York where founder Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Hank McCoy aka Beast (Skins' Nicholas Hoult) can teach him to control his abilities. Scott meets telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and they develop an attraction, Raven brings Kurt to the institute and informs Xavier about Magneto, then Apocalypse's powers cause disturbance across the world, Xavier and Alex consult CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) who has been researching the legend of Nur. While using mutant-locating computer Cerebo, Xavier has Apocalypse hack into his mind, using his power to force all global superpowers to launch Earth's entire nuclear arsenal into space, Apocalypse and his team later arrive at the mansion to kidnap Xavier. Alex attempts to stop them, but causes an explosion, coincidentally Peter Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Evan Peters) was arriving, hoping to get help to find Magneto, who he has learned is his father, he arrives in time and uses his super-speed to evacuate everyone during the explosion, Alex is presumed dead. Hank, Raven, Peter and Moira are subsequently arrested by the forces of Colonel William Stryker (Josh Helman), taken to the Weapon X facility for interrogation, Scott, Jean and Kurt secretly follow, rescue their comrades, and get some help from Stryker's brainwashed experiment Weapon X, this is in fact Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who Jean partially restores the memory, he escapes. Commanded by Apocalypse, Erik uses his powers to control Earth's magnetic poles, causing worldwide destruction and casualties, following a secret telepathic message from Xavier, Jean directs the X-Men to Cairo to battle Apocalypse and his lieutenants. They rescue the professor before En Sabah's consciousness is transferred to his body, Xavier loses his hair during the process, Angel is defeated in battle, Erik and Ororo are convinced to turn on En Sabah, keeping him occupied while Xavier fights him in the astral plane (the celestial world of souls). Finally Xavier pleads with Jean to unleash the full might of her powers, she appears to destroy Apocalypse, Psycholocke flees, in the aftermath Moira's past memories of Xavier are restored, Erik and Jean rebuild the school, Erik leaves having turned down Xavier's offer to teach, and Raven guides new X-Men, Scott, Jean, Hank, Ororo, Kurt and Peter to train for battles ahead. The end of the film also sees Stryker collecting a blood sample of "Weapon X" on behalf of the Essex Corporation. Also starring Lana Condor as Jubilation Lee aka Jubilee, Tómas Lemarquis as Caliban, The Breakfast Club's Ally Sheedy as Scott's Teacher and Stan Lee as Fearful Man. The cast who have returned are again great, new additions are mostly terrific, Peters does steal the show in his speedy scene, I agree with critics Isaac is a bit stiff as the villain, the story is certainly understandable, there are the right amount of slow moments as well as spectacular scenes of fights and things blowing up, meaning a lot of amazing special effects, it may have partly predictable stuff, but overall it is an enjoyable fantasy action adventure. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the end of the world as we know it. Xmen Apoclypse completes(?) the pre-sequel trilogy of Xmen films with less of a bang and more of a meh. The film is alright but lacks that special moment/ scene that stands out and would make it memorable.The cast as a whole were fine, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender, James Mcavoy and the rest of the original prequel gang resume their roles, slipping back into them seamlessly like a pair of old slippers. The newbies on the other hand never truly get their chance to shine in this film. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan are given the most opportunity in the feature but others like Angel, Psylocke, Storm and Jubilee (especially) are given very little to do and overall serve very little purpose to the film. The film is 144 minutes so I would have thought there would be a little more of an introduction than what we actually get. Don't even get me started on the depleting relevance of Rose Byrne's Moira McTaggart and how Nightcrawler wore the Thriller Jacket first.Wolverine makes a cameo appearance in this film because its Xmen, and no Xmen movie is complete without Huge Jackedman reprising his role again even if it is to tell our protagonists to f*ck off. Although aimed to be a cool little cameo it doesn't get the yay from the crowd it aims for due to how often Hugh Jackman has played Logan.Genertic is one word that could be used to describe the story of Xmen Apocalypse. An Achient Evil Awakens with a plot to destroy or world. Yeah yeah yeah we have seen it all before. There just isn't anything really new about this film as it seems to follow basic superhero movie formulas and even recycles the Quicksilver scene so often that they even made a Sky Fibre advert doing it. Talk about overdoing something just because it was received well the first time. It was still cool to see but I do feel they have ripped away the wow factor it achieved in Days of Future Past.So the film has a few too many characters to utilise properly and follows a generic end of the world plot, this all could have worked well if the film had that one unique point about it. Sadly it doesn't have Tyrion Lannister or that Quicksilver scene to really get people talking. The film feels like its keeping steady and it just needs that peak moment to make the audience go WOW.Overall Xmen Apocalypse was a bit disappointing to be honest. Jean Grey's comment about the third film being the worst is a funny burn to Brett Ratner with Last Stand but ironically to me she is referring to this film as well, being the worst of the prequel trilogy. And the end credit scene is pretty crap, setting up for the next Wolverine film which on the bright side can only get better after the last two sucking but we shall have to wait and see Bub.</fullReview>

Specially after watching Deadpool i expected it to be a treat and it started quite fairly while introducing the characters. The fall of En Sabah Noor/Apocalypse was a treat to watch. But as it progressed it started to become dull. Here i will compare it with Captain America civil war. The humor quotient in Captain America civil war transformed it from a good movie to an excellent movie and lack of that humor quotient has restricted this movie to a OK kind of flick. It is excessively serious and too much emotionally charged and there is no comic relief at all which can make you feel dizzy if you are a fan of typical formula superhero movies. Acting is good. Oscar Issac as Apocalypse is a winner so is Michael fassbender as Magneto. James McAvoy and his troops deserved a bit more screen time as they are the heroes but still they are good and tolerable but the real heroes here are the special effects which succeed in keeping you at the edge of your seat until the climax. In the end the length of the movie is too long and filled with melodramatic crap which was not required at all. It is another forgettable average x men flick which can be watched once...</fullReview>

I guess it's still worth to actually see the movie in the movie theaters, if you are a fan, but it's definitely one of those movies I would never ever see again... Despite being en X-Men fan.

I personally believe this film is actually pretty good. In fact its great set up to an expanding universe. But with all the arcs, and a villain that feels lacklaster and not as grand and dangerous as initially set up to be. I see this new xmen film as just enjoyable set up to potential more grand. This feels as if it is brain singer's way to try and reintroduced and revamp the xmen franchise with our old classics for a new generation. Its alright, nothing amazing or spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of contradiction in the Marvel universe...quite average movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big X-men fan and this movie is nothing I expected. I've seen it a few days ago so I had time to think about it. At first I thought, it was okay, a bit slow, a bit about nothing, but they show a little background story of all the characters, fine. But if I haven't read any comic book or seen x-men cartoons in my life, just the first three movie, there are also a lot of contradiction. First, how could it be, that Mystique is an all positive character, who saves the day, when in the past movies (you know, in the future), she's the most loyal servant of Magneto and in the comics, she is the one, who brings Apocalypse to life? Oh, I know the answer! And it's not that in the Days of future past the future changed...It's because Jennifer Lawrence plays here the same role, as in the Hunger Games. I know that role fits her well, but...My other big problem was Jean controlling the red Phoenix. How on Earth could she do that, while through the first trilogy she has no power to overcome is, that's what kills everyone, including herself? So mostly things like these made me feel that we lost the reality of the story just for a magical happy ending.Of course, there are good sides of the movie. The scenes' of Quicksilver are funny, there plenty of jokes for my taste, for example when the Jean and the others come out from the cinema and they all agree, that the third part of a trilogy is always the worst (so much self irony:D). The CGI was beautiful and I really cried, when Magneto lost his family, despite it was obvious from the beginning, that they will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good climax to the trilogy but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the first two of the new X-Men movies, I had hoped that the third one in the trilogy would bring something slightly different to what we've already seen in previous movies. Apocalypse being one of my all time favourite comic villains, I couldn't wait to see this omnipotent being come to life on the big screen. First Class was great, DOFP was fantastic and I really wanted this to be exquisite, but unfortunately it fell short of exquisite to just being 'quite good'. I enjoyed it as part of a trilogy, as a good end to an otherwise great series. It had a lot of fanfare, which I really enjoyed, I loved that they included the retro comic book look of the characters. I really enjoyed the cameos of certain characters like Jubilee, who we all remember from comics and TV series. I even enjoyed the plot for the most part, but what I didn't much like much was Apocalypse himself. I always thought when watching the trailer that his look, voice and overall demeanour didn't really match what I would imagine an intimidating being would look like. I remember watching the cartoons and really feeling intimidated by this all powerful being, but I didn't much feel the same way whilst watching Oscar Isaacs version of him. That's not to say Isaac played him badly, on the contrary, I think he done a great job, but I think the character could have been made so much better than what he was. It just seemed like certain scenes were just squeezed in, with odd lines that Apocalypse would say, which didn't much fit with the scene in which he was saying it. The horsemen were really good, I really liked their looks and powers, very good interpretation of the comics. Though I thought that Psylocke and Angel were very underused and would liked to have seen more of them, perhaps a bit of back story. I enjoyed Alexandra Shipp's portrayal of Storm and her African accent was great, much better than Halle Berry's version in my opinion and I hope to see more of her in future instalments. There was a good amount of humour to the movie, which seemed at times a little forced, but overall understandable, as it needed to balance the really dark parts, which there were some. At times I even thought to myself that it could have actually been a 15 rating (R-rated) movie. Quicksilver, there's not much to say, but great as usual, funny, awesome, fast and his slow-mo scene cool, not DOFP awesome, but definitely very cool! The story was very good, very much an Age of Ultron type story, cleansing the world etc, but that was always Apocalypse' goal and they got that pretty much on point. The last fight scene will leave everyone pretty excited for the future of X'Men and the different story lines that could be adopted. I left the cinema feeling like I had a good time, but with something slightly missing. It's definitely worth watching, there is an after credit scene, which isn't really worth staying for, but you might as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie began, it has this very exciting feeling I have. That's because the story telling is good. There were a lot of cool scenes in this movie like Quicksilver saving everyone from the explosion of the school, Wolverine slashing his way out of the military base, Jean Grey releasing her full potential and many more. Even with so many cool scenes, there are also things that came to disappointment. For example, Apocalypse. They actually killed him off in this movie which is pretty underwhelming. Not all of Apocalypse's powers were shown. Psylocke just went away for no apparent reason. Apocalypse's real goal isn't clear either. It's sad to say that this movie isn't as good/great as X-Men: Days Of Future Past.In conclusion, X-Men Apocalypse is a cool movie. Lots of cool scenes but it has its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Bryan giveth, then he taketh away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2000, Bryan Singer shook Hollywood with X-Men: a blockbuster that dared to take comic book superheroes seriously and intelligently. Now, in 2016, he bequeaths us X- Men: Apocalypse - the most dire sabotage to the genre's longevity and credibility we've seen since...well, X-Men Origins: Wolverine (and, amazingly, just as excruciating). My theory? Singer has consciously treated his fourth X-Men as a piece of holistic, self-reflexive, self-loathing performance art. You wanted an Apocalypse? You got one, all right. You'd expect the film's critical lambasting proceeding the airtight Days of Future Past to be hyperbole. But no - X-Men: Apocalypse really is THAT intolerable. Many have pointed to the film's Return of the Jedi "the third one is always the worst" quip turned horribly ironic prophecy for the First Class trilogy. But what if this wasn't just a smarmy, overconfident boast backfiring hilariously? What if the film is literally cheerfully prophesying its own awfulness? Screenwriter Simon Kinberg (whose ongoing employment after penning both X-Men 3 AND 2015's Fantastic Four speaks to a deep, virulent masochism on Fox's part) meticulously collects Every. Single. One. of the superhero genre's most loathed tropes, and rubs them in audience faces to such a nauseating extreme I felt a rash breaking out over my corneas. Oodles of stilted, snoozy exposition, and uber-serious self-important melodramatic posturing? Check. Risible, shoehorned-in love scenes? Yup ("I'm on a beach" is in danger of becoming the new "Martha" or "Brutasha" of boneheaded superhero movie maneuvers). A plot that careens from subplot to subplot like a drunken mosquito, each only in service in the interests of (sigh) universe building, yet still unreasonably stagnant and draggy? Oh yes. A climactic blow-out so bloated with incompetent, aimless CGI it nearly outdoes Hulk's murky mess of a lake battle that then devolves into a literal, beat-by-beat remake of Fant4stic's mortifying, rushed final boss battle? Oh COME ON. This is beyond surgical, histrionically poor filmmaking. This is Fox watching the world burn. You can practically taste Singer's desperation to ape as many iconic X-tropes as possible for fear that he won't get another chance, including clumsily reintroducing his original roster, but it only makes the film more contemptuous. At one point the plot gets - literally - hijacked just to devote the film's middle third to an extraneous William Stryker/Weapon X Hugh Jackman cameo. And yes, in spite of the material's almost unquenchable coolness, it's a dud too. Singer can't even be bothered to keep up the campy, pop-art political subtext of the last two X-outings, despite the almost irresistibly spoofable Reagan administration. But, lest you find his film insufficiently profound, he has a peeved Magneto...um...destroy Auschwitz. Um. Wow. I'll just let the seismic tastelessness of that sink in, and scuttle on. Surely, you plead, there's solace to be found in our beloved cast of lovable mutants? Not so. Most of the movie alternates between the cast of actor-props practicing their constipation stares as they feign telekinetically moving/dissolving things. By the final third, the main attraction is Jennifer "Speechsnoring" Lawrence, Rose Bryne, and Sophie Turner attempting to aggressively under-act one another (Turner wins; we have an actual contender for 'worst blockbuster performance ever documented'. Just remembering her gives me a headache). Tye Sheridan's Cyclops matches them in petulant overacting, and is just as hatable for it. It almost defies belief seeing the X-Men's single most formidable foe squandered to such an outstanding degree. Poor, poor Oscar Isaac. It's offensive enough leaving Apocalypse bereft of any context or explanation for his powers, resurrection technology, or world-destroying motivation, but he's so swaddled in mountains of torpid Power Rangers prosthetics, and given nothing to do but whisper and stand with his arms outstretched, we nearly forget about him while he's still on screen in front of us. As he innocuously and politely assembles Alexandra Shipp, Ben Hardy, and Olivia Munn's human action figures to stagnate around a desert with him (for HOURS.), CGI farts swirl around his visibly slight frame signifying his (unseen) menace. Shameful is far too feeble a word for this travesty. The rest of the cast phone it in with furious nonchalance. Michael Fassbender in particular, doesn't bother hiding his contempt at how often he stands around vacuously, stuck with a pathos subplot so strained he - literally - bellows at God. James McAvoy is on inappropriately but hysterically fine comedic form for the first third of the film before being reigned in as a googly-eyed morality platitude slot machine. We get glimmers of charisma from Evan Peters' delightfully snarky Quicksilver (and yes, he gets another slow-mo scene. Satisfied?) and Kodi Smit-McPhee's bashfully goofy Nightcrawler (even if 13 years of FX improvements make him and his 'bamfing' look even less credible than Alan Cumming in 2003). Naturally, Kinberg is clueless on how to use either to anywhere close to their full potential, sidelining both and saddling Quicksilver with a motivation so cumbersome you can feel Peters rolling his eyes as the words tumble sheepishly out of his mouth. Recognizable side characters like Tómas Lemarquis' sassy Caliban intrigue, but are virtual nonentities. Still doubt Singer's willful self-destruction? Dig this: the earlier X-Men movies fiercely advocated for education and tolerance, employing violence only to stave off hate- crimes. Apocalypse ends with Lawrence's MystiKatniss droning on the virtues of militarism Above All Else. Here is the death of Xavier's dream - so dismal that the only worthwhile embers are lazy callbacks to moments done better in other Bryan Singer X-Men films (McAvoy and Fassbender virtually shed tears of embarrassment reenacting dialogue exchanges from X-Men 1). If this is the rejigged time-stream after Days of Future Past, they may as well ship Wolverine even further back in time to put the whole sodden franchise out of its misery. -3/10</fullReview>

They didn't do good with Storm, Psylocke, Angel, and Apocalypse. The opening scene is amazing, but after that I couldn't feel worried that the X men were at a serious risk. Apocalypse wasn't scary, he felt like a wimp. Like I said before, the acting was good. I felt Oscar Issac did good from what he could, Michael Fassbender was amazing, and so was James Mcavoy. The introduction to the new X men was executed well, and I can't wait to see them more involved in the universe. I recommend seeing this film if you like the X men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter mess, a complete disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm being kind by giving it 6 stars.While not the worst in the X-Men franchise (that accolade still goes to Origins), Apocalypse is a film that never makes it out of the starting gate and stumbles towards a dull, fantastically messy end. I waited two weeks after the release to go watch. Having heard nothing but bad reviews, I said to myself "These people have high expectations after Civil War and Days of Future Past." Obviously, I too had high expectations but I reminded myself to accept it at face value: as entertainment. It was clear from the very beginning when Xavier (James McAvoy) began his speech about mutants and humans that this series had run aground, was out of steam. Everything about the film has been done in previous ones and has been done better. The action is limp, the special effects are bombastic but uncharacteristically unimaginative. Characters dissolve into puddles of nostalgia and dreariness. What remains of plot is nothing but a hodge-podge of half-baked strands from the previous films - Jean Grey and her worrisome dark Phoenix power, Xavier trying to convince Magneto not to be evil, Magneto trying to be good but ultimately letting evil win over, Cyclops trying not to blast Jean Grey. Hell, even Wolverine turns up just long enough for him to escape from Stryker and get his memories back (cause that already happened in X-Men, X-2 and Origins, right?). In the previous 3 films (Wolverine, First Class and Days of Future Past), a lot of effort was put into location and setting. Part of the fun was the attention to detail as these established characters navigated various periods or cultures. The groovy spy flavours added to First Class and the mind bending, time bending disaster epic of DOFP helped elevate those films beyond simple superhero fare. Sadly, Singer has dispensed with setting or detail and plays this simply as a monster of the week episode of Buffy. And while we visit Poland, USA and Egypt in the 1980s, they could be anywhere. The closest we get to the decade is a throwaway conversation about Star Wars and the Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams" in another Quicksilver set piece.The direction, and this is a major upset for me because I think Singer is fantastic, is dire. At no point does he even bother to build tension or ratchet up suspense towards the inevitable conclusion or good vs evil. His villain, Apocalypse, spends 3/4 of the film trying to get his team together and the final quarter losing. For all his apparent smarts, he chooses the worst possible horsemen in Storm (a self-confessed fan of Mystique), Magneto (who apparently has tried living in communist Poland with disastrous consequences), Angel (a drunk) and Psylocke (apparently a great fighter). None of them interact with each other, none of them do much other than stand around, gurning at the camera. Needless to say the twists as members turn on him and others get defeated easily doesn't come as a surprise. There's little offered that suggests that Apocalypse is a force to be reckoned with and his team do nothing but grin and stand behind him for majority of the film. Bizarrely, Stryker turns up halfway through but his appearance is confusing and does nothing to propel the story. So far the story seems to be that Apocalypse wants horsemen and that seems to be it for plot.None of the cast get much to do. The new additions are quiet and behave in a confused manner. Apocalypse wanders around like Emperor Palpatine but with all the menace of Father Jack. Oscar Isaac tries to chew up the scenery as Vincent Price, it just made me want to watch Vincent Price. Much excitement was incited when Jubilee turned up in the cast list but clearly she isn't Singer's type because she has even less to do than some Egyptian fanatics at the very beginning. There is a repeat of Quicksilver's hilarious power but it serves only to highlight the lack of ideas present. Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan do get more to do than most others but Turner still has a long way to go until she's as captivating as Famke Jansen. Her relationship with Xavier is barely explored so when he begs her to "let loose! Unleash your power!" you'd be forgiven for wondering why she would when she has probably zero trust in him and he in her. Ultimately, the film is a fail. There's very little to get excited about here. The returning cast deliver their lines with a cringeworthy manner that suggests they're ready to move on and the lack of detail to character, setting and themes proves that Singer has gotten all he can out of the X-Men. Perhaps Fox should bite the bullet and return the X-Men to Marvel before they attempt to "reboot" the franchise again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An omnipotent deity falls into a thousand-year sleep, leaving humanity to fend for itself. I know what you're thinking--ah, so that's why there haven't been any Haus reviews!--but no, my flock. 'Tis not my apologia. 'Tis, rather, the soft undergirding of what passes for a backstory to X-Men: Apocalypse.Quick recap: First Class (2011) was awesome, a fact attributable entirely to Matthew Vaughn's direction. Bryan Singer's 2014 Days of Future Past was a messy muddle, though plenty of people seemed to love it. Singer's now back with Apocalypse, which is--to put it kindly--a trifle uneven.Whereas some superhero films cling to reality by the tenderest of bowlines, the X-Men franchise cast off from those shores long before it ever got green-lit. As you probably know, the various characters wield arbitrary and wholly impossible powers, which absent careful story-rigging would lead to some very uneven title fights indeed. As usual, there's really no sense belaboring the lack of realism in the X-Men films, but it's perhaps worth noting that unlike some of its sibling installments, this one doesn't even try a pseudoscience gloss. Mutants here are closer to gods, which is perhaps how they're properly seen. (Once I decided this, in fact, I enjoyed the climactic battle a good deal more.)Story wise? Well, as the trailer suggests, an ancient Egyptian mutant/god (Apocalypse, who according to the credits is played by an unrecognizable and deeply slumming Oscar Isaac) awakens from his poorly-explained sleep to seek--what else?-- the destruction of the world. He identifies other mutants as henchmen and augments their powers. Some mutants join him, others try to stop him. He wrecks some things (largely of the Egyptian variety) though never manages effectively to convey his motivation for pretty much anything he does. (He's also not frightening, coming off more like a lumbering eighties action figure with seaweed-colored pancake makeup.) Humans, perhaps mercifully, play virtually no role in this film--eschewing even their traditional duties of gawking helplessly as heroes and villains wreak havoc. A couple of cut scenes show Pentagon-types wringing their hands, but that's about it. Mutants Only.Coolest scene ever. Coolest scene ever. The good? An absolutely brilliant (and appropriately long) scene featuring Quicksilver racing through frozen time takes the Haus trophy for best Sweet Dreams montage ever put to film. Evan Peters (that's right, Kick Ass's best friend) playing Quicksilver-- that's great too. Olivia Munn's monotone glare. Olivia Munn's outfit (for comedic value, natch). Legitimately strong performances by the main leads.The bad? The story leaves aforementioned main leads often with little or nothing to do. The villain is lame. It's long. Is any of this tied to reality in any form at all? And this may be sacrilegious, but I really didn't find much of the CGI to be that good. Your mileage may vary.The big question is, should you see it? Eh, maybe. If you've already seen Captain America: Civil War (a far better version of Marvel hero overload that's also out now) and Zootopia (a fabulous Pixar film, still playing as I write), and you still fancy a summer blockbuster type experience, this one isn't all bad. I've seen worse. And for an X-Men film, around these parts, that puts it right around the middle of the pack.Haus Verdict: Weak villain, much CGI, not much sense. The elements are there, but it doesn't hum. But that Quicksilver scene is the flippin' mustard. X-Men: Apocalypse opens everywhere today, May 27.</fullReview>

I expect people to die, run away screaming, panic, fear... Nobody except the mutants fighting seem to be all that bothered. I mean, this is the end of the world right? Supposedly. Was anyone actually in real danger at any point? We presume so, but it wasn't quite shown. The 4 henchmen seem to follow blindly into it, but then, we never really get to know 3 of them. And what happened with the nukes? Did I miss that part? Are they orbiting the earth now? What? I guess I just expected a bit more from an apocalypse. But maybe that was just the Independence Day trailer before the film showed in the cinema getting my hopes up...That said, it wasn't terrible. Jean Grey and Quicksilver are highlights!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching X-Men: Apocalypse got me mired in conflicted thoughts as it keeps blowing hot and cold too frequently. Firstly, when you cast such a charismatic and talented actor like Oscar Isaac - you don't hide him under a thick layer of prosthetics where you neither get to see him nor he can show his acting prowess. Secondly, such an uninteresting character for an antagonist doesn't work if a movie has to rise above the heap of well-written superhero movies. Lastly, one would expect Bryan Singer who is the creator of this universe on the big screen with an experience of creating tense thrillers would come up with such a flat screenplay.This installment goes right to the start with the emergence of the early mutant through a ritual in ancient Egypt. When this procedure was interrupted by a few rebels, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) lies in hibernation for thousands of years and is resurrected by a bunch of modern Egyptians for unknown reasons. Upon waking up, he catches up with the history thus far by inserting his hand inside a television that was playing a news channel - Duh. His modus operandi includes recruiting 4 other mutants and calling them 'The Four Horsemen' - the Biblical reference to bringer of Apocalypse and he goes about recruiting them with neither shortlisting from a potential list of candidates nor verifying their capabilities. They all even gather for a pose with Metallica's 'Four Horsemen' blaring in the background symbolically which was too cheesy.On the other hand, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) seems to have mastered his art and removes all of Moira's (Rose Byrne) memories and conveniently puts it back at the end - that's one hell of a memory management. While the Professor is focussing his energies towards making his school for mutants bigger than it is, Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is hailed as a hero for her efforts in the previous installment in preventing a disaster at the White House and she has a lot of budding mutants looking up to her. Erik (Michael Fassbender) is living a peaceful life and even has a family until an incident provokes him to use his special powers which eventually leads to the death of his family. Apocalypse disturbs this delicate balance of their peaceful co-existence which starts the fight of Good against Evil.It starts promisingly (not in any spectacular way though) on both the fronts - emergence of the early mutant and meet &amp; greet of the existing mutants but loses the plot midway. First with the negatives - there is no edge-of-the-seat screenplay which was a marquee element of the first 2 installments of the prequel series, the visual effects though ambitious - lacks the finishing it requires (where some explosions look like they are straight from the 90s action movies), the spectacular Quicksilver (Evan Peters) show from 'The Days of Future Past' is disintegrated into an insensitive and uninteresting romp. Even after having reality expectations that is apt for a comic book remake, it gets too silly and childish many a times without the cheeky factor. Even the cameo by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is so muddled that I wish it wasn't there. The inexplicable need to destroy infrastructure or killing innocent civilians or police personnel without leading to a conscious consequence never grows into a solid drama.It does have some bright spots though, especially the refreshing character of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), great character development for Raven, subdued performance by Michael Fassbender, ambitious visual effects and an epic background score. GoT fans get to see a powerful and independent Sansa (as Jean Grey (played by Sophie Turner)) who isn't short of attitude as well. It does seem to have reintroduced the origins of most characters which completes the cycle to merge the two trilogies.Poor antagonist, flat screenplay and lacks overall innovation, but holds its ground rather loosely with likable familiar characters and epic action sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyably Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite torn about this movie, as it is quite a 'different' movie. It has an intriguing enough story line, with mostly convincing characters and impressive visuals...I certainly enjoyed it while watching it, but after the fact I could not find a reason why I enjoyed it so much. It is certainly a film with many flaws. As an 'action movie', the action scenes were not too innovative or even impressive. The fights are largely what has been seen before in the X-Men franchise, just less of it compared to Days of Future Past. As a 'superhero ensemble piece', the fact that it was an 'ensemble' definitely took away from individual story arcs. With nobody really developing from the start of the film to the end of the film, at least not clearly. As a movie, the plot was incredibly cliché without many stakes. Superhero movies don't necessarily need heroes to die in order to have stakes, it just needs emotional weight and connection between characters, and these connections being morphed or broken (like Captain America: Civil War). Apocalypse however, had no such stakes, only the threat of world destruction...which obviously would not be accomplished. Though character arcs were lacking in this film, performances by the leads were mainly good. With the clear exception of Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who continues to feel like she has no connection with the character whatsoever. Both McAvoy and Fassbender gave great performances as usual, with great chemistry between them as usual. Especially with that one scene of Fassbender in the woods, the emotional layers in his performance were incredible. All the new X-Men also gave good performances, though the ensemble element drowned them and cut their development short. All up, Apocalypse wasn't the worse X-Men movie, but it is far from the best. It's still worth a watch for X-Men franchise fans, but I doubt it will entice any new viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it was the high-standard set by Days of Future Past, but Apocalypse was a little underwhelming. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable - it was much closer in quality to Civil War than it was Dawn of Justice - but a victim of its own success. The main cast are as impressive as ever with new mutants making the idea of future instalments exciting (that is, if Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy and Hoult step down as I suspect them to) which is matched and intensified with impressive visuals. It offers very little new to the genre and I do wish it took more risks, but one should avoid penalising the film for its previous victories (although, I do admit that I made that mistake, as I have previously discussed). It still is, after all, one of the most unique and individual franchises in the genre, unmistakably X-Men with its coups and accomplishments.FULL REVIEW: http://goo.gl/tbUJCm</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a deep love and affection for the source material, the characters, the filmmakers and the franchise, I could not overcome the bloated film I was presented with, which despite preserving some key elements that constantly make these stories emotionally powerful, can't come together in making any kind of organic film, which messes up one of the most fascinating characters in comic book history.Right from the opening scene, introducing Apocalypse, you will get what I am talking about. I was immediately turned off. The X-Men have always been a very grounded saga, with emphasis on character, yet what this scene presents us is a tonal shift of unbalanced proportions. The CGI extravaganza is all over the place, the suspense of disbelief the films ask us is way too demanding to have any kind of attachment to the narrative.These are problems that carry through the whole film. Firstly, on a technical level I have to say that this level of CGI is almost unacceptable from a major blockbuster film. The green screen effects are embarrassing throughout the whole duration and keep distracting you every time characters appear in front of it. The composition overall is terribly distinguishable and the combination between practical and CGI is all but seamless. Moreover the wide shots of CGI landscapes all look way too unconvincing. I don't know what it is, the suspension of disbelief, the rendering itself, the way it is used, it simply didn't add up.On top of that, we have a really bloated storyline where character motivations are frustratingly confusing and it all originates from the sadly underwhelming villain at the center of it. Look, I will not hide the fact that I have been a comic book reader all my life and of course when I go to see these movies there is a nostalgic and excited part of me, but that part comes in only after you give me a good film, if at the core of it you don't have one, my knowledge and nostalgia will rarely fill the gaps. Moreover, screwing up such an iconic character adds to the disappointment. Apcocalypse is one of the best characters ever committed to CB page, what we have here, other than the fact that in the first place doesn't resemble anything close to his printed counter part, is a villain so bad it makes me angry. He has no depth, no motivation, no menace and worst of all he is all powerful! The mistake of having a villain that seems to be able to do anything is really annoying, it takes away any kind of grit or personality.I have to say I really liked the casting of the renewed characters, they were almost all inspired choices that delivered. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner were big highlights of the film. That is also probably due to the fact that the characters they are playing, alongside all of their fellow actors, are incredibly layered to the point that they could be considered mythological. Their struggle and inner dynamic is so strong, complex and emotionally powerful it is really hard to alienate an audience with them. These filmmakers know and have demonstrated in the past how thrilling and touching these stories can get, how much this tale on diversity, peace, love vs hate, self loathing (the list goes on and on) opens up the possibility of commentary and discussion. They demonstrate they know all of this in the film which sporadically offers genuine moments of this, only to be taken down by the plot that moves too many elements around and screws up the flow of the film.Bryan Singer has had his first failure in this saga and whilst it isn't a disaster by any stretch of the imagination, it just reminds you of how good X-Men, X2, Days of Future Past and to an extent First Class and (for me) Last Stand are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Empty Grand Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apocalypse is the lamest villain I've ever seen in an X-Men movie, it makes Deadpool from X-Men Origins look subtle. I believe this movie has the Dawn of Justice problem, except probably a little better. People would defend it to how close it looks from the comics, when the argument they would point out is only from the aesthetic. Example: The movie may have Psylocke's look, powers and leotard, however remains cipher that it's close to Batman v Superman's Wonder Woman. The movie throws in a ton of characters and cannot even juggle enough from them, especially when it comes to Jean Grey. She is supposed to be important to the story, but her arc is rushed and her involvement from the climax felt extremely unearned. Fans of the old movies might find the returning young characters such as Cyclops and Nightcrawler fun, but that's only for the sake of familiarity and if this is the first time you've encounter these characters, then you won't find anything remarkable from them. Good performances do help, mostly from Michael Fassbender, even when Magneto here is underwritten as ever, he manages to make a rather contrived sequence quite powerful. But even then, when he starts becoming the villain again, the bombast just compromises every talent on screen.The movie is heavy on CG, but short on tension. All we see are spectacle, that it gets too exhausting that you're almost like watching a Roland Emmerich movie. It all looks cool, but there is nothing really exciting about it. To be fair, it's still quite watchable and fans might go crazy about its fan service like Wolverine (it's shown in the trailer,) bald Professor X and Mystique wearing her original costume. But even with these aesthetics, it's still pretty empty. These characters are too burdened from the past that it's kind of missing the point.Oscar Isaac tries, but the role is just too silly to be taken seriously. James McAvoy does his best as Xavier. Tye Sheridan is the best cinematic Scott Summers so far, but that isn't saying much since this franchise never even cared for this character. Michael Fassbender is seriously the only one who can exceed from the film's shortcomings.Overall, X-Men Apocalypse is pretty to look at, but the lack of enough connection with this rich amount of characters and tension towards the situation and the villain just rob all the fun. It's far from boring, at least. You can find worse ways to kill your two hours, but still, it's like the Mutant Apocalypse game; if you're looking for some action that looks like the comics, then you may have a blast, but movies aren't videogames. There has to be a story to impact the experience. And there is rarely any elements from the story here that actually flow. It's far from a blunder, but X-Men movies have become better than this. This movie is nothing more than a bucket of candies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Grand Finale We Hoped For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is a jumbled and sometimes confusing mess of a movie. From the unbalanced CGI, to the one-dimensional title villain and the dreadful, mismatched pacing throughout, this is a car crash that you cant help but to watch. Not because of the gripping story or its characters but because you're waiting for something to happen to make you care about this movie. This film (as well as the previous 2 films) are carried and driven by Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Magneto. You see and feel his pain of wanting to do right and live a normal life but is always thwarted by some circumstance that causes conflict within himself. Oscar Issac's Apocalypse is a character that is limited to one- dimensional views of a world he left behind and has now rejoined. One of the most intelligent and fearsome of all the Marvel foes, he has been reduced to basically giving his outlook on humanity but really has no substance as to why he wants to cleanse the world for only the strong to survive. Arch Angel doesn't do much until the end fighting scene. Psylocke basically followed suit but did the best with what she was given (Which wasn't much at all) and Storm portrayed as she was in the comics and Alexandra Shipp just might make you forget about Halle Berry (even with a believable African accent) The introduction of the new timeline X-Men characters are a fresher take on the ones that we have come to love and trust. Jean Grey is solid and Cyclops is actually played with some kind of conviction. Problem with this is, in an ensemble cast they get taken out and re- added to the shuffle when its convenient to push the plot forward which doesn't give you much time to get acquainted with the new actors much. Of course the person who stole the show in the last movie does it here again. Quicksilver holds it down in all his scenes and the "Mansion Run" is going to be the most talked about scene of the whole movie, ITS THAT DAMN FUN TO WATCH.The thing is this: Its not a bad movie, it was average at best. First Class and Days of Future Past raised the bar for a grand finale that was severely underwhelming. In a series of movies, you build up to the finale and it has to end with a bang. The movie had a couple good action scenes but it cant make up its mind as to what it wants to be and focus on. Is it actually about Apocalypse? Does it want to focus on Mystique trying to find her place in the world? Erik and Charles not seeing eye to eye due to different ideals again? Jean and Scott learning to understand each other? Quicksilver's revelation? There are too many different stories that are trying to be told and if feels like a mess. A bunch of scenes with little or no cohesion. You could see what they were trying to do but the execution was severely flawed.Sad to say that this doesn't look or feel like a Bryan Singer movie, but more like an ensemble of directors that lacked any kind of cohesion with the scenes. The dry attempts at humor and way too much cheesiness only cheapened what could have been a solid send off. This movie didn't end the trilogy with a bang, not even a whimper. It was more like "Meh". Make sure you stay for the end credit scene because marvel fanboys and purists might geek out quite a bit. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not only the weakest in the series but weak in general. Cheap tricks, dull story, badly directed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past entries the most interesting characters in the movie were Magneto and Xavier. Both with the strong history, well written dialogues etc. Apocalypse is so weak in terms of the story that producer(probably) made an obvious choice to go for CGI rather than further development of the characters. There are also good old "previously on X-Men" scenes that have to fill the gaps between totally stupid conversations and another dull huge CGI scene. Final cheap trick is of course making fun of the Christian belief system. It seems to me as it is a way to gain popularity and climb out from the deep whole that director and producer dumped the movie in to. Polish accent was so...Stupid. Seriously. Scenes that supposed to be emotional were simply funny as Fasbender did not learned even one word properly and Polish "actors" were literally reading from the cart board. It seriously ruined every single scene in that segment including the final one. This is by far the weakest X-Men movie made to date. It's little like Hobbit. CGI is everywhere and characters are nowhere to be found. It also feels a little like Batman VS. Supermen where both Batman and Supermen characters are totally different (in a bad way) and the reasons behind their choices are simplistic, primitive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another failure in attempt to create a good action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a waste of time! I expected so much from this movie. As the result, X-Men: Apocalypse is not up to the quality level of most of the X-Men series. It lacks certain style and special atmosphere present in the previous parts.Bad casting, somewhat ugly and weak actors, flat characters, poor special effects, boring ending, you name it - it's all about this movie. The beginning is promising, but as the movie goes on, the more predictable it becomes. The world's most powerful mutant picks-up ordinary mutants for his team (except for Magneto), later on he can't properly organize good defence. What is Magneto doing in the final battle? Creating some magnetic field for, like, what purpose? Some teenage mutant girl with plain for a mutant ability becomes all of a sudden a very powerful mutant, and Apocalypse all of a sudden becomes weak. It seems more as the script writers ran out of ideas at the end of the movie.Besides that, the whole story chronically hangs in the middle of nowhere. The time is the 80-s with no connection whatsoever to the past or the future events. Some events shown did not actually happen in the real world, and it's not explained to the viewers how it is supposed to fit in. For me watching the second part of the movie was a total disappointment.In my opinion, this movie would do nicely only for kids. It failed to be a good fantasy action movie. The rating 7.5 out of 10 is way too high for this below average creation!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great X-Men Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always had a problem with Bryan Singer's X-Men movies. Not a complete problem, but the first two movies he did, while being good, are rather...dumb. But then he seemed to realize what he did wrong and corrected them in X-Men: Days of Future Past. And in X-Men: Apocalypse, he continues the trend of making the X-Men truly great.Grade: 10/109.8/1098/100A+Plot: 10/10 Apocalypse arises in the 80s, a bit confused as to where he is after a really long sleep, but he realizes the world is screwed up and he just wants to make it simple again--with him ruling EVERYTHING. So he gathers some followers and starts his quest to take over. Simple, straight, and to the point. There's no mucking around in this movie. You have a bad guy and good guys who have to stop the bad guy. It's so simple that it actually works. But the story is so much deeper than it seems, which really makes the movie shine.Character Development: 10/10 A lot of old characters are re-introduced in the new world created by X-Men: Days of Future Past, but a lot of old friends show up, too. They are all giving enough screen time so we don't feel like anyone is shoe-horned in (ala Wonder Woman), and they're all given enough personality that we do become attached to them. The writers did a good job here.Direction: 10/10 Bryan Singer did a good job bringing this movie to life and I'm glad to have seen the movie in theaters. One thing I was worried about was how they portrayed Apocalypse in the trailers, with him claiming to be all these different gods, including Yahweh, but Singer actually did the smart thing and took that line out of the movie, making sure he offended no one. I was very happy for this, for while I can appreciate the fact that Apocalypse thought himself all the gods of the world, there was a minor thing about calling people who do believe morons that I felt the trailer said very heavy-handedly. But the movie chose to ignore this other than a passing reference. So if you are a Christian and think the movie is offending you, I can assure you that it actually does not. Nor does it offend any other religions, for those who might be interested.Casting: 10/10 I was worried most about the casting, especially Sophie Turner, but I was surprised when everyone turned in a really tremendous performance--especially Sophie Turner. Still, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were the best performers, and Oscar Isaac actually kinda stole the show.Acting: 10/10 See above. Acting was just as great as the casting--and I don't mean that in a disparaging way.Cinematography: 10/10 The film was visually stunning, and the destruction-porn was actually far less than I was expecting from the trailers. It was handled masterfully.Music: 10/10 Great score that accompanied the movie well but did not overwhelm it. Pacing: 9/10 I'll admit that the movie did move a little slow at times. It wasn't completely noticeable, but there was a time I was beginning to wonder if the final battle was ever going to get there. A few moments later, it did.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 All the costumes in the movie were great, especially Psylocke's. Whoever created her outfit needs to win some kind of award because it was perfect--just what I wanted her outfit to look like. The other costumes were great, too, but Psylocke's was really spot-on.Re-watchability: 9/10 While being a great movie, like most X-Men movies, it has a great re-watch factor but it's not perfect. I can't wait to own this movie, but chances are I probably won't see it in theaters again. Nothing against the movie--just have to save my money for awhile.X-Men: Apocalypse is definitely worth seeing in the theater if you're an X-Men fan or even if you just like the X-Men movies. Go see it. You might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well that was disappointing. One of my favorite superhero films is X2, it was a fantastic film that somehow (in my opinion) has not been topped in the x men franchise. I assumed this film would be different what with such a great story ( GOD-LIKE APOCALYPSE recruiting 4 horse men) is every fan boys dream... him being one of the greatest villains ever, i read some of the reviews and decided to make an informed decision my self. This is what I saw : Long film.. too many characters...flat boring under developed Disney villain ... and too much talking (until the final hour), so overall it underperformed. The cartoon version still remains better than this mess that really could have been done better. There were some scenes that were fantastic, like for example QUICKSILVERS and the fight scenes were intense, especially the final climactic battle...yet through the film Magneto plays as better omnipresent villain than apocalypse and Psyloke truly underperformed with her 2 lines lol. The film focused on turning Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique into the main hero given she's an Oscar winner, so they messed up what could have been a great villain and all for billing an actress most don't really care about. Overall the one true thing (and this is a spoiler) that i enjoyed was the future possible establishment of the PHOENIX SAGA... Sophie Turner as Phoenix was great! Yet it took long to get there ... X2 came out years ago and ever since i have been disappointed by all the other x men films ...shame that trend continues and most likely will.Final Grade C</fullReview>

However, I've been a fan of the X-Men franchise since the very first movie. Don't believe all the harsh negative critics. Go see the movie for yourself. You can be the judge. It's more than worth the price of admission. 20th Century Fox is doing wonders with this franchise. Marvel could never do the #XMen justice. It's honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. At least in my opinion. A lot of people are quick to judge when they haven't even seen it or refuse to watch it altogether. I don't get all the negative criticism. It had action, suspense and even heartfelt moments. I give it a solid 10 out of 10 rating. #XMen #Apocalypse</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6/10 may seem like a harsh score, but in the Pantheon of comic book films, it's a positive score. Xmen Apocalypse follows the mega-fa &#x24dd; tastic Days of Future Past, but falls just short of greatness. Apocalypse, portrayed by the do-no-wrong Oscar Issac, is an ancient mutant who has spent the last couple of thousand years in hibernation. He awakens to the a new and bizarre world and decides it's time to hit "reset" on humanity, the only problem is that while Apocalypse is an extremely powerful mutant, he doesn't realize he's a mutant, he actually thinks he's a living god.Apocalypse is missing some of the charm of recent Xmen endeavors, but overall it's worth a viewing, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the previous two films, but entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When X -Men first came out in the year 2000 comic book movies were still finding their feet as we didn't yet have the MCU, The Dark Knight trilogy or even Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. Now 16 years later the X-Men Universe has been joined by Marvel and DC in the superhero movie universe brigade/thing. Having helmed three of the previous X-Men films, including Days of Future Past, Bryan Singer has again been trusted in bringing the mutants to the big screen.It's now the 1980's and the first mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) has awoken and displeased by the culture he has awoken within (perhaps if he had awoken in the 60's he would have been more chill) decides to eliminate humans from the planet so that mutants can truly rule supreme. He recruits the orphan girl Storm (Alexandra Shripp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn), cage fighter Angel (Ben Hardy) and everyone's favourite metal detector Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Elsewhere Professor X (James McAvoy) is running his institute for the gifted with Hank (Nicholas Hoult) and new student Scott/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) arrives alongside current student Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) also stops by with Nightcrawler (Kodi-Smit Mcphee) as she is worried about Magneto's well being following a traumatic event. Quicksilver (Evan Peters) is also alerted to this as he feels he needs to bond with Magneto who is his father. Whilst Professor X looks into Magneto's disappearance he comes across Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) again, as there were not enough sub-plots apparently.Basically there's a lot going on, and it's mostly entertaining but doesn't really feel weighted in anything because there isn't enough time for the film to fit everything in. Apocalypse was one of my favourite villains from the old cartoon series and I didn't feel his more 'subtle' design was effective. Oscar Isaac is a terrific actor but his performance felt very repetitive and stifling, not because of his lack of ability, but there wasn't enough time or nuance devoted in the film's run time to keep him interesting. All of the returning players perform ably; Fassbender delivers a fine mix of gaunt expressions and passionate vengeance of a man going over the edge. Whilst the newcomers all perform promisingly in their roles they don't get enough material to truly flourish and end up simply being promising additions. Whereas in Captain America Civil War Tom Holland was a great Peter Parker/Spiderman in Apocalypse Sophie Turner seems that she could be a good Jean Grey, and Tye Sheridan could be a good Cyclops etc. but they hover on the periphery battling for screen time with all the other characters. Having stolen the show in Days of Future of Past with a breath-taking slow motion (or fast motion I suppose?) sequence Quicksilver returns with a similar scene here. It isn't as good, going for a bigger is better approach, it is funny in parts but lacks the surprise and intricate detail it had in Days of Future Past. Then we get lots of worldwide destruction that makes Man of Steel look conservative by comparison, say what you will about DC's attitude to city wide destruction at least in Batman vs Superman they showed the destruction from a personal perspective to add dramatic weight. In Apocalypse we watch as cities are sucked into the sky and feel simply that the animators did a stylish job with it, but no empathy whatsoever.Despite my hang ups X-Men: Apocalypse has enough impressive action beats to be entertaining without being immersive. There are some funny gags, and impressive special effects but very little dramatic stakes. It's definitely the weakest film of the "New class" trilogy (First Class and Days of Future Past being superior) but with an impressive cast to sell it does the job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse left me with the same feeling I got after Batman vs. Superman. I'm getting tired of those franchises putting it on too thick. You know why Deadpool was so fantastic? It was fresh and fast paced. I am getting sick of re-watching origin stories (Magneto turning evil, then back to good for the third (?) time) of every X-Men character, while having to content myself with villains that get NO character development. I mean, true, the Deadpool-villains were one-dimensional too, but that was about the movie's only flaw. This time? Psylocke is just a pretty face and body with a cool weapon. Angel is just an angry wing man.The other two were forgettable as well. Worst of all the chief villain. Jeez! I just can't care about the action, when the characters are that bland. (Like in Batman vs Superman, when a totally underdeveloped Wonder Woman joins the finale. Nobody cares, right?) In the good old days of X-Men (1), these characters had some flavor to them. The studio was having fun with them. That kid Pyro, for example? Remember him? The only fun character left now is Quicksilver. Rebecca Romjin, now SHE was a fun Mystique. I think I'm ready to let go of the X-Men franchise now. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bryan Singer's 8 Guidelines for making an X-men film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally do not write reviews about any movie, but after watching this left a sour aftertaste that drove me to review this. It seems Bryan Singer made this film based on these 8 guidelines:1. Magneto must be the victimized anti-hero who gets his life messed up in the worst way possible, turns evil, and eventually betrays the evil to join the side of the good.2. Juicing the hell out of Quicksilver's slow-mo scenes, because everyone loves it since DOFP.3. Some of the good guys must die. Even if the death is lame, forced out of nothing, or has no impact on the plot, just do it. Because audiences love that emo s**t.4. Show the world that there are new characters coming into the film so there's hype. Then give them 1 minute of screen time and 3 lines of dialogue for the entire film.5. Reveal a truckload of subplots, but no need to follow through. Just gotta look fluffy, no substance needed.6. Romance and sexual tension is also a must. Doesn't matter how it is done, or why there is a need to have it in the film.7. Always have a hidden mojo ready, in case there's no convincing way to get rid of the bad guy and end the film.8. Huge plot loopholes are irrelevant as long as we have the power of CGI to juice the hell out of all the planetary destruction scenes and the final battle scene. Because screw logic and just go for visuals.With that said, the film felt like Bryan Singer just wanted to get everything over and done with. Just from watching the trailer alone, 95% of the plot was predictable, and the dialogue became very boring very quickly. The only saving grace was the great acting from the cast. DOFP was great but I really have serious reservations about this one.Well, at least now I know what Apocalypse meant when he said "Everything they've built will fall..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of incredible spectacle, but lacking in dramatic tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strength of this movie certainly relies heavily on the extremely cool looking CGI. We see cities being turned to dust, incredible displays of power from the mutants (especially magneto), and the villain is possible the most powerful we have seen in a Marvel movie so far.However, due to the nature of this film being another prequel, being set before the days of the original X-men films, I never found myself fearing for the fate of the main characters. We knew that they would live through this. Whilst you could also say the same perhaps for the films X-men: First Class and X-men: Days of future past, somehow those movies carried a little bit more dramatic tension. Perhaps this was due to the fact that in First Class, many of the characters would not later become X-men, so their fates to non-comic book fans was a mystery. In Days of Future Past, the time-line was in schism so the outcome of the movie actually could change the time-line of the original movies (which it did for the better in the end.In Apocalypse, however, there is no doubt that the cast would survive, although it was at least intriguing to find out how such a powerful villain could be defeated.This is also quite a simplistic movie- there are no complex morals like "are mutants and humans able to live side by side". The villain motivation ultimately comes down to wanting to rule the world. Speaking of the villain, Apocalypse, he was quite menacing and ruthless, but comes not even an iota within the brilliance of Ian McKellen as Magneto, and his character was no where near as developed which isn't surprising seeing as he came and went within one movie.So really, to sum up, this movie is a cool looking spectacle, but lacks dramatic tension or any build up, and there is no challenge of morals to the audience. I consider it to be above only the two Wolverine movies in the franchise, but it is my least favourite main time-line X-men movie. Also at almost two and a half hours in run-time, the plot feels incredibly stretched out. The whole sub-plot of being captured by the soldiers felt ultimately pointless.If you are a true X-men fan, you will probably find some enjoyment from this movie but overall I can't recommend it as I found it quite boring throughout most of it- even the action scenes are quite reminiscent of the "Transformers" Franchise in that it was flashy but lacked great choreography or tension. A lot of the humour also fell quite flat for me, but the other cinema goers laughed so perhaps that's just my sense of humour for you.Final rating for me is 5/10 - average and takes no risks. In terms of Marvel films recently, it was rather disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics are WRONG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I came to this movie, all I had seen were the metacritic numbers and those of rotten tomatoes. They were low. Lower than I had expected for an X-Men movie directed by Bryan Singer. So going in, I was apprehensive. First Class and Days of Future Past were excellent- really, amazingly excellent- and I didn't want a repeat of *shivers* Last Stand (In which the first two are great and the third is cringe worthy). To my relief, these fears went largely away once the movie really kicked off. Admittedly, this installment didn't feel as polished in the beginning as the before mentioned FC or DoFP, but it didn't need too, because once it really started moving, it went moving FAST. The action? Great The humor? Not overdone (like a certain AoU I can think of) The drama? Tasteful and achieves what it set off to do The characters? Likable, new and returning The Magneto? EXCELLENT. The special effects? Solid The villain? Oh boy, they got him spot on The inevitable Quicksilver scene? Just as good as you can imagine As you can see, this movie was awesome. I highly advise that you go see it, for this one, the critics were DEAD WRONG.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That was again the best and worth watching movie I saw today. Fassbender was always the best choice for Magneto so is James McAvoy for Charles. New entries were just perfect. This would be in my blu ray collection soon.As for other professional movie reviewers out there..I can't believe I was actually going to miss this one because of all the negative reviews all over, but man were they wrong. Won't criticize them as that is not our job ! but guys please do you seriously think the movie was that bad was it you were in a bad mood when you went to see it. or was that a paid bash just like you did for... use your imagination which could it be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable and a well-made film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know some of you have heard pretty mixed reviews from critics, but I wouldn't trust them. Critics do get things wrong from time to time. I saw the film recently and I must say that I was very entertained. The script is very good (though kind of Hollywooded), the visual effects are impressive, the music score is awesome, the acting and directing is fantastic and it's well edited. But personally, my favourite thing about the film was the characters and the costumes.However, I do think this film is somewhat weaker than First Class and Days of Future Past. Those two films took a very different and inspiring approach to the franchise which did not fail to impress the audience. While Apocalypse appears to be more focused on the characters themselves. I'm not saying that is a bad thing, just that I was hoping for more. Nevertheless, Bryan Singer managed to bring the trilogy to a successful and a good end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic X-Men Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men has always been my #1 superhero team since I was a little boy and when I first heard about X-men apocalypse I got so excited. Well right before the movie came out I saw and heard about all the bad reviews from rotten Tomato and the like so I started to get worried about this movie. After seeing the movie all I'm thinking is did me and the critics see the same movie because this movie is one of the best so far. Truly Epic movie. Bryan Singer and the cast and crew did an awesome, amazing job. This is a must see. Screw rotten tomato and the critic's cause apparently they know nothing about X-men and apocalypse. I just got done watching this movie and I can't wait to see it again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this really the last installment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the best moments in the X-Men franchise have always been when the big action is fueled by really strong character work, and grounded by the themes about prejudice that have always made these characters resonate.Even Peters and Michael Fassbender did a fantastic job. Slow motion rescue operation by Evan Peters was full of entertainment. Guest appearance by Wolverine was nice.I didn't cry but I got a little bit emotional, especially when looking at Fassbender's face. Sophie Turner and Jennifer Lawrence were the stars who co-stared very well. Sophie was sweet and saucy while Jen was looking hot and sexy.Movie starts with promising note on the backdrop of Egypt, Pyramid and first mutant. First half was better one and Second was unable to carry momentum due to less effectiveness of Apocalypse and four horsemen. Bryan tried his best to sync up story with Days of Future Past and First Class. After watching X-Men: Apocalypse, I think it should have been released between FC and DoFP. It would have made more sense!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget What The Critics Say!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a true fan of the XMEN you will go to this movie to enjoy seeing the Mutants on the big screen again. There are so many moments in this film I have waited to see over the years! Every mutant has a moment in the film that just lets you enjoy them individually! The backgrounds enrich the mutant history and the references to past XMEN movies are littered through the entire movie! Apocalypse just happened to be in this movie at the time. Yes there are three Nha you can pick at but who cares?? Enjoy it first just as a MUTANT MOVIE! The connection between Raven, Xavier and Magneto is strengthened and the cameo mutant will knock you socks off! The reveal at the end of course we all knew it was coming so why be a dork and say "it was predictable"? It's as predictable as the mansion blowing up or being attacked every 5 minutes!! So we the moments we all know are coming in the movie arrive, ENJOY THEM!! DOFP was my favorite up till now but XMEN Apocalypse is now the best XMEN movie in my opinion! Why?? Because we get to see our favorite mutants in action that's why! And they are actually powerful and let loose with all their powers!!! That's why it puts it at the top of the XMEN movies in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For X-men fans, this is the best movie ever. But it's a bit confusing on how they mixed up Wolverine's story because it doesn't sync with Wolverine Origin movie. It just seemed totally an odd scene when the X-men encountered Wolverine. This story should have never cross path. Or maybe this is an alternate reality of the X-men franchise?And the ending scene, it turns out that Jane is the most powerful mutant in the universe, even stronger than the apocalyptic mutant, which humans proclaimed God thousands of years ago. It just seems so surprising that, it could be like this. There was no introduction or hint that Jane was Phoenix. For X-men fans, of course, they would have known it. But for common people, it's just like one of those scenes when the impossible will happen when the good guys are about to lose. It's just so impossible! Come on! Why does good guys always win when they're supposed to lose?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been following X franchise since my childhood and this film, what can I say, is the best among all, even better than 'X2' and 'Days of Future Past', what a continuity, there is not a single place where story could have glitch. They honored, I guess, all the fans around the world. Whether its Quicksilver's moment in the film when Magneto asks 'and what about you?', Or its Storm's moment when she sees Apocalypse's real motive. Now I think they could have made 2 parts of this film as I missed to see Magneto's daughter's life more, I really feel sorry for Mr. Magneto. There is a lot to say about movie, I would suggest, just go and experience it. Great Going Marvel team!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this today and the first thing that comes to mind is what a great year it is so far for comic book movies first we had Deadpool(A), then Batman v Superman dawn of justice (A+),then Captain America civil war(A) and now this awesome Xmen Apocalypse (A+).I was captivated from the start to the finish,Fassbender,Mcgovey,Lawrence and Hoult were all top notch again and as were all the newcomers especially the one's that portrayed Cyclops and Jean Grey.As for Quicksilver well he was awesome. Wolverine had a good action packed cameo(I'm going to miss Jackman when he retires from the role next year).The best comic book villain this year so far is definitely Apocalypse, very threatening and powerful,played brilliantly by Oscar Isaac. The action scenes were excellent just as they were in Days of future past. I hope they use the same cast in a sequel set in the nineties(hopefully the Phoenix saga which was hinted at in this film).Overall well done Mr Singer you have made another great Xmen film ,my rating A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: X-Men: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"At Least We Can All Agree The Third One Is Always The Worst"Interestingly this quote from the movie, that's hardly connected to anything plot related seems to have turned out to be a self fulfilling prophecy, which is a shame, because this movie had potential to be the climax of the (at this point) trilogy. All the pieces seemed to have been placed quite neatly for it to work. Unfortunately it didn't. The movie is especially weak in it's early phases. While the first scene works decently as an exposition to who the films antagonist is going to be, the next couple of scenes slow down the pace, giving us introductory scenes to "new" characters. This could have been fine, had the characters been interesting. But they weren't. Luckily the movie has McAvoy, who even 3 movies in, is still the highlight of the series, due to the witty personality of his character (Charles Xavier). As for the other main character of this series (Magneto); this movie gives him a new start, but only as a setup for his involvement in the conflict, that is about to unfold. Unfortunately his character arc is just mashed into the large multi-character story line and therefore fails to peak the interest it's intending to catch. Another character worth mentioning is Quicksilver, who can best be described as a big convenience for the plot progressing into the direction the authors want to. This may sound like a negative thing, but something about Evan Peter's character just made me swallow it and go along with it. As for the antagonist; while not necessarily well written, I do feel like praising Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Apocalypse. The plot is for the most part character driven, which could go either way. In this case it didn't work out best, because the conflicts of the characters felt like something, that had been previously done already and some of the highlighted characters lacked the screen time to get an actually interesting characterization and development. Another aspect of the plot is the mutants using their powers to their advantage, which results in funny comic relief and entertaining battles. Due to this I actually felt the movie picking itself up towards the end, I was however displeased with the resolution of the conflict and it's aftermath. Overally the film is entertaining and ignoring the character introduction scenes, I wasn't bored during it's run time. That however does not mean it doesn't have it's fair share of problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...it doesn't add anything new to the franchise or the genre.The more substantial change introduced to the franchise since it started back in 2000 was the refreshing of the cast in 2011, operated by Matthew Vaughn in a prequel filled with plot twists, multi-layered characters and style that set the origin of the current narrative web. The return of Bryan Singer after X-Men: First Class seemed to promise a continuation of this refreshing of an old franchise, as Days of Future Past gave us more innovation, plot twists and multi-layered characters, as well as one of the best scenes in the genre with Quicksilver and his speed. However, Apocalipse seems to have taken away the freshness the two previous films brought to the franchise. Where First Class and Days of Future Past innovated, Apocalipse merely recycled plot lines and scenes from previous installments (realy, how many more times do we have to see Magneto loose his family, go on a rampage to avenge them, only to have his mind changed at the very last minute by having either Professor Xavier or Mystique tell him he has good in him, that he's more than just his pain and rage? Hasn't he heard that enough times already? Haven't we? I mean, if he didn't understood that the first two times he heard it, he never will). Where First Class and Days of Future Past had a multi-layered villain, Apocalipse has a one-dimensional, almost clownish bad guy - is motivation is basically "let's destroy this world and build a new one because I was asleep for 3000 years and woke up in a bad mood". Oh, and what was that with him destroying all the nuclear weapons of Earth? I was hopelessly reminded of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the very similar plot line of Superman also destroying all the nuclear weapons of Earth, and that's not a good thing since that film was total rubbish. And didn't Apocalipse have the intention of destroying the world anyway? So why bother to destroy the nuclear weapons first? The fact is that this villain should be called Disaster, for that is what he is and no amount of amazing special effects can change that. Which is a shame, when you have someone like Oscar Isaac playing him.The truth is that Apocalipse seems to confirm that superhero movies are increasingly becoming an "assembly line" at risk of a creative emptiness, one that not even amazing casts like this one can save from mediocrity.In short: even though it was put together with the best of Hollywood's technical expertise, and Quicksilver has another amazing scene in it that is worth a watch (although it does begs the question: why repeat something that had already been done in the previous film? Were the filmmakers that devoid of inspiration? You already now the answer...), this film is essentially more of the same, treading a path already (and more expertly) tread, without bringing any special grit or inspiration to the franchise. To be watched at home; save your money for something more worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK-ish film. Nothing great or new. Just another generic destruction movie that is the weakest of the rebooted X-Men trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the trailer of this movie made you apprehensive, you had every right to be because the movie is everything the trailer threatened to be- mediocre. Just when we thought that superhero movies were going to new places, we get X-Men: Apocalypse which firmly drags the genre back to mediocrity.Deadpool was wild (and incredibly enjoyable), BvS tried to be different(and failed miserably but still had style which this movie doesn't have) and Civil War was awesome (by being both different and great fun at the same time). But X-Men: Apocalypse doesn't even try to be different. It plods on with a run of the mill story and CGI heavy destruction that interests not one bit (the CGI too is varied. It swings between great to downright crappy). It is overloaded with characters that do not interact and are probably there only for fan-service. So Cyclops's brother dies and it is supposed to jolt you emotionally- only it doesn't. Why would I care about a character that I have hardly seen for 10 minutes in prior X:Men movies and whose interaction with his brother mostly happens off-screen? Simply put, there are a lot of characters but no character development. Olivia Munn as Psylocke is wasted (the lady has so few lines in the movie that at one point you wonder if she is speech impaired). Apocalypse's horsemen are supposed to be super powerful but all they do is act as musclemen and nothing more. Archangel has as much charisma as a mannequin and save for a mild effort at a back story, Storm hasn't much to boast about either. Only Magneto has some semblance of character development but even that feels stale- how many times do we need to see Magneto decide to be the bad guy because his family is killed only to flip sides at the end to join forces with the good guys? This has been happening like forever (since X:2 came out that is). James McAvoy is his usual self as Professor Xavier and the only reason Mystique is so important to the story is because she is played by Jennifer Lawrence (who gives her best phoned-it-in performance). You got to wonder how a shape shifter is such a big deal in a battle among crazy powered freaks (I mean one stroke from Psylocke and she is minced meat) but hey, just because it's Jennifer Lawrence, screw logic. And whats with Apocalypse's make up? The guy looks more like Ivan Ooze from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the character is incredibly one dimensional- just one of your generic bad guys that wants to end the world.Civil War has set the bar high for superhero movies but X-Men: Apocalypse firmly brings it down. The plot is messy and is filled with way too many characters than it can handle. The climatic battle is filled with uninteresting mindless carnage more in the lines of Michael Bay and Ronald Emmerich. The coolest (and the best part) is Quicksilver's super fast evacuation of the X-Mansion. It's really an extension of the scene in DOFP but is longer here and still super cool. We do get a cameo from Wolverine (clearly not in his best shape) but hey, Wolverine is Wolverine right?If you are a casual fan of the X-men (like me), you will find this flick OK-sh (if you are a die hard fan, you will probably love the film and hate me) but as a casual viewer (as most outside the U.S are), you might find it underwhelming- a sense of been there, seen that.Oh and by the way, we do get a post credit scene which serves no purpose at all and is just there because Marvel made it cool to have post-credit scenes. It is just vague and doesn't actually mean anything significant</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men Re-introduced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago I saw X-Men Days of Future Past and it was then that I fell in love with the cast of the "new team" if you will. The new cast. To put into words how I felt about the movie I waited two years researching everyday about when the new one would come out and how they would portray the infamous villain Apocalypse. After two years I saw the film and was amazed at how terrific it was. I chose to give this film a ten for a few reasons. The way the actors and actresses that were new to the scene playing younger versions of Jean Grey, Scott Summers, and even Nightcrawler himself felt like I was watching a true comic book on screen. I felt a little disappointed in the way that they held back on Apocalypse. It was like they didn't let him show his full potential and powers like in the comics, but Oscar Isaac did a fantastic job at how they wanted him to. So I chose to watch this film as one of it being about showing the X-Men how they should've been and what went wrong after X3. Like most people have said, Quicksilver steals the show again. And I hope that fans will speak up enough for him to feature in his own movie. Deadpool is a perfect example. It never would've happened without fans speaking up. Quicksilver's character is one that would really build on the X-Men franchise and would show us a side of the films that we've never seen before. McAvoy's Professor X is once again a fantastic portrayal after Sir Pat Stewart's X. A certain cameo from another classic X-Men character I felt was cut short too soon. But it did help us get over the not so great 4th installment in the X-Men franchise from back in 2009. To finish this up and hopefully bring some light to some of these negative reviews, this film is wonderful. A classic X-Men film with a fitting amount of screen time for almost every character. Quicksilver's scenes bring heart to this movie and if we speak loud enough, maybe, just maybe will they hear our cry for a Quicksilver standalone film that will explore his relationship with a certain character. The film is a turning point in the series and is a perfect way to continue the team of mutant students known as the X-Men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best superhero movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched Deadpool and Civil War, loved both of them, but I still preferred X-Men to both of them. First watching some reviews and all, I almost didn't even want to watch it in the cinema, but I'm glad I did. First I will adreess some points that botter the most other reviewers, then I will talk about my pros and cons.Apocalypse was a very simple villain, he wants to own the world, he wants mutants to rule it. He has a huge number of powers. He sees people control the earth and he wants to change that. He is the only villain that actually can be allowed just to want to destroy the world, it's logical, he wants to destroy so that he would rule. His "horsemen" are Storm, Psylocke, Angel and Magneto. Storm joins because he seems to her like a hero he seeks, Psylocke is a mercenary that wants change, Angel is an injured ex fighter and Magneto lost his family. They all have motive and want to role the world along with Apocalypse. For me Apocalypse was a great villain, but he was a villain with an usuall goal and people expect Jokers all the time. If you compare him to Loki he had more reason to destroy the world and Loki was an awesome villain.Pros: -Jean was awesome, I didn't even like the actress, but she delivered big time. -Quicksilver was just being usually cool self-Movie is extreamlly active, full of events -CGI for me was awesomelly made, I didn't watch it in 3D, but it was great -Magneto plot from good guy to villain and back was given a great background -Scoot was finally useful for a change, that didn't happen since X- men and even then he was just making a messCons: -Psylocke was not that strong really, even with her power amplified -Stryker feels kind of forced and he the film could have skipped it, but seeing Wolverine new origin was great -Moira MacTagger was just in the way all the time, but she did have a nice love story All in all, for me it's the best X-Men movie ever and one of the best superhero movies of all time. It's filled with action and i definitely recommend watching it at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW!!! X-Men Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow!!! What writer Chris Claremont did for the Xmen comic in the 80's Director Writer Brian Singer is doing for the Xmen film franchise this movie brings us full circle even through the altered time line after Days of Future Past back to the first Xmen film only now that the time line was altered do we see the true repercussion. That's saying a lot people get twisted with timeline alterations but this connects things from all the movies and of course from First Class to Apocalypse. More than that it gives more foundation to what we see when Logan returns to the mansion after Future Past to find Phoenix and Cyclops alive and more than that go back to the first film and remember Xavier knew things about Logan. When timelines are altered somethings stay the same but play out differently like Mystique working in the Danger Room make note of the Sentinels from the first movie to the newest perfect example of timeline alterations yet stay the same. Brian Singer is a Genius. OH Yeah go see it omg its so good critics be damned Long Live the Phoenix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End of the World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The end of the world. That is probably not what you wanted to hear, but it is coming and it is true, just not in the shape or form of a mutant destroying the world. The tag line is: only the strong will survive. But who are the strongest. Nothing is short of the strong-willed human being or mutant for that matter. When we left our friends/heroes, they were all divided and went their separate ways (Days of Future Past) and the beginning started for some. But then the unthinkable happened ? the end of the world. I don't want to spoil this review for the people who have not seen it, but I will say this everything this movie stood for and stands for will ultimately come out in the wash. Leading an all-star cast, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender give extraordinary performances. With this the second movie of Summer 2016, this movie will stand the test of time. It was beyond incredible. It was earth shattering. I know what you may be thinking. Not really, because unlike Charles Xavier, I can't read minds. But the future is bright for the X-Men Franchise all the thanks for that goes to a brilliant director who lead the all-star cast and thousands upon millions of crew members and fans alike to stand up for what they believe in. Bryan Singer, you are an incredible director, you made it easy for us believers to embrace the strongest in us. Our world may be coming to an end, but not the end for the X-Men. Thank you, Bryan for your tenacity and for your blood, sweat and tears. So, for those of you who did see the movie, the post-credits scene ? something is about to happen ? I believe that there will be another one, another X-Men, do you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fixes all the mistakes made in the old movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some reviews are stating that it doesn't make sense with the rest of the X-Men movies. Well, apparently these reviewers are not aware that in the previous X movie AKA Days of Future Past, they changed THE PAST, hence, they changed all the events that occurred in X-Men, X2 and The Last Stand, so obviously this movie has nothing to do with those three movies! This is a whole new chain of events, and we get to see some of the characters background, and how everything goes after they changed the past ten years ago (let's remember First class was in the 60's, Days of Future Past was in the 70's, and this movie is supposed to be in the 80's). The spectacular opening with a flashback to ancient Egypt explains Apocalypse character, and we get to see his horsemen who die trying to save him. We finally get to see Havok (Alex Summers) and Cyclops (Scott Summers) as brothers, and the beginning of the relationship between Cyclops and Jean (Phoenix). Another fact that fans wanted to see in the movies is that Quicksilver is Magneto's son, which is stated by Quicksilver (Peter Maximoff) but Magneto is not aware of it, probably will be addressed in future movies. Also, Quicksilver totally steals the show, along with Nightcrawler. We get to see a more powerful Storm. And talking about powerful, Jean sets free her inner Phoenix, unlike the old movies where she goes crazy because she can't control her power, this movie shows a young Jean who is actually encouraged by Professor X to use the Phoenix Force to defeat Apocalypse. So she is not going to die like in X3, as we already saw in Days Of Future Past, when Wolverine wakes up in the new Future. We see the personal struggles of all these mutants, their fears and their goals, I have to say that the new cast is perfect portraying their characters.</fullReview>

X men's canvas is so big that all avengers, batman, superman were small in front of this. After the movie ended i bought another ticket and watched it again. How can one still seek improvement or can quote like" it could be better". This movie is the best. And apocalypse's costume is just the perfect, even better than the original with an over sized jaw like thanos, and joker like lips. This is the finest comics based story. Its greatness forced me to write something about it, as i thought this movie deserve to be watched twice at least. PLEASE WATCH IT IF YOU HAVE EVER WATCHED A FICTION, AND YOU WILL WITNESS HOW GLORIOUS CAN A MOVIE BE.I RATE IT 11 out of 10.</fullReview>

This is definitely the best X-Men ever, surpassing Days Of Future Past which I thought was the best X-Men movie at that time for me.....will definitely watch it again. There are some stunning visual effects throughout the whole movie from beginning to end, and the cast is incredible, We get to see Magneto in a different light and in a more personal way,Quicksilver once again delivers and cracks you up. Definitely better than Captain America: Civil War. So, I would definitely recommend this one to anyone. Don't listen to the critics go see it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-cellent Movie - Want to Watch Once More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie because, as a child I really wanted to know how pyramids were built. I was told that it might have taken years of toil for thousands of slaves. Now this movie presented a different idea on how it was built and I loved it.It is amazing that people have started to look at spirituality from a scientific perspective of mutation. At a certain time while watching this movie I thought Jesus too could have been a mutant or an alien with access to better technology. This perspective is of significance when mass obsessions like religion, race and nationality are causing divisions in human society.I had been watching all these 3D superhero movies recently and all of them displays a lot of fight. Fight between individual super people, and fight between clans of super people. During the fight normal people and what they value being almost turned to dust. This certainly signifies the power struggle between politicians, business-men and the wars they create in today's real world.I was starting to feel bored of all this, that I was wanting to stay at home and watch Doraemon on TV, rather than going for this movie. TV was taken over by mom and sis so I had to go for the movie. And the movie made me think that the psyche of these story makers seems to be obsessed with some sort of clan formation and the struggle to prove who is better. With all due respect to Stan.All the actors had done a great job. My most favorite being Quicksilver by Evan Peters. Quicksilver had inspired a Tamil movie '24' which was released a few weeks ago. This movie portrayed a scientist freezing time with his watch.The audience in the theater where I was watching X-Men: Apocalypse, really applauded when Hugh Jackman appeared on screen. Sophie Turner as Jean was successful in portraying the inner conflict that Jean was facing. The fear about the dark side of her mutation and the love she had for her friends.Days of Future Past had presented the idea that, what we see in an X-Men movie need not really be what actually happened in the movie. Because there could be multiple realities based on the sequence of incidents. Events could be manipulated through time travel. This really helped overcome the multiple questions that might rise about specific characters and the incidents in other movies in X-men series.Because, we try to connect the events in one movie with other movie in the series. For example, In X-Men 2 we see Jean murdering Charles and in the Last Stand we see Jean being murdered by Logan. Where as in this one Jean ultimately realizes how to control her powers. In that case the movie that we saw earlier could be wrong. Storm's accent was different in this one and so on. Altogether, great entertainment. I just had a nice time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-men:Apocalypse never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it.It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. Director Bryan Singer did a great job.The movie is an absolute stunner - from storyboard, script, mutant characters, pace, cinematography, CGI, VFX etc... you get the picture. Some of the scenes got spellbinding visual effects. There are plenty of big action scenes throughout the film that really impresses. The cast are awesome. I think Oscar Isaac (Apocalypse) is a apt man to do the character. All the characters are perfectly done their job very well (Fassbender, McAvoy, Jennifer, nicholas, sophie etc...) The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. And I forgot to tell 2 characters Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) his appearance only 5-10 mins but that scenes are amazing. and another one is Evan Peters (Quicksilver) he is awesome I think he steals the show.So go and watch the movie on theatres. Its a good movie to all audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best X-MEN Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well when it comes to the authenticity of the movie, it was very well played. This movie not only contains action but also essence in the story of the X-MEN characters and how they came to be. It was not really an exact with the original comic release but I love it! The characters of each individual are very well played. There are some minor glitches but still almost perfect. The story is not dragging.When it comes to action and cinematography it is well laid out. It was like eating the best meal of the day. I cannot say anymore, it is for you to see. So allocate a free time and watch this movie. If you are an avid fan of the X-MEN comics then you will understand more about what I am saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to see the film with an older relative and a younger one. We all left the cinema buzzing about how great the film was. The last film we saw was Cap America Civil War and we all loved it but this was so much better in every way. The acting performances of Fassbender, Mcavoy et al were top notch, the action sequences were wonderful and then there was Quicksilver. Yes, Psylocke didn't say much (she's a henchwoman - they don't tend to speak, that is their role in life); yes there are a few back stories (still interesting though); and the plot moved forward with due pace. I was certainly not bored at any point. In fact it was so good I ate 9 of my fingernails (only 1 for Civil War). Please do not be put off by the negative reviews - my mum remembers almost being put off going to see Star Wars back in the 70s because of the negative reviews and was so glad she ignored them. Take heed - if you enjoy action/Superhero films and do not go to the cinema to see this you will regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an X-Men master piece, not because of the actor performances or how it was written, but because they managed to capture the essence of the original 90's X-Men Animated series, something I've personally been wanting to witness on the big screen for years.The themes are a lot more adult oriented unlike the other X-Men films. I'm very happy with the outcome of this film, and I'm definitely looking forward to more movies with the same tone.The film is very well put together, the actors are likable, their performances are true not only to the characters but to how they would truly behave given the chance they existed in our world.This movie will expand the X-Men universe to new horizons, go watch it, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this was probably the best X-Men film to date. It was really well done and I thought Oscar Isaacs as Apocalypse was superb. The action was awesome, there were good comedic relief moments and Michael Fassbender gave a stunning performance as Magneto once again. Great to see the origin stories of Storm, Jean and Cyclops. Sophie Turner is brilliant as a young Jean Grey coming to terms with the extent of her powers. I would advise not watching the trailer before you see the film as it gives away so much!! I saw the film having watched no trailers and was pleasantly surprised by 2 great moments.I don't really understand the Rotten Tomatoes critics rating as this is one great film, a must watch of 2016.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed a lot this new movie about X MEN, because of the actors, the photographs, the locations, and the story. It have fantastic scenes that you are going to enjoy, if you liked X MEN. The music is very good. It remembered me the TV cartoon series. I liked The role of Jennifer Lawrence. You are going to enjoy action scenes, but it has also interesting dialogues, the X MEN saga takes continuity strong with this new movie. Remember see the post-credits scene. The story takes place during 80's. It is linked very well to X MEN: First class, and X MEN: Days of future past. Quick Silver is spectacular. In 3D the movie works very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very familiar with IMDb but I've never written a review. Today I just signed up here to write this review. Believe me or not this is the greatest x-men movie ever could have been made by anyone. I'm just a crazy fan of x-men for last 25 years (though I'm just 31 years right now). I've played each of their games, have seen each &amp; every movies, cartoons everything, anything but this one is the greatest. This is for the fans, the real x-men fans. What they really want, it is all about. Just forget the critics, ignore whatever they say, they just want a movie rather than an x-men movie. Just go to the hall right now and watch it. Just watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is visually stunning and engaging. While the movie has a long runtime, it doesn't drag. The movie kept me engrossed the entire duration of the film. Critics have been far too harsh of this film, it is a good movie. There are some rather negative aspects of the film, though. One of those is the confusing timeline. It is a bit hard to trace through every character after the events of Days of Future Past. Even though the movie provides flashback to these events, it still remains rather confusing trying to remember the events of a movie that was filmed years ago. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and think that it is a solid addition to the X-Men film family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This review focuses on comparing the movie with the Age of Apocalypse comics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently read the "Age of Apocalypse Complete Epic" collection released by Marvel. Having just watched the movie I thought it would be cool to compare both while they're fresh in my mind.I'm giving this review a 10 because I loved the movie. As an adaptation of the original storyline it's a poor effort at best. The comics themselves haven't aged well. The episodic format, too many characters, repeating story structures, recurring clichés and lack of depth are not up to scrutiny compared to superior works like Neil Gaiman's Sandman and Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira.The Age of Apocalypse comic series is an alternate timeline in which Charles Xavier died before bringing the X-Men into fruition and in his stead Magneto became their leader and mentor. In this alternate reality a supremely powerful alien (Apocalypse) takes over the planet, making mutants the ruling class, exterminating and enslaving normal humans.First of all, half the fun of the comics is Magneto leading the X-Men. Normally a villain, to see his potential for good realised is awesome and in many ways he is a better leader than Xavier, much more active and passionate in his leadership. In the movie, of course, this is explored by having him join the X-Men in the final confront, but this happens too late and he is not explored at all as a leader, becoming just a powerful ally instead.In the comics Alex (Havoc) and Scott Summers (Cyclops), Hank McCoy (Beast) and others are made into villains. This brings strong reactions from fans - to have us see how a few mishaps in destiny would turn our beloved heroes into a ruthless racist (Cyclops) and mad scientist (Beast). Again in the movie this is done by having Storm and Angel become bad guys but they're not explored as such, they're just there as mere opponents and when Storm decides to stick around and become a X-Men no one even think it's weird at all (neither the audience nor the other mutants). If instead we could see Storm enjoy her darkside and repent later, it would be much closer to what we see in the comic saga.Apocalypse is a one-man army in the movie, always directly involved in leading his horsemen. In the comics he is instead a distant and ominous figure. He has built an entire empire to enforce his will on his behalf. Not only this gives him a much bigger air of empowerment but it also brings a much complex structure to his ranks. His horsemen are often battling against themselves for his favor, lower ranking officers are always eager and plotting to bring down current horsemen so they can take their place in the hierarchy, etc.This internal backstabbing is created by the design of Apocalypse's philosophy - his belief that "the strong will survive and the weak must die", which he constantly preaches. This quasi-religious faith gives Apocalypse (and his Age) a lot more depth and relevance as a metaphor for survival. The closest thing in the movie is a single line when he asks to "be taken to the strongest mutants" and Psylocke tells her she'll do so. It hardly comes close to what we see in the original saga.This is made only worse by the fact that this philosophy has a central role to play as contrast to the overarching philosophy behind X-Men. All the talk of the human species (homo sapiens) evolving into mutants (homo superior) is a metaphor for cultural evolution and personal empowerment. It tell us that it's OK to be weird and different because evolution is often weird and makes the new-and-improved stand out from the old. How normal humans react to mutants is a mirror of how society reacts to anything different ("not normal").In this light, Apocalypse's philosophy, while still being as much rooted in biology (Charles Darwin's theory of evolution) as the genetics that explain the mutant phenomena, is at times a ruthless exaggeration of Magneto's views that mutants are stronger/better than humans and at other times is a step backwards in the sense that it doesn't care about who is "more evolved", just about who has the raw power to crush his enemies - which as we see in other X-Men movies is often the non-mutants that control government, technology, etc.The resulting philosophical debate is a pretty interesting and enticing backdrop. In the movie, it's utterly lost and no attempt at all is made at preserving it.Visually, the comic book landscapes are urban post-apocalyptic ruins, like in Mad Max or the Fallout games. Again, this is hardly true to the film - except for a few scenes: like the aftermath of the University's destruction and the ruined cityscape of the final battle. It's understandable that producers wouldn't want to change the entire visual style of the X-Men movies and I was content with the few throwbacks in the movie.So, would it be possible to create a true X-Men: Apocalypse adaptation? The "Complete Epic" collection is almost 2000 pages long and it's not even complete. I don't think it's impossible though: much of the comics are episodic and many add little to the overall plot. The basic outline would boil down nicely to be explored in a single movie (or 2 if you wanted greater detail). Movies like Terminator do a great job of telling a complex story while still featuring great action. The same could have been done here.Unfortunately, there will never be another X-Men Apocalypse movie adaptation. It's sad so many elements that made the original series so unique to start with were lost in translation. Alas, despite being a poor adaptation, it turned out to be a pretty good X-Men movie and maybe even one of the best super-hero movies ever made, and it is undoubtedly more mature, grim and violent than earlier movies in the franchise.</fullReview>

Yes i enjoyed it and it was well produced and great acting . but the plot wasn't enough satisfying . obviously bringing a huge weird shaped villain back from death or creating it is a very popular plot now adays from action movie . c'mon guys it was failure on avengers and look pretty well here too. also the movie suffered lack of Wolverine , a very slow start and screen playing didn't rhythm with events. still worth watching , you gonna catch some funny moments and some cool action .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse continues with the adventures of the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier(James McAvoy). This film takes place 10 years after the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014). Charles has been successfully running his school for mutants. However, everything doesn't stay rosy, with the re-emergence of the world's first mutant, En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse(Oscar Isaac). Apocalypse is unhappy with the world of today. So, he sets about destroying the world, as we know it. Apocalypse takes the help of, Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto(Michael Fassbender), Angel(Ben Hardy), Ororo Munroe/Storm(Alexandra Shipp) &amp; Psylocke(Olivia Munn), to execute his malevolent plans. Now, it is up to the X-Men led by Charles Xavier, Raven/Mystique(Jennifer Lawrence) &amp; Hank McCoy/Beast(Nicholas Hoult) to stop Apocalypse &amp; his followers, from bringing about the destruction of the world. X-Men: Apocalypse is an outstanding film. Director Bryan Singer continues to make flawless X-Men movies after, X-Men(2000), X2(2003) &amp; X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014). I am really happy, that they finally introduced all the fan favorite mutants like, Jean Grey(Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops(Tye Sheridan), Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler(Kodi Smit-McPhee) &amp; Storm. The visual effects are fantastic. The destruction set pieces, are one of the highlights of the film. The Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver(Evan Peters) set piece, tops the Quicksilver set piece from X-Men: Days of Future Past(2014) &amp; is another highlight of the film. The climax of the movie is epic &amp; is a fitting finale to the trilogy of rebooted X-Men films, that began with X-Men: First Class(2011). The 3D is eye-popping &amp; has been put to great use, in pretty much every scene of the film. However, this movie is not just about the action &amp; destruction set pieces. The script by Simon Kinberg, Bryan Singer, Michael Dougherty &amp; Dan Harris, makes you genuinely care about each &amp; every character. Not the titular villain, of course! The audience will love to hate Apocalypse. The performances are another highlight of the film. James McAvoy is spectacular as Professor Charles Xavier. McAvoy's performance is more akin to Patrick Stewart's portrayal of Professor X, this time around. No need to fret though. McAvoy makes his portrayal of Charles, his own. Michael Fassbender is flawless as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Fassbender effortlessly portrays Erik's grief &amp; rage. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Raven/Mystique. Nicholas Hoult is awesome as Hank McCoy/Beast. Oscar Isaac is great as En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse. Rose Byrne is impressive as Moira Mactaggert. Evan Peters is incredible as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver. I am so glad, that Peters' character has a much more important &amp; fleshed out role, this time around. Josh Helman is effective as Col. William Stryker. Sophie Turner is superb as Jean Grey. Tye Sheridan is perfect as Scott Summers/Cyclops. Lucas Till is good as Alex Summers/Havok. Kodi Smit-McPhee is excellent as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler. Ben Hardy is impressive as Angel. Alexandra Shipp is great as Ororo Munroe/Storm. Olivia Munn is awesome as Psylocke. The supporting cast is effective. X-Men: Apocalypse is a must watch, for fans of the X-Men film franchise. Go, be thoroughly entertained!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a spoiler free review cause you don't need spoilers before going to see this movie. Is absolutely amazing how finally Bryan becomes more faithful to the comics and they paid attention to a lot things that the community complained about it past movies. This is truly a masterpiece movie. No character feels left out, all of them have a big role to play and all of them show a really incredible display of power during the movie. Go see it the movie is awesome. My only advice is not to watch the trailers, videos and clips cause they spoiled too much. You wan't regret this. It is really a awesome movie with a great feeling of X-Men.The reviews saying that the movie is bad are all misleading cause everyone who goes see it, love it. On my theater everyone during many moments cheered a lot. And the final part of the movie is just memorable.What I liked the most about this movie is that it really showed the powers of the characters at their fullest and it didn't focused only on some characters, it focused on all of them with a great pacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A messy, lifeless and outdated superhero movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe came into being in 2008, the superhero genre has undergone an incredible revolution. Nowadays, we're getting numerous top-quality comic book movies year on year, so when one that doesn't quite match that comes along, it feels immensely disappointing, which is unfortunately the case with X-Men: Apocalypse.Before I get into why, however, I want to say that this isn't a terrible film. It's still got some great moments, the introduction of characters like Jean Grey, Nightcrawler and Cyclops is great to see, and, had it been released twenty years ago, it wouldn't seem so poor.However, modern superhero movies are so much more than just bad guys and good guys, and you need far more depth in a story to make an entertaining film. X-Men: Apocalypse, however, delivers a clunky, convoluted plot almost completely devoid of emotional depth, good characterisation or comic relief, and at nearly two and a half hours long, it's a real slog to get through.My biggest issue with the film comes in the form of its narrative. Although it does improve by the end of the film, the first hour and twenty minutes are very poor. Spanning between Apocalypse's creation millennia ago and the 1983, where the main story takes place, the film spends far too long flying to and fro around the world establishing various different characters' back stories, and it turns the film into a mess.Yes, the plot eventually centres its focus in the final act as it heads towards the inevitable final battle, but for a good half of the whole movie, it's very difficult to get grounded on what's going on in the greater scheme of things, which is surprising considering how well Singer's Days Of Future Past managed to handle its even more complex plot.Another problem with the film is that it feels very lifeless. One of the reasons that First Class remains my favourite X-Men film is because it had a sense of fun to it as well as being an impressive action spectacle. Apocalypse does have its obligatory Quicksilver scene (which is brilliant), but apart from that, there's very little sense of fun here, making it almost as brooding a film as Zack Snyder's DC movies, which was not great to see.But sometimes, with a degree of emotional depth and intrigue, a superhero film can still pull off a dark atmosphere. Again, however, Apocalypse fails to deliver. Throughout the whole film, there's only one scene early on with a proper emotional power, which makes the rest of the movie feel very stagnant, so I just wasn't able to get excited and wrapped up in the story.In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse is a big disappointment. Being a big, action-packed blockbuster that lacks any real intelligence or depth, it feels like it was made for release in 2003, but given the high quality that so many expect from superhero films nowadays, a film that comes across as a very stale, lifeless spectacle just doesn't impress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema today with low expectations since First Class and The Days of Future past were excellent, this movie was just as great, if not, better.The music, the acting, the action, and the characters were all amazing. Each character had all their turns equally in the movie and I thought that was a great idea to get to know them better. Charles Xavier and Magneto were both well done and I thought that Isaac AKA Apocalypse did really well in the movie. All the other mutants did exceptionally well. In my own opinion, I'd go as far to say, but this is the Superhero movie of the year for me, even though the year hasn't ended yet. The battle and the intensity of the movie gave me goosebumps and I was at the edge of my seat. I hope that they are going to make more Xmen movies in the future.</fullReview>

Right from the start, one of the best openings ever, the movie gets me going and maybe it slowed down a bit but i didn't notice because i was to excited and intrigued. This might be the greatest x-men yet, at least now I think that it is. I found my self wanting more after the film had ended even though i had been seeing submarines and deep sea creatures for that last 30 minutes due to a full bladder.I think I'm gonna go and see it again before i can buy it for the collection.That all.</fullReview>

And we also get to see some colorful costumes in the end) the reviews are mixed but watch this movie and enjoy the ride!) The actors brought their a-game although Olivia Munn and Ben hardy aren't given much. However their action sequences makes it up for what they lack when it comes down to dialogue. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are fantastic as always. Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Lawrence are somewhat okay but not wasted! The new kids on the X-Mansion are great and hopefully the next movie will explore their personalities. Each kid shines on their own and fans won't be disappointed. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first off I need to say that I am not very skilled at writing reviews. But as I have just finished watching the movie and as it really impressed amazement on my mind I felt it was my duty to convey my thoughts on this movie. I've always been a fan of X-men (the movies not the comics--and x-men evolution no matter what you think of it) and as I loved the first series of x-men I was a bit let down by the prequel. It did not send me into transports of joy and the action was a little weak but I grew attached to the characters because they were really well crafted and acted well (Fassbender I love you dear). So I went to the movies with little expectation and the trailer I had seen did not reveal too much amen I was still able to be surprised.. And goddammit was I surprised!! Right from the beginning I was engrossed in the movie. The soundtrack also did wonders and greatly contributed to the movie. The movie really felt like apocalypse was looming. The action was neat. The acting was intense. The effects were well measured and beautiful. And the plot was correct but it's x-men I don't expect a mind-boggling story. To summarize I went to see and enjoy, I saw and took delight in doing so, and I left and felt completely entranced and entertained. Apocalypse moreover was really a charismatic villain although I expected him to be more terrifying.Don't pay attention to rotten tomato and Metacritic. Only IMDb's users have common sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most epic and ambitious superhero movie of 2016 that did not fail to deliver</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In X-MEN: APOCALYPSE the stakes are higher, the X-Men are battling against a god-like mutant. X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is an EPIC movie for comic book movie lovers. X-Men Apocalypse had a great balance of drama and action, it was a tearjerker and an adrenaline inducer. For a 2 and a 1/2 hour movie I did not feel the length of this movie, from the beginning till the end i was hooked. It was gorier than the previous X-Men films (excluding Deadpool), especially the intro where you'll go "ooh that was savage" but nonetheless the intro worked for me, it got me hooked and interested on this movie.Critics were harsh on this movie, after I watched the movie I went home and looked at the reviews, and I was shocked that it got this reception. I could not remember myself getting bored on this movie. I had a great expectation for this movie and for me it did not fail to deliver!This movie really showed the "true birth" of the X-Men, it wasn't another Jennifer Lawrence movie, in this movie they really gave each character a spotlight. Olivia Munn, Lana Condor, and Alexandra Shipp were born to be their respective characters. All the actors were on point in this film, especially Fassbender. Every scene Magneto was in really connected to the audience, it was perfect.All characters stood out in this movie, each and every character's abilities were showcased in this film, except Jubilee's which is sad because I was expecting to see Jubilee in action but psshh it's just a minor thing, and at least Jubilee finally had some screen time and dialogue. Kodi Smit-McPhee's performance as Nightcrawler was a killer! This version of Nightcrawler is very close to the one in X- Men: Evolution (Animated Series).The Quicksilver scene was awesome.The cameo of this character that you may (if you watched the trailer) or may not know was fantastic. This "act" had a horror/action feel, it really showed that this character was made to be a killing-thing, and gave hint to this character's intimacy with another character in the future.The climax was very epic that i left the cinema with goosebumps all over me. Whatever you have seen on the trailers, FORGET IT! The trailers were nothing compared to what the movie had shown. IT WAS UNEXPECTED.In my opinion, this is by far the best comic book movie of 2016 and the best X-Men movie ... so far. Kudos to Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg!"ALL IS REVEALED"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest X-Men instalment fails to live up to its name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five months into 2016 and we are already in our fourth comic-book movie of the year. We've had the fast-talking Deadpool, the gladiatorial battle of Batman v Superman and an epic showdown between superheroes in Captain America: Civil War but now it's the turn of the X-Men in X-Men: Apocalypse, a film that doesn't quite live up to its name.After events in Washington DC, the X-Men are disbanded and living as normal a life as they can. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) runs a school for the 'gifted' mutants and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), who is seen as a hero to mutants after her actions in Washington DC, goes in search of Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a teleporter. When the one considered to be the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), awakens from a deep sleep in 1983 Cairo and gathers his Four Horsemen; Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender), he plans to destroy the Earth and rebuild it in his own image.With this threat against the world looming ever large, the X-Men must unite to save it and its population, human and mutant.The biggest problem this film had was its titular villain, Apocalypse. He's just so dull and lacks any character that could have made him an interesting opponent for the X-Men. A talent like Oscar Isaac tries his best to make it work but overall, he deserves better from the writing team.It's the writing in this film that really does hold it back as well. The story feels flat, the dialogue is unbearably corny in places and there is no real room for any real character development. It's a film that runs for far too long also, coming in at just under two and a half hours, meaning there are quite a few moments that feel like they drag. It doesn't help when someone like Jennifer Lawrence is intent on sleepwalking her way through the film.The film does have some genuinely good moments, and you won't be surprised to hear that Evan Peters' Quicksilver is involved in two of them. He gets a moment similar to that in Days of Future Past, the only difference here is that it's at a really dramatic moment which the comedic elements totally nullify. No surprise either that Michael Fassbender gets a few of the more memorable as both he and James McAvoy are once again the real stand out performers.These films have never really been about going for all out spectacle however, in this one they go all guns blazing with the finale and try to deliver a huge action set-piece. Some of it works but unfortunately, the whole thing feels all too unimpressive thanks to some some dodgy CGI and uninspired fight choreography.Introducing a slate of new mutants mightn't have helped their cause in this case because they try to juggle the finale to showcase all of the talents that these mutants possess. I've spoken about the lack of character development already and it just seems strange to me that, apart from Magneto, the villains are totally void of it. Storm, Angel and Psylocke are all poorly served by the story and feel more like mere henchmen than powerful mutants. Out of all the new recruits, I was most happy with Scott Summers, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler played by Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee respectively. Jean Grey and Scott Summers in particular are dealt a better hand by the story and one of them gets one of the film's best moments, almost feeling like a middle finger to how that same character was treated in The Last Stand. There's also a very familiar face that turns up towards the end and his involvement was more welcome than I was thinking it would be.I can't say X-Men: Apocalypse is terrible because it's far from being terrible. It just doesn't live up to the standards set by First Class or Days of Future Past, which is quite disappointing. The final part of the finale and the film's closing moments do have me excited for the next instalment. Who knows, with this new team it could be the best yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least alright</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the amazing "X-Men: Days Of Future Past", we were all hyped about the next movie coming up featuring beloved villain Apocalypse. It was a tough act to follow, but it wouldn't have been that enjoyable either way. There are a lot of pros and cons, but the cons dominate here. What was weird about this movie was that it seems like Apocalypse didn't even do that much. I mean, he didn't talk a lot and he just sort of stood around a lot. We should have seen more of his origin and the exact point that he was created. He was older than Ancient Egypt. Also, why was this a prequel to the original movies? We already showed with "X-Men: First Class" that a good prequel could be made.There's no point in placing this in the past. We even got another great movie taking place at this time which made more sense via time travel. Wolverine does in fact appear in this movie, but only briefly. Yeah, when you think about it, his presence is pretty pointless. It's like they were just trying to give him a brief cameo like Professor X in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine". The weirdest part has to be this idiotic move Apocalypse does. In one scene, he actually has access to all the world's nuclear weapons and then he throws them all in the sky. Why doesn't he just, I don't know, USE THEM to kill people?! I guess one could argue that he didn't want to kill everyone and just rule over them, but that makes no sense. It's later shown that he does want to rebuild the Earth from the ruins he'll create. Why not just use those missiles to do it? It would have been the easiest thing to do. All they had to say was that Havoc severed the ties with Apocalypse so he couldn't fulfill his mission.There's one scene where the characters come out of watching "Return Of The Jedi" and remark that they're sure the third one (this) was the worst. Is that meant to be a shot at itself? The third X-Men movie was considered by many people to be the worst, but most everyone agrees now that "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" was the worst. "The Phantom Menace" was the fourth created, which again, could be a reference to the fourth X-Men movie. Ironically, this movie is now in between. I also saw "Up The Academy" listed there, which could be another injoke as that movie was discredited by the people at MAD Magazine how the first Wolverine movie was.For all the flak I give this movie, it's still by no means really bad. It's great to see Quicksilver again and he is as entertaining as ever. Yeah, they do reuse a lot of jokes from his first appearance, but they still work pretty well. The scenes with Magneto are actually really well done. The best part in the whole movie is probably him seeing his daughter die and his reaction. These are really sincere scenes and they advance the story well. The visuals are really good in this. Still, it's too long and the last fight scene just seems to go on forever. Even the scene after the credits goes on forever! I do like the idea of them showing more of the characters and their fates. I say that while it's better than "Batman Vs. Superman", it's nowhere near as good as "Captain America: Civil War". It's fine for a single watch, but nothing you'd want to return to. **1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In no way am I saying X-Men Apocalypse is a bad movie. However, with the glut of super-hero movies done well, this one is definitely in the average category. Apparently, Apocalypse was one of the first Mutants to appear a little more than 5,000 years ago in Egypt. With untold power, he was about to transfer his mind to another when the attempt was thwarted by his minions. It left him buried underneath the Earth until a cult reawakens him. Also discovering this long-forgotten mutant is CIA Agent Moriah MacTaggert (Rose Byrne). When the vault is opened it causes a world-wide tremor that alerts our favorite wheel-chair bound Mutant, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy). They reunite. At the same time, we find Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) living quietly in Poland as a working man with a family. He has a wife and a child. However, he is discovered and local authorities kill (by accident) his new loved ones. His new anger makes him ripe for recruiting for Apocalypse who is seeking new minions. He also adds Ororo Munroe/Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Angel (Ben Hardy), and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). At the same time, other mutants make themselves available to counter the power-mad ancient Mutant. This includes Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Scott Sommers (Ty Sheridan), Night Crawler (Kodi-Smit McPhee), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) who all must band together to stop Apocalypse. The movie has some good things - mostly in McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Lensher, respectively. Both men play their familiar parts with such adeptness and depth - especially Fassbender. Magneto is one of the best Mutant Villains because of his complexity, conflict, and pain. He is someone you can sympathize with, especially with the discovery of his family. Another great aspect are some of the supporting characters, especially Quicksilver who steals about every scene he occupies. He also has a great scene of his endeavor to save a bunch of young Mutants from an explosion. Jennifer Lawrence is probably the best, usurping the role from a quiet, sinister Rebecca Rojmin Stamos. Also, this one (like First Class and Days of Future Past) is wonderfully etched with the time surrounding the events. This time, it is 1983 where we have the musings of Return of the Jedi by the cadre of Mutants. However, as they ponder the points of the finale of the original Star Wars Trilogy, a huge hint of foreshadowing occurs when one of them says "The third is usually the weakest of a trilogy." They hit the nail head on. Not every trilogy ender can be an Iron Man III or Captain America III (and the Mutants could have used the Avengers help in this one). First, there are too many characters and sub-stories to follow. Just like Last Stand, do we need this many main Mutant characters? At a point, it becomes exhausting. And while Fassbender, Lawrence, and Peters are stellar, the rest of the Mutants don't have much depth. Another strike is the use of special effects over story and character. It is too much, especially towards the end with an over- the-top climax and resolution where the CGI distracts from the conflict. Moreover, one really has to know the whole plot line from First Class, Days of Future Past, and even the original X-Men Trilogy. In other words, this one is hard to watch unless you have seen ALL of those previous movies to know how they progress with the story arcs. I'm not saying it is a total washout. It is certainly no Spider Man 3, or even Last Stand, but it fails to deliver the depth, fun, story, and character the two previous installments offered. I still recommend it, just don't expect it to be as entertaining as previous installments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun - but not the best superhero movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting how from time to time we have two or even three films released close to one another which have essentially the same plot. Think, for instance, of "Armageddon" and "Deep Impact" in 1998 or "White House Down" and "Olympus Has Fallen" in 2013. So, in the first half of 2016, we have three movies that fundamentally tell the same story: in order of release "Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice", "Captain America: Civil War" and now "X-Men: Apocalypse". In each, we have a superhero production in which superheroes knock the hell out of each other rather than concentrate on an independent bad guy.Which of the three is the best? For me, it is "Captain America". "Batman v Superman" had too few characters to fill two and a half hours, while "X-Men" had too many characters with insufficient back story on most of them. "Captain America" just about managed its large cast list and was helped by our knowledge of most of the characters from previous movies.Including "The Wolverine", "Apocalypse" is the eighth outing for the X-Men of the Marvel Comics franchise and Bryan Singer, who helmed the first two and the last one, is back as director for the fourth time, so the work is in good hands. It looks splendid with yet more destruction of iconic world landmarks - although the apparent death of millions of innocents is totally overlooked in a work that references the Holocaust - but the problem is with the mutants themselves.The eponymous Apocalypse (an unrecognisable Oscar Isaacs) wants to destroy everything and everybody for no good reason and manages to recruit four aides or horsemen with ridiculous ease and again for no clear reason. The female actors are especially badly served: Jennifer Lawrence, back as Raven/Mystique, has too few decent lines, while newcomers to the franchise Alexandra Shipp (as Storm) and Olivia Munn (as Psylocke) are terribly underwritten. Best not to think too much about the plot or script and just enjoy the visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The franchise is dying with every release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either the X-Men films are getting worse, or I'm just too old and too cynical to invest in the farce anymore.I still maintain that "X2" is the best film in the series. It had a dynamism and a smartness of pace that has been severely lacking in the latest installments to date. I had hoped Singer's return would bring back those punchy, high octane, humorous elements which I enjoyed."Days of Future Past" almost managed it, with some terrific action sequences, and a real sense or threat, but the time travel story was messy and only created confusion. Its saving grace was Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, which has certainly carried the series a good deal of the way so far. This latest installment unfortunately suffers from his absence.Overall I found "X-Men: Apocalypse" to be dull, predictable, devoid of humour, cliché-ridden and embarrassingly hammy in parts. The dialogue is often childish and silly, Professor Xavier's sophomoric slobbering over Moira MacTaggart is one cringey example of a 'dumbing down'. Oscar Isaac's performance as the titular villain is believably threatening, but he is betrayed by a ridiculous costume and makeup that gives him the appearance of an 80's glam rock diva. His 4 horsemen are also woefully unimpressive, and I couldn't help but chuckle at the many shots of them posturing around together in what was supposed to be an imposing death brigade, but looks more like a bunch of awkward misfits at a rainbow party.Sophie Turner does not convince as Jean Grey. Perhaps it's the throaty, whiny tone to her voice that means I just can't see her as anything but Sansa Stark doing a generic American accent. She certainly doesn't look like she could grow up to be Famke Janssen, who played the older Jean, and that bothered me too. The movie clearly wants us to be wowed by the effects. The action is more bombastic and world-ending than ever, yet manages to feel stilted. Landmarks explode and spiral in a whirl of cluttered CGI, yet none of these sequences have any real impact, or sense of danger, since no actual people are visibly caught up in the destruction. There's just no reason to care.We also have a bullet-time montage literally copy and pasted from the last film where Quicksilver zips effortlessly through a building to save the inhabitants from a creeping explosion, all set to "Sweet Dreams" by Eurythmics. It feels so out of place tonally, and ultimately lazy and arrogant for expecting people to laugh at the same goofy gag all over again.Throughout the whole film I just couldn't shake this seen-it-all- before feeling. A mixture of bemusement and boredom. I fear it can only get worse from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrying the mutant torch with pride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the events of DoFP, I'd been really excited to see how the studios would take the X-Men time-lines. I really enjoyed this movie, and am impressed with where the current story line seems to be heading.The usual angst that comes with these movies appears to center more around Erik once again (how many unfortunate events will they put him through? Jeez). I really felt for the guy; he's already lost so much, and losing his wife and daughter was the absolute worst to watch. The conflict needed to happen in order to push Erik over the edge, but was it REALLY the only option?The new cast for young X-Men did a wonderful job with bringing beloved characters back to life. I really loved Sophie Turner as Jean Grey. (And a huge kudos to Oscar Isaac!)I also enjoyed the reveal of The Phoenix at the end of the movie. I hope they do a better job with that sub-plot unlike the original movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but worst one of the Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i watched this movie,i wasn't really pumped up for it neither was i expecting a lot from it and after i watched it the result was okay.What i can say is that X:Men Apocalypse is like the Age of Ultron or Transformers of the X:Men universe and that appealed to me because they tried to do something different with the franchise,its almost more like a blockbuster movie than a drama-like comic book movie that they did with X-Men:First Class and Days of Future Past and i liked that they took a different route.This movie was long though and that's fine as long as it is captivating,but some scenes where just dragging on and on like the multiple times Apocalypse was recruiting his "Housemen" which began to feel a bit longer than it needed to be.One advantage though is that the characters of the movie were developed nicely and key moments between them didn't feel rushed which was a plus,however for a comic book movie it takes a longer time than usual for the movie to kick on.Best way i can describe it is like this is a film of two halves as the first half is slow paced and plot hand-holding while the second half had a faster pace full of action and explosions.Most of the new characters in this movie are great like Scott Summers,Jean Grey and Nightcrawler,i really liked the way how these characters were handled because they are given a good backstory and their introduction is quick.I especially liked Tye Sheridan's Cyclops because in the past X:Men movies Cyclops was never given as much time as i hoped and in this one they all are.Psylocke however wasn't used as much as i hoped,Olivia Munn was OK as Psylocke but she didn't do much in the movie,its like she is just there and not really fleshed out(she did have some cool action scenes though),also Alexandra Shipp's Storm is another case as she was introduced well but felt flat as the movie went on.Quicksilver is back in this movie and he is again awesome as he had another speed scene and i am glad to say it was bigger and better than the speed sequence he had in Days of Future past.One character i wasn't sure about was Magneto,i really doubted if he needed to be in this movie because Apocalypse was the major villain in the movie.Magneto starts out well as he is given a simple arc and you understand why he joins Apocalypse to destroy the world,but at the end of the movie his arc doesn't come to a satisfactory conclusion as he took a backseat and felt like he didn't have a voice of his own and that is what i was afraid of.Out of the Trilogy,X-Men Apocalypse is the one with the most action,although there isn't much when compared to the length of the movie,because the movie starts out with an action sequence but after that there isn't another one for a long time until the last third of the movie which is fine because like First Class and Days of Future Past it was interesting enough and it was cool to see the more action in an X-Men movie as both First Class and Days of Future Past didn't have a lot of it,although there was a downside as some of the action didn't have much fluidity and came of a bit stiff.Now the villain.Apocalypse was a mixed bag for me in this movie,he had a satisfactory reason for destroying the world or remaking it,he is given a brief introduction but he was an interesting enough villain as the movie went on (and he monologuing for days).He was manipulative and powerful which i enjoyed,but during the last act of the movie he somehow falls flat as he had this particular arc in this movie,but it just felt sluggish and unnecessary and in the end he doesn't have a strong impact like previous villains had.In terms of Story it really isn't that great compared to First Class and DOFP,it is bigger but not better as it didn't have much dramatic moments which you are used to seeing in the X:Men movies and some scenes didn't have the gravitas it should have which is really disappointing.There is a lot of good humour in this movie as well which for me is always welcomed,The Wolverine Cameo was awesome and without giving much away Jean Grey in the last act...nailed it....nailed it.X:Men Apocalypse maybe not as great its prequels,but it is an enjoyable movie with in its own right and it really makes me more excited for more X:Men films to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst of the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I've been called many things over many lifetimes: Ra, Krishna, and Yahweh. I was there to spark and fan the flame of man's awakening, to spin the wheel of civilization."Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac)Yep, we're in trouble as you can tell from that quote. Sounds almost like a power-deluded presidential candidate. I would call X-Men: Apocalypse "absurd," but even that dramatic genre has an element of believability, such as waiting for a god that never shows. Waiting for Apocalypse produces only a doomed demi-god from very ancient Egypt, visiting the 1980's and taking over the world. Besides the usual Hollywood fire and brimstone, this hot mess has no redeeming conceit, such as a race of mothers nursing humanity to evil. I can't tell you the special circumstance other than weeping over Apocalypse because the great actor underneath is so hidden he could be a reality TV host firing everyone who doesn't agree with him.Except for Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique in a very skin-tight costume, even the CGI is ugly, disguised under tons of smashing rocks, rocks all over, nowhere near aesthetically inspiring. The crew of X-Men is pretty much dealing with two men, the aforementioned Apocalypse and the estranged Magneto (Michael Fassbender). As in the case of James McAvoy as Xavier and Fassbender, these two superb actors pale next to Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, possibly because those Shakespearean Brits brought so much gravity from so many years of living. No fault of the younger actors, who are given scant smart dialogue that abounded, for instance, in the anti-heroic Deadpool.Other marvels such as The Avengers do quite well in the character and wisecracking categories; the X men are humorless except for some attempts from younger heroes like Nightcrawler (Kodi Smitt-McPhee) and Quicksilver (Evan Peters), e.g., "No matter how fast I run, I always seem to be too late." A bright note is the thematic capstone declaring the key to human success, companionship:"It's over, Charles. You are beaten." (Apocalypse) "You'll never win." (Xavier) "Why not?" (Apocalypse) "Because you are alone . . . and I am not." (Xavier)</fullReview>

When you are overrating one character in one sequel, then whole lots of question arises for the previous releases. Specifically speaking, the role of magneto in this sequel.Brilliant acting from the side of James McAvoya and Michael Fassbender.Overall, if provided a better and interesting story-line rather than just simple brawling from start to end, then it would have been a successful movie like Captain America: Civil War.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse is a another disappointing film of the x-men franchise since X3(not including Origins)because the soft-reboot starts strong with First Class and got even stronger with Days Of Future.Apocalypse an be compared to Ultron. Generic,cliché and wasted.Oscar Isaac did a good job but his character was just unfocused and badly written.His plans is just to take over the world which we have seen so many times from now and his costume is just terrible(I'm sorry I just can't).The cast was fantastic but it was again unfocused.The main Characters were great especially Nightcrawler which was great,cyclops was charming,Jean Grey was not bad,Havoc was lovable Beast was good and finally the best Professor X.The 4 horsemen were underdeveloped except for magneto,whos was just fantastic in the film,Psyloche is just there for some reason,Angel was underdeveloped and storm was okay but again underdeveloped another one which is not from the 4 horsesemen is blue katniss(Katniss Everdeen/Mystique) who was annoying and cringe worthy.I almost forgot about Quicksilver,he stole the whole me for me in just one scene and that scene was creative and well executed.Verdict:The film has so much potential but it suffered by an unfocused Story and a emotional scenes which was completely wasted ,Underdeveloped characters,weak and clichéd villain,dull 1st act and unbalanced because of the overabundance of characters.X-Men is the good example if a franchise is now tired and run out of new ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they keep letting Singer make these movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I thought the movie started out great. First 40 minutes was solid. It was darker than the average x-men and was building with good pacing and character development. But as always, they have to throw around the monster budget they get to bolster up CGI with ridiculous destruction and throw out any acting abilities all of these really good actors have with stupid cliché lines.SPOILERS: Magneto: Fassbender is great. Too good to be in these movies when directed by Singer. So he is tearing up everything that has metal basically to level and start over. Umm, everything basically has metal in it and seeing somethings get picked up and others around the world doesn't make a lot of sense. People watching other metal objects rendered to pulp from other buildings/ships that have a lot of metal without even moving doesn't make any sense.Secondly: he is helped save the day and is now a hero. He pretty much killed millions of people with his actions. He waffles more than any super power I know. I'm good, i'm not good. I'm good, i'm not good. How many people get killed directly/indirectly because of him before he decides to do the right thing? Its absurd.Wolvering sequence could have been great, instead it was just OK. They show some blood and grit, but pull back on some to make it clunky versus a could scene. Get rid of that ridiculous headvice thing earlier too. It just looked stupid.The god guy: he could pretty much do anything he wanted and then he can't. Don't make him infallible to then make him weak enough to get beat up by the fast dude. He's fast, but he shouldn't be able to hurt the guy.Grey: WTF. Why is she waiting so long to do something. Dumb.Xavier: the whole in my mind house thing was cheesy.When s#$t was hitting the fan and the only thing they wanted to do was get their people back on the chopper. For what? If they don't stop this guy, the worlds over. Pick it up.Also, when it looked grim near the very end, Hank, Grey, and Nightcrawler are just watching. WTF, if he wins, the world is over. Get in the fight.The movie started out great and then went into the classic "we need as much mayhem as possible regardless if it makes sense or not". The whole nukes shooting off was pointless. Please understand that "less" can be "more". Tighten the script and use your talented actors. Rose Byrne (I lover her) was almost uncomfortable in her deliveries and she is usually great. No point to her character other than the emotional scene at the very end. Just adding characters to add characters. Angel/Storm... were not even needed. Should have given Psylocke more of a role. Could have built her characters. She's ticked and you don't even know why.</fullReview>

Oh wait, the mind has one emotion: rage. How cliché.

		<fullReview>First things first, movie is good, but there's a lot more that could've been better, like they can link the movie with X MEN Origins: Wolverine, as there is a sequence where it feels connected but not the way it should, the story, well every comic fan knows what and who apocalypse is, but his get-up and make-up was awful, and people who are not familiar with comics will definitely don't feel connected to the story.Psiloc has finally mad her debut in the series, and she is how she was in the comics (only thing that relieved in the movie to see her that way)but still her character and her powers needed explanation too, she's probably one of the influential mutant but they just avoided her may be due to the whip which makes her similar to Wonder-Woman.The movie has became more of a special effects treat rather than a complete package, although there are elements which you'd like too, this movie is made for Magneto, or naming it X MEN:Magneto will not be a bad idea, and yes, you must watch it if you are a fan of him... And here I'm talking about the good Magneto, not much here for fans of wolverine rather than just cameo...Verdict : Watch it only if you are fan of XMEN series, else there's not much for a average movie goer....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible villain and a likable hero, but at the same time many unsatisfying characters and an unsatisfying ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! X-men Apocalypse is the series' 3rd installment after it all started again with "X-men: First Class" and follows the events of "The Days of the Future Past". To remind you of where everything was left in the previous sequel, Magneto tried to kill the President near White House and this was broadcast in all TV channels. Unsurprisingly the world got to know mutants and this was especially an unpleasant surprise for people to meet a mutant like Magneto who is an all- powerful evil who can easily kill millions in a split-second.Magneto wanted to stop being Magneto and started a new life in Poland in this movie. He has a nice home with a garden full of animals, a loving wife and a sweet daughter. Then everything changes when he tries to save a colleague and his true identity gets revealed. For this reason his neighbors kidnap his daughter. Magneto remains calm and tries to retrieve his daughter from their hands giving himself up, however one excited fellow shoots his wife and daughter with a single arrow and then Magneto has nothing left to live for and directly becomes the evil he was before. The reason for the earthquake is another mutant, the first mutant, Apocalypse. The one that the Bible is referring to apparently. He lived 3600 B.C. in Egypt and he was frozen during a process which made sure that he would obtain a mutant's skill which is just like Wolverine's, meaning his scars would instantly get healed and he would be immortal. A cult praying to the skill transferring machine activates the machine again and Apocalypse wakes up from hibernation in 1980s just during cold war. After he is reborn he starts exploring around. He touches a TV's screen and obtains information about the world including a perfect English. I wish I had this skill, it would be invaluable. Apocalypse thinks that people are believing in their false Gods and these false Gods are not fit to run the world, meaning that this world, Apocalypse's world, is left to people who are incapable of running anything at all. Apocalypse has arisen again to stop this non-sense and give the world back to the people who deserve to live in it and he wants to unleash them from their chains. He has a point though especially firing all the nuclear weapons to space and criticizing people's addiction to materialism. To confess, Apocalypse is one hell of a villain and you cannot prevent yourself from liking this omnipotent mutant who has his pretty right motives and who has a point about him being perfect and some people being incapable of running things around.Apocalypse gathers an army of mutants just like the old times and the mutants he chooses become more powerful after he bestows his skill-augmenting skills upon them. Yes he has such a skill and yes it is damn cool. After Magneto's loss Magneto is prone to being the evil himself again and Apocalypse is really good at convincing. Magneto gets to demolish the remains of Auschwitz and after that joins Apocalypse. The other three co-villains are Storm, Angel and Psylocke. They are all more like X-men scum meaning teenagers having teen problems etc. I did not like them a tiny bit. Magneto is the only actually deserving villain in that crew and the rest would not be chosen by a bad-ass like Apocalypse. They are the exact people Apocalypse would hate and therefore this choice of mutants was poorly made. They were not powerful and not cool at all.On the other hand we get to meet the young Scott and Jean. They meet each other and like each other since both of them are regarded as creeps around Doctor X's school for talented children. This is also another thing we got used to in superhero movies. Two hated super heroes get to know each other starting to like one another etc. Sophie Turner is damn hot and this is her first big movie. I'm sure we will see her in many movies to come. It was a bit odd to see her together with Jennifer Lawrence. Sophie Turner will be the new Jennifer Lawrence and it was so obvious in this movie. Jean and Scott are not interesting characters, they are just so stereotypical wannabe characters, created to charm the teenagers of today. SO LAME! I literally hate these characters who the writers put in movies just so that they attract today's youth. I hate whiny characters. Whenever I think of Jean in the movie I imagine of Sophie Turner crying. God, please stop being such a whiny teenager. Nevertheless, her last move was pretty darn cool walking mid-air twisting with Apocalypse's mind unleashing her brilliant psychic skills. I personally liked that sequence although my friend told me that it was such a bad ending to such a great villain. However on the bright side we have Quicksilver, he was so cool in the previous title and he is so cool again. There is again a great scene with him in the lead. God, this character should have his own movie, it would be so much better than the X-Men movies. On the other hand we have got Professor Xavier again. God, I grew to hate this character so much. James McAvoy could not be more appalling. I hate his portrayal of Charles Xavier. Patrick Stewart is dearly missed. I don't even want to talk about James McAvoy's Xavier cause it's utterly boring. Another whiny and not charming character in this series. Overall, the movie has a perfect villain with many bad co-villains and teenage mutants(unfortunately not ninja turtles). The story has a nice body but overall it is not convincing in its turning points. Some great characters and a great villain do not make a fine movie because of the really shitty characters and an unconvincing story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biggest example of Hollywood multilation of classic Comic script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a comic book fanatic, I am always dismayed at how Hollywood and it's lack of diversity and majority Zionist viewpoint never fails to tilt reality to their myopic worldview, spoiling the narrative for the rest of the world. How does WW-II, Nazism and the Holocaust always seem to find their way into every Marvel movie being made, when none of the comics had much mention of the above? Also, for some reason Zionists have a compulsion to distort Ancient Egyptian history and managed to transform Apocalypse into an evil ancient Egyptian, which IMHO, not only weakens but cheapens the plot.Hollywood was just under criticism for their lack of diversity in all of their productions, and this movie is more of the same. A vehicle that is less than the 20 page comic it represents, all because it is filtered through the very narrow and biased lens of Zionist producers, script writers and cast selection incompetents. The movie will likely make a lot of money, but seems more like Nazi propaganda than art.</fullReview>

We all love X-Men. But what makes this movie different than say any other movie? What makes it original or unique aside from the story. Nothing. Is just same script with different actors and different sets.By now we can all guess what's about to happen. In 1920-1960 these ideas might have been fresh but now they are just repetitive.I'd give this 0 stars if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X6: Judgment Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Days of Future Past", the previous X-Men entry, had visions of a stark post- apocalyptic future ala Terminator, and now comes "Apocalypse", taking cues from eschatological lore with its titular megavillain threatening to destroy all to achieve his own vision of grandeur, forcing the X-Men to unite as one to stop this fallen god. It's pretty darn good.Do not be fooled by its comic-book brand; this is a biblical quasi-disaster film disguised as a superhero film, chock full of thrilling action and urgent, no- nonsense heroics, something that is sorely lacking in most superhero films today (I'm looking at you, BvS and Civil War). Both movies lack the human touch that Singer has given ever-so generously in his films, making the X-Men grounded and human while blossoming with their gifts. The stark difference between this film and Civil War/the DCU shows during one particularly harrowing scene involving Fassbender's Magneto in a Polish forest, which elevates this into a real film with real characters. The humor seems natural, too, save for another scene of fine trolling involving audience favorite Quicksilver that is all too similar to his scene in the previous film.Still, despite a script that offers nothing new to the table, hats off to director Bryan Singer, proving himself yet again as the golden goose of the franchise, for delivering the superhero goods with balanced, kinda old-fashioned storytelling and a plethora of fine performances from all cast members, especially Oscar Isaac as its titular villainous anti-Messiah. It's very operatic, overtly theatrical without being hammy, and it contrasts nicely with the rest of the grounded characters, truly fitting for a villain named "Apocalypse."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The special effects are fast, frequent, and generally overwhelming.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), the world's oldest and most powerful mutant, awakens after centuries of forced slumber, he determines to reclaim his former throne as ruler of all mankind. And his first goal is to seek out other highly-skilled mutants to assist him. Recruiting the ambitious Psylocke (Olivia Munn), the dejected Angel (Ben Hardy), the disillusioned Storm (Alexandra Shipp), and the vengeful Magneto (Michael Fassbender), Apocalypse concocts an annihilative plan to reshape humanity to his liking. But Professor X (James McAvoy), his colleague Beast (Nicholas Hoult), and pupil Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters soon discover this new threat, and with the aid of former student Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and newcomers Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), confront Apocalypse and his followers in a cataclysmic battle for the very fate of Earth.The special effects are fast, frequent, and generally overwhelming; they look stunning, for the most part, but their sheen wears off when 99% of the imagery is computer generated. It's difficult to be impressed by any one element when so much of the production utilizes a sustained visual onslaught of laser bolts and electrical sparks and the slow-motion vaporization of structures. And with the whopping running time, it quickly becomes apparent that most of these eye-catching, fancy flourishes do little more than distract from the fact that the story is unnecessarily complex, riddled with loopholes, just plain repetitive, or, at its worst, unusually silly.Although the world is about the same regardless of the various time lines or time periods (director Bryan Singer is doing his own superhero time travel work by coming back to the franchise to save what he clearly feels was nearly destroyed by Brett Ratner's takeover for "X-Men: The Last Stand"), mutants still roam the earth in abundance and out in the open, and still regard their superpowers as curses. That is, except for the evil ones, who embrace their ability to break the law and get away with it, which would, realistically, be far more than the odd rebellious abuser. Of course, with the younger cast, some of the teen angst finds its way into the fray, but typically only as comic relief. Most of the plot actually strays away from the previous films' interests in embracing one's differences, fear of the unknown or xenophobia, and political or authoritarian interferences, aiming instead for epic showdowns and catastrophic skirmishes, where super powers can be constantly pitted against one another in a perpetual one-upping. Fortunately, just when it seems likely that the primary antagonist has the greatest mutation, someone else randomly demonstrates a knack for quashing chaos.This new storyline is essentially unguessable (and, perhaps, unmanageable), since the effects of "X-Men: Days of Future Past" included time travel and setting back the clock to an era before all the previous happenings. Although it creates a grand opportunity for the reinvention of characters and ideas, it comes dangerously close to simply repeating everything that came before it, just with younger actors and actresses and a few twists on mutant capabilities. The villain might be new - but not fresh, since he's curiously designed to look almost exactly like the Djinn from "Wishmaster," of which there were four features up through 2002 - yet the predicaments are disappointingly familiar. Some of the fight sequences are fun (though many border on what probably should have been R-rated material), but when the players and the outcomes are the same, the entertainment value is fleeting at best. Plus, when the greatest scene in the movie is the Quicksilver save, wherein he humorously moves about repositioning and rescuing people as time stands still - and it's practically identical to the sequence from the prior picture - it's evident that this newest X-Men adventure lacks the zest needed to justify its own existence.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse... Well the early scenes were promising, but the film got very dry very quickly. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate this movie, I just didn't enjoy it half as much as I had hoped. The plot of the movie is too weak for starters "an ancient mutant (who sounds like a robot and looks worse than Thanos) is awakened, he decides to bring down the world with his four horsemen. Alexandra Shipp's Strom who gets far too little to do given how well she does it. Ben Hardy's Angel who looks cool but makes no impact. Olivia Munn's Pslocke who's only cast for her boob shot, shown in the trailer. Finally Nicholas Hoult's Magneto which by now has been the villain far too often...I mean how many times can Professor X remind us that there is still good in him? He's murdered hundreds of people. It also takes the whole of the first hour to introduce and assemble all the new and existing characters passing from one to another at a zappy pace. My nightmares came true when Jennifer Lawrence re- appeared as Katniss Everdeen with super powers rather than Mystique. Which is a shame because this movie could have used less inspirational speech making and more of the kinkiness Rebecca Romijn's Mystique had. In short this film leaves questions like; What was Apocalypse's ultimate goal? Did they need to replay entire scenes we've seen multiple times before? How many times will Professor X introduce a student to Cerebro? Why is it when entire populations are vaporised our heroes don't appear to warrant even a momentary look of horror? And how many movies will they make? All together Apocalypse was a messier and heavier than the previous Days of Future Past. I did like the Quick Silver scene though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step down from its predecessors but still, "X-Men: Apocalypse" never ends the fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Singer continues the "X-Men" cinematic lore with a continuation to the "First Class" storyline. We see the team formed then divided in the 60s, clashed in the 70s and regrouped in the 80s. This time, a powerful, ancient mutant named En Sabah Nur or Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) resurfaces and aims to reform a new world but destroying our own. So, it is up to Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and his band of mutants to stop Apocalypse and his Four Horsemen from (what else?) taking over the world.Now, I am an avid follower of the "X-Men" lore. Although I have not read the comics, I follow some story lines that shape up the universe. And I praise Bryan Singer for his efforts ever since the first "X-Men" movie until his return from departure for being involved in "X-Men: First Class" to bring the complex superhero team to silver screen form. I tell this as a strong compliment, for Singer made a bold risk with "X-Men: Apocalypse", whether the repercussions are good or bad.To give its credit, Singer, along with collaborator Simon Kinberg, knows the "X-Men" story lines all too well. But fanfare does not weigh as much as narrative. (Still, for comic book fans, watch out for Easter eggs.) Being too familiar of the storyline makes this the most derivative part of the franchise. And it all feels predictably formulaic: mutants are outcasts but they are given a chance when a baddie emerges, and all is well. Despite the amount of great moments, the narrative lacks the heftiness of its predecessors. And it does not help that the jarring editing jumps like a jumping bean, shifting from one lighter tone to a heavier one. When the story fell flat, the same goes for the cast.To be fair, this is an undeniable cast ensemble, mixing the originals, from McAvoy, Lawrence, Fassbender, Nicholas Hoult as Beast and Rose Byrne in a returning role, with the new generation, from Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt/Nightcrawler, Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/Storm and Olivia Munn as Psylocke. Seeing every mutant interact feels like watching the 90s animated series. But even with that, majority of the characters have no arc. The one that has a recognizable one is Erik Lensherr, who goes through the same plot beats but with winning effect. Michael Fassbender really made a compelling performance as a mutant desiring to live normally, only to be brought down by his unwanted powers. The rest are there to drive the plot, sadly. Then we go to the main villain. As Apocalypse, Oscar Isaac makes up the character for its intimidating presence but gives too little of a payoff, making him generic and kind of disappointing.However there are indeed moments, like Evan Peters topping with another Quicksilver's slow-motion scene, Smit-McPhee's Nightcrawler being an effective comic relief and the final battle in Egypt. But it cannot help rescue "X-Men: Apocalypse" from a derivative plot, a clichéd villain, haphazard editing, a confused tone, a mix of professional and amateur special effects, the absence of deeper themes and missed opportunities with the cast. Still, "X-Men: Apocalypse" is a fun ride, thanks to its enthusiastic and well-committed cast, thrilling action scenes and wonderful moments. It may be a fallout from "X-Men: Days of Future Past", but this Bryan Singer's boldest move for the franchise, better or worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For context, First Class and Days Of Future Past were both 9s or 10s. So, I give this one star with a very heavy heart.I'm not even sure where to begin, but the biggest flaw by far was the writing. What kills me is these were the same writers that did so well in the previous 2 movies. So many things so far out of character, even given the context the characters were introduced in, then trying to mesh the whole thing together with the most overused Hollywood trope of all time: the emotional appeal.A movie done right should never make you think "it's just a movie" while you're watching it. That should be an afterthought if they did their job correctly. However, the frivolous manner in which they deal with brutal executions is just jarring. If a character is going to be this brutal, no jokes can be made by such character, nor can any witness act with levity. We see this from Storm when she meets Apocalypse, yet somehow she's magically an X-Men at the end with no reason for her 180. We see even worse from Magneto when he justifiably avenges his daughter (and somehow wife?) but then marches with premeditation to commit an atrocity at the steel plant. Then somehow he 180s because Xavier makes an emotional appeal. All is hunky dory at the end.To be fair, there were things done right: costumes, music, CGI, and even the actors' performances were solid implementations of horrible writing.Bottom line, if you're reading a review with spoilers, wait for it to come out on Netflix. Don't waste any dollars in any direct fashion on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not terrible but also not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar to "Batman v Superman" opinions divide greatly on "X-Men: Apocalypse". While Rotten Tomatoes is not fond of the movie, audiences and a great many people love it. In the end all this does not matter since everybody has to decide on their own whether they like a movie or not. And after all it is good that each person has a different opinion on a piece of art because it is fun to discuss and learn other people's views. "X-Men: Apocalypse" is set in the 80ies and adds a lot of new character portrayals to the franchise. The movie starts out with the awakening of Apocalypse, him learning about the present world and recruiting his four horsemen. A young Scott Summers discovers his powers and arrives at Charles Xavier's school for gifted youngsters, where he meets Jean Grey. Meanwhile Mystique grew to be a role model for many mutants since the events in the 70ies while Eric lives secluded with his family in Poland.First of all, there are many aspects I loved and enjoyed about this movie. The performances in this movie where overall good. Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender prove again they are fantastic in their roles and we witness some good character developments. Especially Magneto has some emotional moments. Evan Peters stays the greatest Quicksilver ever put to screen, this time receiving more screen time and another outstanding scene even better than the one from "Days of Future Past". Olivia Munn is great as Psylocke and it would be cool if we get to see more of her character in the future. Nightcrawler was awesome as well! Unfortunately there were some performances that were not as great. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was not my favorite part of the movie. I respect her as an actress but there were some moments in the movies when I could not help but see Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones on screen. Also Apocalypse left me disappointed. Oscar Isaacs is a great actor and one can tell he did his best but to me En Sabah Nur is another generic villain. He had some cool powers but I was not fond of his design and most of the time he was more annoying than threatening. In general the look and design of some characters bothered me (looking at you Angel and Storm).Additionally there is a section in the middle of the movie that felt forced to me, even though it is understandable why they had to put it into the movie but still this could have been handled better or left out and it would not have changed a lot about the plot. In general the plot is the main problem of the movie, since some parts felt unnecessary and forced and sometimes the movie is slow, though I would not describe it as boring. Furthermore some scenes were way over the top! Especially the end battle with a great amount of it involving Jean Grey. It felt stupid.As much as I hate to say this, but "X-Men Apocalypse" is my least favorite superhero movie this year and ranks rather low on my list compared to the other installments of the franchise. It had great moments and was enjoyable but it still had too many things bothering me about it. Stay in your seats for the post-credit scene though!</fullReview>

This scene actually had me in tears, from laughing so much at the absurdity of it all.Without giving too much away; the 'bad guy' is holding a very basic wooden bow and arrow and he is BARELY pulling back the bow when he is momentarily distracted, so he accidentally lets go of the bow causing the arrow to shoot straight through the bodies of TWO people. Now I'm no doctor but I'm pretty certain that the human body contains muscles, bones, cartilage and all sorts of bits and pieces that would make it very difficult for a rudimentary wooden arrow to shoot through. Not only did this arrow by somehow make it through one body, by some miracle it went through a second as well! If this arrow was shot by Green Arrow, Hawkeye, Legolas or even Princess Merida from the movie Brave then perhaps I could have believed something like this could have happened... but instead it was achieved by a minor character with no known special abilities or skills without even pulling the bow back or actually aiming.It's officially the stupidest death sequence I have ever seen.The rest of the movie is okay, but it's not life changing. Whilst it's stupid at times, it's still watchable and hey maybe you'll like it?</fullReview>

No explanation of her powers . . . yep that's how she rolls. 6. Mystique 1st thing to do is to turn back into Jennifer Lawrence. Like really? She gave a real "Katniss Everdeen" performance.This movie basically said that Days of Future Past was irrelevant because only Jack Hughman was in it. The old characters never made an appearance!!?? What's the point of having Days of Future Past to bring back the character back to life when you're not going to use them in the final trilogy?? Singer also messes up with the timeline too.It's sad that a movie with such promise can have an outcome like this :( just like Dawn of Justice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had high hopes for Apocalypse and it was a huge let down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-SPOILERS-I want to start by saying what is good about the film before explaining why I gave it a 6/10. First off, being able to see Wolverine in a short scene made the movie much more interesting. Some of the CGI and effects are good and very enjoyable. The acting was good but some of the dialogue was weird and unnatural. The main issue with the movie is Apocalypse himself. He's supposedly very strong and powerful but the movie fails to convince me as such. We all know Apocalypse is strong and what he is capable of, but the movie does a poor job at translating that into picture time. He spends most of the movie talking or walking around, getting all of his 'followers' to do most of the work. We do not see what he is truly capable of and the way he was defeated was rather pathetic.Apocalypse's power is that he is able to amass other mutant's powers and combine it with his own, growing more powerful as time goes on. The problem: he is already powerful enough to destroy the whole world when you first see him. Yet, he wastes time trying to gather minions for no reason (actually, so they eventually turn against him and help defeat him). He tried to steal Xavier's powers in the middle of a fight when he knows there are tons of people right outside his door trying to murder him. During this time he is vulnerable and separated from his minions. While fighting with the X-Men they were eventually defeated and some of them even switched to the good side. Then Apocalypse shows up after his minions are wiped out to fight at a disadvantage is ends up losing. He could have easily wiped out everyone before he tried to take Xavier's powers and no one would be able to stop them. That would be more believable and realistic. It's so disappointing to see an enemy with so much potential fall flat on his face because he cannot use 10% of his brain. I left the moving thinking Apocalypse deserved so much more than what they gave him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Either like it or Dislike it But enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like B v S this year, X-MEN: Apocalypse is super-ambitious but just doesn't know how put all its ideas together in a very interesting way. But unlike BvS X-men partially succeeded in actually making you feel that there are some missing story lines or backstories that could help make this into a really good film.Don't get wrong I enjoy this movie for about 2/3 of it, but mainly because I lowered my expectations--to the point where I checked my brain out of the door, but it is a pretty straight forward story which lacks any form of complexity--which only engrosses you here and there, and for the rest of its running-time makes you wonder, "uumm, I think Fox is tired of the X-men franchise."The Direction is pretty tired at this point when it comes to Singer's Vision of the X-men. I don't know if I can see him direct another X-men movie, but interestingly enough Apocalypse left me wanting more.A great Cast, lead by Michael Fassbender as Magneto, who for the most part has a pretty interesting story, but just like the movie itself it collapsed under the fact "we need a big CGI-heavy battle at the end of this, which feels "small" in comparison to Captain America: Civil War's either fight scenes, but they tried. Then you have Oscar Isaac who is heavily underutilized as the main villain Apocalypse. His story has a strong beginning, rather interesting and just plummeted into disaster by the end. And I asked myself, would it have been better if Apocalypse was completely Motion Capture (like they did with Thanos in the Avengers movie) and make him looked more like the Comic Book and Animated TV series version. Just saying, it wouldn't take anything away from the movie. Throughout the movie I asked myself, what is Apocalypse big vision or motivation? Is he supposed to be a threat to the world or the X-men? For a man with all that power at his disposal why does he need the "Four Horsemen" to conquer the world? And even when he has the Four Horsemen under his control He doesn't do much but reaping the Earth/Nations Apart; monumental landmarks among other things. But not once, I was at the edge of my seat. No Threats or Danger. Nothing at all to make you invest in it emotionally, or cerebral enough like its processors. The Visual Effects are great, but so repetitive and common place that they don't "WOW" you, but the simple moving and establishing shots made up for that. And for the STORY/SCREENPLAY, it is the complete letdown. It Could've been way better than what was presented considering the Apocalypse story-line is one of the most herald X-men comics.With that been said, I enjoyed Apocalypse for what it is. I think Superhero Movie fatigue is setting in even for the filmmakers. So, am I looking forward to another X-men film? You bet I am. But, in 10 years or so, that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Apocalypse...it is just a Movie Matinée in its core-a Transformers movie per say-but with common sense. NOTE: I don't know if Apocalypse worth its $234 million price tag. They could have made a better movie with half of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good &amp; OK &amp; Not a cinema movie but watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Would have to say that, this may not be one of the best marvel X-MEN movies of the new generation but its a good and watchable movie, but having said that this comic needs a new director as for me this was just not as good as X-MEN First Class And X-MEN Days Of Future Past but as the same time much better than watching Batman V. Superman. The action scenes in the movie were the only good thing about the movie really, it was boring, only in the middle of the film it started to pick up. The only three acts who have been making these new films watchable have always been, Michael Fassbender who acts as Magneto, James McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier and Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique. Like most of the X-Men fans who have been talking bad about this movie because Oscar Isaac is just a small actor who acts as Apocalypse was just not the right guy for the film. I Mean Bryan Singer did a good job with X-MEN days of future past and X-MEN 1 but i think he needs to step away and let something new take over. i really wanted Matthew Vaughn who directed X-MEN first class which for me stands out as my favourite X-MEN movie. Then again, I at the same time, did not feel like this movie was rubbish or decent, it was just a good movie which fox has not missed up. Fox have only missed up X-MEN 2 AND 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay addition to the Xmen Franchise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched Days of Future Past, which I thought was by far the best X-men film i'd seen, I had high hopes for Apocalypse, regardless of reviews which didn't seem too promising.I have to disagree with some of the reviews here about this film - it wasn't particularly good. It just slots in with your run of the mill superhero film and won't be remembered when the sequel is released.Positives:Some of the action scenes are excellent. CGI seems to have improved again in recent films and Apocalypse is no exception.I think the casting of Sophie Turner and Alex Shipp is a great move. Being a GOT watcher, I liked her introduction into this franchise. I'd never seen Alex before but that girl can do something different with Storm and move away from the Halle Berry rendition. Not so Positives:It's getting difficult to do something really different with these kind of films; there wasn't any shock (for someone that hasn't read the comics). Having seen Civil War recently, this story really lacked that unique edge, whereas it's competition had me from the beginning to the end. Apocalypse as a villain bored me. I won't lie. He could have been so much more exciting! Instead it was just another bad guy wanting to start the world over again. It'll be interesting to see what happens next with the X-men Franchise. With the end teaser, hopefully it will be something new to keep up with the other Marvel projects that are leading the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting the worst after reading all of the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the best superhero film, nor is it the best Xmen film, but it's solid. Positives: More Quicksilver (not enough though) has a glorious scene that is better than his first Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler are great Oscar Isaac as apocalypse is solid Well written motives for every characters actions (unlike BvS) Negatives: More Quicksilver (we want MORE!) or this Quicksilver in the MCU Mystique is terrible - so boring, so useless, offers nothing but talk Magneto flips sides every film, it's played out and predictable. Prof X looked weaker than ever That cameo was poor (also why show it in the trailer) The film felt rushed - Apocalypse assembles his four horsemen almost immediately, basically whichever mutant he sets his eyes on first gets the nod. This could/should have been set up over a couple of movies like Thanos in the MCU. In the end he just looked weak, despite great acting from Oscar Isaac. Good film, go see it but don't expect Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, Dark Knight Trilogy or Civil War standards?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing given the 7.4 rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prequel to the other X-men movies which introduces a supper mutant who is dressed like a wrestler from wrestle-maniac. The computer generated battles aren't bad but they are interrupted by long periods of dialogue among the x-men doubting themselves and their role in the world and developing each ones history and hate motivations in a way that seemed to drag for an inordinately long time. The movie made an attempt include philosophically inspired declarations on humanity and its plight but they were few and though inspiring, did not carry the theme of the movie. It is not the worst movie I have seen but I would place it equal with the X-Men: Days of Future Past only because the computer generated battles were slightly better and the story wasn't so hard to follow but the characters were a little weaker. I missed the original actors for several of the X-Men/Women and it appeared the movie was trying to appeal to the high school audience, given most of the X-Men's ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a big fan of X-Men, I don't want to see another X-Men movie after this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love the X-Men franchise, for me it the best superheroes franchise out there. I love them since I first watched the Animated series in the 90s. With that being said, this is one of the worst X- men movie to date, worst than the Last Stand, better than both Wolverine movies. I used to trust Bryan Singer wholeheartedly, he did produce 3 best X-Men movies after all but this one is a flop. It make me wonder maybe Singer has run out of idea, maybe he should pass on the torch to another director. Michael Fassbender was great, his performance along with the ever charming James Mcavoy was the highlight of the movie. The visual effects was good, Quicksilver and Wolverine action scenes were highly enjoyable.Apocalypse has so many potentials, so much powers but just fall flat to me. He destroyed some buildings and that it. The ancient "god" being defeated by a teenager Jean Grey and she hasn't even let out the Dark Phoenix yet! Why was his name Apocalypse again?I love the 4 horsemen idea but they only focused on Magneto, the other 3 were underdeveloped just like many other new X-men characters. I thoroughly enjoyed Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) was okay at best.Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss was just ridiculous! But this is because of the script, the writers wanted her to take the center roll, made Raven become a strong female lead but it was too out of character in my opinion. Sophie Turner as Jean Grey was a bad, bad decision! Jean Grey has such a big roll in the movies to come why didn't they hire someone who can act? The only reason she got this roll is because of Game of Thrones fanbase and sure enough she bring Sansa Stark into this movie.Turner lack of acting talent plus her trying to be American accent were just terrible. I don't want to see her in the future movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't trust the critics !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third comic book movie of the year so far, this film is not as bad as the critics make out it to be. X-men: Apocalypse is a film which I enjoyed because the narrative is interesting and the characters are very intriguing. The standard characters which we have come to know such as Charles, Raven and Magneto are well portrayed by the respective actors. The new cast of characters that we have come to know are mostly done well but there is some bland acting in few spots. Bryan Singer's directing is solid, and he knows how to get the best performances out of his actors. The action set pieces are solid and these scenes are well made and are excellent because they look and feel brutal. This is a well shot film and the cinematography is outstanding and this is because of the camera (Epic Red Dragon). The narrative in the film is interesting because the studio have managed to adapt the Apocalypse story to the silver screen. I think that they have done a good job and don't think that the filmmakers could have done any better. However like every other movie this has some negative aspects to this movie. The first thing is that some of the CGI needed extra time in post production because some of it looks fake and you can clearly see that it is CGI. The second part is that there is little substance to the back story of the villain because the back story is not quite explained and therefore his actions are not fully explained. The third and final negative is a small point which I feel annoys me, and this is the Metallica soundtrack used. The director decided to use the song I am evil, but considering that the movie is based around the four horsemen i think that the Metallica song The Four Horsemen would have been a better choice because it would have been appropriate and people who are not Metallica fans wouldn't have noticed, as well the soundtrack The Four Horsemen is on the same album which came out in 1983 which is the year this film is set. Overall this movie is a good time and a recommended watch, and ignore the critics because they have too high expectations because of Days of Future Past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The X Men Rises From Superhero Mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had the pleasure to watch several superhero films despite not having read a single comic published and while i admit to enjoying a few i never understood the popularity of the genre. These movies while at times fun never seem to carry much depth even compared to blockbusters such as star wars, jaws and dark knight.I thought the previous x men films were mediocre and forgettable with days of future past being the strongest entry into the franchise.I had only low expectations going in to this after having to sit through the awfulness of batman v superman and the mediocrities such as civil war and dead-pool, hoping to find the gem in this average genre.Needles to say i thought x-men: Apocalypse was the best x men movie produced as well as the one of the better superhero films of the last century.This movie showed me a glimpse of that gem i was searching for in this genre and have somehow restored faith in the comic book movies or at least for the next x-men installment.The first half of this movie is just brilliant and probably demonstrates the best of the superhero films.Most of it is done visually without relying on dialogue(which is great considering the fact that the screenplay is the weakest part of every superhero films). The opening sequence was fantastic as it laid a foundation of the story without giving any expositions like civil war did.There is a quiet feeling in the first half giving calmness and needed emotion in the movie and moments such as magneto's daughter's death, quicksilver's dash in flames as well as the bursting of rockets works perfectly giving the film an aura of calmness and energy as well as tension.Now this film is far from perfect as shown in the second half where the brilliance of the first half falls, becoming more Hollywood with the cliché redemption, weak villains and end of the world fights excess of CGI.Despite these problems the final fight is enjoyable due to the craziness of the situation and in my opinion the battle was much more memorable that the airport fight in civil war due to the primal existence of stakes and emotion in the fight between the characters.Also on a positive note the film is never once dull.The cinematography is great when comparing to other superhero films and the music was exceptional and really helped to bring this movie alive and grant.The performances were fine, though nothing really stood out.James Mcavoy and Michael Fassbender steal the show with their respectful performances with the supporting roles doing just an okay job.Even Jennifer Lawrence is tolerable with her character.There is a wolverine cameo late in the film which was effective in establishing the character and even managed to provide a screen presence of a larger degree than both superman and captain America did in their respectful movies in the year's superhero installments.So overall x men: Apocalypse stands out as the superhero film of the year 2016.It somehow manages to find a balance between the dark and gritty nature of batman v superman without becoming somber or dull as well as the lighter tone of civil war and dead-pool without becoming jokey and thereby losing the tension.It's not a great film but a highly enjoyable and memorable blockbuster as well as one of the best superhero films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another Jennifer Lawrence vehicle marginally saved by Wolverine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge success of Days of futures past . Both critically and financially it seemed obvious that the return of Bryan Singer to the X men universe was the tonic the franchise needed. Don't get me wrong First Class was a good movie but it just felt as though Singer clicks with these mutated characters and his return to the helm was great news for X Men fans. However this latest installment proves that the director is only human and this one can be marked down as a mistake. Even a joke in the movie by Jean Grey referring that the third movie is always the worst makes you feel that they knew they were flogging a dead horse with this one. Just as The Last stand was a let down so is this. The problem with Apocalypse is that there's no real depth to the threat. The villain may have been laying dormant for thousands of years but we as a audience haven't been given sufficient time to learn and fear about how evil and destructive he can be. The film rattles on too quickly bouncing from one character to another neglecting that the titular villain needs time to grow and captivate the audience. He's a comic book villain too comic book like for the big screen. If that makes any sense. He just doesn't install that fear in you. Remember when we saw Darth Vader for the first time. Every 8 year old worldwide filled their pants with fear. Apocalypse looks more like a Smurf with issues than a all conquering evil mutant god. Sure we see him and his four horsemen destroy whole cities but without seeing one casualty or even a drop of blood. Even the new characters are under used. It's as if there's too much to get done in the movies run time to devote any real time to character development. Nothing in the movie makes you grip your seat in peril or even care. Not until fan favourite Wolverine makes an appearance. This I believe being the most accurate portrayal of the character put on screen yet. Here we do see blood as the clawed mutant goes berserk killing everyone in his path. This causing a real big reason to get excited about the forth coming R rated Wolverine movie. Hugh Jackman has always been superb as the character but as somehow been held back by the studio from unleashing Logan's real temper so as not to give the film a more adult rating. This latest installment feels more like a vehicle for Jennifer Lawrence's career than a deep full fleshed out X Men movie. She doesn't have the Slinky sexy like killer attributes Rebecca Romijn's version of the character possessed in the earlier movies or even her own as her first two appearances as Mystique. This time she's playing the girl from Hunger games but occasionally painted blue. Michael Fassbender does what he can. A particular seen with wife and child had me gripped. James McAvoy as Xavier is as annoying as ever and bares no resemblance to Patrick Stewart's turn as the character. The one you have to really feel for here is Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse. A great actor given a paper thin villain to play. Not the worst Superhero movie ever made but on a par with Batman Vs Superman so nothing to write home about either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaker than the previous two, but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men Apocalypse may feel like a step down from the good Days of Future Past and the great First Class, but it's tough to hold that against considering just how good those were.Fassbender's Magneto continues to be the best thing about these movies, along with his relationship with Charles Xavier. The rest of the cast is good, and Isaac does a good job of making Apocalypse seem threatening in spite of the character design. Quicksilver steals the show (again) and a certain scene will be sure to satisfy the comic readers, although it's a shame Fox didn't keep it under wraps.The climactic battle is less Roland Emmerich-ish than the trailers suggest (thank God) and the action overall is top notch.However, three of the four horsemen are criminally under developed, and their motivations for joining Apocalypse are never explained. Possibly worse than that is the fact that Apocalypse never explains why he needs them. Moira is in this movie for no reason (although her presence does lead to some hilarious moments with Charles) and could have been cut out completely.Overall this probably won't please anyone who didn't like the previous installments, but is a far cry from the likes of The Last Stand and Origins Wolverine. It joins the first X-Men and the 2013 Wolverine in the pretty good-but-not-great category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of "seen done better before" and "who would wanna watch this"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ancient Apocalypse returns and wants to destroy the world. For companions, he recruits those of the emo teens who don't already go to the School for the Gifted and provide annoying angsty melodrama. Bryan Singer recreates some of his most beloved moments from the series with less effort, and sticks in bits he was previously forced to cut. Like X3 and First Class(which happened 20 years ago. Ignore that no one looks to have aged by anywhere near that much), the main threat and the team are two separate plot lines fighting for attention. Then they smash together at the end.Some claim this has a lot of action. Not at all. There's almost none, outside of the climax, which isn't that impressive, or memorable, in spite of what the director has done in the past. Civil War does, you could watch that again. But there we do have Roland Emmerich style destruction, which this is oddly callous towards. We're going backwards. Young versions of characters, most of which were already wasted. At least give us new ones. Or do them well. Comic relief is hit and miss.There is a ton of death, with blood and brutal gore on corpses, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone needing reminding just how wildly the quality of this film franchise fluctuates. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Gets Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The joke in the movie about part threes being the worst of their series might be talking about the original X-Men trilogy (and a jab against Director Singer not at the helm of The Last Stand) but it certainly applies here, as well.X-Men: Apocalypse, hopefully the conclusion of the X-Babies set, was okay to begin with. Just the run of the mill X-Men movie and was followed by more the same: younger cast recruiting and developing other mutant powers. And then the second half kicked in and it did get better.Still the movie "reboot" series seems to have run its course. I think I, like the movie watching public (SEE: Box Office receipts,) have had its fill of the "newbies" learning to work together, fight, learn to work together again and repeat. Time for yet another reboot, hopefully including a merger with Disney and the Avengers. Now who wouldn't wanna see that?Oh, and this movie? Well, like Blade: Trinity, they pull out the big gun from thousands of years ago in the form of Apocalypse who just wants to wipe the slate clean. Will the troubled X-Men work together to defeat him?The movie has so many problems in the first half, but makes up for it so much in the second half that the movie's actually recommended. Still think they should end it here. We're just backpedaling over and over repetitive ground. ***Final thoughts: Not really spoiler since the trailer gave it away, but Wolverine's appearance was actually one of the best scenes of the movie and makes way for a fantastic R-Rated Wolverine movie. Funny, he had no lines, was in the movie for probably a 50th of the running time and yet, got me psyched for the next Wolverine Rated-R film. Snikt!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cursed For Being a Prequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's what I think in a nutshell: eh. blah. sigh. It's alright. I think this for three reasons split below:The Characters: The new characters introduced were: Psylocke (Olivia Munn), Angel (Ben Hardy), Storm (Alexandra Shipp) NightCrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). That's a ton of new characters, but not really when you consider all but one were in the original trilogy. So really it's just seeing younger versions of old characters. I would have to say that if I had to pick one of them to be the best?AKA, left the best impression?it would have to be McPhee's NightCrawler, with Turner's Jean coming in second. I remember reading comments prior to seeing this film that said Munn had turned down the female lead in Deadpool because she didn't want to be a damsel, and she was excited about this film because she got to be kick-ass. Perhaps the kick-ass is in the deleted scenes? I think Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is more kick-ass, and she doesn't have any powers! To be frank, they took an extremely strong actress and gave her a strong mutant, but made her a mundane character. Turner's Jean Grey was good, but since I was never the biggest Jean Grey fan there wasn't much there for me. Sorry, but how Jean Grey ends makes me really hate her, and this film has a lot of references to The Phoenix, so I kept cringing and the voices in my head kept shouting "YOU'RE DOOMED!" So that pretty much ruined any chance of me getting real excited for this new Jean Grey. I also have to just say that Moira's (Rose Byrne) return is kind of pointless to me. I thought she was a useless character whose sole purpose was to bridge the gap between Apocalypse's return and the X-Men finding out about it. Otherwise she flies the ship. Oh, and of course, I can't forget that Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is back?again?as usual. I know, you can all hate me, but I just feel like he doesn't have to be in every single freaking X- Men film. The Villain I get that a person with powers who has a god complex is not an original villain. That being said, I still expected so much more. The first third of the film is slow as Apocalypse is going around collecting his followers. However, I feel like aside from Magneto, he just picks the first three mutants he finds. When he's actually supposed to pick the four most powerful mutants. Yes, Storm is powerful, but not in this film. In this film Apocalypse has two petulant teenagers, a man struggling with his past and present, and a woman whose sole purpose is to be another female character. On the plus side he does help Magneto see the extent of his powers?finding the metal in the Earth so that he could actually level cities?is pretty cool. Aside from that all he seems to do is change people's appearance. He's a stylist. Psylocke wears this coat with a ponytail, after Apocalypse she's wearing a swimsuit with her hair flowing behind her. Apocalypse turns Storm's hair white and Angel gets a haircut (and Apocalypse is apparently responsible for the Professor's baldness), so really Apocalypse is just a glorified barber. Everyone keeps saying how this guy is the most powerful mutant ever, but all I see him do is create portals and amplify other's powers, ?so I think they didn't do him justice. I know, I sound mean, but when we've had so many villains, and when this film takes one of the most cliché villains?though it's cliché simply because it's a classic?I am going to be more critical of it. I think Apocalypse's most significant scene is actually his foreshadowing of Jean Grey's Phoenix. I cannot go into more details without spoilers of the film, but let's just say that it is blatantly obvious in the final showdown for anyone who saw X-Men: Last Stand. I mean it's like a freaking neon Las Vegas sign.The Curse of the Prequel I saw this film with my mother, who forgot that technically this film and the two before it are really just prequels to the original trilogy. Therefore, most of the references to the original trilogy that take over about 1/3 of the film are overwhelming. The original trilogy is great, the prequel/first film is great, and the second and third in the prequel series start to fade. Sound familiar? I think this is better known as the Star Wars Curse. The film is burdened with wrapping up the prequel characters' stories, while introducing the characters that we all knew from the first trilogy. However, because this is X-Men and there are too many characters, it does not do a good job of either. Mystique is too minor a character for how major she was in the first two, and then there's Magneto and the Professor who are really just there to be the two pillars of the X-Men universe. The film's focal points are the teenage mutants who are the main characters in the original trilogy. Though this film's teenage hero prequel is not as disastrous as the Fantastic Four version, it's still just OK. I was also reading on IMDb.com that part of the goal is to possibly create another X-Men film using the "X-Men team" that is created at the end of this film. We're given the teenage X-Men: Cyclops, NightCrawler, Jean, and Storm. And as we can remember, Storm, Cyclops, and Jean are the X-Men in the first film from the late 90s. If that movie gets made I'm likely going to see it, but I am not sure if I'm looking forward to another set of X-Men films that are still technically a prequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seems to be the year of superheroes vs superheroes with DC and Marvel releasing their tentpoles, Batman v Superman and Civil War, and now Fox has released one for the X-Men with the lackluster X- Men: Apocalypse. In Apocalypse, the world's first and most powerful mutant, aptly named Apocalypse, has woken up from a slumber after thousands of years to find that society is not revering him as a god as they used to. Apocalypse throws a tantrum and assembles a team of four mutants to destroy modern civilization and create a new world order. As the fate of the world hangs in the balance, Mystique and Professor X assemble a new team of young mutants to save mankind. It seemed like having God and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse be the villains would make the movie at least somewhat interesting, but, really they don't do anything for a majority of the 144 minute running time. For most of Apocalypse's story, he's just assembling his team while the Horsemen he's already recruited just sit around while he convinces another mutant to join the group. That's not only an issue with the Horsemen, unfortunately. Almost all of the other mutants, Mystique, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, etc, wait around until something bad happens. There's a ton of interesting characters in this film that aren't given anything interesting to do. Almost all of the mutants spend the entire movie feeling sorry for themselves, and there's really no good action until the very end. Even the final fight scene gets underwhelming at certain points. At times, I felt like I was watching a bad Roland Emmerich disaster flick. One positive is that Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, giving a great personality to the character. He was the one thing I wholeheartedly enjoyed about the movie. X-Men: Apocalypse has a couple moments of visual flair, some decent action and clear ambition, but its muddled plot and bland characterizations make it a disappointing misstep.</fullReview>

The story takes place sometimes in the past,I think...You never really get a clear indication as of when it takes place.But I think it suppose to be in the 60-70s The end climax is nothing but a dull thud,that you yawn away. The only good thing about the movie was Jennifer lawrence look super hot in it. And that they have gone back to the original blackbird plane. Come to think of it,that's about all that is left from the original storyline in the comics</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This lame version of Apocalypse is nothing compared to the comics. As far as the rest of the cast, I felt like I was watching a bunch of little kids in a baby version of the X-Men. I know they are supposed to be younger but seriously, NightCrawler looks like he's 12. Oh and Nicholas Hoult, I'm sorry but your version of Beast is horrible! The Beast make up looks more like a hairy smurf than a super hero. Kelsey Grammar was actually a better beast.Sophie Turner was very hard for me to accept as Jean, I felt like I was watching Sansa Stark trapped in an alternate universe, rather than watching the Jean character.As far as the Wolverine cameo. I almost wanted to burst out laughing. Hugh Jackman reprized his role as Wolverine for barely even a minute, in a scene that was thrown in for no reason other than just having him there. He is old enough to be the father of most of the current cast.Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't remember anywhere in the comics where Xavier goes bald because of Apocalypse.This whole movie was just a big fat joke! Although, I liked the casting of Olivia Munn as Psylocke, a key X-Men character that FINALLY got to appear in an X-Men movie. It took you guys long enough! Although she is depicted here as a villain, Olivia even looks like Psylocke which is very nice. Unfortunately she is in a bad X-Men film.Can we please for the love of god get a version of the X-Men that is actually faithful to the comics? Preferably with a cast of the right age(not mostly little kids, like in this film) and the correct costumes? Most importantly, how about a cool story and good character development?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mutant Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eighth "X-Men" film,(though the first one taking place entirely in the new, altered time-line) is set in 1983, where a powerful, ancient mutant named Apocalypse(played by Oscar Issac) has been reawakened, and is hellbent on ridding the world of all traces of human civilization, who enlists four mutants(Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and Magneto) to help him in this task, though the combined powers of Charles Xavier, Mystique, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Beast, Nightcrawler and Qucksilver may be too much even for a self-styled god... Action packed if bloated entry has big ideas but fairly routine execution, and I still think this new time-line(effectively negating five of the first six films in the franchise!) is quite needless and misguided.Hugh Jackman does make a brief, obligatory appearance which sets up the planned ninth film in the series. Wolverine is not done just yet it seems...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am and I was never a great superheroes-comics reader (I was more into fantasy and sci-fi stuff a la Jodorowsky/Giménez). So as a no specialist of DC or Marvel or whatever superhero-cosmos there may be existing I guess I can dare to say Iam a little more objective to all the superhero-movies as a hardcore-fan.Imo the quality of Marvel/DC movie-adaption drops fast - Batman vs. Superman, Fantastic Four, Captain America Civil War and yes, the last part of the X-Men franchise name it they are at best average entertaining stuff and lose compared to their predecessors.The issue isn't imo the acting, editing, cgi-quality or other "technical" parts - ofc that's all well done or at least sufficient executed but the real and BIG issue is - the plot, the story and yes, some of those movies with that a shallow story-line are far too loooooooooong. Less would be more - cutted to 100 min maybe those movies wouldn't be so boring and bored I was (not the whole time but way too much).So back to X-Men: the story is fast summarized, the good and the bad mutants are gathering their troops, after grouping up the first little fights after that the endboss-fight with the supervillain in-between somewhere Stryker and/or other "normal" guys do interfere, end-credits, closing of the curtain.Also how the super-villain Apocalypse was beaten is implausible - that dude just could have transformed his enemies to sand...Imo the first trilogy was far more interesting story-wise. This movie has no story the other movies didn't already tell us over and over again. And this switching of Magneto from good to bad and from bad to good - really this guys sucks, be a villain or be a good guy, maybe change your mind once, but not in almost every movie/struggle...Anyway Antman and Deadpool are the positive surprises and I enjoyed those 2 movies bigtime, both beat easy everything the "big players" of the superhero-cosmos provided with their last endeavors.Last words: Not unwatchable but - redundant. The only important info for me was how Professor X lost his hair ;) Only recommended for die-hard-fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes, this is a bad film, not irretrievably bad like Gods of Egypt, not quite laugh in it's face bad, just lazy, cliché-riddled repetitive. this well is exhausted. if it weren't for the presence of michael fassbender it would have no weight whatsoever... CG overkill cannot rescue films such as this anymore. the technical aspect of spectacle totally underscored with plot, character development ... a scene that takes place at the gates of Auschwitz is what sent this straight down the toilet for me. doesn't a super villain who wants to 'cleanse the earth' make the inclusion of that scene utterly risible? and when said 'super villain' utters lines like "you are all my children' you know you are watching lazy garbage. and the necessity to have to be aware of plot lines and characters from 'the marvel' or 'DC universe' precludes many viewers who have no interest in being a citizen of these 'universes'. characters do ridiculous things for ineffable reason, and there are so many characters all 'super in some way' that this genre is now almost utterly vitiated. these films are either reboots or remakes or reboots of remakes etc... while bringing nothing new to the genre other than a newer younger face. ( that being said, Sophie Turner is utterly miscast, not her fault, just rubbish script writing) .. i wish for the days when a movie had the power of originality, and writing good enough that you could spawn a whole mythos from one solitary film. watching Under The Skin gave me that and so i define that as art. X-men is derivative shallow nonsense and hence i describe that as garbage. ( apart from the lovely caveat in the end credits say 1500 people where employed in making this movie, that is laudable i guess)..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with unrealistic CGI, for a ritual ground that has been used for thousand years, everything looks so fresh and brand new, with sort of high-tech equipment. It should be old and mystical. Then it follows with some gore actions which made my kids close their eyes. I beginning to think I made mistake by taking them to watch this movie. Thanks God that it become more kid-friendly throughout the time. While my kids have quite a good time, I think it's below my expectation.Take the explosion that happens in the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. It make my kids laughs, while I feel that scene is not suppose to be funny. And then we meet Wolverine and Col Stryker, which turns out they're just cameos. And then the action. Perhaps I put my expectation about the action quite high, because they are Marvel's characters just like Captain America and friends. And Civil Wars has just released so it's unavoidable to compare both. Civil Wars is full of spectacular action, with heroes which not just rely only on their gift but primarily on their skills. While this X- Men movie, the actions have simple, uncreative choreography which just relying on their gifts. These heroes almost has no skill. Blame it to the Russo's whose made the final battle in this X-Men series looks like just some people trying to hit their opponent as hard as they can.If I watched this movie alone, I may give lower score. That score above is because my kids still can enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't write reviews but when I saw all these people giving the film so much praise, I had to write something. Since everyone else is giving it such praise &#x131; will focus on the negatives.So, the film has pacing issues. It is too slow at times and the first half of the film looks like a montage. The scenes are randomly placed and the plot is all over the place. Even when we are informed about the plot, there is too much stuff going on. Magneto shouldn't have been in this film. It is the same thing that happened in DOFP: He has full control, he is about to kill people, they convince him otherwise, he stops being bad, they part ways.Another complaint that I have is Mystique. She is just a side character in the comics, she pops up occasionally, is deceiving and smart, and goes away. But in the movies they felt that she had to be in every scene. They made her a hero which was bullshit. And the speech she gave in the last scene- cringy.They also didn't do some side characters justice. I wanted to like the Cyclops-Jean-Nightcrawler trio but my favorite character from the comics who was Cyclops did NOTHING. Jean played a huge part in the final battle and Nightcrawler saved the professor while Cyclops shot his eye beams a total of four times in the film. Psylocke quickly became Apocalypse's bitch and she was given no attention unlike the comics. They put her in the trailer and that footage of her is 50 percent of her total screen time. Storm was another half assed subplot: she is a horsemen immediately, she betrays Apocalypse because of her "hero" and they just take her in at the school. Also they either needed to give Moira more use or they should have focused more on the romance. While I liked the romance between her and Charles, might as well focus more on that because the plot is kinda weak.Apocalypse was...meh. Very fitting in this film. He was mysterious early on in the film and he got more and more cryptic until the final act. And his final plan is so damn stupid. The mind battle was good but don't tell me Charles can get his ass kicked and Jean just totally evaporates him. I don't like that they made Phoenix a part of Jean from the start.Bryan Singer should say goodbye to the franchise and leave his place to Matthew Vaughn again. That guy knows how to make a FUN movie which is what this franchise should be about. If only we could have more of First Class.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh no?.. Another failed attempt to make a blockbuster with the film X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). This film has such a great cast, the costumes were for the most part fair and of course some were just horrible. This is a film that had the potential to be something really good though then came the script?..You could literally turn the sound off in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and think of every cheesy one-liner within all films like this and know exactly what words were gonna be said and when. The story just went off in the dark totally destroying the stories that took place in former X-Men films, it was if they didn't know what took place in the other films before it. X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) was a rush job and it shows very badly.X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) had some fairly good action spots, though predictable to say the least. The film did bring the stars to the show, though X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) sadly let all of the viewers down on many levels. This film didn't come close to expectations.</fullReview>

The movie is made for younger audience whom may not know much about x-men characters or what a "mutant" is. so many long, boring, and useless dialogues over similarly annoying music through out the movie. usually Ii fall sleep through boring movies, this time I was TRYING to fall sleep but i couldn't. where the movie loses real fans with lack of story line and misrepresentation of characters powers and back stories, it makes up with so much unnecessary over the top violence it makes you yawn. the only thing I remotely liked was Olivia Mann as Psyloke. I say skip this one if you get annoyed by crappy and money grabbing movies.PS. Gene Grey is NOT the Phoenix.

It's great that special effects wise we can do pretty much anything nowadays, but this movie took that idea and just went too much with it to the point where everything was ridiculous.I'm certainly glad I didn't pay to see this. I guess every movie mo matter how good or bad rubs some people the wrong way and I guess that was this for me. I just felt that everything power and destruction wise was just too much to the point where I was no longer enjoying a movie but rather being reminded that I was seeing one.Part of the thing I hate about evolution especially when it comes to movies is just how they feel they need to one up everything, but what those retards don't realize is that at a certain point it just all looks fake and stupid, and that's pretty much how this movie ended up for me.Far as time lines, it seems to me they broke so many aspects of peoples encounters and other such that it just seems ridiculous. Wasn't it just a couple movies back that Kurt was introduced and Jean and Storm found him, and didn't know of him? Yet they were in this movie all together? So many stupid things like that plus the over the top powers just made this an utter mess...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She did not deserve her memories back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since CIA agent Dr. Moira MacTaggart beat up the goon protecting the entrance, moved the rug, and left the piece of plywood open for the sun to come in and resurrect Apocalypse (something none of Apocalypse's minions could figure out), she is ultimately responsible for all of havoc caused in this movie. X-Men: Apocalypse certainly has many other plot holes (as it appears that they wrote this movie in about 5 minutes), but nothing nearly as gaping... yet no one, not even the telepathic Professor X, acknowledges her folly (as well as Storm's and Magneto's direct murderous involvement going without guilt, justice and retribution), instead... Charles rewards Moira by giving back the memories he once took from her. LAME! Just about ANYONE I know could have written a better way to resurrect Apocalypse, let alone write a better movie.I gave it a 3 because I quite enjoyed the Quicksilver stuffs-- except when Mystique brought him up to stop Magneto by telling him that he is his son, but even with all the destruction going on, they changed their mind. Horrible writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost its Superpower</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right, where do I even begin.The movie is incredibly dumbed down and the script was equally flawed. Magneto allowed himself to be captured by ordinary people, whilst he could have ended it right there and then with his super powers. Instead he surrenders (what?) which triggered clumsiness that resulted in the loss of his family. He chose a simple life at a factory to keep a low profile. Since he's raising a a family now you'd think he'd use his abilities to accomplish a better life for them and still keep a low profile. But again, common sense is not welcome in this movie.For some reason Angel and Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) are captured by ordinary people too. It was only to cater to an irrelevant side story, which wasn't explored anyway.Josh Helman (Col. Stryker) was 29 at the shooting and was a colonel already... At his age he should pushing pencils to prove himself as a young Lieutenant or something. Anyway, he's Colonel here, yet earlier franchises, which represent a later time-line (!) he'll be a Major. So he'll lose two ranks in the future! It's one of the many overlooked inconsistencies. More on the Stryker inconsistency later.Nightcrawler can't escape from cages all of a sudden. For some reasons top military bunkers is no problem but not metal cages. You'll immediately realize this was another entirely unnecessary approach to a story line.Wolverine was freed and given some of his memories back by Jean Grey. Yet in earlier episodes, Wolverine didn't even know he was rescued by the younger versions he's with now. And they didn't recognize him either, despite having seen his trademark claws. No one would forget his claws. So future installments of this movie need to find a way to make Wolverine not being aware of Xavier's gang, and Xavier's gang must forget about Wolverine. Good luck with that.Far more inconsistencies exist surrounding Wolverine's appearance, but you can read all about it on the internet. There are so many errors, it's undo-able to put them all in a review like this.Acting wise Josh Helman didn't convince at all. It's not clear to me why he was hired to begin with. Jennifer Lawrence under-performed heavily as well. It's painfully obvious she was in here for face recognition only. She indicated she grew tired of playing Mystique already. James McAvoy (Charles Xavier) does his usual thing. Despite him being 31 or 32 at the time of the shooting, he's made to look younger and didn't convince he could be the patriarch of his school. One needs a certain gravitas and he doesn't have it. Fassbender is lucky because of his awesome charisma, but frankly his performance was underwhelming too.It looks like the director simply didn't care anymore either. Sound wise, shooting, acting, he went for the bare minimum only. This is perfectly demonstrated in the character of Apocalypse; other than a promising start, nothing impressive comes from his end. You'd anticipate Apocalypse would put up more than a nice fight, as powerful as he supposedly is, yet his character remained entirely underwhelming.Also the Auschwitz-milking remains part of the standard Hollywood formula. Action scenes lack inspiration too. It has become a bore because it was implemented as if it were a chore.I advice to wait and obtain the movie later to keep your collection complete, but otherwise don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've liked many of the X-Men films, but is it just me, or do we all collectively forget this franchise exists until the next one is released? This is especially a problem with 9 films in 15 years, with so many sequels, prequels, sidequels, spin-offs, and jumps-in-time that keeping track of the plot and the multitude of characters requires mutant-esque power in itself. The unbridled success of the last film, Days of Future Past, would discount those worries of franchise amnesia, only it's appeal was mostly in its 70s nostalgia and intention to stick with what we know. Apocalypse, an intense series continuation that requires much of its audience and offers little, may be the least inspired film in the bunch. There's nothing to the plot: an ancient being with seemingly endless power rises from the ashes to end the world, and only the X-Men can stop him. It's boring and over-done. Sure, McAvoy and Fassbender continue to enhance all the material they're given with a gravitas and depth beyond anything else in these films. However, those great central performances can't save a movie whose villain is so dumb, uninteresting, and paper-thin that the normally-great Oscar Isaac even comes off as plastic. The rampant deus ex machina and muddled motivations give the high-danger plot a feeling of having no stakes at all. It's a shame the overall experience is so muddy and ill-advised seeing as how there are definitely some great scenes found throughout. Scene stealers Magneto and Quicksilver each get there times to shine, in moments both cool and emotionally interesting. Unfortunately, a collection of cool set pieces can't overcome the tired and hasty story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled, long, and cliché.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Apocalypse' is a very odd film. It's kind of the sequel to 'Days of Future Past' but it's set before the events that we see at the end of 'Future'. So, it's a sequel, prequel to 'Days'. At this point everything that is happening in the X-Men universe is very difficult to follow. There are so many different stories being told in separate times and places. This film tries to capture every single one that is happening around this time period. For some reason Magneto is like retired or sometime and has a family I guess. And Raven is running around saving other mutants inexplicably. After the film wastes about thirty minutes setting all these characters up it actually gets going. I can't understand why Singer felt it necessary to reintroduce these characters as if we had never seen them before. It takes so much time early on showing what every single person is doing that It's hard to connect with the story later on. We don't need to see what literally everyone is doing or how they are doing it.Not only is that a waste of time but it robs the actual main characters of having any character. We don't need to see how Angel or Nightcrawler got where they are. We don't need to spend twenty minutes with Magneto's family that we all know is going to die. And with in thirty minutes, oh what do you know! They totally die for no reason. Having a main character filled with rage over the death of two dimensional family members is so cliché at this point that I actually burst out laughing when they died. Like a guy double kills his wife and daughter with a bow and arrow without even looking. Why did this guy have his bow drawn in the first place? He was being attacked by birds but still had his bow perfectly aimed at them and just happened to let go of the arrow.It was absolutely ridiculous (and hilarious). Of course this plot convince spurs Magneto to join Apocalypse's band of misfits but really? How many times has that been done before? And if that hadn't happened would he have not joined the bad guys? It seemed like a lot was hinging on that moment and it was freaking stupid.And lets talk about Apocalypse. Not only was he as cliché a villain as you can get but his climatic fight scene was ridiculous. We literally watch him decapitate people with sand but once we he is fighting the X-Men he just kind of tosses them around. How can I feel threatened by a villain that is this atrocious? He's a big deal in the comics but he amounts to zippy zap on screen. He gets beat up a lot and does nothing about it.But he'll turn around and annihilate an entire city within seconds of stretching out his hand. Granted these scenes where pretty cool though. That's really the only thing that carried this film. The action sequences. Everything in between them is rubbish but when the action hits, it hits big and hard.And it's elevated by superb performances from McAvoy, Isaac, and Fassbender. Fassbender in particular (Magneto). The scene in Auschwitz is arguably the best sequence in the film thanks to his performance. You really feel his pain and rage as he tears everything around him apart, screaming at the air all the while. It was the only powerful thing that the film had to offer.If anything, I was thoroughly entertained while watching this. There was three or four excellent sequences that blew me away. One including Quicksilver that even up staged 'Future Past's scene. But aside from the technical aspect of the film and some great scenes there isn't much here. The characters a flat, the plot convoluted, and the story bloated with far more personalities than the film could handle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the title and rating I'm sure you can guess that I was not a fan of Apocalypse. After the previous two movies setting such a high bar, it would be understandable for the third movie to maybe slightly go under, but no; instead the people behind this film made sure to bend their back's to a 90 degree angle, and limbo under that bar with absolutely no problem, which putting it like that, makes it sound like a success, but, I assure you it was not. The acting was fine, the casting was fine, the visuals were fine, and the makeup was fine. It was the story, or lack thereof, where this movie suffered tremendously. For the first hour and a half absolutely NOTHING happens, Apocalypse gathers some followers that takes more than half the movie, Jean Grey and Scott Summers make a cameo, Raven/Mystique saves another fellow blue man so they can start their own music group or something, I'm not sure I wasn't even paying attention at this point. The whole marketing was touted for featuring this all- powerful villain, a God some would say, and yet he does nothing. He grants powers, taps into a character's mind, and monologues. Seriously every time he opened his mouth I thought he was auditioning to be the next voice of Shodan for System Shock 3. I digress. Our villain was trapped under the Earth for thousands of years because of convoluted plot points. He is then released because some light shines through a hole and hits his tomb so to speak, which is also ridiculous because he was *spoilers* 10 feet under the ground, I find it so hard to believe not a single inch of sunlight ever hit it before that point. Also in this scene showed the return of Moira MacTaggert, who was absent in Days of Future Past, also due to convoluted plot points. Essentially Charles wipes her memory immediately after the events of First Class to "protect her". Which is again completely ridiculous since it was very well demonstrated she was someone who could very clearly handle herself, but, they had to think of a reason as to why she wasn't in the last installment and that was the best the writers could come up with. *spoilers* She gets her memories back at the end of the movie and instead of being livid that he would give her a telepathic version of a date rape drug, she is happy and kisses him *end spoilers*. So again throughout this movie (which also takes place in the time span of 2/3 days) we're treated to a build-up for the "epic" final fight, all that exposition and "plot" threads lead to this final fight which lasts maybe the last 20 minutes of the movie. Which wouldn't have been that bad if there had been any other fight/action/struggle throughout the movie. I mean they get *spoilers* kidnapped by Stryker and Jean Grey releases Weapon X (Wolverine) but they even managed to make that into a snooze fest. *end spoilers* Again though the final battle is coming and we're treated to a long awaited build-up, so imagine by surprise when we find that this final "battle" is just as sluggish as the rest of the movie. *spoilers* Storm and Cyclops battle it out but that was all shown in the trailer, Jean moves some debris to block Angel from hitting them with his blades, and Beast beats up Psylocke, who gets like 45 seconds of screen time. Oh yeah, Apocalypse strangles Raven for a bit, but again that was also in the trailer. Sansa Stark finally gets to show her stuff though by absolutely annihilating Apocalypse, with the power of the Phoenix Force, which honestly is the most interesting part of the movie. *end spoilers**spoilers* We're then treated to an after-credits scene which hints at Mr. Sinister appearing in the next film, which was also interesting *end spoilers*.So again I wasn't a fan, I tried so hard to like it, but I couldn't. As stated in a much better Marvel movie "Compromise where you can. And where you can't, don't." Well I definitely held true to that advice for this movie. Also can we just talk about how LAME that Stan Lee cameo was. In a year where Stan Lee was *spoilers* an announcer for a strip club in Deadpool and coined "Tony Stank" in Civil War, this one was awful and made his cameo in Netflix's Daredevil seem like Oscar material *end spoilers*. Okay I'm done, I've said my piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I want to say that Bryan Singer needs to stay far away from the X-Men. Last Stand was a billion times better than this film.This is by far the worst iteration of the X-Men we've ever seen.Keeping in mind that half of the costumes were somewhat close to the comics. Psylocke being the closest. They didn't really do any of the characters justice, accept for maybe Wolverine. Yet again.I remember seeing X-Men in theaters and thinking I can't wait to see Apocalypse! Well, it seems Magneto is all they can get right.What was once a terrifying character was shown as a threat only to a CG world, we didn't really see actual victims, we only heard screams. But how will we know if it was just empty homes with TV's on? Apocalypse spends no time at all finding only four mutants whom all fail him.Quicksilver's scene was probably the most entertaining part by far. It seems that's all they cared about. On top of this was a very disappointing meet with his father, where he doesn't do what we were all waiting for.How in the world Mystique is even taken seriously is beyond me. Jennifer Lawrence was clearly thrown in this film, unlike the previous films where she had something to do. She felt like she needed to help the guy that spent the entire last film trying to kill her. What a mess.All in all, I'd say skip it. Watch the early 90's X-Men cartoon instead. This was such a waste on all accounts.Well enjoy your paycheck Fox. Thanks for ruining yet another childhood dream. This is why cartoons are by far the perfect medium for these stories, clearly no one that cares is actually working on them anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Look, Another Big-Budget Explosive Superhero Blockbuster! Never Seen One of Those Before!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>X-Men: Apocalypse is the follow-up to the previous X-Men movie, 'Days of Future Past'. It follows the X-Men as the first mutant ever, Apocalypse, reawakens and seeks to destroy the world and create a better one from it. For the most part I had fun watching this movie. The action was good most of the time, and the special effects were pretty great, as expected. And for the most part the story was, while not horribly original, in place and understandable. What I didn't like was how at times the movie could be inconsistent. I noticed one point in particular where a character uses some kind of laser whip and cuts a giant slab of rock in half with it, then wraps it around some guy's neck. But the guy doesn't lose his head for some reason. Also, the opening scene was a little weird. While I liked it overall, there were a few things that just didn't make sense. Apocalypse himself was kind of dumb, particularly in his character design and the way he spoke. His voice just kept changing, which made it look like Bryan Singer was just trying to use stupid cheap methods to make the audience intimidated. The movie was a little rushed at points, specifically more towards the beginning when one of the characters in recruiting people to join his team. None of the characters really had any reason to join the guy, and in the end it didn't matter anyways. My biggest issue with this movie though is that it's just a really average movie. The acting was just good, nothing special. The character development was just good, nothing special. Even in the way the movie was shot, through camera-work and the such was all just so average. To top it off, it was loaded with overdone, unrealistic dialogue that we seem to see in all movies nowadays, again, making that aspect of it average as well. I'm not saying all the dialogue was bad, but a lot of it wasn't anything special. There it is again. Nothing special. Overall, in case you haven't already figured this out, the movie is nothing special. Sure, there are good parts and bad parts, but when it comes down to it it's just an average movie. In the end I would only recommend this movie if your a fan of the X-Men universe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can a movie about superheroes be boring? Yes, yes it can.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what went wrong? Well, the pacing is way off. For what is marketed as an action/sci-fi, it consists of very little action. Worse of all, the action doesn't even look that great. It lacks the feeling of power and pain that Captain America - Civil War did so well. The Quicksilver scenes look awesome, but it's not enough, and this time it didn't have the "wow"- feel like when we saw it for the first time in Days of Future Past. To sum up, action wise, it brings nothing new. The actors does an OK job, Sophie Turner is no Famke Janssen, but she does alright. Yet another forgettable Marvel villain with the cliché "I'm gonna take over the world!"-goal. Why you ask? Cause he's evil and hate weaklings. Yeah, and it's kind of a revenge thing, but still, nothing he says or does make me care about him. Loke was a great villain because of his backstory, didn't feel like he belonged, asshole father, the works. Apocalypse is just a dude with a God complex and some superpowers. Boring. I dream about the day Bryan Singer and Fox steps down and gives Kevin Feige and some other talent the chance. One day?And no, I don't care if something is explained in the comics, a movie has to stand on its own. This one, doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Singer Fan This Was a Tough One to Swallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought Bryan Singer's X Men films were not just the best of the X Men franchise but also the best of the entire superhero genre as there was always something more intelligent going on with them. The mutant struggle for equal rights perfectly parallels the prior Civil Rights movement and the differing approaches on how to achieve equality shined in the lead characters of Xavier and Magneto. Xavier representing the path of diplomacy and peace like Martin Luther King and Magneto going the more forceful path like Malcolm X. When Singer left the franchise I had never been more let down by any film as I had been by Last Stand as all that was smart about the series was traded off for a generic action film with the team needing to defeat an all powerful mutant who was poorly developed and hardly used in the film. Of course Singer's return seemed to undo all this with the excellent Days of Future Past and it seemed like the series could move forward in a very positive way. Unfortunately I would go as far as to say that Apocalypse somehow managed to be much worse than Last Stand. The main reason being that Apocalypse himself is a very flat character devoid of any motivation for destroying the world and nowhere near as menacing as the version of Apocalypse from the 90's cartoon. The story also jumps all over the place between different characters without developing any sense of rhythm for story progression and I constantly found myself just wanting the film to get to the big dumb ending it was building towards just to get it over. The dialogue is very corny in many parts and it's nearly impossible to root for any of these characters played by these new adolescent actors. Worst of all, the complex friendship between Magneto and Xavier which was the driving force of all the films is completely absent and all we have is a special effects extravaganza of super mutants duking it out over a world ending event which we never feel invested in. At this point I don't know what the series can do to correct itself again and if Bryan Singer does not come back I don't think that would be so bad because he has clearly checked out with this latest attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins in Ancient Egypt where En Sabah Nur is worshipped as a god. He is Apocalypse, the first mutant and he can amass the powers of other mutants.After an attempt to kill him goes wrong his followers awaken him in 1983 and Apocalypse recruits his four horsemen, a team of mutants that includes Magneto reeling from the death of his wife and child in the Polish forest and a young Storm who has been residing in Egypt. They intend to create a new world order by destroying the previous world first.Professor X and Raven have to lead a new team against them that includes Cyclops, new to the academy and who starts a teen romance with Jean Grey. Comic relief is provided by Nightcrawler who sports a Thriller style leather jacket.This is a bloated film with thin characterisation and even the 1980s period setting was rather empty in comparison of the sheen of First Class which was set in the 1960s. Do not get me started as to how Professor Xavier and Magneto do not age, these guys should be nearing 50 now and look nothing like Patrick Stewart's and Ian McKellan's older versions.The whole film is an empty spectacle. So Magneto just wants to live an ordinary working life but when he saves someone at a factory we know he can wave goodbye to his family.I even found the film rather morally dubious. We are in a scene set in a former Nazi concentration camp. Magneto asks Apocalypse where was he when his family were getting killed. Apocalypse mentions something like he was unable to help. Well something tells me with a name like Apocalypse he would had admired the havoc that the Nazi's created with the holocaust. After all he only plans to destroy the world himself, men, women, children, animal life, plant life and Magneto helps out as countless people die in the climax.The film has some nice touches, a zinger of a joke about the third film in the trilogy (which this is) never being as good as the younger X Men come out from watching Return of the Jedi in a cinema.The best scenes in the film is when the school is blown up, the students are saved by Quicksilver who literally just dropped by in a slow motion sequence set to the Eurythmics song 'Sweet Dreams.' However much of the film lacks resonance it is moderately entertaining but also a by the numbers action film. We think here we go again. Magneto has just killed millions but Professor X wants to see the good in him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>special effects does not a movie make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They tried to just completely wow and overwhelm with special effects. Story line and character development was non-existent. Apocalypse casting and makeup was atrocious; he should be huge/muscular, intimidating, scary, a force to be reckoned with. They should have made this into a 2 part movie and really developed character background stories and an actual plot. It was hilarious and definitely unintentional foreshadowing when Jean Gray/Scott Summers/etc saw Return of the Jedi and jean says, "the third movie is never as good". The only reason I give this movie a rating as high as 6/10 is because the wolverine scene was amazing and so was the fight between Charles Xavier and Apocalypse in Xavier's mind. Special effects, while cool, do not a movie make.</fullReview>

It started off relatively interesting , new character all powerful and blah blah , but then it went south ( kind of the same way the last avengers - age of ultron did ) . The all powerful apocalypse gather 4 measly mutants to be his 4 horsemen ,when he was trying to gather the most powerful ones (by the way his 4 horsemen in the beginning were just as bad - defeated by mere humans with some sticks and a big stone that took down a whole pyramid - so much for ancient Egyptian engineering ,if all it takes is a stone down a slide to destroy a pyramid ) , and then those 4 horsemen lose or switch side in the first battle they have together . And how was he even defeated, he could have killed any of the other mutants in an instant, judging by the extent of powers he showed earlier in the movie. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous . Had apocalypse won this movie would have made sense , but defeated like that it just left a underwhelming feeling .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is pathetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an insult to everything related to the "X Men" series. At least it was better than "The Last Stand" but that isn't much of an accomplishment. This film's only redeeming factor is Quicksilver and maybe nightcrawler. All other characters were painfully annoying to look at/listen to, especially Jennifer Lawrence's "Mystique" which is quite frankly a character getting worse and worse every film. I think actors such as Nicholas Hoult must feel appalled at the extent of which he was underused and was given no material to work with. They even found a way for Magneto to be unlikable. Let's get into the main problems with this film. For starters the villain is less intimidating than a de-clawed kitten. His character is comparable to Shrek in terms of appearance and intelligence. He proved to be little more than a tremendous waste of time, he couldn't even select three worthy apprentices that could help him. The character was too lazy to do any real scouting for the most powerful mutants and instead just picked the first three mutants he ran into. Magneto was the only powerful follower he had and yet he managed to get talked out of destroying the world (which he did a fairly awful job of) by that pathetic, unlikable and mind numbingly boring character Mystique. It baffles me that Mystique is allowed to "lead" the X men. Who would want to take orders from that idiot? Although Mystique was an incredibly annoying character, there are many others that do not live up to the brilliant standards set out in the original time-line. Jean Grey for example, played by the apparently talented Sophie Turner, obviously not talented enough to give even a slightly convincing American accent, seriously, what was that? Honestly, I'd much rather some random unknown ginger actress play the role than a girl chosen entirely because she appears in a well-known TV show (Game of Thrones). If this is the standard of the casting process in the X-Men franchise, I'd honestly grab a wig and go audition myself, because it seems they'll accept any useless pillock who wants in. Also, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, the most forgettable band of villains I think I've ever seen. Storm is such a powerful villain and was entirely wasted during this movie. Psylocke who? That is probably what you were saying after the movie. Finally, the bird man, what in his right mind was Apocalypse thinking when he decided a great addition to his team would be nothing more than a glorified turkey.Admittedly, the film did have some laugh out loud moments, most notably, the death of Magneto's daughter, which had me in stitches. The girl's death can be blamed entirely due to yet again another act of awful parenting with parents who cannot keep an eye on their daughter for even a minute. If Magneto had brought a piece of metal with him, he wouldn't even be in the situation he found himself in, the character of course cannot even think of this.Bryan Singer, you dodgy bloke. You have so much behind you, greats such as 'The Usual Suspects' and 'X2'. Now you have X-Men Apocalypse, good job buddy, your reputation as a film director has reached new lows.Yours sincerely, -a disappointed fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud, dumb and derivative, thie empty CGI showcase is by far the worst superhero movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Apocalypse unleashes the end of the world, there is a moment when the gifted youngsters of Professor Charles Xavier's school for mutants sneak out to the cinema to see 'Return of the Jedi'. Following a debate which of the original 'Star Wars' films is the best, a teenage Jean Grey gets the final word with the following remark: "Well, at least we can all agree, the third one is always the worst". Though clearly intended as a dig at Brett Ratner's oft-criticised 'The Last Stand', it is an equally prescient remark about the third superhero-versus-superhero showdown of this year, a loud, empty, overblown CGI-fest that possesses not the depth or excitement of the eminently superior 'Captain America: Civil War' nor even the grand operatic ambition of the flawed 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'.As promising as it may be to underscore the ideological divide among the mutants of waging war or making peace by introducing an all- powerful deity meant to be the first of their kind, that premise never quite comes to fruition here. Aside from world domination (which pretty much sums up describes what every other comic book villain is after), there is no purpose or motivation to Apocalypse's plan to scorch everything on the planet. Try though Oscar Isaac does, the usually charismatic actor struggles to bring much conviction to his character's monologues about restoring the strong in their rightful place atop society, not least because the actor is buried under slathered-on makeup, facial prosthetics and a costume that would make Thanos embarrassed.Seeing as how Apocalypse proves to be a disappointingly generic villain, it once again falls to James McAvoy's Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender's Magneto/ Erik Lensherr to provide the dramatic conflict on which the showdown between good and evil is based. And yet that tension between Charles' man of reason and hope versus Magneto's darker impulses has been fought so many times that it feels familiar and undercooked here, especially considering how its immediate predecessor had fleshed out the same complex relationship out so much more beautifully.That essentially reduces 'Apocalypse' to yet another superhero round- up much like the first 'X-Men' or 'X-Men: First Class', and so, for the first hour, we are introduced to newcomers Tye Sheridan's laser- sighted Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops, Sophie Turner's telekinetic Jean Grey and Teutonic teleporter Kurt Wagner a.k.a. Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee). They will eventually join forces with 'First Class' regulars Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and Hank McCoy a.k.a. Beast (Nicholas Hoult) to go head to head with Apocalypse's 'Four Horsemen' recruits ? weather-controller Storm (Alexandra Shipp), energy- manipulator Psylocke (Olivia Munn), flight-enabled Angel (Ben Hardy) and last but not least, Magneto. News about the latter will also prompt the son he doesn't yet know about, Quiksilver (Evan Peters), to enlist in Professor Xavier's school, where he will put his fleet- footed powers to save all the students within from an explosion ripping the building apart.Given how that sequence set to Eurythmics' period-appropriate synth- jam 'Sweet Dreams' is by and large an exact copy of the crowdpleasing scene-stealing sequence in 'Days of Future Past', there is more than a nagging suspicion that director Bryan Singer (who marks his fourth 'X- Men' outing with this movie) has pretty much run out of ideas. As if compensating for an attention-deficit audience, Singer and his screenwriter Simon Kinberg cut from subplot to subplot without ever letting their audience get involved in any one storyline or character. Even though the 'X-Men' movies have always been an ensemble, Singer has always grounded them in their struggles to emerge from wealth or poverty, acceptance or rejection, confidence or self-hatred; yet this latest dumbs down their humanity in favour of pure spectacle, which proves an ultimately foolhardy choice in this era where there are just too many superheroes fighting for our attention.Even as a superhero slugfest, the action is frankly disappointing. It says a lot when Quiksilver's cheeky slo-mo turns out to be the highlight of a film that promises no less than the end of the world. At any and every opportunity, every other character reminds us of what is at stake, but the large-scale catastrophe consists of nothing more than unimpressive shots of capital cities (including New York, Sydney and Cairo) reduced to swirling CGI-dust with little sense of tragedy or consequence. The climax itself is packed with plenty of sound and fury, but comes off shockingly dull. Rather than have the Horsemen take apart the good guys as a team, Singer splits the fight into a series of mini-skirmishes that hardly do the characters or their superpowers justice. By the time Apocalypse (finally) steps into the fray after a way-too-long buildup, the battle has shifted into his mind (which, as we suspect, turns out to be pretty blank), but that change of setting barely unleashes any creative possibility for Singer to think out of this world.And coming off 'Days of Future Past', 'Apocalypse' is undoubtedly a tragic letdown. There are so many characters that even Charles and Magneto become no more than supporting acts, their perennial disagreement treated as an afterthought than the dramatic dynamo of the film. The titular villain may seem like great potential as an antagonist, but ends up vague, underwhelming and insignificant. And most notably, what used to be potent allegory about the civil rights movement or coming out in the LGBT community has now been diminished to standard, sometimes sub-standard, superhero melee, so much so that it even fails to make good use of its vibrant 1980s setting except for a couple of recognisable tunes. It may not be the apocalypse of the 'X-Men' franchise, but this dreadfully boring and derivative entry could very well portent its end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another proof that Hollywood is managed by atheists...?I would like to write a review from a very different perspective. What you got after 2.5 hrs of ego clashes among highly "developed" mutants with an advanced visual screening, a secret atheism piped through movie screen, hidden behind childish fights and primitive objectives of key characters...This is what is happening right now with other big budgeted movies as well. a danger comes from an unstoppable force, people are desperate, some prayers you hear first, God hear us, help us, but at the end all help is done by some other mutants or some other worldly force. no divine force you can mention. So then? is there a God really, where? why it is always silent? Remember some scenes in the movie. All those prayers...then our mutant Jean finishes them all.. a good comforting sound says God heard our prayers...no, wait, but jane did it all by herself..oh yes, also the mutant was saying he was called Elohim, Ra? So all these years, stupid people? called a devil mutant their God? So God was him? Remember as well famous "interstellar"as well...Ghosts and all, some mighty force?..finally you find all is done by the guy himself. I am big movie fan, but this hidden messaging thing, I do not like it at all...Action movies should like an action movie, not a platform for sending hidden anti religious messages. see where this goes with all these hero movies...you have a hero in the world, in the galaxy, that crashes almost everything down and no force other than another hero can stop him.

		<shortDescription>It's not Bad...but its not Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, I will be posting spoilers because I feel I can only review this movie properly by telling talking about everything. So if you don't want spoilers, then please don't read this.Again...don't read this if you don't want spoilers...Firstly, the returning cast of McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence and Hoult are cool. They don't really have in depth character journeys but they do well with what they were given. Magneto's reasoning for joining Apocalypse was a bit ham fisted. Taking him back to Auschwitz as a way to manipulate him into getting on board with a human annihilation plan didn't make much sense. I know Magneto is ruthless but that's a kind of dramatic. I like how Raven is saving mutants but I don't understand why she doesn't want to be the "poster child" for mutants. Her entire arc in First Class was being a "mutant and proud", after being insecure over her appearance and now she can spread that message but chooses not to. It kind of contradicts her character. There isn't much to say about Beast and Charles, they are good but don't really shine in this movie. Although, it was great seeing McAvoy with the iconic bald head.I definitely feel like this movie suffered from having too many characters. Singer just couldn't balance it. I feel like you cant bring iconic character to screen and have them be props, or just there for cool effects and action scene. If you want to do that, its best if you make up characters. My point is Psylocke barely has any lines and just makes the weird face throughout the whole movie. I feel like all her "great" moments are in the trailers, so she was underwhelming. It definitely shows that she was a last minute edition to the movie because her character is terribly under developed. Angel is another prop, although his final fight scene with Nightcrawler is pretty dope. Jubilee did not need to be in this movie. She didn't even use her powers. Not ONCE. But Cyclops introduction was good and a great nod to comics/cartoons. Jean Grey was cool and Storm was wasted as always. She did have her accent, however she didn't have much to do and in the final battle just stood around.Apocalypse I feel was a wasted villain. Since the comics, he's always had a survival of the fittest mentality but I feel like they needed to elaborate more on his reasoning for wanting to destroy the Earth. And like, what's gonna happen after we destroy the world? Secondly, you can't touch a television in the 1980s and have all of the knowledge of the world for the past 5000 years. Maybe now, with he internet but in the 80s....definitely not, that was stupid. I think this was a wasted villain and the final battle was a bit underwhelming, minus some cool visual moments. I, also, am wondering what would make Mystique think that she could take down Apocalypse? Weird.I know it seems like I'm ragging on the movie, it definitely had some cool, interesting, funny moments but I feel like the cons outweigh the pros. Quicksilver's scene definitely tops the one from DOFP. But I thought it was so convenient for him to arrive at the school at the moment Apocalypse was destroying the mansion. Also, why the hell did they kill Havok. After, three movies they just didn't let him be great. Total was of a character.This movie is not a bad movie. Some of the critics are definitely being dramatic, but I feel like this film suffers from trying to top itself and rival other superhero franchises like Superman and Civil War. I'm glad that it contains a lot more action than previous X-Men movies and I'm glad that Fox is trying to embrace the science fiction aspect of these stories, but it just falls short to me. I do have a lot more complaints but I will keep those to myself. Of course, I will never tell anyone to not see a movie. I think you should see for yourself to form your own opinion, this review is just my personal experience in words.Anyone who gives this movie a 1 is just being dramatic and knit picking. But anyone who rates this movie a 10 is just trying to battle the terrible reviewers instead of being realistic and honest. Lastly, I don't want the X-Men to go back to Marvel (as great as that would be), I think the X- Men should stay it's own universe. However, I do think the franchise suffers because of the creatives that handle bringing it to life. Kinberg and Singer should just leave this franchise alone and allow some fresh hands/eyes to take these movies to the next level. Even with DOFP erasing some continuity issues, they just bring more issues into the franchise that make your head twirl.OMG....last thing, i promise. The wolverine sequence was cool and fun to watch. But it just wasn't needed at all. That entire scene should have been the post credits. Speaking of post credits, it's nice to know that Mister Sinister exists in this universe. I guess I'm anxious to see which movie he will be a villain in; Deadpool sequel, New Mutants or the next X-men film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terribly Disappointing Continuation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming off the heels of 2014's stellar Days of Future Past, I had very high expectations of the third entry in this soft-rebooted series. X-Men Days of Future Past and First Class were not only brilliant X-Men films, but brilliant films in their own right, and are both in amongst some of the best movies of the last few years.Unfortunately, X-Men Apocalypse really isn't a worthy continuation of what was a brilliant run - the two years in which it was made seem to have been wasted on special effects and style over substance. Fast tracking a film in this fashion and pumping it put of the works in two years is a vain attempt at squeezing out as much profit from the franchise as they can before Days of Future Past's brilliance falls to the back of peoples minds.This new entry is as flashy as ever, and some of the effects do impress (whilst others are terrible), but it is a typical case of sporting more style than substance, and its very noticeable. It's primarily fueled by effects driven action sequences, and this becomes very boring toward the latter half of the film. For what was a 2 and a half hour film felt like an absolute eternity.The acting is very good, and I have no qualms with the actors - they all played their roles incredibly well and Fassbender and McAvoy were as brilliant as ever. The characters, however, were incredibly underwritten and dis-interesting. The 'new' character additions are poorly conceived and there's a little bit too much going on and too many to keep track of which will prove very unwieldy for some. They've tried to cram a few too many characters into the film, and it doesn't pan out well.All this being said, X-Men: Apocalypse is not a bad film at all - it's not good either, it's just OK. And it is incredibly disappointing because the last two entries have been nothing short of incredible. I realize people will not like to hear this and will dislike this review based on those merits, but I would prefer to get dislikes and give an honest review than lie. In the end, X-Men: Apocalypse has some moments of glory, but these moments are too few and far between, eventuating in a fairly tedious onslaught of special effects and dull action melange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>X men Franchise is doomed just like MCU... superhero movies need gravitas like DC films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryan Singer directed three of the first five "X-Men" movies, not counting the Wolverine or Deadpool spin-offs. His work in the series has been, at the very least, entertaining and exciting, and at its best (2003's "X2"), representative of the apex of the superhero genre. Singer's take on the material has always put character and theme at the center, giving us interesting people grappling with issues that felt recognizable in the real world, and never at the expense of thrilling action or wildly imaginative set pieces. With "X-Men: Apocalypse," however, Singer seems to have acquired a new mutant power of his own: monotony. Whether it's the lack of an interesting villain, or the fact that the series' time-travel element is forcing these mutants to meet each other (and the audience) all over again for the first time, this latest entry marks a shocking letdown from Singer's earlier contributions; what once soared now slogs.Singer's regular composer John Ottman works overtime to make us feel that exciting, important things are happening, but the movie never delivers them. "X-Men: Apocalypse" provides a hint at what might one day take down the ubiquitous superhero genre: utter dullness. For all its bangs, the movie is ultimately a whimper. still better than Civil bore</fullReview>
