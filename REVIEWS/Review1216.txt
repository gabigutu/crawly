		<shortDescription>Ignores major facts to make its case but is still a good film and an effective piece about injustice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerry Conlon is a small time Belfast thief who gets excluded from Northern Ireland by the IRA for anti-social behaviour and goes to live in England with his old school friend Paul Hill. They are in London when the mainland bombing campaign becomes more intense and they are both picked up for the bombing despite their claims of innocence. After more than week of beatings, abuse and threats, the two men break and sign confessions, longing for the beatings to stop and hoping the courts would see through the lies. However they are found guilty and, along with other relatives, sentenced to time ranging from 14 years to life. As time goes on Gerry and his father campaign for their case to be reopened until, eventually, the lawyer Gareth Pierce takes up the case.I came to this film having not seen it since its release in the early 90's, at which time I was still living in Northern Ireland in a mostly Protestant area. Given the subject matter the film was well received in this area. I decided to rewatch the film last night so that I could review it for this site and, since first seeing it, I have actually more of an insight on the subject matter since I had been held without charge under the same legislation that held the Guildford Four and had been taken to court twice before the charges were entirely dropped. I say this not as some claim to having a more valid opinion than anyone else but simply as a counter to those who will accuse me of being biased on the basis of being a Protestant.While I can see myself that the majority of reviews here for this film are slanted and full of political bias I will attempt to keep my review as free of this as I can (either one way or another).Despite the fact that the film leaves out glaring facts, none of these facts actually affect the film's main thrust ? that these men were (for this crime) unjustly accused, tried and convicted. The facts that are ignored are those which would have made the film a bit more complex (eg Hill's membership of the IRA) and I can understand why the makers decided to just make the subject as clean cut as they could and not present the audience with anything that may cause them to be in any doubt about what they are meant to be feeling. I can understand why they did it ? but that does not make it right and I would have welcomed a more complex film because those of us from Northern Ireland know that nothing is ever as simply as right/wrong, black/white ? but Hollywood is not there to inform but to entertain and hence the facts get lost on the road to a good film. And it is a good film.It is frustrating that people take what it tells them as fact but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of political beliefs, the idea of a justice system that would do this is interesting and worrying to me, and the film does a good job (albeit it overegged) of letting us see the extent that the police went to to get, if not 'their man', then at least 'a man'. The film does well to deliver characters (although simplified) that are easy to get behind and they helped me get involved in a story that was already pretty involving in its own right. The direction feels professional and injects enough emotion and sense of anger into the film to give it a solid sense of pace without it ever really tipping over into sentimentality or out and out preaching/ranting. Of course the material also helps from a great cast that deliver well and do their bit to keep it edgy and not sentimental.Day-Lewis is a very good actor and he does well here making his Gerry go through the stages of being a cheeky young man, frightened, shell-shocked, defeated, angry and then driven without us ever thinking he is a different character. If anything it is a shame that the film did paint his character so clean because I think Day-Lewis could have easily handled the moral complexities that would have come with that territory. Postlewaite is the real emotional heart of the film in many ways and he does very well with a role that could easily have been cloying and sentimental ? but Postlewaite plays it straight till the end. Thompson is all too simple and upright and her performance is little more than a cameo; this is made worse by the fact that the vast majority of English people are biased and corrupt according to the film ? again, like leaving facts out, just an attempt by the film to simplify things to make the audiences' emotions clearer and stronger.Overall I like this film but it is not a perfect piece of cinema nor should it be taken as the whole story. The film has dropped facts and directed its presentation to ensure that we, the audience, are in no doubt over what we should be feeling and thinking throughout. This does not change the message of the film or the injustice of the things that happened but it doesn't do justice to the always-complicated situation that is my country. The film as a film is very good ? well acted, well paced, well directed and engaging from the early realistic shots of Belfast in the 1970's through to the 'I'm going out the front door' finale that is no less impacting for us knowing it is coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot accurately describe how affecting this movie is. The story itself is harrowing, but the way in which Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon is heartbreaking at times. Several scenes in the film may be hard to take for those with a sensitive nature. Captures the mood and the time perfectly for someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings. I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong. The soundtrack is great without exception too! A total and utter classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's "In The Name of the Father" is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent."In the Name of the Father" is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Sharp Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a clever film this was. Quite modest yet remarkably entertaining. Instead of blaring political bias, viewers are treated to a compassionate human drama without the preachings and irritating banter of most other "social dramas" (Dog Day Afternoon, All the President's Men, Norma Rae). It's shameful that this film didn't receive at least two academy awards, despite it having been nominated for 7. Now considering that this was the same year that Schindler's List and The Piano, two outstanding dramas, were released, it isnt surprising nor unreasonable that they beat In the Name of the Father for many of the awards.The acting in this film is terrific. Lewis is low key and quite effective as the petty Irish thief Gerry Conlon. Pete Postlethwaite is spectacular as Gerry's father Guiseppe (certainly better than oscar winner tommy lee jones was in the fugitive). Emma Thompson's portrayal of attorney Gareth Pierce received much acclaim, and properly so. Beatie Edney, who had a small part as a wrongfully accused British teenage hippie, was so enamoring that its a wonder we don't see more of her.Of course much of this film is exagerrated and perhaps fabricated for the purposes of entertainment (as all movies which are "based on a true story" tend to be) but it's so finely done that it doesn't seem to matter. Some terrific scenes include the beginning, when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers, the trial in London, the prison scenes (which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies), and of course the powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo. Be sure to see this film if you haven't, it will definitely stir your emotions and renew your faith in the human spirit. And for those who eschew political films, give it a try anyways, the acting and craftiness outweigh the civic themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innocence Is Not An Absolute</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a an extremely well made film , but like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS much of it is total invention . Reviewers on this page have already pointed out the numerous errors such as Guiseppe and Gerry Conlon never being imprisoned in the same jail or the " Guilford four " and " Mcguire seven " trials taking place in completely seperate court cases but no one seems to have pointed out the erroneous backgrounds this film paints of Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill. In their book THE PROVISIONAL IRA authors Patrick Bishop and Eamon Mallie state the facts quite clearly that Paul Hill was a member of the Belfast brigade of the provisonal IRA ( And Hill later did confess to being a member ) while Conlon had been a member of Na Fianna Eireann which is the youth section of the provisionals though Conlon was quickly kicked out ( Literally ) due to his heavy drinking and drug taking . They didn`t meet on the ferry as shown in the film but Conlon bumped into Hill in Southampton where Hill was staying . What was Hill doing in Southampton ? He was on the run from the IRA who wanted to question him about guns going missing and about the possibility of Hill being an informer , something that is always punishable in IRA ranks with death and prior torture . When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that he`d met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings , not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend . Hill was also later found guilty of the murder of a former soldier though is never shown in the film and it`s this playing hard and loose with the facts that almost threatens to destroy the film . It could have been worse though , there might have been the suggestion that the bombing could have been a mass suicide Well that`s the bad points out of the way . What`s IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER`s good points ? Well Jim Sheridan directs with a real kinetic force especially the early scene where Conlon is pursued by the Brits against a voodoo chile soundscape . Sheridan also gets the very best out of his cast . Emma Thompson is good as the crusading lawyer , Pete Postlethwaite is very good as Guiseppe Conlon , but the outstanding performance is by Daniel Day Lewis as Gerry Conlon . Has anyone noticed the bitter Irony of a film about injustice features one of the greatest injustices commited by the Oscar board voters where they gave that year`s best actor Oscar to a very average performance by Tom Hanks ? No wonder more and more people view the Oscars as a popularity contest . And despite my above criticisms about the facts - or lack of them - IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER can in no way be described as a pro IRA film in the way that THE DEVIL`S OWN or SOME MOTHER`S SON are</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps a bit too black and white but still very impressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies, but aren't welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub, one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended, together with Conlon's father, his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations, putting them in jail for many years even though they haven't done anything wrong.The film is very good. It's well acted, well paced and well directed. The story is touching and I never got bored when watching it. Therefor I give it an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disquieting great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is based on a true story. Belfast guy Gerry Conlon is suspected of being one of the IRA terrorists responsible for a bomb in Guilford, London, in 1974, which killed several people. He spends 15 years in jail, fighting for his innocence and for truth.After working with Daniel Day Lewis in "My left foot", director Jim Sheridan teams again with the actor for this drama. The strong cast is completed by Emma Thomson and Pete Postlewaite. The result is a brilliant, passionate feature which tells about injustice. It's a disquieting film.This is doubtless the most achieved collaboration between the director and the main star. The other pictures as well are very good, but here we have a film of accusation -the story is more involving. Day Lewis performance in "My left foot" was awarded with an Oscar, but the actor could have been given the same prize for his play of Gerry Conlon.Strong screenplay, actors and soundtrack -with music of Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer and songs of Irish stars Bono and Sinead O'Connor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Name of the Father came out one year before The Shawshank Redemption and is bar none the better film. Shawshank is a great film but Name of the Father has more of human story to it. Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor with more potential now than he did when he won his first Oscar for My Left Foot and since then he has never starred in a film which he has acted badly in. Some of the stories have not been amazing but his acting makes up for it. This was the second time That Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Sheridan have come together to make a film. In all they have done three but Name of the father is by far the best. Pete Postlethwaite is another example of fine acting as he is the best actor in England since who ever was the last greatest actor.Daniel Day Lewis plays Gerry Conlon who is a seventies hippie who doesn't want to grow up. He has had so many troubles at home his fatherGiuseppe played by Postlethwaite decides to pack him off to London for his own safety and not become a lost soul amongst the troubles in Belfast. But when Gerry gets there he might as well wish he never went there in the first place as the trouble from Belfast follows him and before you know it a bomb goes off in a pub near to where he is staying and is not long arrested for the bomb along with his friends and family including his father.From there we are taken into this grieving story of strength, hope, tragedy and family. The story between father and son in jail is more touching and compelling than any love story you will ever see because these two men who have never really seen eye to eye are forced to confront each other's feeling and face up to where they stand in the world. Also Pete Postlewaite reminds me of my own father and my grandfather and yours two. He plays Giuseppe so well so would have thought he was the old guy living next door to you or the man you look up to as a father and spend time with as a granddad. What you have to remind yourself is that the movie is a true story of the Guilford Bombing and the men who paid the price for it. Whether or not you believe Gerry and Giuseppe were guilty of the Guilford Bomb is not the case in the film as it's more about the characters and there trials and tribulations.One film that will always be remembered in my mind about making a difference with your life not matter where you are in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Name of the Father and the Truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Sheridan's astonishingly fantastic 'In the Name of the Father' tells the brutally direct story of a wrongfully accused family who are tortured into making a false confession and imprisoned by the British justice system. Sheridan has a way of telling his stories where he gets straight to the point and does not fear to show the reality of the situation while keeping us viewers at the edge of our seats. The film is based on Gerry Conlan's autobiography where Daniel Day-Lewis plays the central character. Sheridan effectively portrays Gerry and Giuseppe's struggle and fight against injustice and his portrayal of the corrupt British justice system is frightening. Just the idea that people could get away with such things in a country like the UK is chilling and Sheridan skillfully brings that across on screen. Terry George's brilliant screenplay with rich characters and solid dialogues forms a good backbone for the film. I also liked how the humour was infused in a modest dose as not to interfere with the intensity of the story. There are some excellent performances. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a suitably explosive performance as he breathes fire into the role while Pete Postlethwaite is sublime and equally outstanding as Gerry's father, Giuseppe. Though father and son do have issues to fight over, it is Giuseppe who is Gerry's conscience and Postlethwaite's heartbreaking act really touches the heart. Emma Thompson holds her own and she is simply excellent. The rest of the cast do a superb job (watch out for Tom Wilkinson in a bit role). The soundtrack fits the mood of the film and the cinematography is good, especially in the prison sequences, where it creates that feeling of claustrophobia which gets stronger after Gerry is alone in his cell. I have liked all of Sheridan's ' films that I have seen so far and 'In The Name Of The Father' is another remarkable film from this fine director. It is a difficult movie to watch due to some disturbing themes and scenes (though most of them are rather suggestive it is the idea behind that sends chills down the spine) but it is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Name of the Father- and of the Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although considerable liberties have been taken with historical facts, this film is based upon true events. In 1974 an IRA bomb in a pub in Guildford, England, killed several people. Four young Irish people ("the Guildford Four") were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Several others ("the Maguire Seven") were convicted of assisting them and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. All were innocent of this crime, and were later exonerated and released from prison when fresh evidence was discovered, particularly evidence that their confessions had been obtained under duress.Although all the main characters are Catholics, some devout, some only nominally so, the title does not have any real religious significance. Rather, it alludes to the film's central relationship, that between Gerry Conlon, one of the "Four" and his father Giuseppe, one of the "Seven". The two are very different. Gerry is a wild and rebellious young man, unemployed, a petty criminal and a drug-user. He wears his hair long, something fashionable in the early seventies but often regarded by the older generation as the sign of a hooligan. Giuseppe, by contrast, is a conservative figure; deeply religious, hard-working, law-abiding and honest.A key moment comes when Gerry recalls a football match in which he played as a boy. His team won, but instead of congratulating him on his victory, Giuseppe reproached his son for a foul committed during the match. This encapsulates the difference in their characters. For Gerry, winning and success are all that matters. Because he has achieved little success, he has no faith in himself and has always drifted through life. For Giuseppe, adherence to moral values is more important than achieving outward success, and it is these values which enable him to retain his self-respect. Because of these differences in character and outlook, the two men's relationship is a difficult one. Beneath their differences, however, they also have a deep love for one another; Gerry is persuaded to confess to the bombing, after the police have failed to obtain a confession through bullying and violence, by the threat that his father will be killed if he does not. Later, Gerry's love for his father is strengthened by the realisation that although the older man is physically frail, his religious faith and self-belief enable him to cope with the injustice of his plight.Daniel Day-Lewis has been much praised for his performance as Gerry, and he was certainly good, if at times too showy. For me, however, the real star was Pete Postlethwaite as the long-suffering but dignified Giuseppe. The strongest scenes were those between Gerry and Giuseppe; the weakest were those when Gerry, in prison, befriends Joe McAndrew, an IRA man who claims actually to have planted the Guildford bomb. McAndrew is an invented character, and psychologically this did not seem likely; Gerry was, after all, as much a victim of the bomb as those killed and injured by it. Had there been no bomb, there could have been no conviction, wrongful or otherwise, for planting it. Moreover, by associating himself with the IRA's cause, even temporarily, Gerry, although legally innocent, makes himself seem morally guilty.There were other things that did not ring true. I was unsure why Giuseppe's lawyer thought that Inspector Dixon, the policeman who originally investigated the crime, would be responsible for deciding whether her ailing client should receive compassionate parole, or why so much attention was paid to Gerry's alibi that he was in London on the night of the bombing. As the bomb would have had a delayed-action timer, he could easily have returned before it exploded; the "Horse and Groom" pub (I used to live in Guildford) is only a short walk from the station, about half an hour by train from London. (The brutal and corrupt Dixon is another invented character; the name may refer ironically to the popular British TV show, "Dixon of Dock Green", which featured an honest and decent "bobby" named Dixon).It surprises me that some have criticised the film as being "pro-IRA". If one were setting out to make a pro-IRA propaganda film, one would not make it about the Guildford bombing, an event in which the IRA cold-bloodedly murdered several innocent civilians without warning. Nor does the film ignore the IRA's violence towards the Irish Catholic community it supposedly represents. At the time of the Guildford bombing, Gerry is living in London, having been forced to flee Northern Ireland by IRA threats; like most terrorist organisations it has a sternly moralistic attitude to all crimes other than those committed by its own members and punishes with mediaeval severity those who, like Gerry, are guilty of petty larcenies. The fact that the "Four" and the "Seven" were undoubtedly treated unjustly by the British authorities does not retrospectively justify the IRA's crimes of which they were wrongly accused.The film does not attempt to be a comprehensive statement about the Northern Ireland situation- the Unionist community, for example, is not even mentioned. Indeed, given the complexities of that situation, and the even greater complexities of Irish history from which it springs, it would not be possible to make such a statement in a film. Nevertheless, "In the Name of the Father" is a very good film, both as a study of father-son relationships and as a warning of the possibilities for injustice inherent in any criminal justice system. 7/10 A goof. In the early scenes, set in 1974, Gerry, while driving along London's Lower Thames Street passes a set of orange and white barriers designed to stop vehicles from entering "The City" (London's central financial district). These barriers did not exist in 1974; they were erected following a later IRA bombing campaign</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrorism hurts everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In watching this fine film, on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.In watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'In the Name of the Father': a moving masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'In the Name of the Father' is a compelling portrayal of the harrowing ordeal faced by Gerry Conlon, his family and friends, who were wrongfully imprisoned for the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970s. The film is skilfully manipulated to show a myriad of contrasts and juxtapositions, such as when Gerry is being tortured and interrogated in his cell, the police in the hallway are unconcerned as they celebrate someone's birthday with a cake.The framing of shots and camera angles used emphasise the helplessness Gerry and the others experience. There is also a particularly moving scene in which prisoners show their respect when Gerry's father dies by dropping flaming material from their windows, like a waterfall of burning tears.The soundtrack uses music which is carefree or haunting in all the right places, perfectly mirroring the scenes and adding to the mood of the film. The themes of injustice and corruption are heightened through irony in the dialogue, and are representative of the problems faced by Irish Catholics in the 1970s and beyond.'In the Name of the Father' is a beautifully constructed film which is a credit to the actors, direction and production crew.I challenge you not to be moved by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not see this film as being political nonsense at all.Rather it serves as a warning of what can happen when blanket stereotyping is allowed to influence the course of justice.As Gareth Peirce (impressively portrayed by the excellent Emma Thompson) points out, the only reason Giueseppe Conlon and Co were tried in the first place was on the shaky premise that "they were bloody well Irish". As Irish people living in England in the 1970s, they must therefore have been terrorists.Logical?I thought not.The authorities never thought for a second that they might actually have been trying to escape that nonsense through carving out a new life for themselves in England.With a British public baying for blood, the police capitulated by picking up the first "paddies" they found and making an example of them, without making any serious efforts to root out the real perpetrators and ensuring they were rendered incapable of causing more harm through doling out lengthy imprisonments to them, as opposed to ruining the lives of an innocent family.Ironically of course such actions could well have served to make terrorist sympathisers out of the Conlons through the horrific treatment meted out to them!It didn't of course but there is always the danger in that type of case that a person could become embittered to that extent.Obviously given the unstable climate of the time Irish people in England were sometimes regarded with suspicion,yet the fact remains that the events portrayed in the film were unacceptable in a supposed western democracy committed to the rule of law.While neither side was entirely innocent the fact remains that England was undeniably culpable in this instance, and the judiciary involved in the case must bear full responsibilty for the devestating effects of their knee-jerk ruling, given to appease an irrational and hysterical public.In this respect the Conlons and Co can viably be seen by some as "Irish martyrs". While I am no fan of Hollywood fare which seeks to glamourise Irish terrorists at the expense of England who is invariably portrayed as the cold and unrelenting oppressor (inaccurate and unfair in the present day I feel) I strongly believe that in this case the criticism and negative portrayal of the English legal system is justified to a considerable extent.The film has especial resonance and significance for us today in the wake of al-Quaeda and the resultant perceptions of Muslims as a whole as being "the enemy" in certain quarters.The recent incarceration of an innocent Syrian who had lived his entire adult life in Canada, and who was imprisoned purely on the basis of his ethnicity, only serves to remind us of the perils of "judging a book by its cover" and making snap judgements, a danger which is admirably illustrated in this well-acted film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I thought it was more about the crimes committed by IRA during the "hot" period, a sort of documentary. IRA plays indeed an important rule in the events, but the main thing is that this movie is the true story of a family that has been destroyed by the madness of the time, by the need of a scapegoat to pay for all the crimes that were committed. Very well directed. A very famous prison in Dublin, that had an important rules during the independence from England, has been chosen as setting. Watch it, you will be satisfied!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:)Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling "hang these Irish bastards", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said "I wonder why you are not charged as treason". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted.But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are "in the business". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying "silence is the most terrifying weapon". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful story with one of the best performances of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An emotionally wrenching and immensely powerful true story of an innocent man who is put in prison for fifteen years, after being forced by interrogators to sign a confession out of the threat that they'd kill his father if he didn't, and this man's fight to clear his name and his father's. Due to an incident with the IRA, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast, coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend, who was with him that night, Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four, these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and, after painful torture, the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). Gerry has to deal with pent-up aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.Even after Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and confesses to the police that he was behind the Guildford bombing and the people they have in prison were innocent, Gerry and Giuseppe remain in prison suffering more and more by the day. Eventually Giuseppe begins working with Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) to investigate their case and prove the innocence of the Conlons and the other members of the Guildford Four. After Giuseppe dies of natural causes, Gerry gains a new drive to prove their innocence and takes over the task of working with Gareth. The film is a powerful character study of a man put under unimaginable circumstances and has the discipline to rise up and, along with Pierce, prove the innocence of not only himself but of his father and the other three members of the Guildford Four. It's an immensely heart-wrenching, emotional story that had me in tears several times throughout.Highlighting this sensational film is Daniel Day-Lewis who further proves that he is the greatest actor of all time and delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career. Taking on the role of Gerry Conlon requires the ability to subtly flow from a naive, immature young man to a disciplined adult working to clear the name of his father. Along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying the man, but Day-Lewis brings a power to Conlon that no one else could. His brilliance is unparalleled. Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among the best of the 90s. In the Name of the Father is a phenomenal film that studies the torture that one man had to go through due to the government and the journey he took to clear his name and the name of his father. It's the best film of 1993, in my eyes and Day-Lewis' portrayal is very high among the best performances of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible father and son story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford, England. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard, Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle, it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth. The final court case is theatrical as heck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie. But it's a good movie, not a great one. And I don't even think it has intentions of being it, but rather making a statement on the Northern Ireland conflict, about the UK, and about democratic legal system's as a whole. And above all, it wants to make Gerry Conlon's story reach a wider audience. I seriously cannot believe what happened to him, it's completely outrageous and it really makes you think about the whole idea of Justice, judges, juries, laws, police and so on. Besides the story, which is good (and even better when you keep in the back of your mind that it really happened), the best of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting. He is probably the best living actor, I'd dare to say. Since it's the earliest movie I've seen of him, I seriously thought that he's actually Irish and that only later he learned to do other accents. Man, he really sounds Irish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson).The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Name of the Father" is a dramatization of the infamy committed to "Guildford four" unjustly accused of planting a bomb in a bar near London, and falsely declare them as elite terrorist Irish Republican Army.Is one of the most potent and exciting films of recent years. It is political denunciation film by Jim Sheridan with strength and courage, and above all with sweeping cinematic sense. There are films of social criticism or political very brave, but cinematically poverty are extraordinary. Jim Sheridan, however, do not forget at any time you're doing film and uses all its resources in a masterful way. You are holding a very rich history and complex, which addresses many issues and each touch that gives the best comes.In this brilliant film by Jim Sheridan, once again collaborates with award-winning Daniel Day-Lewis, four years after the also excellent drama My Left Foot (1989). The pair will meet for the third time a few years later in The Boxer (1997).With a screenplay adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan, based on the book "Proved Innocent" written by the defendant himself Gerry Conlon, the movie deals with the troubled relationship between this father-son (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postelthwaite) two Irishmen, coming from the hit Belfast in the midst of war between the British army and the IRA guerrilla group.Sequences like the one that opens the film, and that other prisoners in the burning paper thrown through the windows of their cells, or the final judgment, are a marvel of strength and mounting tension, and makes a splendid Jim Sheridan film director .This would not be the same without the help of an extraordinary cast, with the great Daniel Day Lewis, seconded by the extraordinary and moving Pete Postlewhite a brief but intense and Emma Thompson. By dropping a great music selection, we are certainly at one of the most successful films of recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent drama with a very strong charismatic performance by Daniel Day Lewis who plays Gerry Conlon, an unemployed drifter. It starts in Northern Ireland and moves onto London where Gerry gets involved with another group of itinerants. He is then falsely arrested for the bombing of an English pub by the IRA, where a number of people are killed and maimed. He is sentenced to a long prison term erroneously, along with his father. It is all part of a nefarious plot by the British government to incarcerate any suspect to keep the British population content that something is being done about the bombings.Daniel Day-Lewis plays a complex character who is not entirely likable, but we do commiserate with his plight. At over 2 hours the movie never slows down. It's has tremendous conflict at all levels ? in Ireland, the courtroom, the prison and the usual family father-son rivalries. It's based on a true story, but I have no idea regarding its authenticity. Highly recommended; particularly for those who love courtroom- prison dramas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will stir your soul and disturb you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1974 a London pub in the town of Guildford was hit by I.R.A. activists with a terrorists bomb, and no warning was given. Five people were killed and several others maimed and injured in a tragedy which sent shock waves through a then terrified and outraged public who demanded police bring the culprits to justice.Director and co-writer Jim Sheridan (scripting with Terry George) brings us the story of a group of young people from Ireland who were brought forward by police to face the charges of murder that related to the bombing. They were unceremoniously tried and found guilty, then sentenced to between fifteen years and life. Pleading their innocence to an unsympathetic jury and public had got them nowhere, so they were left to fight for their freedom from the inside.As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive.Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, "In the Name of the Father" is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you. It is truly frightening what men in power are capable of, and even more frightening are the devastating effects they can have on so many people's lives.Saturday, June 18, 1994 - Greater Union MelbourneDirector Jim Sheridan's account of one of the most ruthless bombings undertaken by the IRA is jam-packed with emotion. The tragic, moving story of how the "Guildford Four" lost their freedom, and fifteen years of their lives, for something they were never a part of makes for a most upsetting and aggravating film.The powerhouse performances from leads Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are sensational, as is Emma Thompson's showing as compassionate lawyer Gareth Pierce.Not seeing this film would almost be as grave an injustice as was that which befell these innocent people.Monday, June 12, 1995 - Video</fullReview>

Regardless, the acts of a mindless few doesn't ever justify the gross abuse of power seen and portrayed in this film.The British who view it can't help but be appalled at the behaviour of their own because we do pride ourselves on having a fair and balanced legal system. The Irish who view it can't help but applaud the rare nature of a film making a stand from their side.But one side shouldn't attack the other over opinions on a film such as this; neither the British for the inaccuracies or the Irish for the Brits apparent refusal to accept something very wrong was done in our name.

		<fullReview>In 1974 the Irish Republican Army bombed two public houses in Guildford, England-The Horse &amp; Groom and the Seven Stars. 5 people were killed and 65 people were seriously injured. During the wave of public hatred for all things Irish, the police round up Belfast rogue Gerry Conlon and his mate Paul Hill and interrogate for 7 days with brute force to obtain a confession... This is Gerry Conlon &amp; the Guildford 4's story.This is real powerful stuff that thankfully is directed with careful hands. Director Jim Sheridan is equal in his demonizing of the police and the IRA here because it's crucial for us to focus on the Guildford 4. Focus on the Conlon family, for they are victims of injustice when they have no political, or nationalistic affiliations. He centres in on the relationship between Gerry &amp; his father Guiseppe as they find themselves both wrongly imprisoned. It's that family heartbeat that drives this film on, and it's testament to the makers talents that it never comes across as maudlin, it's all very potent and is the films major axis point.Based on a true story the picture has a finale that will not surprise anyone, but come the last reel you feel emotionally drained, you have come thru the mangler, and myself personally felt both joy and anger in equal measure. Containing brilliant performances from Pete Postelthwaite &amp; Daniel Day Lewis as father &amp; son Conlon respectively, In The Name of The Father is a truly great film that demands not only your head, but also your heart. 9/10</fullReview>

In the Oscars 1994, "In the name of the Father" was nominated to 7 Academy Awards, but it didn't won any of them. Most of them won "Schindler's List" which is also a good movie, but "In the Name of the Father" is better and deserved the Oscar for best picture.

The visuals are also great thing to see. The early Belfast depiction is something very attention grabbing. I watched '71 some time ago and now know where does the movie get their inspiration to depict the Belfast chaos. The acting overall is also a great job. Daniel Day-Lewis did great in portraying the character's personality and the changes happened through the fifteen years. Emma Thomson did well enough through her relatively short screen time.

Daniel Day- Lewis is a phenomenal actor and this one really made him shine. He was so convincing and played the role so well. He made me feel everything he did. It was like I was in the situation with him. When the man said he was going to kill Gerry's daughter, the face of terror and helplessness struck me so hard. The acting in this movie is what really sold me for it. The story is so sad and heart breaking as well. The fact that this actually happened to Gerry Conlon's family is so sad. They had the prime of their lives taken from them. His daughter went to jail at 17 and came out at 32!! That is so screwed up. They took everything from them, just to blame someone for this crime. Even when they caught the real criminals! This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. Yes, they left out big chunks but as a movie, Jim Sheridan did an excellent job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never knew how good Daniel day Lewis was , perhaps never knew who he was until I actually saw this movie , I remember watching Gangs of new York but I never knew it was him who played this role. I was sailing when I got this DVD , I dint have anything else to watch so I just played it to get my free time handled,I was totally blown when I was halfway through the movie,It starts with Daniel day Lewis playing as Gerry being this carefree guy and living life to the fullest, but something happens and he gets arrested ,till here the story was just normal ,but at a critical point there comes a person in the prison unexpectedly who changes his life forever. The great thing about this movie is that although he stays inside those 4 corners behind those bars ,he attains the wisdom which we look for throughout our life traveling around the world. The movie gives you a boost if you are looking for one , and there is some magic in this movie , which keeps you just craving for more even the movie finishes, I re-watched this movie a couple of times , especially certain scenes , and trust me this helped my sail.Watch out for Danny you are definitely being his fan after watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courtroom Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Courtroom drama's are always prime for great cinema. In the Name of the Father is no different. It shouldn't come as any surprise with Daniel Day-Lewis as the lead, and he is incredible as Gerry Conlon, a wrongfully convicted terrorist in 1970's London. I have to admit I didn't know much about the bombings upon viewing, so this whole story came as a shock to me. But the film is a really good eye opener and reminder that no one is guilty until proved innocent, and then some.Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were both nominated for supporting roles and they really do carry this film. I would almost say more so than Day-Lewis. I knew he would give a killer performance but i didn't know the other two had this in them, especially Postlethwaite. The film also closely deals with the relationship between Gerry and his father. The many ups and downs they go through as a result of being in a jail for so many years. Gerry is a scoundrel at best towards the beginning. They show him stealing right off the bat to give us the impression that this may be a character you may not be able to trust. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I could trust him up until he was being beaten by the detectives to sign the confession.I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the direction to begin the film. Jim Sheridan had a knack for choppy directing early on that was hard to follow. But once the film settles in and gets going as a true courtroom genre, the film takes off. I also like that the film tackles the issue of non-violent vs. violent protests and tactics in a fair way. It isn't clear to me that the filmmakers believe one way or the other is the way to go. And I think that's the right way to go about it. +All the performances+Tension built in the court-Choppy directing to start8.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliantly written, Perfectly casted! Let's not talk about the movie and focus on the amazing acting of Daniel day Louis. I strongly believe that he is the best living actor. His Irish accent on this movie makes you swear he is an Irish man! Actually, his insane method of acting lead to the 5 Oscar nominees. loved how he amazingly play the role. I truly recommend everyone to watch this movie and all Daniel's movies, to see how the real acting should be! In my opinion, The best scene of this movie was the interrogation scene where he been under a lot of pressure. This scene reflect how emotions toward his father he hold! Finally, Daniel Day Lewis movies deserve watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a son, a father, and the damning of the Irish (or any damned group)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie In the Name of the Father, we get a story involving injustice - people who are accused and found guilty of crimes they didn't commit - but why it works is centrally two things: even if you don't know a thing about the IRA (though it might help to know just a little) or the struggles in Belfast in the 1970's and how it involved the United Kingdom, people see injustice happening every day, with many races. If one were to put this on a double bill with the Burns doc The Central Park Five, the coincidences would be extraordinary: the rampant torture via police to the accused, the lack of any strong legal defense, and the tampering of evidence. There is that aspect, the US against THEM element, which is simple enough. But trickier, and what works greater, is the father son element of the story, where Daniel Day Lewis is Gerry Conlon is in prison for life along with his father (a very innocent man) Giuseppe, who is there for the simple reason of accused corroboration.In a way it's probably the most accessible film that has been made, that I can think of off the top of my head, about the controversies and "war" of the IRA over the years. I don't see Sheridan taking sides either way exactly with the IRA except for the fact of the killing innocent people, those "innocent bystanders" that die in that pub bombing, is very wrong. The context and framing of it is what counts; Conlon had no real political aspirations either way, and when we first see him, he's basically a young punk/hippie who gets chased by IRA guards as they think his stick is a sniper. He goes to London to cool off/find work/hang low, and it's actually in the scene where he first is going off - by the ship - that he and his father have the interaction that speaks to what will come: Giuseppe is a natural, loving father, maybe at worst a little awkward or 'normal', while Gerry is just a young, aimless youth, uncomfortable with any affection or care.The crime and arrest happen due to the sort of circumstances that happens with Wrong Man scenarios (not the Hitchcock sort, to be sure). The Wrong-Place-Wrong-Time thing, and it leads one of the most harrowing section of the film, where Conlon is interrogated. Day-Lewis here is explosive, charged, frightened, crying, under mental and physical abuse, but yet he keeps it all in check. Another actor might have gone over the top here, but somehow it always feels just right, calibrated even in the highly charged emotional range. Then he and the others are found guilty (oh darn that homeless alibi!) and sent off to prison.Apparently, according to Ebert's review, some facts were shuffled around to add to the drama - namely that the Conlon father/son shared a cell. Perhaps it is convenient dramatically speaking, and there's even a period in these years they're in there together, that Gerry spends less time with his dad, trying to escape through drugs and other (somehow friendly) prisoners. If there's one issue with this mid-section involving prison, it's that most everyone - with the exception perhaps until the other Irish man (no spoilers here) comes to prison - gets along and there's no real horror to go through. Maybe that's kind of refreshing in a sense, usually prison is shown in movies as a very rough place. If anything the political situation - the Conlons being innocent - makes it the most frenetic and harried for Gerry and his father.But, again, it's the tone of this personal side, just showing DDL and Postlethwaite together, that makes the film work so well. We may hope, and see it probably as conventional, that Gerry is set in these injustice-wheels and everything's spinning until he can get help (in the form here of Emma Thompson, in maybe the only one-dimensional role in the film, not that she is poor in any way acting-wise). But deep down, the bond between these two is what counts, and Gerry's own growth as a person is marked as he spends more time behind bars. So In the Name of the Father is successful on the fronts of what the story is about, but also how it's about it via its emotional stakes, especially in the third act when things become uncertain for the decent father. And if anything, as great as Lewis is (and that's a given, of course, look at his track record), Postlethwaite rises up to be his equal. In sort, an acting masters class in what is mostly a heavy film, with a lot of heart and (even once or twice, early on before the s*** goes down) a little light-heartedness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man (Daniel Day-Lewis)'s coerced confession to an IRA bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.This film is a great combination of history and court drama. Sometimes both mix very nicely (as with the Nuremberg trial) and sometimes they do not. Here, we get a nice glimpse at the IRA in Ireland without dwelling on it too much and also get the true story of a family that was wronged by the state for their alleged involvement in terror.Ireland today is not the same place it was a generation ago, but it is not so far removed that this story is "distant history" and not important. Heck, Americans should probably know more about it than what they pick up from a U2 song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In the Name of the Father" is a drama movie which is based on true events about a man who coerced confession about a bomb of an IRA bombing, but he did not do it. This had as a result the imprisonment of him and his father and also some other friends of him. An English lawyer fights to free them all and does whatever is possible to succeed this.I really liked this movie because it is based on true events and as a result I liked the plot of it. I also liked this movie because it shows the fight of man for the truth and what he has to do in order to be able to succeed this. What difficulties has to surpass and what emotions feel about these situations that he lives in. Daniel Day-Lewis who played as Gerry Conlon was simply outstanding in his role for one more time. In addition to this it has to being mentioned the interpretation of Pete Postlethwaite who played as the father of Gerry Conlon, Giuseppe Conlon and I believe that his interpretation gave a different view for everyone who watch this movie.Finally I have to say that "In the Name of the Father" is a must see movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone to watch. When you watch this movie I am sure that you will understand many things such the true meaning of a fight and what a person has to do not only for himself but also for his family, his friends and all the other world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many reviews before i watched the movie. After i finished it seemed like English people don't like this movie too much. At some point i understand them, but most of them tried to bring some historical "facts" and rumours to damage this movie. There were some others who was trying to catch some mistakes in the movie. The were saying things that doesn't change anything really, for instance: It doesn't really matter where Gerry and Hill met, it doesn't matter if they were at some time in some groups or how they have become the suspects. These things doesn't change the whole idea, but when you sometimes make movies you just have to make some changes. There were some other people who was trying to state they were not innocent, they did some other things, robbery and so on. They are wrong too, it doesn't matter what else they did in any other place. This movie is focusing on Guildford Bombing, this movie is focusing on people who ere jailed that have nothing to do with that bombing. So, they were innocent in this case. The stayed in prison for 15 years. That is very unfair and the such an embarrassing story for England. I am sorry, but it is. For my point of view this movie is underrated because of people who didn't like it. They rated this movie considering many other things that have nothing to do with this movie. When i rate movie, i only consider movie. This movie is well directed with great performances! I was not bored when i was watching the movie. This is all i can ask from movie.</fullReview>

Falsity everywhere lead to life in the prison. The movie is a fight to the end. The sentenced can either give in or make their lives worse. In life we are often faced with these sort of wrongs, errors that we have not committed but are accused of. The society around seems to fall for that lie. That traps us in a shell and we could loose our heads or never forget the truth of who we are. I'm from India and we have a long history of violence with our neighbor Pakistan. This could any of our stories. There have been innocent victims victimized by the government in both camps. I know after the 9/11 America ill treated harshly many Muslims and Indo Americans there. It is a crime that should not happened. An innocent man's freedom cannot be taken away when he or she is not at fault. They are falsely bludgeoning the Juice of life. The Freedom is a man's birthright. I hope justice prevails and the corrupt governments and officials day in misery reaches them. Fantastic tale of putting up a fight when the odds are stacked to the end of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting depiction of historical injustice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Led by magnificent acting performances and great direction, In the Name of the Father offers the audience a terrific reenactment of one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in the history of Britain, as it portrays the story of Gerry Conlon and his father, and the false accusations made against them in regards to the Guildford pub bombings in 1974. By exploring a very controversial issue, this enthralling drama proves to be a very eye-opening and thought provoking viewing experience, one that is both politically and morally charged. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give extremely passionate performances, as they serve as the centerpiece for a film that strikes a strong balance between exploring the estranged father-son relationship and the surrounding political issues. In the Name of the Father therefore proves thoroughly engaging, as it has perpetual motion, both due to its powerful story, but also due to the excellent filmmaking techniques that are one display.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Name of the Father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This was indeed a great movie. Amen for that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Jim Sheridan, this biographical film based on the autobiography, 'Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four' by Gerry Conlon. The movie focus on the Gerry Conlon's memoir of his imprisonment in England, for a crime, he didn't commit. In the film, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a trouble young man who would rather explore free love and dope than get a real job. After Gerry Conlon get in deep trouble in Belfast for stripping lead from roofs of houses and causing a riot with British security forces. Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), saves him from IRA punishment, by sending off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. While, at London, an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 74, and Gerry Conlon find himself, prime suspect in the crime. Soon the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary arrest both, Gerry and Giuseppe. After being torture and threated, both agree to sign a confession to a crime, they didn't commit. After years of being mistreat in prison, Gerry finally grew up from bitter son who rails against his father's wishes, to fight for justice for himself, his father and those, whom were wrongly convicted when he discovers who the real perpetrator of the bombing are. With help with Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer, Gerry try to overturn the falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA's Guildford pub bombings. Will he triumph and gain his freedom or will he fail? Watch it, to find out. Even, so, the film is pretty predictable on the ending outcome, but that's not the main reason, not to watch this movie. You should watch it, to get a true understanding of the thought of being forced to live in a prison like that for seventeen years, accused of a crime, you had no part of. It made my stomach turn and I wept. In the climate of near-hysteria, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed, allowing the UK police to interrogate suspects for up to seven days without bringing charges or allowing access to an attorney. Americans like myself should watch it, because a similar Act was passed here, after Sept. 11, 2001. Both acts are not right, and need to review. If this movie doesn't raise your blood pressure over the miscarriage of justice, the arrogance of leadership and the need for each individual to judge according to their conscience and not their prejudices, nothing will. Another reason is because the film really work on being a gripping drama between the relationship of father and son. The movie took some liberties by showing the father/son relationship enhanced by sharing a cell in prison, which they never did in real life. I was immediately drawn into the story by Daniel Day-Lewis' as well, as Pete Postletwaite performances in both legal and personal perspectives. Both are great in this film giving the audience emotional depth. The language is a bit harsh in this movie, lot of cursing, but understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea. Some people might not like this movie due to its over impartially case that Britain misrules Northern Ireland, violates Irish civil rights and knowingly compromises its own legal system. I study a lot about the Troubles between England and Northern Ireland, but I really doubt every Englishman is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot. It might be a bit over exaggeration. Though some minor facts were changed, some the major 'facts' are just not real. Example like the crucial character of Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), an IRA man who might had something to do with the bombings is just a fictional character. Still, what remains as truth is gut wrenching when you think about it. Given the subject matter, the film was still well received in protestant areas of Ireland and in England. The film does shows that English public attitudes turned into a highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for these atrocities nor does the film make the IRA terrorists look like heroes. It is a bit frustrating that people take what the film tells them as fact, but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of people's political beliefs or the idea that the film might be a bit political bias. The film is a good movie that never really tip over into slushiness or being over preaching or ranting. The music soundtrack is amazing to hear. I love Bono and Gavin Friday "In the Name of the Father". Epic and beautiful. Another great song is 'You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart" performed by Sinead O' Connor. Quite inspiring. Overall, I thought this film was fascinating to watch. While the troubles are now over with 1998's Good Friday Agreement. I think the film is still very important to watch in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder if our government is or had jail innocent people. Hands down, a politically and emotionally charged issue such as that, is needed to be question. In the Name of the Father shows a good example of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few times have I felt such injustice portrayed in a film with such a pay off since Stanley Kubrik's Paths of Glory. This film is perfectly put together and establishes said portrayal of injustice from the get-go.The film follows Paul Micheal Hall played by Daniel Day Lewis who was wrongly sentenced for 'The Guildford Bombings' of 1974. This film shows him and his father from their time in Belfast to their prison sentence. Daniel Day Lewis gives an unsurprisingly good performance but the crown goes to Pete Postlethwaite in his role as Patrick "Giuseppe" Conlon, Paul's father. This is an easy film to compare to Shawshank Redemption which is at the top of the IMDb's top 250 and I think anybody who has loved that film should check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More proof that Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't understand your language. "Justice." "Mercy." "Clemency." I literally don't understand what those words mean."If I had to describe this film using only one adjective I would say it is an enraging movie. Jim Sheridan followed his successful directorial debut, My Left Foot, by teaming up once again with Daniel Day Lewis who delivers yet another superb performance. I'm ashamed to admit that I just got around to watching this film for the first time on its 20th anniversary, but it was completely worth it because I was blown away by this powerful and engaging film. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking film because we've had plenty of movies dealing with similar themes. Films like The Hurricane or The Shawshank Redemption deal with the kind of social injustice that is presented here where an innocent man is incarcerated due to a corrupt justice system. In the Name of the Father differs a bit in that it doesn't focus so much on the hope of finding freedom, but rather on the enraging aspect of the injustice that the lead character and his family and friends go through. This is a genre that I'll always be drawn too, especially when it is based on a true story because I think these people deserve to have their voice heard after all they've gone through. I know that several artistic liberties were taken to make the film, but even so it draws attention to Gerry Conlon's autobiographical book. Sheridan's direction was solid, and I liked how he focused a lot of the attention on the father and son relationship. I don't know if this film would've worked as well as it did if it weren't for Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of our time.Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) grew up in Belfast in the 70's when the IRA terrorist attacks were at its peak. He was never involved with the terrorist group, but he was no saint either. As a young lad he felt forced to become a small time thief due to the lack of employment. While robbing some lead sheets from a roof of a house he accidentally leads British soldiers to a home that was hiding IRA weapons. Fortunately they never discovered anything, and the IRA members send Gerry off with a warning. His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), with whom he's had an estranged relationship, sends him to London hoping he can find a better future there and escape from all the political turmoil. On his way to London, Gerry runs into his school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) and together they decide to go visit their friend Patrick Armstrong (Mark Sheppard) who has been living in London along with a group of free spirited hippies. Unfortunately for Gerry and his friends, they end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and are accused of bombing a soldier's pub. Bullied by the police officers they are forced into signing a confession and are sentenced to prison along with some of Gerry's family members. In prison, Gerry and his father continue to fight to prove their innocence with the help of an attorney named Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) and the more she digs into the story the more corruption she finds in the police procedures.The film manages to draw you in and make your blood boil due to all the injustices suffered by these characters. It is one of those movies where the tension builds up with the passing of time, but at the same time you also feel a connection growing between Gerry and his father. The film becomes more than a simple social injustice tale and turns into a character driven story focusing on the relationship between father and son. It is a shame the film has kind of been forgotten because I thought it was really well made. It never won an Academy Award, but it did receive 7 nominations including Best Picture, losing out to Schindler's List that year. Daniel Day Lewis outshines everyone in this film, although the supporting cast was very strong, especially Pete Postlethwaite who shared great chemistry with Lewis. This was an intense film that had me at the edge of my seat thanks to the way in which Sheridan tells the story and slowly draws the viewer in. The final 20 minutes of this film are perfect and Daniel Day Lewis knocks his performance out of the ball park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Sheridan's Finest Feature. One of Daniel Day-Lewis' Finest Performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the true events surrounding the IRA bombing of 1974 in England, In the Name of the Father tells the story of Gerry Conlon; a small time thief who, along with his friends, is falsely accused of committing the heinous crime &amp; after being coerced into confessing guilty by the British police during the brutal interrogation is sentenced to prison life along with his father who is also implicated in the crime during the trial. The story covers 15 years of Conlon's wrongful imprisonment during which he tries to prove his innocence with the help of a British attorney.This is the 2nd collaboration between Jim Sheridan &amp; Daniel Day-Lewis after My Left Foot and presents Sheridan in complete control of his craftsmanship &amp; Day-Lewis at the top of his game. The real-life character of Gerry Conlon is magnificently brought to life by Day-Lewis &amp; he was simply at his best during the interrogation scene, making it the film's most intense sequence. Also, the scenes between Gerry &amp; his father, played amazingly well by Pete Postlethwaite, are its finest moments and the two shared an amazing chemistry together.On an overall scale, In the Name of the Father is one of those films that leaves little to complain about and is a brilliantly directed, deftly written, tightly edited, strongly performed &amp; elegantly composed cinema that also features best works in the directional career of Jim Sheridan &amp; acting career of Pete Postlethwaite. Daniel Day-Lewis' contribution here often gets overlooked but, in my opinion, it's right there amongst his finest performances. All in all, In the Name of the Father is one of the best films of its year and is a must watch for anyone who appreciates great cinema. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Name of Respect, Dignity and Truth ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "My Left Foot", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through "In the Name of the Father", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation."In the Name of the Father", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment.Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect.Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with "My Left Foot" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. "In the Name of the Father" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature "The Godfather", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty horrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Name of the Father tells a pretty horrifying tale of several people who were wrongly accused of the Guildford bombings. It's admirably written and directed, and there's enough here to allow you to really feel for the characters involved. As it is, it strongly reminds me A Cry in the Dark, another similar biographical film about an unfortunate turn of events starring Meryl Streep. Both films work as much as they do because of their central performances, in this case Daniel Day Lewis, who is truly fantastic. Ultimately, this is an effective film that is worthy of a viewing, although I don't think it's overall as effective as A Cry in the Dark, if maybe for obvious reasons of the tragedy in the latter being worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very sad and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a keeper, it is indeed one of the best films I have ever seem. It is in my top 50 favorite films and I think it will always remain there. Set in the British Islands in the 1970's, this film shows clearly how complicated was the situation of the poorer folks from Ireland relative to the rest of the Islands and how they suffered extreme prejudice from their ethnic background. Which I would think is rather absurd considering that the main way of differentiating an Irishman from an Englishman is the accent.There are some minor flaws in the film, however, but it doesn't detract from the viewing experience.Overall, a very touching film and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>was a very good story, represented</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline in this movie, was a very human, and rare, depiction, of real-life immaturity. Which is the true cause for a lot of pride fueled hate in the world. And, Daniels character, throughout the beginning of the film, hurt himself, and his father, along with the rest of the people he knew, by simply being selfish and immature. As I said, a real character flaw in a lot of people in the world. He refused to see, that the people, he thought were "in the right", would use him too, in the struggle for power. And, while imprisoned, his maturity grew. Sadly at the cost of his father. He saw that it was only about a power struggle from the 2 sides. And, finally realized, his father and him had nothing to do with it. And his father who would fight for his son, and family. Not for the glory of power. But the love of his family. Was truly, the strongest person, around him. Daniel Day, was awesome in this movie, for portraying, a stubborn immature, character, who completely matured, albeit, very late. He discovers what really matters to him the most. But, hey, Thats the evil of pride, for you. It isn't a sin for nothing. for the record, i'm not religious at all, but, the seven deadly sins, hold a lot of truth, I found this movie on a tape. Seeing that a good actor, was in it. I decided to watch it. And it surprised me. Even when lewis character made really unthoughtful choices. It still felt real to me.

		<shortDescription>Great performances, powerful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny how you can watch a whole bunch of movies, trying to learn more about film-making and how shots are constructed, how characters are developed, how music should be used and then all of a sudden a movie comes along and you find yourself drawn into its story and easily forgetting to pay attention to all of technical aspects. When it comes to In the Name of the Father, it was like being reminded of how powerful a performance could be and how films can truly reach into your heart and affect you.I don't know what makes Daniel Day-Lewis' performance so effective but I thought it was very much so. I think great film is often about capturing the great things that already exist in the world, not so much about creating a great work of art but recognising something that you find beautiful or simply interesting and sharing it with an audience. Perhaps the reason Day-Lewis' performance is so good is that he is so "naked" as an actor (as they say). I have a feeling this is probably some well known concept in film that critics rarely talk about because everyone understands it (except me). Oh well.I also though Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were excellent as well, one gets the impression that everyone that worked on the film truly believed in it. As for the story, I have no idea how close it is to the truth but to some degree I don't think it matters. What matters is that it manages to engage and affect you, hence inspiring you to learn more about the actual events for yourself. I don't think films should have to be about capturing or creating realism only, by exploring fantasies you can make things more personal as well as achieve greater depth (I believe) hence expressing more than you could otherwise. This probably has little to do with this film in particular but as Roger Ebert has said (roughly), movies should be about emotions and ideas not facts.So, I think what makes In the Name of the Father so effective is that its a personal film with a very talented cast, a good story and a director that knows how to let the magic happen. Or something. I think that's an extremely vague and general statement but hey, I don't want to spoil the details of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant commentary that is 100% relevant today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an exceptional movie, and a deeply political one. Not just for its discussion of Northern Ireland, but the very poignant statements it makes about torture, about the death penalty, and indeed about any system of justice that prioritizes attaining a confession of guilt.More than a decade since the film came out, all of these issues are highly relevant in, for example, the United States today.Guantanamo Bay, anyone? As this film makes clear, there is no justification for the torture of political prisoners (or indeed, anyone else for that matter).The Death Penalty? Had the UK permitted the death penalty for this sort of crime, the Guildford Four would almost certainly have been executed (both the film and the contemporaneous accounts of the case indicate this). There can be no justification for capital punishment, under any circumstances. Guilt is never 100% certain, even when accompanied by a confession.It's rare that a film makes compelling, timeless political statements, and rarer still to do so in the context of telling a great story. The story of Gerry Conlon, and the rest of the Guildford Four, needs to be told and retold. Especially in times when people are willing to sacrifice human freedoms and fundamental rights in the hopes of attaining a false sense of "security."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tremendous film. Tremendously underrated. When I talk to my peers about "In the name of the Father" I often get, "what?" It's truly a shame. Yes, the movie is a older now, but it's a classic film about injustice and political oppression. And Dainel Day-Lewis, wow. It's my understanding that he lost out to Tom Hanks for Best Actor, which is unfortunate. Not to take away from Hanks, but because this is an absolutely amazing performance. He shines as Gerry Conlon, a man wrongfully convicted for a brutal crime. This is one of those rare films that allows you to feel the pain of injustice. I'm not Irish. I'm not English, and I wasn't even born when Gerry was convicted, yet I can feel as if I was there. I was in that prison with him with this movie. Also Emma Thompson, what an inspiration. She's the knight in shining armor in this movie, and she really makes you like defense attorneys.Watch this movie. Enjoy it. It deserves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you avoided this film or put it on the back burner because you thought it would be standard or simply just a people-pleasing, fairly dull drama that would maybe be the kind that would be shown in school because of its cultural value, then just see it for yourself. It's incredibly well- made, it's fast-paced, brilliantly acted, and very passionate and interesting.Standing out in the stunningly engrossing cast are Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson, who are both always wonderfully appealing, and though I'm not sure I'll ever see Day-Lewis in any performance that surpasses the magnetism and captivating charm of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York, he wows here, conveying such a deeply felt character. Thompson, whom I just recently re-watched in Primary Colors as an entirely different character, proves herself a true chameleon, completely taking all forms of her role.It isn't approached from the angle of structuring the story the generally most appealing way, even though it seems like it, intercutting flashbacks with the present and such. It simply follows the characters through their own arcs, and the film becomes the most interesting and engaging film I've seen in weeks. The hardships they endure, the conflicts that fall into their laps, the drama that ensues, and the prospect of justice are all just so absorbing that you have to see it to believe it.

		<shortDescription>Amazing View of The Troubles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Totally Surprising. Not at all what I expected from the subject and previews. It could have been a clichd exploitation of a complicated horrible situation, but rather is exceptionally subtle, nuanced and original, and therefore, very powerful. Some people comment that it plays a little loose with facts, some of which are not so minor. That the film makes no mention of Gerry Conlon's possible, if doubtful, ties to the IRA does change things a bit. Including that info would only have made the film better, more subtle. But its omission does help us to see Gerry Conlon as unjustly accused, tortured and convicted, avoiding the distraction of our suspecting him a criminal terrorist. Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are riveting as living, breathing, flesh and blood characters, almost bigger and better than the story itself. As a period piece, it recreates the turbulent '70s vividly, while it constantly fascinated me with its British take on the Generation Gap. If you need to remind yourself what great film-making is all about, this is a first choice.</fullReview>

Seen from this point of view, this film is haunting, as is Daniel Day Lewis' performance yet again as Jim Sheridan's alter ego. And this could be the best collaboration between the two.The portrayal of this man is so human and realistic, his feeling of guilt mixed with a need to revolution in his immature opinion make it striking. Sheridan is good at portraying Northern Irish situations to perfection, this is probably the best and the most haunting. And the theme is justice and prejudice. He is blamed for his nationality and without evidence. It makes you think.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - The interrogation is unbearable.

		<shortDescription>They can't block out the light in here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films. As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage. From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political "courtroom" drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison. Due to Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all. Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core. I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion. Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film. He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film. Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world. He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film. It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this. He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life. Then there was Emma Thompson. She was subtle in this film. Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation. The story is what kept me glued to the screen. I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story. We don't watch Gerry grow up. We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father. We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain. We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone. Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments. Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father. I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father. It was like watching a child grow before our eyes. The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending. I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself. I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see. It frightened me to watch it in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent. Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family. He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation. It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me. Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.Grade: **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Piece of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent reconstruction of the wrongful imprisonment of the 1974 'Guilford bombers' and the denial of Justice.The acting is 'A' grade and the cinematography is anything but average. This is surely a superb piece of Hollywood.The story starts when Gerry Conlon travels to London after the IRA causes conflict in his home town of Belfast. When the bomb goes off, his pety thievery makes him a perfect scapegoat for the British police to blame the deaths of the innocent on. After several hours of torture and torment, Gerry is forced to sign confessions and, eventually be sent to jail along with his family for the accused making of the bomb.A great father-to-son relationship is developed throughout the Conlon's time in prison. However, when Gerry's father, Guiseppe, dies in prison for something he didn't do, the audience sympathises with the emotions of Gerry and the burning pieces of paper floating down the prison walls acts as a metaphor for the loss of the innocent.One again, a marvellous film with tells the story of one family fighting for Justice</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In the Name of the Father" review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's refreshing to view a based on factual events, without the fabricated love story used by directors to enhance the entertainment value. Instead, In The Name of the Father, the audience is exposed to a beautifully crafted film portraying the injustice of the Guildford Four trial, with the central focus regarding the emotional conflict between father and son."In the Name of the Father" remains faithful to the story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a man wrongfully accused of the Guildford pub bombing in London, 1974. His unfortunate events affect his whole family and friends, as they are used as scapegoats by the police, blamed for a crime they didn't commit. The film continues to highlight the injustice of the Guildford case, resulting in life imprisonment. Even so, with the faith derived from his father, Conlon's spirit remains alive as he faces the hardships of prison, and the ongoing hope as they both attempt to re-open the case after 15 years with the aid of the lawyer, Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson).It isn't surprising that the movie was nominated for 7 academy awards, especially with an exceptional cast to embody one of the most 'emotionally charged cases in British history'. And one wonders how much emotions influenced the convicted decision made by the jury, when we witness the public present in the courtroom yelling obscenities to the accused! Daniel Day Lewis(Gerry Conlon), together with Pete Postelwaithe (Giuseppe, Gerry's father) manage to capture the emotion of the case, as well as their strained relationship. When Gerry attacks Giuseppe in the prison cell, the camera remains focused on both men's faces, capturing the pain and frustrations on Lewis' face, and contrasting the look of disbelief on Giuseppe's.The music in the movie is to be commended, with a different yet accurate tune used to reflect the sequences displayed on film. From the loud, thunderous rock tune at the beginning, to the intense rhythmic beating before the anticipated walk to the courtroom, as well as the soulful, heart wrenching ballad played as the prisoner's throw out paper flames in a desperate cry for help, it is undeniable that the music is the essence of a film with such emotional depth.In "The Name of the Father", the audience become touched by the story of an uncommunicative father and son, whose relationship prospers on new found trust and respect, all the while dealing with the political issues regarding their wrongful imprisonment. If not watched for the acting or the camera's remarkable ability to captivate, even the storyline is enough to keep a person entranced!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the name of the father is an excellent portrayal of human injustice and the lengths humanity is willing to go to, to seek revenge for crimes regardless of the truth. This is an excellent representation of the Guilford 4's true story. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) had been squatting in London with his old school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch). When the Guilford pub is blown up on October 5th 1974, Gerry and Paul become suspects. Tension building music is a pre cursor to the Guilford pub explosion contrasted with normal scenes involving couples walking into the pub. During their questioning Gerry and Paul are subject to physical and mental abuse. The filming here adds to the feeling of helplessness by filming Gerry's head through a gap in the officers surrounding him. High camera angles show how defenceless Gerry is and low angels on the officers demonstrate their authoritarian positions. An important shot is a close up on Inspector Dixon's face as we see him sneering at Gerry. Gerry's father Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwait) travels to England to arrange a lawyer for Gerry when he too is arrested for participating in an IRA support network. While Gerry and Giuseppe are imprisoned together we become further aware of their distant relationship and the underlying causes. During these scenes close ups on Gerry and Giuseppe's faces show the pent up emotions that come to a head. Giuseppe Conlon is well aware he may not be released from prison alive .So is the audience. His death forms one of the most incredible scenes. Gerry's grief at his fathers death is expressed through close ups on his face with tears running down and wailing music this is paralleled by the fire tears of the prison. When the prison cries fire tears its dark outside representing the extinguishing of Giuseppe's light. The contrasting the darkness and fire tears running down the walls of the prison are stunning and will stir the emotions of any watcher. Gareth (Emma Thomson) their lawyer works on the Conlon's case for nearly 10 years. Shortly after Giuseppe's death she uncovers fresh evidence withheld from the defence in Gerry's favour. This leads to the moving court scene with Gareth's passionate speech incriminating the officers involved in the Guilford 4's arrest, trial, and imprisonment. This scene uses high camera angles and although they make her look small she is empowered and unstoppable. The close ups on Dixon's lips and hands (which he is wringing) show his guilt. In the name of the father is filled with emotional scenes and speeches. One of these speeches Gerry makes when he is released from prison. He demands to exit from the front of the court and as the camera pans over him on his way out, he climbs over the crowd. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing through out the film but if you hadn't been convinced of his connection with the character yet this would be the time. His speech declaring his innocence and that of his father is one of the most memorable in film. The wonderful acting is complemented entirely by the sound track and various film techniques. Although not entirely accurate it's a truly stunning film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'In the Name of the Father'- a compelling story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'In the Name of the Father' is a true story based on the Guildford Four. In particular it follows the story of Gerry Conlon who was wrongly accused of the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970's.There were some outstanding performances by Emma Thompson who played Gareth Peirce, Pete Postlethwaite who played Giuseppe Conlon but by far the best performance was by Daniel Day-Lewis who played Gerry Conlon. He made his character seem so real and believable making the audience sympathize with him. The last speech he made was very passionate and well spoken leaving the audience with a tear in their eye because they were so moved.The layout of the film was interesting by the way they showed the bombing right at the start of the film then going back to Gerry in Ireland and follow what he does up until the bombing and afterward. This captures the audience attention from the start making them interested and willing to find out what will happen next.The film shots and camera angles help to emphasize the feelings and emotions felt at certain parts of the film. For instance, there are many times when Giuseppe is shown behind Gerry to show how Giuseppe is always looking over Gerry's back. There is also a shot that shows the police officer looking down on Gerry in an intimidating way trying to get him to sign a confession.The soundtrack sets the mood in the scenes, it was happy when Gerry was happy, dramatic when it was a dramatic sound and sad when something bad happened. It really helped to set up the scenes. There was a lot of good music that kept the audience interested.There were many themes that were clearly shown in this film. These were injustice, corruption, family values and equal rights. The dialogue clearly showed these themes and helped to make the audience really think about them.'In the Name of the Father' is a moving film that really captures the audience's attention and keeps them in suspense the whole time. It is a good watch and I really recommend it.</fullReview>

You quickly get into fantasy land. The answer? Stop looking for history in the movies. They are not real - even when 'based on a true story' - whoever's reality that is!

		<shortDescription>Completely different genre than "Green Mile"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing I wanted to address was that although it does take place in a prison, this cannot be compared with such movies as "The Green Mile" or "Shawshank Redemption". Those two are completely fictitious stories, although they are entertaining. You wouldn't put "Stripes" or "In the Army Now" in the same basket with such films as "Full Metal Jacket" or "Shaving Ryan's Privates", would you? Oops, excuse me; I meant "Saving Private Ryan".Anyway, excellent film. I don't see anything anti-English about it; it just Happened in England. Just like "Murder in the First" Happened in The States. Things like this happen in all sorts of places, so making a movie on them doesn't make it an Anti-(country of choice) film.Kinda funny how a previous comment mentioned Pete Postlethwaite and Tommy Lee Jones in the same sentence; I spent half the time debating to myself whether the actor was Tommy or not (until I read the credits, of course). Sometimes they're spitting images of each other, sometimes they're not.Anyway, very well done film and I look forward to reading the book sometime. Good soundtrack, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irish screenwriter, producer and director Jim Sheridan's third feature film which he co-wrote with English screenwriter and director Terry George and produced, is an adaptation of an autobiographical book called "Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon from the Guildford Four" from 1994 by Gerry Conlon. It premiered in Ireland, was screened In competition at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival in 1994, was shot on locations in Northern Ireland and England and is an Ireland-United Kingdom-USA co-production. It tells the story about a 21-year-old man named Gerard "Gerry" Conlon who lives with his parents and younger siblings in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Gerry leaves his family in early October 1974 and goes to London where he joins a collective of hippies, but after returning home and learning that two pubs in Guildford, England has been bombed, he is arrested by British law enforcements and accused of having taken part in the fatal crime.Finely and engagingly directed by Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan, this finely paced and somewhat fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a humane, heartrending and excruciating portrayal of the injustice which was brought upon eleven Irish citizens by the London Metropolitan police force in the mid-1970s after a politically related act of terrorism. While notable for it's distinct and naturalistic milieu depictions, fine cinematography by British cinematographer Peter Biziou and production design by UK production designer and art director Caroline Amies, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about miscarriage of justice, survival and the hardships a Catholic working-class family from the capital of Northern Ireland is faced with when their eldest son is convicted and imprisoned for a terrorist crime he did not do, depicts an in-depth study of character and contains an efficient score by South African composer Trevor Jones.This biographical and political reconstruction of real events which is set in England and Northern Ireland during The Troubles and where a man who after years of opposition against his father gradually begins to see him as the goodhearted man he is, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity, heartened depiction of the relationship between a son and his father, documentary-like realism, use of music, the distinct and magnetic acting performance by English actor Daniel Day-Lewis and the compassionate supporting acting performances by British actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson and English actor Pete Postlethwaite (1946-2011). A thoughtful and consistently involving drama from the early 1990s which gained, among numerous other awards, the Golden Bear at the 44th Berlin Film Festival in 1994 and seven Academy Award nominations at the 66th Academy Awards in 1994.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Great Film About Miscarriage Of Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The My Left Foot team of star Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan were reunited to make this political docudrama about Irish citizen Gerry Conlon,who was wrongly convicted of taking part in an IRA bombing that killed five in Guildford, England in 1974 in this movie entitled,In The Name Of The Father.Pete Postlethwaite,John Lynch,Mark Sheppard,Beatie Edney,Emma Thompson and Don Baker co-star to play key supporting roles. The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the autobiography Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four by Gerry Conlon.The movie tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon. A petty thief in strife- torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe. When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the "Guildford Four." An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer, Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.The brilliance of Jim Sheridan's motion picture is that we come to view every event from the perspective of how it impacts on the relationship between Gerry and his father, in whose name the final struggle is fought.In addition to that,Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite that the acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicity of the script and do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you are faced with enough material to make a mini-series and try to put it in a 2-hour film you have to make choices.Neither the British nor the IRA are depicted with any depth, the target is to establish both Gerry as a bit of a goofy, likable character and his father, an intelligent but downtrodden figure. Rock, humor and great lines complete the package.The better part of this movie depicts the relationship between Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon and true to life, never receives closing. Sheridan seems to realize this and gives the relationship time to grow naturally without forcing anything. A few lapses into sentimentality could be avoided but are successfully countered with humor.Since 1994 when I first saw the movie, the world, including Ireland has moved on. Some points this movie makes stand, others do not. In any case, I loved seeing it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent character study of a man wrongfully imprisoned and further forced to balance finding justice with finding solace with his father.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Name of the Father is an epic tale of hope and mistaken identity, a towering achievement of sorts focusing on everyday and very likable central characters as they are put through an awful emotional grinder based on true events from the 1970s and 80s. The film is spoilt only very slightly by a quite woeful theme song from Irish band U2 and the fact director Jim Sheridan cannot much direct action, forcing the very early few scenes to come across as awkward and misjudged. The rest, however, is a dedicated study of a dedicated man forced into becoming a hate figure; a fall guy of sorts, as the British government struggle to come up with answers regarding the ongoing struggles in the conflict with the Irish Republican Army.The film is a tale of fighting for justice, a tale of independence and the duty one must go through in order to attain that independence. The road is long and the times get desperate; the characters face long stretches of prison time for things they did not do ? years were incorrectly taken off their lives and the result of it all is condensed down into a two and a bit hour film that you can most certainly go out of your way to see. What is two hours of your time compared to thirty odd years of someone else's, after all?The film is essentially told in a flashback perspective, a story that is distilled through lawyer Gareth Peirce's (Thompson) imagination as she envisages the lead character doing what he does as he narrates to her exactly what went down through a cassette recording. But we are there as well, we are back in the 1970s and 80s with the lead character as they lead a relatively upbeat and happy-go-lucky life initially before the tragedy strikes. The lead is Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), a young Northern Irishman from Belfast who is living a life surrounded by IRA-led activity in the 1970s without ever directly being involved, but he is the sort of guy who gets caught in the cross-fire; a sort of 'wrong place, wrong time' scenario-led life that will catch up with him in horrific ways later on. When we first see Gerry, the likable rouge attitude and relatively odd choice of song by way of Jimi Hendrix sees him get chased by British troops that mistake him for an IRA sniper ? the scene has a fair amount of 'fun' to it; something that is brought back down to Earth later on.There is a sad irony and that is that it is proposed Gerry should move away from Northern Ireland following these scenes in order to get away from the troubles. Gerry agrees and takes a boat over to England with a friend named Paul Hill (Lynch), before briefly settling down in London. Initially, the film plays on Gerry being a bit of a misfit in this new setting; he mixes mostly with casual drug takers, hippies and devout, air headed female vegetarians. This unconnected and grounded realism driven segment in the film is impressive and mysterious. Having no knowledge of who these people are and what eventually happens to them will have you see the film as this wandering and series of supposedly random events in a specific time setting as Gerry wanders the streets; talks to tramps, thieves from the homes of those that accidentally drop their keys right outside the front door and looks for short stay accommodation here and there.But what follows is a change in gear and a change in study, indeed a change that encompasses desperation; mistaken identity; the hunt for redemption and the forcing of confronting issues regarding the relationship with one's father. A bomb is detonated within the vicinity of Gerry's general area one night and he is singled out by the police for his Irish roots and the fact he has only very recently arrived in England. He is jailed, with his father, as a part of the 'Maguire Seven', before desperately trying to claim justice. As a lead character, Gerry later embodies all the innocent and necessary traits for a victim just trying to survive. The film's point of attack takes special care in painting a wavy image for Gerry, one that sees him rob apartments of money, joke about with his mates and come across as quite antagonistic at times.Gerry and his father's, named Giuseppe (Postlethwaite), coming together in prison provide some of the more fascinating scenes in the film; a forced period of bonding during which they humblingly make peace and mend the past problems that they shared from years gone by. There is enough in the film to get caught up in, a sense of tragedy and mis-justice; a sense of pain and desperation. As far as prison set dramas go, this is one of the more impressive I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An addictive story with breath taking performances make for a quality film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the name of the father is the story of Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon, a father and son who along with nine other innocents, were wrongly accused and convicted in relation to the Guildford Bombings in 1974. Gerry Conlon became apart of a group that were known world wide as the Guildford Four and Giuseppe became apart of a group that were lesser known as the Maguire Seven. In the Name of the Father is set during the time that relations between England and Ireland were most strained.The film begins in 1974 Belfast and it immediately establishes Gerry's character as a tearaway. He is a tearaway for many reasons too many to list in this comment but it is evident that one of the reasons that he refuses to lie down and become like his father. His father Giuseppe is a likable man. A loving father whose hard work to provide for his family during a time where Catholics had no rights results in him developing severe asthma. When Gerry is blamed with his friends Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong and Carol Richards for the Guildford Pub bombing, Giuseppe drops everything and goes to London to help his son. When staying with his relations the Maguire's he is also picked up and charged with them for being involved in Terrorist activity. They are found guilty and sentenced. Gerry receives life and Giuseppe get 14 years. While in prison the turbulent relationship between Gerry and his father worsens to the point where they are not speaking. Despite their natural stormy relation ship this situation is worsened by the arrival of Joe McAndrew who is the real Guildford Bomber. In McAndrews, Gerry sees the man who his father should be. A man that is a fighter and who does not take things lying down as opposed to quiet conservative Giuseppe who has turned his cheek all his life and has been repaid in bad health for it. But as time goes by and maturity sets in, Gerry revises his opinion on Giuseppe and discovers that he always will have a friend in his father. The final chapter sees Gerry discarding his troublesome persona in favor of one that is similar to his fathers and together begin to fight to clear their names.This film was Jim Sheridan's first in relation to the situation that had engulfed Northern Ireland and to be honest it is his best so far. Sheridan once again uses an addictive storyline (father and son in miscarriage of justice) to further investigate the theme of father/son relations. Despite it's political setting and use of ethnic sides to tell the story what Sheridan wants us to asses is the relationship between Gerry Conlon and his father and how Gerry's resistance to become like his father leads to his downfall but it is through the worst part of his life that he gets to know his father properly. Through the claustrophobic atmosphere of their prison cell Gerry realizes that he has more in common with his father and despite past arguments Giuseppe becomes not only his father again but his best friend.Day-Lewis is on form yet again with his performance and I have yet to see him in a film where he does not give a solid performance. This time he has the very strong support from Postlewaithe as his father Giuseppe. Postlewaithe is superb as the ill Giuseppe who never gives up hope. Emma Thompson is someone I have been very keen on. But in this film she delivers a spectacular performance and like Posthlewaithe it is worthy of the Oscar nomination they received and in both cases they should have won. Sheridan must also be praised for his script and direction of this film. He took a story that at the time was still sore on the minds of both the Irish and British people. It was also a time where the situation in Northern Ireland looked as if it would never stop and the films release could further the cause of fighting for both paramilitary sides. It did however make the world sit up and pay attention because every country has had at some time a severe miscarriage of justice.If you want facts about the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven I suggest you don't watch this film. At the time of it's release it was heavily accused of not painting an accurate description of the case but the reality is that if you want details the film would not run at just over two hours but it would run for 15 years. I suggest you ask your local television stations to commission a Docu-Drama. This story is about the Conlon's. If I had faults with it I would say that my biggest hate of this film is the republican bomber Joe McAndrews. It is a very wooden performance that is down to bad acting and nothing else. He is too open about the whole affair which leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. If all Republican terrorists talked and acted like this the troubles of Northern Ireland would have lasted 10 minutes. There is a saying in Ireland that those who talk about it, no the least about it. On a whole it is very unbelievable. But despite this the film is very good, hard going to watch and very hard to walk away from without having some emotions evoked inside you. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>COURTNEY VANDERPLUYM IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER 'Well, I think they ought to take the word 'compassion' out of the English dictionary.' Jim Sheridan's In the Name of The Father is an emotional movie portraying the real life story of the Guildford Pub Bombings, and the people wrongly accused of doing it. You see an in-depth look into the corruption of the Authorities, the callousness of the IRA, the struggles of the innocent, the terrible events that bring a father and son from a cold relationship to a close one, and a lawyers ambition to uncover the truth.On October 5, 1974 the IRA bombed a Guildford Pub in England, resulting in the deaths of five innocent people. The police, headed by Robert Dixon, became under intense pressure to find the bombers and make the public feel safe.Meanwhile in another town in England, Two Irish boys, Gerry Conland and Paul Hill, were walking the streets, broke and looking for a place to stay. Gerry Conland, a mischievous, petty thief was sent over to England by his father to straighten his life out. Gerry was always getting in trouble with the IRA and his relationship with his father was cold and distant. Gerry, Paul and two other Irish People that were living in a squat with them, have their lives turned around when they are accused of committing the bombings.Paul Hill was taken in to custody, and tortured until he admitted to the crimes and named others involved. Hill, being innocent, signs the confession and naming people who aren't in the IRA as his accomplices, assuming it would all be sorted out in court. Gerry, along with the others, are all threatened and hurt until they sign a confession.Gerry's father, Guiseppe arrives in England to sort out the mess his son is in, but soon becomes arrested along with a few relatives and are accused of also being involved in the Bombings.The court trial comes but the news is not so good, they are all found guilty, and sentenced to life changing jail time. Dixon, along with his colleagues, find there alibi's and know they are innocent, but corruption takes over, they hide the truth so they have people to pin the blame on, even if they are the wrong people.Gerry, Giuseppe and all the other accused terrorists are sent of to jail, with four of them receiving life terms. Gerry and Giuseppe are sent into a jail together, soon to learn they are complete strangers, and don't know each other at all. Years pass, and jail began to take it's toll on the Conlands. Gerry has lost all hope in being saved, whilst his ill father fights for their innocence.In their struggle to make it in jail, Gerry and Giuseppe soon become closer than ever, they get rid of their demons and are able to be close to each other. During this time, Giuseppe hires Gareth Pierce, a lawyer, to uncover the truth. The lawyer is passionate about the case and puts her heart and soul into helping them and putting a stop to the corruption. The real Guildford bomber is found and sent to jail, but the authorities turn a blind eye to it, leaving the blame on the Conlands.Many years pass, Guiseppe soon passes away, leaving Gerry to fight for their innocence. In a twist of fate, Gareth uncovers the confession of a man who was Gerry's alibi. She takes the evidence to court, and with an emotional speech, which will surely be remembered, she Gets the Guildford four out of jail.The movie ends on Gerry outside the court claiming his innocence and telling the crowd his will fight until his father is also found innocent.The movie uses camera angles and lighting, which makes you realize who the innocent or that guilty are. Lighting is used for a mood setting, e.g. Blue lighting leading up to the moments before Guiseppe's Death. The music is used to set the mood, and build up to big moments in the movie e.g. Loud dramatic music is used during the bombings.This emotionally charged movie, really made you question the corruption that takes place today, and the struggles and stories of the innocent people that become mixed up in it.</fullReview>

Although the movie is based on Conlon's autobiographical book, this is not only a political film in the sense we would expect it to be; the tragedy of two innocents arrested and convicted serves only as a background for an intimate reflection on father and son relationship in a movie that finally lies midway between a prison movie and a family drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No less great than 'The Shawshank Redemption'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some times you watch a movie and tell yourself "Why I haven't seen this movie before?". This is exactly that kind of a movie. The movie is said to be a bit blurred in historical accuracies. Probably, that is the reason the movie is a bit underrated. The things that make this movie a winner is its simple yet strong story and immeasurably powerful performances. The movie is about Gerry Conlon and his three friends, the team of whom was later christened as the "Guildford Four". They were falsely accused of bombing and killing. This was followed by multiple arrests, including those of Gerry's Aunt and Father, Giuseppe. Full credit to Jim Sheridan for handling the plot in an appropriate way by following a linear narrative. It is the credit of the director for showing the unique bond between Gerry and Giuseppe, which I am quite sure can be related by any father-son pair. About performances; when there is Daniel Day Lewis, as Gerry, there will be impeccable and majestic acting. I always fall short of adjectives when I talk about Day-Lewis' acting. Be that when he got the news of his father's death or in the climax or any other single scene featuring him, he excelled. Pete Poslethwaithe was also brilliant as Giuseppe and got matched Day-Lewis' acting. Emma Thompson, always a fantastic actress, didn't disappoint and was excellent especially in the last climax courtroom scene. Special mention to Don Baker as Joe McAndrew.As a final note this is a movie which, as its fantastic soundtrack 'In the Name of the Father" by U2 indicates, tells a story about love,humanity and fighting for truth and those make this movie no less great than The Shawshank Redemption.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was looking at this cover of the DVD that i was planning to rent out, I see, there is this man who looks very similar to Daniel Day Lewis staring at me with a intense looks. First reminded of the music album covers that were produced of individual artists.But then seen There will be Blood, picked up In the Name of the Father which is a serious and not to be taken lightly movie. A little background of the IRA and the Great Britain, will surely help while watching the movie.There were scenes where in i was lost in between cause of very heavy British accent. Sometimes the abusive language was so empowering that you enjoy watching the what you are watching, but you miss on the dialogues.One thing which completely hats off to the man - Daniel Day Lewis, he can actually take the whole movie all by himself. He stays in the character, he does what he needs to do to be in the character and completely shows on screen which he has a very strong presence.At the same time, not to forget Pete who plays Gerry's father and they share the same prison cell in the movie. Something that which I had seen for the first time and it was a little difficult for me to digest that father - son sharing the same prison. Pete in his own way played the role model of the good father who wants to inculcate good habits in his son, but fails. Even his death scene who intensely dramatic and clearly showed that how this would change his son. Then the movie picks up the pace.on Emma Thompson, probably i was too enamored by the Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, her role was kind of over shadowed. Not saying that she didn't have a commanding role, she was the lawyer, defending falsely accused of terrorist activity.This movie is not for the faint heartened, its not horror movie. But at the same time, it is really good movie to watch out for, when you are hoping to watch good cinema. Don't let the intense look on the cover on the DVD cover dissuade from watching a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think there is anyone around who can dislike this movie as it's directed in such a magnificent way that there are times you wish every movie could have the same impact even if strange enough director Jim Sheridan never really would make it in the director-scene. This is the story about the Guildford Four, the story of four people who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once again London is haunted by an IRA-bomb and as the justice don't want to be blamed another time they must find some "guilty" and so it happens that some Irish outsiders are in the area of an exploded pub. The whole family of Conlon (even his father who must be so honest it reaches the laughable) are sent to prison at where they are absolutely hated and getting the hardest regime a prisoner can get. In the meantime the real terrorists are caught but the British government is too proud to convince that they made a mistake and little by little we see people torn apart as they are condemned for something they never did... Let's thank God this was a British production as never Sheridan chooses for Oscar-sentiment, it never goes over the top and it's just given as documentaryinformation, but mind you, the truth itself is shocking enough. Once again splendid performances from Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlewaite who plays the role of the father. Superb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I might have rated this higher had Emma Thompson had a bigger role. I am a fan of hers, plus I think most people would agree she's an excellent actress, so it was disappointment to see her appear much until the last 15 minutes of the film. That's especially misleading when she gets second or third billing in this movie.Nonetheless, it's an involving true-story of an Irishman, his dad and some of their relatives who are all sent to prison for a bombing they had nothing to do with. Filmmakers LOVE these kind of stories in which they can make their country and police into the bad guys. Here, the British look bad - very bad - as they railroad "Gerry Conlon" (Daniel-Day Lewis). The latter makes a convincing hot-headed Irishman, but he's no killer. The tone of the movie softens not in the last half hour as Lewis' character begins to appreciate his father. Until then, it's a rough film that is not always easy to watch and hear because of the accents, some police brutality and corruptness and general group of nasty characters.By the way, despite the billing, Pete Postlewaite is the second star of the film. He doesn't get the recognition he deserves for his acting contribution in this movie.</fullReview>

I feel that Daniel Day-Lewis seemed to be forcing each line out and was not portraying the character to its fullest extant. I also feel the director pushed too hard for the audience to be sympathetic towards Gerry Conlon and spent more time telling about his torture then on his time trying to secure his freedom. Then the death of his father, Giuseppe you feel as though he didn't care and that the inmates cared more about him then Gerry did. Then in the end you see that the ones responsible never were charged with the bombing and that the police who chorused the confessions didn't have to face any kind of consequences for their actions.</fullReview>

With the unwitting help of his roommate Charles, several classmates, and a stranger at the pub, he stumbles onto a new theory of governing dynamics that ultimately earns him a place in history. He soon goes to work for Wheeler Defense Labs where he becomes a code breaker for the U.S. Government as well as a professor. Through his work, John meets his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and U.S. Department of Defense agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who both prove to be very influential in many different ways. As he tries to find his way on a path to recognition, he finds himself struggling with a much stronger force than intelligence . . . schizophrenia.John Nash spent most of his life in a lonely state of superiority. His quest for a truly original idea and his overwhelming feeling of failure when he can't seem to find it show that he valued his intellect above all else. When he finds that he can no longer trust his own mind, the mind that served as his only friend for a great portion of his life, we as an audience become as confused and devastated as he was. Director Ron Howard brings the viewers into his world, into his state of confusion, to shed light onto the lesson he learned. Yes, John Nash was exceptionally intelligent, but he was also fragile in a very humbling way. Because of this, he came to hold humanity and love in a very dear little place in his once cold, blindly driven heart. I appreciate and almost envy that heart-breaking learning process. I feel myself falling, growing, smashing, and squishing my way through a distantly related struggle towards contentment. I can connect with his desire for greatness, his ultimate descent back down to earth, and the feeling of peace that followed. This film has shown me that we will never live up to our own expectations, but we can achieve a much more remarkable form of greatness by accepting our fallibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth seeing...but I'd sure love to see a follow-up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film.The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well.Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom.Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait.Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not backwards in coming forwards politically, and quite rightly so. Had the death penalty been available, or the lawyers had sen fit to charge under the antiquated treason laws, the defendants would have been hanged - innocent blood on the hands of the British justice system. As a young man I remember well the tabloid publicity and rantings against the defendants - one lone journalist and belief in themselves as innocents led to justice for these poor people. NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN, FREE THE INNOCENT! As for the film - superb performances, Pete Postlethwaite is brilliant, and this is Daniel Day-Lewis' best role ever. Just brilliant.

		<shortDescription>A true memorable story of injustice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Sheridan made the movie "In the Name of the Father" based on the autobiography "Proved innocent" by Gerry Conlon. In the Name of the Father displayed the true story of the "Guildford Four" and retells there miraculous journey to freedom. The movie displays the process of innocent average Irishmen wrongfully accused for bombing a pub in Guildford.A bombing occurred on October 5th, 1974 in a Guildford pub in England. The head of the police force Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave) arrested the accused bombers Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch). Gerry's father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) helps Gerry find a lawyer but then gets charged for participating in the bombings.Gerry and Paul were sentenced to life in prison because there was insufficient evidence for them to be hung. The only chance for them to be set free was through a lawyer named Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) who attempts to set them free by gathering scraps of evidence.The movie showed the actual story of the "Guildford Four" in many views. Jim Sheridan displayed views from Robert Dixon under public pressure, injustice towards the "Guildford Four" and also Jim Sheridan showed the development of Gerry and Giuseppe's father and son relationship. The development was shown clearly because at first Gerry and Giuseppe had a weak relationship but they then discovered they could connect and formed a closer bond.Gerry Conlon and Giuseppe form a great duo as father and son and perform a very convincing relationship. Many movies lack the actors to play a true father and son relationship but Daniel and Pete play it with perfection. Another memorable performance was by Corin Redgrave who played a firm and sly policeman determined to put the case away.The camera angles and shots of the movie were remarkable in presenting the scenes. When there was a riot in the beginning of the film, the camera used was hand held so that made you feel you were there. The lighting and music was very significant in the film by choosing the right colour and sounds to help set the mood to express the scene. Certain scenes such as depressing or dim scenes were shown with a dark blue colour and sad touching orchestra hymns to set the mood.The film In the Name of the Father successfully portrays the true story of the "Guildford Four" from different perspectives. Jim Sheridan accurately displays the events that lead to the freedom of the "Guildford Four". During their journey to freedom, the development of the father and son relationship is shown and society's views on the events that occur. The movie is based around injustice and proves to be a memorable movie which will be remembered by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Jim Sheridan and actor Daniel Day-Lewis' follow-up to 'My Left Foot' entitled 'In the Name of the Father' may move a little slow but most of the time in succeeds in being both heart-wrenching and inspiring. It's a very political film based on the true story of an small-time Irish hoodlum Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), his hippie friends, his relatives and his father being falsely convicted of London/Ireland IRA bombings. The film follows Gerry in prison and his fight to get him and his family out. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance, while Pete Postelwaithe who plays his father is amazing in every scene. Emma Thompson is good for her very limited screen time as Gerry's lawyer and you should look out for a bit part played by Oscar Nominee Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom) towards the end. 'In the Name of the Father' was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director - Jim Sheridan, Best Actor in a Leading Role - Daniel Day-Lewis, Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Pete Postlewaithe, Best Actress in a Supporting Role - Emma Thompson and Best Adapted Screenplay. If you don't mind some of sagging parts of the film and want to shed a tear or two, be sure to add 'In the Name of the Father' to your 'to-rent' list. Grade: B</fullReview>

The film recreates a true historical event that was a sad example of extreme injustice and political double standards.The movie shows, with tons of eloquence, how the powers of government institutions are often used to manipulate the truth. Themes like physical and psychological cruelty, distortion of reality, mind and spiritual growth, human redemption, and family love at its highest level, are treated with brilliance by Jim Sheridan whose wonderful direction allows the viewer to emotionally relate to every aspect of the story.The performances of Pete Postlehwaite and Daniel Day Lewis, as father and son and victims of a terrible misstep of the administration of justice, are astonishing. The scenes between these two actors are incredibly powerful and truly heartbreaking. Emma Thompson also gives a great performance as Gareth Peirce, the lawyer who represented the long awaited arrival of the truth after years of harm and legal blindness.'In The Name of the Father' is a great piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During this film i am totally sure that you will have a lot of laughs and also a lot of tears. This is about growing up in Belfast and through the troubles. Daniel Day Lewis plays the main character of Gerry Conlon a 20 something Belfast thief trying to make something of himself and yet finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is so like many of the young men in Belfast trying to scrape a few pound to keep his ma happy and always falling into the traps of the law along the way. Pete Postlethwaite is a great actor as we all know and portrays the perfect Giuseppe Conlon, the father of Gerry, always trying to see the best in everyone and is let down time and time again.This is a film well worth seeing and i assure you that you will be on the edge of your seat at this moving story of one man trying to prove his innocents to both the world and his family. Unlike many films about Belfast this is set mainly in an English Prison and not on the Streets of Belfast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good view on the Irish problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The screenplay for "In the name of the Father" is based on the memoirs of a Belfast young boy who, along with friends and family members, was wrongly convicted by the British government in 1975 for the terrorist bombing of two pubs in Guildford, a town outside London.Imprisoned for fifteen years, the "Guildford Four" (they were called like that) finally won their freedom in a ruling that sparked controversy and shook the British legal system. "In the name of the Father" tells a really moving story which will not probably remain indifferent to the viewers. In fact, all my impressions about the film were very good, both for the performances and for the interesting contents. Jim Sheridan, the director, knew how to turn his ideas into reality in a masterly way. I think, as a spectator, that this true story of terrible injustice provided a compelling basis for a moving drama: the problem in Ireland, family values or real facts made by the authorities en the 70s give a touch of reality that is felt throughout the whole film. In addition to this, in constructing his parable of good and evil, Sheridan was also inspired to explore some patriarchal concepts, including the British crown's involvement in United Kingdom. On the other hand, I also observed a certain allegory of a father and son in conflict which, actually, provides the most important argument in the film. In fact, a combination of values related to religion is a constant feature throughout the film. In conclusion, I believe that "In the name of the Father" has been one of the best films I have ever seen so I recommend it to anyone interested in social problems. A story about violence and love, about justice and injustice, all combinated in order to explain the crude reality about a harsh conflict which, even nowadays, goes on affecting thousands of people in a similar way of Gerry Conlon. And, obviously,for the Spanish people the film will mean a revival of a problem that affects us directly. So, come on, see it because it is worthy and it will help you to understand (or unless to try to look for an explanation) many life matters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'In the name of the father' is a movie based on a true story. The story is about a young lad and his father that end up in the hands of the IRA-police because they think Gerry Conlon put a bomb in an British pub. Gerry and his pal Danny travel to Gerry's to get a job and get away from the hometown. They find some new friends that are hippies. Their lifestyle gets a little different, but they still follow the law. His father Giuseppe traveled from their family's home in Ireland to England, to help his son. When they both are put in jail the family do all they can to get them out. Gerry aunt is also arrested and gets many years in prison. Gerry is young and handles the prison-life better than his father. Giuseppe gets pneumonia and Gerry helps him rubbing a strong lotion on his chest to open up his airways. After a while Giuseppe dies, and Gerry swears to clear his fathers name. A British lawyer, Gareth Peirce helps Gerry to get his case reopened so that they will get a new chance in court. When the case is reopened many years later, Gerry has read in a tape with his side of the story. This will help him a great deal in the second court round. The genre of the movie is typically drama. Policemen who are bad, people who gets punished for things they didn't do, and the ending of the movie. The fluidity in the film was good and comfortable to watch. The nice editing job made the movie a great deal better than it would have been with a poor editing job. The sound could be better, but all in all the movie was good even though the sound was a little bit shrill. I would give this movie a 5, in a scale from 1-6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Sheridan is an acclaimed film director and a good storyteller. Jim was born in Dublin, in 1949, and later moved to America in 1982. He directed the movie "In The name of the father" which was a hit all around the world.With an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis, how could this movie go wrong? The movie is based on a true-story that took place in Ireland. Daniel plays a character named Gerry Conlon, who is a small time thief from Belfast (England). Gerry is falsely implicated in the IRA bombing of a pub that kills several people while he is in London. The British police 'force' Gerry and the four of his friends to confessing their guilt about the bombing. Gerry's father decides to help his son, but ends up in prison as well. He ends up spending 15 years in prison with his father trying to prove his innocence with the help of a female British attorney. The genre is biography and drama. I really liked the movie because it had a lot of talented actors and actresses that had good chemistry. Even thought the movie was depressing, thanks to the acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite, they managed to draw at least a few chuckles in some sequences. The editing was well done, and matched perfectly. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has a great cast, good story, good amount of effects (lighting/cutting/editing etc.) I'll give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

However this story moved me in such a way I did not think was possible through a film, and is hard to put into words. It is a story that is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time, the final scene being incredible. Without a doubt the best and most moving film I have ever seen. The fact that it is a true story adds to all the emotions it causes the viewer to feel.All actors play their parts brilliantly, particularly the main characters played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite who really seem to become these characters and feel what they are acting.I think it is a film that everyone should take the time to see, not only for the incredible experience watching this film is, but to be educated in this event, which many people do not know about.The soundtrack is brilliantly suited to every scene it's played in, each song reflecting and enhancing the feeling of the scene.I have lent this film to several friends since I saw it, and they have all thought it was fantastic.I have seen some reviews expressing the opinion it portrays the British in a negative light, and for that reason they do not like it. I have to disagree. The British legal system is portrayed badly (and rightly so) but there are good and bad individuals in every society. The British are also shown protesting in the streets and supporting the wrongly accused Guildford Four, and it is a British woman who brings justice to the individuals. In my opinion seeing extremely irresponsible and selfish individuals will not drive many to hate the British as a whole.Definitely definitely definitely watch this film. Hopefully you will be as glad as I was that you did.</fullReview>

The local Odeon outlet refused to show it. The film's story is based on an IRA bombing of a Guildford pub. The people arrested and sentenced for this offense were clearly innocent but the Surrey Police did not see it like that.Pete P was the consummate actor. A man who could say by the expression on his face all that had to be said about what was happening.The Surrey Police are seriously indicted in this film but as far as I know they were never held to account.

		<fullReview>What is so sad is that while some of the true events were played with, for the most part, this sad episode in British history actually took place. The issue of Northern Ireland has spawned numerous portrayals, some of them outstanding movies. This is about a man who is a bit of a buffoon and a free spirit who acts foolishly (unfortunately, he is unaware that his stupidity would be viewed as it it), and gets into big trouble. Not just going to prison himself but dragging in his entire family. New laws allowed a group of overzealous police to take the rights of a "free" people into their own hands. It's a bit like the Homeland Security act today. It was easy to torture, frighten, and taunt people into giving up everything. This included threatening to kill a good friend or even your father. This is a black eye. I never felt the IRA had a right to do what they did, but one can see how their hatred was hatched. Add to this the incredible performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and his cohorts and you have a superb film. See this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'In The Name Of The Father' is a milestone motion picture. Prolific Filmmaker Jim Sheridan, takes a giant leap in his cinema with his 1993 offering. 'In The Name Of The Father' is a biographical film, it is based on the true life story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the IRA's Guildford pub bombings which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. One of the most shameful verdicts in Court History, is brilliantly done on Screen with a Running-Time over 130-minutes. Jim Sheridan's direction is excellent. He handles such a difficult subject, with such ease, that you have no choice but to be in awe of him. Peter Biziou's Cinematography is exciting. 'In The Name Of The Father' is filled with Legendary Performances: Daniel Day-Lewis proves his supremacy, yet again. Playing a real-life character, with the accurate body language, and dialogue delivery. Pete Postlethwaite as Lewis's Dad, does wonders. In a supporting role, he steals the show. Emma Thompson is flawless. She might not have a lot of screen time, but whenever she appears on screen, she leaves a strong impression. John Lynch is another topper; he excels from start to end. Tom Wilkinson in a brief role, is superb.On the whole, 'In The Name Of The Father' is A True Masterpiece! A film that deserves a Standing Ovation! Don't miss this one, at any cost!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Sheridan's IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER tells the story about the Guildford Four, framed Irish people that were sentenced for life for being IRA terrorists bombing a pub in 1974. Gerry Conlon, accused for being the leader, an innocent, angry young man becomes roommates with his own dad (who got sentenced as an accomplice), and a heartsick relationship evolves behind the bars. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry, and Pete Postlethwaite his father Giuseppe Conlon, and both do extraordinary performances in capturing the relation between the two; the no-good petty thief Gerry sees everything he's demonstrating against in his father, a straightforward and careful elderly man who Gerry insists needs to start fighting back for all the unrighteousness in the world. The film is just as much about this father &amp; son relationship as it is about the political war fought in Ireland, and it mixes those two ingredients masterfully and it makes for an engaging, provocative, tender and emotional experience in which we understand the many difficulties that faced the wrongfully accused convicts. The absolutely blistering Day-Lewis should have anchored the Best Actor statue for this, in which is possibly Sheridan's finest film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deep and powerful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie a few times now and each time I watch it, I get more and more sucked into it.Its one of these films that Jim Sheridan has opted for the right man to play Gerry Conlon, it just doesn't seem that anyone else but Daniel Day Lewis could have pulled this off. His posture, his accent, his mannerism, he just pulled off the character of a mischievous petty thief.The entire story of how they are convicted just because they are Belfast boys in London who happen to be around on the night of the pub bombing, then held for 7 days and nights under new legislation, beaten and torchered to the point the easiest way to end it all is to sign a confession to something they never done, its all very realistic and you feel part of it.The court room scene as they are being convicted, both the Guilford 4 &amp; Maguire 7 is one of the most touching scenes I've seen in a movie, just knowing that there are 11 folk, completely innocent, watching a Crown Lawyer sit and tell a jury of how they were involved in explosives and the murder of innocent people when the truth is every last piece of evidence against them is a lie, it actually gets you on the verge of rage. Think of it in context like this, all 11 members who were trialled and imprisoned totalled 120 years combined for something they were not even remotely involved in. This is what makes the said Court Room scene more thrilling.The way the English police are portrayed into being completely anti Irish due to the ongoing current political circumstances is sickening, it really makes me despise how Governmental bodies worked in those days and it gives you the idea that similar occurrences probably do happen in modern times.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be sucked into a film for over 2 hours. Unless of course you are a supporter of the British justice system and preach that there is no discrepancies there whatsoever :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie for the second time after first viewing it when I was too young to understand it fully. It has moved me to write my thoughts and this is the best place I could think to do it.The movie is very good in itself, even if only taken for entertainment value. However, the message it delivers, as with many great movies, is truly the most important aspect of the film. For that reason, I'll only write a cursory description of the plot of the plot, and try to focus more on the overall feelings invoked by the movie.Daniel Day Lewis continues to solidify himself as one of my favorite modern actors. He portrays a young Irish man who's common and occasionally immoral search for his place in life is cut short when he is accused and wrongfully convicted of a brutal terrorist bombing. The film chronicles his trial, imprisonment, and final acquittal for this crime. The movie is long, but the script is strong and precise with fine acting. The length and serious nature of the movie demand that it be watched with complete attention and not in pieces or with distractions.I have no doubt that many aspects of the true story which this movie is based on have been somewhat altered or omitted. That being said, any alterations to the actual happenings could have only served to make the main message stronger for the audience. This message, to me, is that we must continually search for the truth in a world where it is commonly distorted and shaped for convenience by bureaucracy and sweeping public generalizations. While Democracy and the modern judicial system are truly great advances in civilization, they are far from infallible. They must continually be held in check by the individual. This topic is now relevant more than ever in light of the recent legislative reaction to terrorism in the US.If you haven't already seen the movie, I highly recommend it. It is definitely worth the two and half hours or so time investment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the name of the father, in the name of the son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the name of the father" directed by Jim Sheridan, not only takes you through a poignant journey of awareness in its political and social context, but also tells a story of an alienated father and son that only reach an understanding through their shared circumstance in a prison cell.After mass speculation, angry protests and the passing of the terrorism act on the wake of the Guildford bombing(October 5, 1974), Gerry Conlon(Daniel Day-Louis) and his friends Paul Hill(John Lynch), Paddy Armstrong(Mark Sheppard) and Carole Richardson(Beatie Edney), become the lead suspects following an inquiry by the British police into their whereabouts.None of the Guildford four fitted "the bill" in terms of being associated with the IRA because of their lifestyle. They were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Gerry Conlon was a petty thief from Derry, Northern Ireland and Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson lived in a squat and also had involvement with drugs and petty crime. There were many inconsistencies in the case against them, However with the enormous pressure on the police and the state by the public, they were tortured and threatened into signing confessions and later sentenced to life imprisonment on murder charges, along with Gerry's father Guiseppe Conlon(Pete Postelwaithe).Although it is emotional enough to be privy to the truth towards the innocence of these eight Northern Irish people, who are victims to perhaps one of the most profound miscarriages of Justice in the history of England or the world, we see the eventual bonding of a father and son who were once coldly distanced. After years in a Jail cell they reach a sought of understanding that allows them to communicate on a more intimate level.One of the most strong manifestations of this, is when Gerry is shown to be looking after Guiseppe instead of the reverse, before his death. When Guiseppe dies, the scene showing the fire tears dropping down from the prison windows is one of the most harrowing of the film. This Juxtaposed against the tears that are running down Gerry's face and the reflection of it in his eyes, is testament to the directing genius of Jim Sheridan to create a symbolic portrayal of his grief. In the name of the father visually enhances what the true story presents, through its imagery and dramatization.Another scene that is worth noting, is also in the opening. It is an adrenalin rush as we are confronted with the singular image of the pub exploding, which is then accompanied by the exhilarating dischorded sound of U2's Bono and Gavin Friday conveniently titled, "In the name of the father". The soundtrack though-out the movie is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine, as all scenes are imbued with nothing but the most appropriate music to accompany the deftly created ambiance. Whether it is the chilling, eerie sounds that scream horror in the confessions room, or the 70's Hippie rock n' roll in the opening scene at Derry in Northern Ireland at the start of the riot, the music is an excellent form of augmentation to the mood.Daniel Day-Louise and Pete Postelwaithe do an excellent job of carrying out their roles as divided father and son on bad terms. In all Gerry's delinquent, childish swagger, Daniel Day-Louise is able to reach beyond this to show his honest, emotional side rendering him a more sympathetic character. Similarly, Postelwaithe does an excellent job of conveying a paragon of what is honest and decent as well as a father who is extremely critical but caring of his son at the same time."In the name of the father" reaches beyond the politically electric content of the true story, to the human issues behind it. We see the experiences of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon in the face of extreme adversity and injustice. It is another influential tribute to the human spirit and another piece of evidence that truth tends to be the first casualty in such situations like the one the Guildford four found themselves in. But farther than even this, we share the moving experience of seeing a father and son come together amidst the torrent that was enveloping them, finding peace, courage and motivation in each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Injustice and corruption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'In the Name of the Father' is a persuasive account of injustice based on a true story following the wrongful imprisonment of Gerry Conlon and others connected to him for a bombing of a pub in London set in the 1970s. Despite their innocence the British police are intent on using them as scapegoats against an ongoing battle with the IRA and use horrific methods such as torture to force them into falsely signing confessions. The story follows their attempts to clear their names and achieve justice in a world of corruption.Injustice is brought up relentlessly throughout the film being one of the main themes among other themes such as corruption and family values.The actors in this film, such as Daniel Day-Lewis (Gerry) and Pete Postlewaite (Giuseppe) represent their, at times complex, characters competently, and are matched by the satisfactory producing and directing of the film.The film techniques are skilfully used in all aspects of the film. The film moves from past to present continuously as Gerry tells his story to Gareth Peirce, to emphasize their innocence and to set the storyline. Camera angles are cleverly used to bring sympathy towards Gerry and the others with regard to the helplessness they go through.The music continuously sets the scene and delivers the right atmosphere and mood to evoke the emotions of the viewers, providing a deeper understanding of the situation and context.Overall, a well-produced film with an interesting and emotional storyline.</fullReview>

A wonderful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite, as father and son are faced with one of the English Systems major mistakes. The sense of pathos and frustration runs high in a film which explores the northern Irish Conflict during the 1970's and 1980's. I watched this film for the first time after the 7/7/05 and I hope it serves as a reminder to politicians and those involved in countering terrorism that we have a fair and just legal system and it shouldn't be usurped in order to gain convictions simply to pacify the grievances of the public.

		<shortDescription>Themes of "Terrorism" and "draconian laws" resound loudly still</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This offering of a movie is very much an Irish/English story: the not-very-well known story(At least here in the States) of Gerry Conlon and the Guilford Four is mostly a tale of how a stupid,impetuous petty thief,Mr.Conlon(played with unrelenting energy from DAniel Day_lewis)is railroaded,along with his friends,his father(played with great dignity by Pete Postelthwaite) and about five others,into confessing complicity in a London pub bombing in the early-to-mid seventies. The focus is almost entirely on Gerry,as he at first accepts his fate as a criminal,languishing in a very hostile English prison, only to be slowly won over to fight for his innocence by his very upright father,who never gives up hope in winning an appeal of their conviction. Emma Thompson's part as the "Four"'s lawyer is not minor,but she really only comes into play more than halfway though the film.Still,she's as impassioned and stirring as ever.I use the title line of my review to say that even though the film's subject is very universal,it's themes are EERILY applicable to our war on terror in the USA. I feel like there's more than a little of this "at all costs" approach to finding terror suspects.Politics aside,this was quite a strong movie,co-written by Terry George("Hotel Rwanda",another very strong film!) and directed by Jim Sheridan("My Left Foot"). I feel like,while this film may have special appeal to Irish Catholics anywhere(which I'm not quite one meself),I think it will work for the Irish(or non)in anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a moving film on many levels. Firstly, it recounts a case of terrible injustice on the part of the British legal system, during a time when relations between the British and the Irish were in chaos. Underneath this is a moving story of how a young man's foolishness and bad luck lands him and his family in the worst of situations, and how in that situation he grows and matures. There are moments of true pain and true tenderness, between Gerry and his father as they share the prison cell. There are also moments of goodness and evil on both sides of the "war", moments of weakness with terrible consequences. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance as Gerry, with a vivacity that pervades the film, and his father's calm strength adds a perfect balance. In the Name of the Father is a film you will not regret seeing and will not soon forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the early 1970s, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) went to London from Belfast to pursue a different life and later on he found work there. In 1974, along with friends and family, he was arrested and later accused of the Guilford Bombing.Conlon was to spend fifteen years in jail for something he had never done. His father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) was also imprisoned and years later died in jail due to ill health and improper prison medical care. Gerry Conlon was transferred from prison to prison and he fought for clearing his and his father's names. Throughout the initial interrogations he was heavily abused by the British police.With the relentless efforts of his lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), finally, after fifteen years, the verdicts were quashed.The film is about one man's journey fighting against one of the most shocking miscarriages of justice in British history and undeservedly tortured innocent civilians. This is a moving, powerful story well told. However, if you like this film, don't forget to read the book. It's even more fascinating and you'll realise how much the film has left out. Still, this is for certain one of the greatest films made in the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring account of a man's struggle against injustice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`In the Name of the Father' is one of the three co-ventures of Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis. In terms of story, spirit and performance, I will put it in league with `My Left Foot', their first venture as a director-actor team. I rate this film 10 out of 10, for reasons I go on to explain:`In the Name of the Father' is an account of the true saga of an Irish man, Gerry Conlon, who is wrongfully imprisoned for life. He and his family are made scapegoats by the police and legal system for the bombing of the Guildford Pub of London in 1974. The film goes on to show the bitter trial of Conlon, his father and 3 of his companions accused in the case, and Conlon's spirit as he faces the brutality of unfair imprisonment, and his inimitable spirit as he attempts to reopen the case after 15 years with the aid of a lawyer, Gareth Pierce.One thing I absolutely love about the film is the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. By virtue of being inspired from a true story, the film has a very strong theme and story line. The evolution of the relationship between Gerry and his Dad, Giuseppe has been shown beautifully. The evolution of Gerry from a quick tempered, riotous fellow to a person who has mellowed down and whom time in prison has transformed into a patient man, has also been depicted rather well. The fact that the guy wrongfully accused of a terrorist bombing is not a Godly and perfect sort of guy, but instead a riotous guy given to petty thieving, prevents the film from becoming didactic and overly dramatic. But I guess this is because the director and writer have been true to the real life story of Gerry Conlon.I have no hesitation in stating that `In the Name of the Father' is one of the best films I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The steamroller of the British state security system flattens one Gerry Conlan and turns this unlikely petty thief into a radical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jim Sheridan has crafted a finely nuanced cross-section of the "Irish Troubles" seen through the filter of a gradual father/son reconcilliation.The both of them, father and son, are clumsily, but brutishly sucked into the dark belly of one of Britian's maximum security prisons. Here Daniel Day-Lewis, as Gerry, the son, innocent of the terrorist bombing he's accused of committing, gets to first befriend a bona-fide terrorist, then see him commit a politically-motivated attack, close up.Here's where the story turns. Daniel Day-Lewis, despite his self-loathing and bitterness, rejects the violence of his friend and recognizes his "Da's" dogged determination to right the wrongs done to them as a proper outlet for his rage and grief stemming from his horrible misfortunes.Conlan's character does what all radicals do. He's able to remove himself and his momentary storm of emotions from a larger perspective, and see clearly what havoc the system has done to him. And he has done so in a stirring, contradictory and ultimately heroic way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true miscarriage of justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the name of the father is an excellent film. It tells the true story of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon who where jailed as members of the so called "Guilford Four" who allegedly where guilty of bombing packed public houses back in the 70's.Britain in the mid 70's was falling victim to many such bombings orchestrated by the Provisional IRA and the English Police where desperate for a result.Then along come Gerry Conlon and his friend Paul Hill, two Irish teenagers who have left Belfast for London after being banished by the local IRA for theiving. The IRA, especially in Belfast, look down upon criminal behaviour in their neighbourhoods as it brings unwanted police attention. These guys where chancers and thieves, NOT terrorists.The Police arrest them, again in the act of burgalry and charge them with the said act of terrorism even though they have a concrete aliby for their location at the time of the bombing. They are beaten and threatened until they sign blank confessions. Gerry's father, Guiseppe, made his way to London to help his son. On his arrival he is arrested by the Police as the Terrorist mastermind behind the bombings. His poor relatives, who lived in London who he was staying with, where all arrested as the police established the small house as a "bomb factory".The Police manufactured the charges and then got greedy. The family in the so called "bomb factory" ALL went to prison for 12 years, even the children went into young offenders prisons as terrorists. Gerry, Guiseppe, Paul Hill and a young girl they had met on the day in question, all went to prison as Terrorists for 30 years terms.About 15 years later, Guiseppe became terminally ill and the Conlon's where given permission to secure a lawyer (the first REAL legal representation they received under anti-terrorism laws). Gerry and Guiseppe convince her (played brilliantly by Emma Thompson) of their innocence.Then, as if by a miracle, she is issued a warrant to see the files on Guiseppe's case in order to appeal for his release for ill health. The warrant reads - G. Conlon. The clerk at the records office asks if she wishes to see Gerry's or Guiseppe's file. Seizing her chance she takes Gerry's file.In this file, she finds a statement confirming Gerry's aliby with a hand written note attached signed by the Police officer in charge of the case stating that this document was "Not to be shown to the defence".The case went back to court and all parties where freed because the case was thrown out in MINUTES. The Police officer who framed all involved retired from the service on health grounds and was never brought to justice.This film damns the British Justice system in a way seldom seen before on film. It does not in any way glamourise the IRA or is it "out to get" the British Government or the Crown Prosecution Service. It simply tells the story of people who where in the wrong place at the wrong time. These people had their lives destroyed just so the police could say that they had caught the Guilford bombers - who where never found.Serious stuff!</fullReview>

The UK judicial system shook to its core when the revelations about this innocent people come to the surface. The impact of the movie was also deepened when the hero's father died because of illness while serving his imprisonment(that's why I think they name this movie 'In the name of the Father').

Which happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. After begin forced to sign an agreement saying they are guilty, Gerry finds his dad Giuseppe travels from Ireland to help him. A relationship which grows stronger within their time together.Together charged life in prison Gerry and Giuseppe find it would be easier if they had been guilty for they would have been respect by the other criminals. Yet even though they find it hard Giuseppe keeps his religion and has something to believe in. where as Gerry doesn't seem to see the light.Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson). A lawyer with great hope for Giuseppe. She dint give up on the case and kept fighting. She believed they were innocent and stood her grounds. Sometimes she had to play dirty in order to find justice and to show innocents. This showed that throughout this case there may have been no justice. In the name of the father has shown facts surrounding the Guildford four but mainly shows upon the relationship between a father and son. A relationship that through time grew stronger. Once Giuseppe found to be sick he knew his time was to be short, within this time Gerry and his self started to respect and trust each other more, Gerry found himself looking after his father making sure he stayed well. Once Giuseppe passed Gerry found he fought for what was right and teamed up with Gareth Pierce to fight for justice.All prevailed when folders were found with markings stating not to show the defendant. Justice was found and the 4 bombers known as the Guildford four. They were then released after few having to serve up to 14 years in imprisonment. From then Gerry vowed to fight for his father's right, in the name of his father.</fullReview>

He has robbed a prostitute, he was not always respectful of his family. That does not make him or his friends IRA bombers.He spends 15 years in prison, as does some of his friends. His father, Guisseppie dies while in prison. He had been ill prior to all of the 1974 occurrences. When Gerry is finally freed, he is older, different, more grown up. How could you not expect a major change, given all he experienced? The soundtrack is very good, especially to someone who grew up with Irish freedom music. My father taught how bad policies were and I took a class to learn more about it. He always had a name for the English government aka "the bloody Brits". He always had respect for the people, not blaming them for a bad government.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing Film About the Triumph of Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following closely on the heels of another movie about the IRA, 1992's "The Crying Game," came Jim Sheridan's effective and rousing "In the Name of the Father," the true story of a group of men wrongly accused of participating in a series of IRA bombings.This film is fun to watch for its period detail and for the predictably excellent performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. But Emma Thompson, playing the attorney of Day-Lewis and his father (Pete Postlethwaite), though given a much smaller role, really brings some fire to the proceedings through her energetic performance. Thompson had just been discovered by American audiences in "Howards End" the year before, and was also winning acclaim in "The Remains of the Day" even as she was making her appearance in this one, and it was refreshing to see her in a more contemporary role.Though nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Thompson) and Best Director, the film was shut out.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Sheridan's movies in general, but I liked this one.Grade: A</fullReview>

Rather I found , and this is a good thing, the unusual fact that the main characters was NOT saints and NOT "good guys". Daniel Lewis small-town-criminal-loser guy is annoying, immature and not very nice. He is not very smart, he is steeling, starts a riot and think it fun, he steels a lot of money from a prostitute.. Not even the hippies like him and his friend, because these Irish criminal guys are a bit to rough. Also , in prison, Levis is arguing like a teenager with his father, most for the sake that his father is "too weak". Also, the main character do drugs. All together I find the characters realistic instead of "saints". Sure, after some years the main character starts to mature bit for bit, but this is described in a subtle way.This is also what I like with this movie - it is not so polished, the main characters is no saints, actually they are annoying criminals - but this also makes us understand why they was perfect as easy targets to blame for something they wasn't guilty for.</fullReview>

The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, and Pete Postlethwaite were simply incredible, and I even got a minute or two of Saffron Burrows as a London hippie.What makes this film so much more that a slam at British injustice in the face of terror, is that it is also a portrait of American injustice against Blacks. In the haste to get convictions and convince the public that they are competent, both systems use the same techniques.What is also common to both systems is the fact that after gross injustice is discovered, the prosecutors and police escape unharmed; while the lives of their victims are ruined forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Legal system rots because people don't empathize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerry Conlon is a small time thief and happy-go-lucky man in Ireland. He attracts a lot of attention of the Britian occupied Ireland authorities and IRA because of his loud behavior. Gerry's father, Guisseppe, sends his son to Britain thinking it would be a little less dangerous for his accident prone son. Little does he know that Gerry's behavior will result in Gerry, his friends and himself landing up in the jail falsely accused of planting bombs. Police tortures and makes a scapegoat out of this bunch of innocent people. Guissepe dies in the jail fighting against the ruling with a lawyer, Gareth Peirce. It takes 14 years for the court to dismiss the case against the innocent people. Based on a true story. Its a very thought provoking film. This film reminds me of a very good Indian film 'Andha Kanoon'(Blind Law). There is a fantastic line in the title track of the film which says "Jail Main Kitne Log Sade, Sooli Pe Nirdosh Chadhe"(so many innocent people have rotted in the Jails and hung on the line). That exactly is the theme of this film. I rented this film to understand the IRA conflict but this film taught me more than that. It is so scary to see people dwelling in the jail for the crimes they have not committed. This film is an example that we are goofed up as human beings and not as Indians or Americans or Britishiers. Every Country has a legal system which can be manipulated and used by influential people. It raises the same age old question again "Is the legal system working for human beings?". My answer to that is "Its not". Indian philosophy behind the legal system is "better ten guilty men go free rather than one innocent man die". This philosophy is just as good as "love thy neighbors" and is practically as feasible. All countries have problems with their neighboring countries and thousands dwell in the jails because no one cared to fight for their freedom. Our legal system need drastic changes. I think the only way is UN but UN itself needs a lot of reformations. A very well deserved 7 Oscars nominations. Why Didn't get a single finally?. Simple. There was Schindler's list and obviously any anti-Hitler or anti-Stalin film is an all Oscar winner. Remember Hitler was an imperialist and England and America dropped an H-bomb for the freedom of the mankind? Daniel Day-Lewis as Gerry is very good. Pete Postlethwaite as Guisseppe is also very good. I think the biggest challenge for the director was to show 35 years old Daniel Day lewis a young Gerry Conlon and then about 40 years old during the trial. I think Daniel, make-up crew and cameraman did a fantastic job in that area. Pete was just wonderful when he played an unhealthy old man. Very good acting. Riot scenes were very well done and 'Voodoo child' really worked. This was my first Emma Thompson film. All the reviews I read before the watching the film were written as if Emma was the central character. She obviously is a good actor but I don't understand what was that euphoria about. I went online to check if she is a 'Paris Hilton' kind of celebrity (people you can never figure out what they actually do) but even that was not true. I think its one of those unsolved mysteries of life.Anyways. A very good film. 9 on 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Central message is delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off as this is a movie obviously it is not 100% accurate.The film makers recognise that this will be the case though and make it in such a way that the main message does get through.The movie couldn't have been made without mentioning the violence in the North etc. but this isn't really what its about.It is about the failings of the British legal system ,and the injustice that led to completely innocent people spending up to 15 years in prison for something they had nothing to do with, whilst the real bombers continued their campaign.It just goes to show what mass hysteria will do.In reality there were 4 main culprits carrying out most of these bombings and yet Gerry Conlon and the rest were locked up for being in the vicinity of the bomb,and being Irish.That was their crime.I see reviews here moaning about how it was from the Irish side only etc. but this is unsurprisingly from English people.Its a FACT that the English legal system sent these people to rot knowing full well that they were innocent.What does that say about them?It would lead you to question every court decision ever made in Britain.Also someone else complained about the English always being shown in a bad light etc.Thats because this is the way they have carried on for years but they don't like to hear the truth.There were a handful of terrorists going around carrying out these bombings which I am horrified by as innocent people were killed, but it must be remembered that this was a drop in the ocean as to what has been carried out in Ireland by the British over the years.It would also make you wonder what would drive these people to such lengths as to feel they needed to bomb innocent civilians in order to be heard.All in all this movie succeeds in creating a picture of the chaos of the time and showing the effect that the injustice had on the lives of those wrongly accused without vilifying anyone in particular.</fullReview>

All of a sudden, the oppression of the Irish people is somehow made to be their own fault. In the meeting with the attorney, Gerry has "an attitude", and it is all his fault for not having "faith in himself". What on earth does this mean, in his situation?? Why must our culture always demonize people for fighting back and standing up for themselves? The performances were top-class by all players. But the caricature and demonization of the IRA man was this film's U-Turn into sentimental mediocrity, and an offense against the people who continue to suffer what it portrays.</fullReview>

A petty thief sure... but a murderer? They had no hardcore evidence and judging from the film the police looked as though they were just doing a 9-5 working day shift.Day-Lewis who was just brilliant and is always brilliant in his films captured Conlon to the bone.The story is such a tale of injustice and the only reason he was put in jail is because he was Irish.I am so glad that this film was made as it finally reflects to the world what England were really like to the Irish. Instead of the whole world blaming the IRA for everything.After saying I must admit fair play to the recent government for apologizing to the Conlon Famliy and the 'Guildford Four'.

		<shortDescription>An injustice that still reverberates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"In the Name of Father" is the one of the greatest movies ever to be filmed. It is based on a true story about an injustice of mammoth proportions committed against four innocent individuals. The corrupt roots of the law enforcement poison the lives and psyches of Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Carole Richardson popularly known as 'The Guildford Four'. Among others including Gerry' father , The Guildford Four are sentenced to imprisonment for a crime they didn't commit. The movie is a painful journey through the lives of these four until their kith and kin manage to garner sufficient public voice and evidence leading to their eventual release. Gerry loses his father to the cruelties of prison life which poignantly portrays the resignation of innocence. A determined lawyer , energetically played by Emma Thompsonm, finally manages to secure the release of the four after 15 years of suffering and trauma. But 15 years is a behemoth of a price for a little indiscretion on part of the judicial system.Although I will confess to being a self-absorbed individual , this movie made me wanna fight for The Guilford Four cause. Apparently, the events have been doctored only slightly to suit move making. The fact that a British Prime Minister offered an apology is but an epitome as to how entrenched the tragedy was. The bearing that the 15 years might have had on the psyche of the individuals is unfathomable. After I watched the movie , I spent hours contemplating on Gerry Conlon and the loss he suffered.Daniel Day Lewis is simply stunning . Not only does he carry the film, he makes it the masterpiece that it is. The supporting cast aren't far behind either. And Emma Thompson just bursts into the scene with great fervor. The soundtrack was pretty impressive too , particularly the score by Sinead 'O Connor. With all this behind such a stunning piece of art , the Academy' move in 1993 puzzled me. Schindler's List , however, I guess solves the puzzle.10/10 really</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Sin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Day-Lewis is Gerry Conlon, a Belfast Catholic. He's a young guy who leads a reckless life, throwing rocks gleefully at British armored cars, stealing from a prostitute's apartment. But things are getting rough in Belfast. A resolution has just been passed that allows for the arrest and retention of suspected terrorists for seven days without charge. (Seven days, nothing. How about infinity? Betrayed by neighboring and competitive falafel-stand owner, the despicable and damned-forever Shaymala, who is forever after me. May her tribe be cursed. Signed: Abdul Abulbul Amir, Guantanamo.) Well, Day-Lewis ships over to London where he leads a reckless, heedless, drug- and booze-besotted, frolicsome, life of hippiedom in a shoddy commune of like-minded dope-smoking friends. We don't believe in eating animals. Only love.The next thing he knows, he's in the slams with his father. He's been convicted of setting off a bomb in a pub, and his Da of running a safe house.The scene in which the explosion occurs is very well done. Here is the happy, fur-bedecked Day-Lewis in the equivalent of Central Park or Golden Gate Park, having his usual unthinking good time, when there comes to the gay group a distant but loud THUMP. They rise and look grimly in the direction of the sound. "Sounds like Belfast," says one of them.It would have been easy to make the Crown the heavy and the poor IRA folk the awesome victims, but that's not what this is about. It's about the relationship between Day-Lewis, a delinquent, and his father, Pete Postelthwaite, who committed sins a long time ago.Inmates have an interesting subculture. And it's different, evidently, from one country to another. These inmates are almost benign compared to Americans. American inmates have ritual verbalisms that excuse their acts -- murder or whatever. "It wasn't personal." (Probably taken from "The Godfather.") Or, "He had no business being there." American cops have the same convention: "It was just a natural act," said when a police officer shoots or beats the crap out of a bystander. No problem. If one inmate has a fit and falls down an iron staircase, another inmate who witnesses it might -- might -- call the center and say, "Somebody just fell down," without helping. And the slams themselves are better kept up in Britain than in all but the newest slams in America. The direction is zippy without being maddening, and the acting superb. It's well worth seeing.</fullReview>

I then thought the US are the worst "democracy" on Earth. After this film I can say the UK is just the same, spoiled and dirty. Who started the Iraq war? USA and UK, of course. Bliar and Bush must have a feeling...A real teaching on the, so called "British Empire" and the "Queen", such a funny joke, filling up the UK tabloids with her family affairs. And the courts... looking more like the '700 (don't they look ridiculous with their blond wig) than a modern democracy.I am not saying this, the movie says "Fucking Government" (quoted) and they are right. 15 years of Jail and not a pound back, the poor father died and never proclaimed innocent, the corrupt police, using methods, not even imagined in the worst African dictatorships, not condemned for a week of prison.The film gives you an idea of how UK was and is today... a mass of ignorant people voting for the best looking candidate.As an European, I really would be happy if the UK went out, as this country has nothing to share with the real Swedish, Finnish, French, Italian and German democracies today.Just a slave of Bush, just an exploiter of its colonies, conquered with blood, with people slowly working 7 hours a day.What a beautiful country...

		<fullReview>This is a terrific movie and the acting is just outstanding. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the finest actors in the world and he never makes a misstep in a role. He had just come off of making "The Last of Mohicans" and when "In the Name of the Father" was cast he suggested Pete Postlethwaite for the rold of Guiseppe Conlan. Postlethwaite had a very small role in "Mohicans" but he he got an Oscar nomination for "Father" and his career took off. No doubt he sends Day-Lewis a Christmas gift every year (if he doesn't, he should!).The movie has two parallel stories---the Conlans' fight to clear their names and the contentious relationship between the father and son. I thought that the most powerful scene in the movie was when Guiseppe and Gerry are put into a cell together for the first time. Gerry, who's already been severely tortured, is scared out of his wits and begins railing against his father, letting all of his resentments towards his father boil out. Guiseppe stoically takes the verbal abuse until Gerry breaks down and falls into his father's arms. In the end he is a frightened child, clinging to his father for protection. Just a tremendous acting job by both men. An interesting trivia aside, Gerry's buddy in the movie, Paul Hill, later married one of Bobby Kennedy's daughters. When he was tortured to confess he not only confessed to the Guilford bombing but to killing a Belfast police officer. Of course he was exonerated of the bombing but amazingly the British gov't fought to make the police officer murder charge stick, claiming apparently that even though Hill was tortured to confess falsely to the bombing, that his tortured confession to the other murder was acceptable to convict him. The higher court finally threw out the conviction and Hill was finally free. "In the Name of the Father" is a movie that will make you angry. And it will also move you as a tremendous portrayal of a relationship between father and son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely dreadful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many reviews say that words cannot accurately describe this movie, and they would be correct. I, however, will give it a try. I first saw this movie some 20+ years ago and I found it to be a long, plodding, go- nowhere film where the outcome was predictable from the start and unraveled so formulaic it could have spewed from the powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack. It was over-acted at numerous times, some of the conversations were simply not believable (did George Lucas write some of this dialogue?) and there were too many unnecessary close-ups for dramatic effect. Having not read the book (as I was unaware at the time I first viewed it that there was one) and no knowledge of the individuals or events that would comprise the film, the filmmakers needed to do a better job of having viewers care about the characters, their struggles, and their fates. Instead, I found the film to be preachy (can't stress that enough), one-sided and ultimately boorish. Fast forward 20 years.Recently, I had the opportunity to view this film again and thought that maybe 20 years of maturity on my part would let me see this film through a different lens and possibly appreciate (at the very least) the intention of the filmmakers. This time was, indeed, different. I was in my house and in control of the remote. After 20 minutes, I just couldn't take it anymore. Daniel Day Lewis and company - you all owe me 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life and I want it back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing but the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A little better than average dramatization about a true story involving a tragedy which not only involved the people accused but many others.The story is basically a father and son story. Daniel Day-Lewis plays an immature man who was wrongly accused and convicted of murder, along with his father as a co-conspirator.Bear in mind, that this story could have been told in many ways. It could have focused on the political aspects or it could have been told from the point of view of the bombing's victims, or rather their next of kin. That could have been a good film as well.As it is, it's pretty good. Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give it their all but there are a number of sub stories that weigh the whole thing a bit down. For example, the IRA man responsible for the bombing. He is such a clich character, the godfather within the prison, that distracts from the main story. He is merely a catalyst for making Postlewaithe look that much more sympathetic in the eyes of his son.Secondly, the prison stuff drags on too long. We are hit over the head with what a depressing place this is. A few omissions would have been nice, especially the fight scenes.Finally, the courtroom finale is utterly unexciting. Since it never happened the way it is portrayed, why not have a little fun with it. Emma Thompson is a good enough actor, but the performance definitely did not warrant an Oscar nomination and the judge could have had some better lines. Why not make him a bit more gruff? Other than these points there is enough to enjoy. The interaction between father and son is terrific. Plus an exceptional performances by the women in Day-Lewis' family. The grandmother, especially, is terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is no surprise that Peter Postlewaite O.B.E. was rated as one of Steven Spielberg's favorite actors. He gives an understated and well deserved academy award nomination for his performance as the father of Daniel Day-Lewis's character. You learn to easily accept them as father and son in this film. They work very well together. Emma Thompson also get a supporting role as the British lawyer who helps Gerry get out of prison and exonerated for the crimes. The film pulls no punches about the violent persuasion into making a false confession. It breaks your heart to see lies, propaganda, and innocent people going to prison for crimes they didn't commit in the first place but it does happen all the time which is why I am against capital punishment in my country for that reason. The film earned several academy award nominations including for best actor in which Daniel Day Lewis also became a naturalized Irish citizen. He would seem an unlikely candidate for British knighthood like his grandfather now. The film is more relevant today than when it was released. Terrorism has returned with a vengeance. People seem willing to put innocent people behind bars because of their ethnicity. We must learn a valuable lesson in not judging a book by its cover. In the meantime, prison life was not enjoyable but neither torturous. Both Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon are in prison together which makes the situation bearable. In fact the other prisoners are more decent and hospitable than the men who put the innocent men there in the first place. Gerry does honor his father's memory by clearing his injustice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having lived through this whole period as an Irishman in Britain I could smell the authenticity of the film, from the drug-addled squats of the early 1970s to the joy experienced by so many Irish people when the Guildford 4, the Birmingham 6 and all the other Irish people who were framed were finally released because the lies were no longer plausible enough.The acting is superb beyond belief and some of the scenes are so harrowing that they aren't easy watching, particularly if you have, like me, shared a milieu with people like Gerry Conlon. You get the feeling:"It could so easily have been me, since they were just looking for some Irish people to set up."Despite criticisms that the screenwriters rejigged parts of the story to make them more dramatic (and to edit a few details that might have distracted attention from the main story - after all, real life is messier than the movies) I don't remember similar criticisms when history was rewritten to make it more dramatic in films like Zulu, Rorkes's Drift, Young Winston or Lawrence of Arabia, which tend to fit better into the British imperial self-image.A highly political film, but still highly effective on a personal level. The central performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting. And the soundtrack adds brilliantly to the atmosphere. A must for all fans of political films.</fullReview>

There are good cops but also bad ones who either don't care if they arrest the wrong people or who intentionally do. There are bad judges and juries and prosecutors who want more notches in their legal belts more than they want justice.Both the US and England have seriously flawed criminal justice systems. It is hard for me to believe I ever believed otherwise. Good cops and good lawyers and decent judges need to challenge ones who are not. They need to speak out and dare to tell the truth about the corruption in the system instead of cowardly hiding their heads in the sand.From personal experience I know of a tragic wrongful conviction and have heard of others through my work and education.This film along with others such as Hurricane Hunters are wake-up calls to citizens who want some semblance of honesty in the judicial process. The US is in the grip of the best corruption money can buy from the top down so it's hard to be hopeful.</fullReview>

Although Conlon is innocent and the police have found a witness who corroborated his story, he is convicted of murder and sent to prison along with his friends and members of his family, considered accessories. Gerry and his father Giuseppe, an Irishman with an Italian first name, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite, end up in prison together, and much of the film revolves around father-son conflict and eventual reconciliation prior to the father's death, hastened by abusive prison treatment. Eventually, a British lawyer (Emma Thompson) takes up their case and, by luck, discovers a file "not to be shown to the defense" which confirms that police found Conlon's witness and had his statement confirming Conlon's alibi. The prisoners are ordered released after 15 years while the police who gave false evidence against them are acquitted. The terrorism committed by the Irish Republican Army was deadly. Mistreatment of suspects by investigators was routine. And violation of the Rule of Law was forgiven by British juries. Unbelievable? Unfortunately not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just really goes to show what kind of horrible acts of cruelty and inhumanity can happen even in so-called 'civilized' societies. A perfect example of injustice. But still the film did not intrigue me quite as much as other 'innocent-people' films I've seen. My personal favorite is Murder in The First. Go see that one if you liked in the name of the father.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honourable piece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an account of a true story, this movie has to be assessed both as a film in it's own right and as a historical documentation which reflects the reality of the events.On the first count, it is excellent: Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis sympathetically portray the wrongfully imprisoned father and son and wonderfully develop their relationship from warring factions to reconciliation with love and respect for each other. The film is clear in it's position and focuses on this angle, keeping many of the judicial complications to a minimum and works well because of it. Demonstrating the closeness that can be between people achieved against tremendous adversity and condemnation.As a direct result of this, the film suffers from the factual angle, mainly because Gerald and Giuseppe were never actually imprisoned together. However, other than this, the story seemed to stay fairly close to the main historical facts surrounding the Guildford 4 trial and should be commended for trying to inform about this tragic happening, rather than glorify it in order to attract viewers.All in all, Jim Sheridan and everyone who worked on this film should feel proud of what they have created, a film which informs and entertains both as a factual account of events and as a tale of tolerance and acceptance both socially and within the family unit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unimpressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Troubles is a recurring subject in Irish/British film making and one can't say In The Name Of The Father is the pick of the bunch with regards to this matter. It even is a bit surprising that it receives such raving critics when the movie has such little impact on the viewer.The plot's introduction doesn't augur anything good and you wonder where Jim Sheridan wants to take you to. The script then shifts to a prison chronicle ? which turns out to be the real nature of the film ? that blatantly lacks intensity and most importantly rhythm, a lot of scenes being not that pertinent. It is also regrettable that the movie is sometimes caricatural, for example with the trial scenes which aren't that well depicted.What to draw then from this film ? not much, only the good performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and especially Pete Postlethwaite, already dazzling at the time, manage to save the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>words cannot describe how i feel about this film. i am a great fan of true stories and also prison films such as the green mile and shawshank redemption. but this film tops the list. it has been my favourite film since 1993 and 11 years on and i feel as strongly about it. it still has the power to make me feel emotional by the end of the film. it is without a doubt the most moving, powerful film i have ever had the priveledge to watch.the story, in short, is about a man wrongly imprisoned for 15 years, along with his father and 3 friends, and their fight for justice. i would recommend that everybody buy this film on DVD and take great care of it as their are not enough films of this caliber in the world. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Name of the Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot), I only discovered while watching what the theme was, but the leading star was the hook for me. Based on the true story, from the autobiographical book by the leading character called "Proved Innocent", Gerry Conlon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) is a small time crook living in Belfast, Ireland. After a IRA bombing of a pub killing several people in London, where Gerry is, he and four of his friends, and three other men, all named the "Maguire Seven" are made to look like, by the bullying police, to have carried out and confess to the crime. Gerry, his father Giuseppe (Oscar nominated Pete Postlethwaite), known IRA member Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) and the other four are falsely imprisoned for a sentence of fifteen years. Knowing their innocence, they are not all keen on prison life, so they start appealing for a case to prove themselves, with the help of compassionate British attorney Gareth Peirce (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson). Trying to help Gerry, who has recently lost his father in the prison cells, Gareth has to get through to the leader of the investigation, Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave), in order to get a case going. It is when covered up evidence appears that Gareth truly knows she has a chance to win the case and clear Gerry, his late father, and the others' names, and she does. Also starring Sliding Doors' John Lynch as Paul Hill, Mark Sheppard as Paddy Armstrong, Beatie Edney as Carole Richardson, Marie Jones as Sarah Conlon, Britta Smith as Annie Maguire, Father Ted's Gerald McSorley as Detective Pavis, Saffron Burrows as Girl in Commune, Johnny English director Peter Howitt as Remand Prison Officer and The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson as Appeal Prosecutor. I'm afraid to say, that in certain moments, I agree with the critics that Thompson is miscast for her role, she may have some okay moments worthy of an Oscar nomination, but ultimately she just feels wrong. Anyway, Day-Lewis is a really good choice for the lead protagonist, Postlethwaite does very well as well, and I suppose it is a biographical drama that should be seen, at least once in my opinion. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for "(You Made Me The) Thief of Your Heart". Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has is the most inspiring, riveting and thought provoking film i have ever seen. At first viewing i didn't realise it was a true story until i read the ending and to find out that all this was true was just so astonishing. My favourite quote comes from Emma Thompson who plays Gareth in the court scene at the end where she says "their only mistake was that they were bloody well Irish." Did you notice that the people who said it was political nonsense and biased were all English? Yes it told the Irish account of what happened but the fact still remains that the English used the four Irish innocent people as scapegoats so as that they wouldn't have to find the real people who did it and even when they did find those responsible they didn't do anything about it. I think you just don't like being shed in a bad light. All in all it remains one of the best films i have ever seen and am likely to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so much for civilized England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We Americans often like to think of England as the most civilized place on Earth. "In the Name of the Father" shows that this is unfortunately not true. It's the true story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a rowdy Northern Irishman who got imprisoned by the British government for a crime that he didn't commit. Specifically, they tortured him to the point that he signed a confession. So, he was sent to jail with some other Northern Irish people - including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) - and forced to experience fifteen years of brutality from every angle.This is one of those movies that cuts right to the heart of a touchy issue. Regardless of which opinion you take of the situation in Northern Ireland, this is a movie that everyone should see, just to understand the cruel lengths to which governments can go when they think that they're right. I've heard Daniel Day-Lewis described as the world's most devoted actor; "In the Name of the Father" certainly backs that up, and I would definitely say that this is Jim Sheridan's best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just.....Not up to Snuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite good acting, I didn't really care much about the main character. Lots of pain and struggle, but it wasn't touching or whatever that magical quality is that makes a person WANT to watch the pain of a drama. I gave up halfway through.wasn't worth the time and frustration.The picture quality sucked. Hook it up to your stereo, blast the volume, and then listen to the voices as a whisper. This gritty, gut-wrenching film was difficult to watch then and has remained so even with the passage of almost 20years. Sure the politics of the period featured heavily but for me the movie was about the turbulent love that existed between father and son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>another piece of selective filmmaking. Anyone ask why all films about Northern Ireland are from a Republican perspective ? if not you owe it to yourself to find out the truth.This is based on the truth...in that there is a place called Northern Ireland..and then it gets a bit hazy. This is irresponsible, nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True it was a well made film with strong performances from Postelwaite and Lewis, however the one sided story favoring the Irish was nothing more than a film makers political agenda. I am sick and tired of films making Great Britain out to be the villians and the Irish holier than thou martyrs.Just once I would like to see England defended in one of these big budget films.No one country is innocent.The obvious Irish sympathies in this film make it unwatchable.Not once is England portrayed in this film as anything but a stock villian! Wake up people this film is nothing but Irish propaganda.</fullReview>
