		<shortDescription>Forget the marketing and chatter, there is a real film here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script is laughable and the acting (often voice-over), too. The 3D sex is well marketed. And yes, during certain scenes people got up and left. Yet. The film doesn't argue to be anything beyond a meandering stroll into the gallows melancholy. And it does this very very well. The film features no highbrow intellectual conversations but instead, favors the same lines you've probably slung at your lovers. Again and again and again. Just like the sex you've had with your lovers again and again and again. You know their bodies and you know how to please them and above all, you know how to hurt them. Sorrow. There's a resplendent simplicity here that hypnotizes the viewer.You hear music banging inside the club, yet the lovers are outside in halflight. Having sex, obviously. This is a good image of what this film surprisingly achieves best: intimacy. And it fights for that with it's magnificent camera-work and editing.But what would this review be if it didn't talk about the 3D sex? Love and cinema are inseparable. Love stories are why you stick glued to a chair for a couple of hours. Raw sex is part of love, yet, films used to cut to birds necking after a kiss. Then it became steamy windows. Signs, metaphors, analogies, semiotic nausea. And here, Noé takes that away which makes the film even coarser, and ultimately more brutal.I wanted to write this review because the whole marketing ("finally a love story restricted for -16) and shock value (an eye-rolling warning in the opening credits) have cheapened what this film has achieved and I encourage viewers to look beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch porn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have nothing against sex. I love it, I love watching it but this was painful. The sex was hot but the story and the acting was terrible. I think it was not worth it and very very long. I can see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark. For the same kind of story with the sex dial down and the story dial up I would suggest The Dreamers. This story could be told in about 30 min, add maybe 30 min to get invested in the characters and that would be good. 2h is way to long for this and 5 min sex scene every 10 min is too much. Like the title says. Watch porn it will be more fulfilling.Now for the actual review. The plot is simple. It is a guy reflecting on a past relationship. The guy is a little to dysfunctional to be in a healthy one but it is not extreme. The only real question you have during the movie does not get answered and that is about it. I would not recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Self-Indulgent Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one was able to walk out of the theater this evening as the director Gaspar Noe was in the audience. I'm certain he took note of folks laughing at scenes meant to have profound emotional impact, like the entire ending. Little character development with the main character's 17 yr old wife, or 18, they had sex when she was 16, nothing more than a prop. Their child, the unintended creation of a broken condom, is named "Gaspar". The wife is an orphan of sorts, unwanted by her mother but somehow has the cash and wherewithall to rent an apt in Paris and do nothing more than go clubbing, listen to her iPod and bang strangers. Profoundly self-indulgent about lost love, but hard to take seriously when the lost love happens between supposed college students (we never see the college, college books or a single classmate) living and partying in Paris, none of whom even are even remotely worth caring about. Except perhaps the teenage wife, after she gives birth, but again her only role is to get banged, have a kid and though otherwise absolutely gorgeous, kind and loving as only a supermodel with minimal lines can be, this one only serves to annoy the hell out of the main character. Reminded me of Brown Bunny, but that was a film with guts. This is just an excuse to film cumshots in 3D, wrapped around a plot that never went anywhere with no sense of finality or a hint of revelation or completion. In fact, the movie had to flash a massive THE END for the audience to know the film was over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filmmaking at its worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a point when the main character and voice-over narrator on Love says that he never sees a movie presenting "emotional sexuality". Sex, semen and blood, that's what people would like to see. Murphy is a filmmaker, or so he says. Actually, I think he is just a puppet to Gaspar Noé intents in this too stereotyped film that had the big ambition to be innovative.Love has been creating some noisy around the world, and has been like that since its premiere during Cannes. Explicit sex and love scenes on 3D, that is how the movie has been known mostly. Despite the bad reviews, I thought it would be at least interesting. It wasn't, at all.Before the first scene, there's a sign announcing the moment to put the 3D glasses on. And so the terrible nonsense begins. At the very begin I've already realized this movie is just noisy. The sex is explicit and so, so boring, that I was begging to the characters to finish their business as soon as possible. What was announced as innovative, is just a bunch of clichés put together. It is filmmaking in its worse. Gaspar Noe thinks he knows so much, and that he is above the other mere mortals. His condescending arrogance is staggering, actually. I imagine him thinking: this world is so mediocre, full of prude hypocrites, I'll show them how it's done and make a movie about excruciating love and sex. So he started to write it and finally realized it wouldn't be so easy. To talk about life, and love, and sex it is necessary to be really alive, and not just criticizing the other's ways from outside. Unable to write a true love sexy story, he decided then to check every box that came to his mind relating to sex: explicit scenes, close on dicks, threesome, sex clubs, homosexual sex, trannies, public sex and so on. As if a close on a ejaculating dick would be the quintessence of a revolutionary speech. There's a bunch of unrelated scenes, as if the awful voice-over could succeed in giving them some meaning. An example: at one scene, the couple are lying on bed after sex, and from nothing, the guy asks the girl about her biggest fantasy. Sexual? she replies. Of course, he says. And she tells him how that she would like have sex with him and a third woman, a blond with blue eyes. The next day or so, they are getting their mail when they meet the new neighbor: a sixteen blue eyed blond that are living next door. After the badly filmed threesome, the guy says: thanks for Europe! (a place where eh would have a three way sex with a minor). Did you get the image? So.Gaspar Noé, by his main character, affirms that there's not sexual love stories on the screen. I think he never saw any of Bernardo Bertolucci's movies. Or the Spanish/French production Sex and Lucía, a beautiful story about love with stunning and heartfelt sex scenes (Paz Vega is incredible). Or even Betty Blue, for everybody's sake. Or even 9 Songs - even with all the bad reviews, this one is actually honest. Sorry the rage, but it is inevitable. Noé should look better around him, or, even better, he should head to the DVD section on a store and just see how wrong he is. I've read how the acting here is terrible, and it is a fact. The actors are not even able to walk naturally (it is so staged that hurts), let alone show deep feelings or have real sex. And despite what has been said, I don't think it is difficult to find good actors that would accept to be a part of this project if it was a good one. At least his protagonist should have been more endearing - even if I'm not sure that it would have saved this doomed story anyway. Because the problem here is not just the bad acting, the lousy dialogues, the incredibly lousy and staged sex scenes. The main trouble in this movie is the sexist, arrogant, wrongful view about the world and people. And when a filmmaker start this way, there's nothing that can save him from the impending doom. People were leaving the theater constantly, they were dropping like flies. However, rather than doing that by how explicit the sex is, I think people did leave for the sole reason of how bad is this movie. It's unbearable in fact. And we see no end to it, two hours and fifteen minutes of sheer bad filmmaking. Not could be more far from deep emotion, an intense love story and visceral sex.

		<shortDescription>Thin plot, bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I fell for the marketing, and I have to admit the idea behind the film still seems OK. The 3D effects were good &amp; not overdone. On the other side: I found the script / plot to be thin, and the acting and voice overs were terrible. I got the idea this was a movie made by an American director who was trying to make a 'european' style movie but didn't succeed. Afterwards I read the director is French (born in south America).The movie lasts more than 2 hours, but there is no suspense, no buildup, etc. Karl Glusman (the lead actor) is not credible in this role, the emotions don't seem real and his voice-overs are even worse. His character begin a 'movie director' or something of the kind seems almost irrelevant and implausible.After an hour, the movie started getting tedious as it was obvious this 'wasn't going anywhere'. I don't recommend seeing it, unless you're only interested in the raw sex in 3D (but remember... it's more than 2 hours you have to sit through).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just come back from the UK Premier, I can honestly say, that was quite simply appalling. Only Kill Your Friends is a worse film of 2015.I absolutely loved Enter the Void with a passion, the poster has been my iPhone screen saver ever since. It was slick, stylish, sexy and trippy.Love, however fails to deliver on so many levels. I get what the director was trying to achieve here, but it just doesn't work due to the appalling acting from the very unlikable main character. Where on earth did they get him from? Was he the only actor who was willing to show his erect cock on the cinema screen? His lines are delivered with such a flat misanthropic moribund tone that you can't believe anything he says. The voice over just adds to the car crash. Its a film which lacks any real emotion or chemistry.If you want to watch a gritty film with real emotions watch Blue is the Warmest Colour and 9 Songs. Caspar Noe, you have let us done badly here. Go back to making in your face trippy films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is literally a 90 minute porno hiding behind a 2 hour art film. Everything about it is bad. The editing is horrific, every single shot is separated by a half second of a pure black screen. The script is bad. BAAAD. No one has anything resembling a likable personality, there is no plot, the dialogue is stupid at best. The acting... well, these people weren't hired for their acting talent. They were hired because they were willing to get naked and have unsimulated sex on film. This film shows random sex scenes every chance it can. Also it's homophobic and transphobic, there is a scene played totally for laughs where the main guy freaks out over a transgendered woman. OH and if you're an epileptic, avoid this because the director seems to enjoy giving people seizures with random flashing lights.Literally the only thing about this that's in any way well done is the sex, and you can see better sex in actual porn films. Just go rent a porno, you'll get more enjoyment out of it and you won't have to deal with this horribly made 'film'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hottest sex scenes in a film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed, thanks to the combination of plausible courtship scenes, character development, and graphic (at least partially non-simulated) sex. Many of the sex scenes are beautiful to the point you become aware of the cinematography, though I did not feel aware of the acting at any point. A lot of the melodrama could have been edited out without impacting the plot whatsoever, not to mention some parts that are downright abusive to the viewer with blinding flashing lights, and, I suspect, some cheap abuse of 3D effects (I saw it in 2D), but then again this movie probably couldn't exist without giving the director a ton of editorial freedom. IMHO this is a must-see if you care at all about eroticism in film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Love' will most likely be discredited by many due to it's sheer honesty, like many films of it's kind are. Yet this honesty, as brutal and daring as it might seem, feels necessary to connect with and understand what the characters are going through, on an entirely new emotional level. In the words of Murphy, Gaspar Noe might have made the only movie that truly depicts 'sentimental sexuality'. 'Love' has many subtle and not-so-subtle references to the underlying story and to the director himself. Gaspar's mother is named Nora Murphy, while Murphy's son is named Gaspar and Electra's ex boyfriend - Noe. His favorite movie is Kubrick's '2001', while hers is Lang's 'M', both of which seem to fuel Murphy and Electra's behavior throughout the movie, where Murphy is often aimlessly overwhelmed with hope and desire, while Electra seems unable to forgive.Gaspar Noe constantly cuts through the past and the future, using the techniques he is so familiar with since Irreversible. The movie abruptly switches between various stages of Murphy's and Electra's relationship, always cutting back to the present, where Murphy's is in absolute emotional agony and despair, raising a child with Clara. At times Murphy and Electra are so deeply engrained in one another that their fights and dialogues seem outright comical and immature, as if we are observing a 16 year- old couple. But this is truly where 'Love' stands out. Being in love feels and looks exactly like this, it's raw, emotional and brutal yet foggy and sweet; when no one else exists or matters.In one of Electra's and Murphy's conversations they talk about the sad reality that they are going nowhere and dragging each other down, they discuss taking a break. It is an extremely sad and emotional scene, where the thought itself brings so much fear into them, that they simply end up holding each other even tighter.The script for 'Love' is only 7 pages long. It is full of beautiful and weird dialogues and extremely emotional, 'free-played' graphic scenes. These scenes however are not there to impress the viewer or open the doors to the unknown. This is also not a nymphomaniac-like sexual exploration. Gaspar Noe does a masterful job in showing us the true emotional aspect of love, in it's raw and relatable form, sex.The sound-score is stunning, with the music gradually changing depending on the mood and the context of the scenes. Even though a lot of times it seems like we are watching the same people 'fuck' in the same positions, different context, feelings and music make each of these scenes truly unique and mesmerizing on it's own. Noe also does a wonderful job in his minimalistic depiction of the story and the scenery. Murphy and Electra always wear contrasting colors, while the background is usually very simple yet fitting to them both. As if to say that when in love, everything should be seen through the eyes of the lovers. 'Love' might sometimes seem silly, overly graphic and way too sentimental, yet it hits all the right notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As thought provoking and stylish as you'd expect. Kind of like a hybrid of Enter the Void, Nymphomaniac, The Lobster and Weekend. You can feel the love that has gone into this film.The sex is both beautiful and ugly. It's not porn, more like an aestheticized version of somebody's personal sex tape, but one designed to provoke contemplation more than any other response. To feel any more real it would need to be in the style of a documentary, which would have the effect of distancing you from the characters. I didn't feel like I was experiencing the story directly (as I do with good suspense movies), but I did want things to work out well for the characters. If you judge a movie by how much the pacing and suspense immerses you, you won't enjoy Love. If you can be immersed into a movie's atmosphere and want something to feed your imagination, then you will get a lot from it.A lot of reviews and comments on IMDb seem to say it is not a thought provoking movie, or that it is pretentious, yet the poster was moved to write about their thoughts on it, so it certainly isn't empty. I found talking about it can result in the conversation going to some very interesting places.It has earned a place in the history of cinema, and is hopefully a step away from the feelings of shame people feel about sex, a step towards greater freedom in art, culture and cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love and lust, decline and fall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mild plot spoiler (and like any Noe movie I think you ought to just ignore any synopses or reviews and simply see it for yourself): this is the story of two lovers, how they meet, how their romance develops, how they learn about each others desires, their past relationships. Sex is a drug, and these characters are junkies. The first hit draws them in, and as they chase the dragon with each other, trying to make each hit as momentous as the last, their relationship evolves, blossoms, and suffers. The movie, set in Paris, moves non-chronologically through Murphy's (an American film student) recollection of his relationship with Electra, a French artist, both of them in their early or mid-20s. Scenes are strung together like jumbled photographs, pieces of each recalling or referencing another memory. The film is told from Murphy's point of view, and yet he's not a completely likable character, displaying huge streaks of jealousy and hypocrisy. Electra is mysterious at first, then we learn more as we go deeper into Murphy's memory.This is a visually beautiful movie. The lighting is dark but expressive, the framing of the scenes is exquisite, and scenes cut in and out like the blink of an eye. The opening scene is bold and erotic, but at the same time, tender and intimate. There is a lot of sex in this movie, but it's not there to be gratuitous. Each sex scene is different, portraying the desires and moods of the characters involved. Like many of Noe's movies an underlying theme is that of a stranger in a strange land. In Enter the Void, the characters are Americans in Tokyo. Here of course Murphy is struggling with his ability to handle a relationship with a French woman with more open ideas of commitment. It's not absolute though; her world is changed too by Murphy's interpretation of the very fluidity she seems to be encouraging. A particularly poignant part of of the movie has a sympathetic French policeman lecturing the hot-headed American Murphy on his aggressive and destructive attitudes about sex and relationships. At this point the officer is voicing a key part of what I think Noe's philosophy about love and sex. Murphy and Electra decide to take the officer's advice, but it doesn't quite work out as planned, and it's seems like Noe is saying, "here is how I think it ought to be, and yet I could still be wrong."At one point, Murphy asks a character what the best thing in life is, and the response without hesitation, is "Love." He follows up by asking what the second is. And without hesitation, the answer is, "sex." This movie is about love and sex, how they influence one another, and how they can destroy one another. There's a sense of humor running through the movie, which is expressed in several mild in- jokes about the director, and one particularly shocking (yet delightful: the audience at the screening I sat in erupted into happy cheers) use of 3D. It's not a movie for everyone, nevertheless it is quite a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a dreadful movie - some spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this... the IMDb description says Electra is unstable - sorry, nothing wrong with Electra... Murphy on the other hand is profoundly mentally ill. The movie should have been called "Borderline Personality Disorder". The writing is pure high school and Karl Glusman is as wooden as any slab rider on CSI. There is essentially no plot and none of the characters evokes any response in me - well maybe loathing for Murphy - what an (expletive) excretory orifice! His violence and his justification for his mindless violence - "I'm an American an we fight for what's ours blah blah" - the police don't stick him in jail but befriend him - what? He's with hot Electra and they go to a sex club - he has few women whilst there but loses his tiny mind when he finds her with a guy and a woman (a dream scenario) - hello stupid - it's Paris not Des Moines!! Why would you go/stay in Paris if you're a narrow minded pillock? This reviewing effort is far more than this abomination deserves - it's not even worth fast forwarding to the amateurish sex scenes (clearly directed by a 14 year old). In a just world this would be a career ender for all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love, as it is titled, should be called Bored Whiny Man Child. This dirge clocks in at a whopping 2 hours and 15 minutes. I had to stop, walk away for a while and then return to watch this sniffling character act out his hypocrisy in such myopic detail. The relationship between the two principal characters is like oil and water. The only thing they share is a voracious appetite for sex, lots and lots of sex. The add a third person into the mix who winds up getting pregnant by the guy which leads to the main couple breaking up. Since they all were in a ménage ? trois, that shouldn't have been an issue but it was. The female leaves him and we spend the rest of the film exploring his memories of her and him having more sex. They participate in orgies and he gets mad because she's having sex with other guys. He can had fun but she can't. If your life is nothing but the sex, why should that matter especially if he can participate and she can't? And there lies the quagmire with this presentation. This guy is totally immature. You become bored with him and with him having sex. Closeups of him with his exploding orgasms weren't shocking, innovative, wanted or move the picture along. After a while, you just want this story to just wrap up. You wonder what is the point? There is nothing redeeming about it. The other female character who has had his child is completely ignored. She is just another prop instead of exploring that dynamic of how they are dealing with a child together. Instead, we find his character crying in the bathtub with the toddler. And you have to ask yourself once again, the time he and his old girlfriend were together appears to be at least three years because you have to factor in the time the girl was pregnant and then you jump in time to see a toddler at least two years old. So why did his old girlfriend/s mother call him about her and why did he just started thinking about someone who hasn't been in his life for a long time? The writing was just poor. This guy was suppose to be some aspiring filmmaker. He is neither aspiring or making films and filming your naked girlfriend on a small video camera doesn't qualify you one bit. That aspect of the character was totally ignored as well. This was just bad. If you want to see if because of the unsimulated sex scenes, I would advise just watch some 5 minute porn clip and avoid this colossus time waster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and no I am not talking about the characters in the film, I am talking about what happens when an A-list director "falls in love" with the idea of doing a sexually explicit film.I want to be clear about this and I think the data will bear me out. Make a list of all the films in the last 100 years by A-list directors who felt confident they could infringe on territory formerly occupied only by the porn industry and still prevail with a hit film...? Are you done? I will save you time. I did the list myself. And the answer is none, zero, zip, nada.Just like there are in the porn industry a handful of directors who constantly try to push the boundaries of their craft into the mainstream (which almost always means soft light and lots of white sheets, films that most resemble a commercial for TIDE) Noe, a brilliant artiste (Irreversible and Enter the Void were both brilliant) tried to push the envelope .. and ended up with junk mail.Sure, if you are determined to see a silk purse where others are seeing a sow's ear, you could pretend that this film has a great deal to say about men's expectations about love and marriage.But this is a review just between the writer and the reader, and we respect each other too much to lie. So I will be clear -- Noe went where angels fear to tread. And ended up with a film that, for posterity, is simply not going to make his A-reel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had potential...but wastes it on cheap publicity stunts and a plot that goes nowhereA man, Murphy, is stuck in a dead-end relationship with a woman he doesn't love. The couple also have an unplanned young son, adding to Murphy's feelings of being trapped. He starts to think of his previous girlfriend - Electra, how perfect everything was, and how and why everything fell apart. Then he learns that she has disappeared...The movie had potential. The intrigue of the disappearance of Electra, the regret that their (perfect) relationship didn't work out, the suffocating relationship he is currently in, his depression over where everything has ended up - these all made for some interesting potential paths for the movie.But, alas, it was not meant to be.None of these threads go anywhere. In the end, nothing is resolved and there is no point to the whole long exercise. And, yes, it is a long exercise - 2 1/4 hours, with about half of that made up of padding. So many scenes which add nothing to the movie, and just make you more bored.From the start you know it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair - the pacing is slow from the beginning - but you hope to be rewarded with something profound at the end. No such luck.What the movie will be most remembered for is its explicit sex scenes. While not really that new anymore (Nine Songs, anyone?), many of the scenes are just there for shock / controversy / publicity value. Sad to see that Gaspar Noe has ended up making pretentious crap like this. Irreversible was brilliant and heralded Noe as director to be followed. However, since then he hasn't made a decent movie. His previous movie, Enter the Void, was even more pointless and pretentious than Love. He is turning out to be a one-hit wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I didn't try to think of the song, the line "Baby don't hurt me ... don't hurt me no more" came to mind. And it's not like it doesn't suit or fit with the movie (if you excuse the pun). And let's get this out of the way straight ahead: If you didn't or don't already know, this movie has scenes of explicit sex in it. And it begins with a masturbation scene, to shock you right out of the gate (or those who will be offended by it of course).It goes without saying that this is full of nudity. You may not have seen this actors before, but you'll see everything of them in this. It's not only being naked physically, but also mentally. Laying emotions out there and going through motions (literally and metaphorically) is draining. Both for the actors and the viewers. The story is simple. It's about love or the idea of it.Which brings us back to our initial question. Are we able to appreciate what we have? Or do we long for things we can't have? Can we be happy with the person we spend our time or is the temptation for something new too big? Obviously that depends on the individual and their "world" view. Also their emotional state. The movie is as you can tell not an easy watch ... for multiple reasons. The message is clear though ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch this movie in 3d in Mexico based on some video reviews I had seen that said it was an "experience" that had to be lived. How far was that from the truth.Love in 3d, which is the title the film had in Mexico, is a tedious, unnecessarily long film that has no real story, statement or message.Its a long porn video with a bad script. The film is supposed to pose a question about what love is, but never really addresses it or takes any kind of position about it. Furthermore, it extends its scenes way past it should. The ending sequences, for example, are just endless quasi-reiterations of the previous scenes that add nothing to the film. You think it is over, and boom! another sex sequence, and then another and another. The "cuts" the film uses are also poorly executed. I understand using the cuts for when you jump in time between the scenes but if you do not, why do you still use it? Half of the time the cuts are used, the movie does jump in time,but the other half is just an annoying blink of the screen to come back to exactly the same point.If this had been a 15 minute short then it might actually had made sense, but a 2 and a half hour long movie was definitely way more than a stretch. Save yourself the time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skip the nudity and sex for the real meat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a moment when the protagonist, American ex pat Murphy, tells his Parisian girlfriend, Alektra, that the police officer understood him and wants to have a beer sometime. This is all after a public altercation fueled by jealousy and alcohol that leaves the audience wanting to dump Murphy as well in that moment.And yet the policeman actually does share a beer with Murphy later in one of the film's more poignant scenes, sharing understanding as mutual and not simply one way or curtailed by gender stereotypes.Gaspar Noé's 'Love' is a film that thrives on shock, sentimentality and a relay of connotations. Everything is in a relationship; the characters and the big ideas it looks to tackle. There's a cynicism voiced in this film against extreme, contemporary western views (mainly American), which in a sense liberates the stigmas one might have towards perceived French social norms: love, sexuality, self expression and most importantly tact or manner.I found myself lulled by the ongoing and over-extended sex scenes, ? shot beautifully by the way ? rather than anything gratuitous coming from them. It's interesting to note that in both scenes where relationship complications arise and are dealt with, as well as the (make-up) sex, everything in these moments are left to their devices, almost playing out in real time, allowing a greater sense of empathy for the audience, even if what's on the screen is severely perverse and daring, if you happen to be a sexually active, romantically charged human being, then the director seems to take a nod in saying "Hey, this is real life." Letting these moments play out feels more thoughtful than overly intellectualizing them, almost as if to excuse the t&amp;a/c&amp;b, something Lars von Trier felt more necessary in 2013's 'Nymphomaniac', a film which will undoubtedly draw comparisons, though Love shouldn't be mistaken as such; there's no high stakes, money or power play. It's just all a bit complicated and messy. But brutally honest nonetheless.Murphy can be a little nonredeemable at times, one of the few protagonists in a while worth caring for, but hardly worth rooting for, especially when he's coming in your (the viewer's) face. It's good this movie isn't shot/screened in 3D. Also the characters are at times lost for words... as if there is a complete absence of script. This isn't an all bad thing as it makes the interactions feel more natural, however a repeated cycle of "I hate you!" for about 3 to 5 minutes straight starts to feel like a fill in the gaps exercise.Overall this film is art/indie cinema when it works best. You feel the director completely and utterly devoted to style and substance without sacrifice on either part. The casting is done well and through all the nudity no single actor or actress is relegated to feeling like they're shooting porn, something I feel a lot of critics and PC audiences will claim in their shallow analysis'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...not just to film-making as an art, but also to porn. This is by far the most deplorable excuse of a motion picture I have ever seen. The script is what a 9-year-old living in a cave without an Internet connection imagines sex to be like. I've seen better acting in Brazzers. BRAZZERS!!!! The scenes are making 80's porn look like a masterpiece. And the music?!?!? Hahahahah!! Yo, like, how old is Gaspar Noe, mid-50s? I saw he's married, but I don't think he's ever banged his wife in over 20 years and this is the closest thing of ever seeing a naked person on screen. Honestly, after seeing this, I would give Twlight an Oscar. Damn, I would Gigli one, because at least that was so bad that it was hilarious. This is just pure cringe. Don't get me wrong, I've seen Nymphomaniac, Salo, Fat Girl, Last Tango in Paris, Shame, and probably a dozen more 'art films', all good. But this is just cheese-balls central. I honestly don't see how this got Cannes recognition...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good analysis film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't quite made up my mind about this film. I don't think I've enjoyed it, however I believe it's a great film to analyse.You can definitely feel it's a Noé film, the cuts, the speed, the colors, the characters, the extra 15 min that weren't really necessary, etc.. Love - in my opinion it's a good title because I felt the couple was in love, and that this film was about love and represents a real couple, like in Blue Valentine.Sex scenes - I kind of understand it, you don't often see real couples making love in films, you just see actors compelled to look hot as hell so that everyone else that's watching feels bad about their bodies and a sexual desires. Despite all of this I think there are too many explicit scenes which add nothing to the story.Murphy - I'm not a big fan of analogies, mainly the ones that are forced just because. That said, I didn't get the analogy in the beginning, in my point of view, it has no logic. The same goes for Electra. - I felt Murphy was really in love, what I didn't get was, in the midst of almost 2h of love, why does he keep cheating. If you love someone, which he apparently does, you don't have room for some random girl, to whom you speak at a party for 5 min, that agrees with your ideas, exactly the ones your girlfriend doesn't. I didn't feel this so I don't understand his need for cheating.Voice over - I see a lot of people complaining about this, well I liked the emotion and reality it expressed, mainly when his at home with the mother of his child.There was a little annoying thing, I started feeling that this was sort of a biography of Noé, it had to many obvious details about him like it was an Ode to Noé...didn't get.Once again, I think it's a good film to analyse and think about if you have the time and interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that my comments will come off as condescending but the reality is that after reading the negative user reviews, it is obvious that the people who failed to enjoy the film are not sophisticated film enthusiasts and likely just watched because they were looking for great sex scenes. There is so much more substance to "Love" than sex. It is a film about complex human personalities, regret, consequences and most importantly, the complexity of human emotions and impulses. I know from the first few scenes that Elektra was a damaged person. Noe did such a fantastic job of getting the very best out of talent with limited experience. Perhaps that was the magic. A group of people who wanted to tell a story and didn't come to the project with baggage or egos. If you enjoy human stories and you are not uptight about the dark nature of the mind, "Love" is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was this movie made for gays and women only? If you read the" view content advisory" Here is what you will read. From the opening frame, there are several graphic sex scenes with lots of nudity.Female nudity; breasts, bottoms, and pubic hair are often shown, however there are no direct views of the vulva/vagina. Male nudity; full frontal and quite often very explicit.The film graphically deals with a past love affair that lasted for two years and saw the two main characters engage in all sorts of casual and less casual sexual practices, including an attempted threesome with a transgender person. Many of these practices are shown in graphic detail.All the sex is un-simulated (meaning the sex is really happening).In one scene two females and one male engage in a threesome.An erect penis is shown many times throughout the film.Two or three times an ejaculation is shown, including one scene where a woman's hand is scene masturbating an erect male penis (which is the only thing on screen), before the male ejaculates directly at the camera lens.Quite a lot of sexually-related talks throughout.So what could possibly be the reason for this except that it was made for gay men and straight women. The Double Standard is alive and well, even in NC-17 and NR and unrated movies.If anyone has a clue as to why it was done this way, please respond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best porn movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a 2:04 hours movie.Take out all the scenes where they present you with genitalia and you have a bit over one hour left. If it was a philosophical movie, perhaps there would be a part of the sex sequences that carried more meaning - but there is no such relief in this movie.We are presented with a stereotypical immature, selfish, arrogant, possessive young male studying cinema in Paris - apparently only to get stoned and laid. He meets this sweet, proactive, sexually empowered young woman that also enjoys drugs. Not the least stereotypical, as she falls for him with deep and unbridled love. His love is also deep but he is the villain here, so he get as many other women as the time not having sex with his official one allows.She notices it (who wouldn't, at this rate?) and tells him she also has had her escapades. He makes scene after scene, including beating up her lover (an ex- boyfriend). He tries to bully a police officer inside a police station.She stands by him in another stereotypical situation.Then this monster gets the pretty blonde underage neighbour girl pregnant. This is where she draws the line. Notwithstanding the fact that she was the one that suggested they get another woman in bed. Despite the fact that she made the move to invite the blondie.Then she goes down into a spiral of drugs and alcohol, shutting him off her life completely.Once more, stereotypes.He keeps the blondie, they have a little boy (that he names after the child he and the lost love dreamt to have together - stereotype, anyone?) and, as he drags himself in a pool of self-pity and despair (which does not go unnoticed by said blondie), comes the news that the original girl has been missing for a couple of months.Then he spends a full day calling people to try and find her. In the meanwhile, blondie leaves with the boy, telling him to finish his past so they could have a future.Obviously, he doesn't find her - which doesn't preclude his opium- induced dreams of her to interrupt all the time.There is a very awkward scene with him and the child in the bathtub, after blondie's face tells us she will leave him.And the movie ends with him and original girl embraced under the shower professing endless love and protection.Oh! Did I mention that it is partly filmed backwards, as 'Irreversible' was? By the way, they used a very similar setting - an underground passage - in one of the sequences. Check it out: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Or that this theme of intense, destructive, drugged and short-lived love was way better portrayed in 'More'? Also, a good part of the soundtrack comes from Pink Floyd.... See it: (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064694/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2In other words, apart from all the sex, this is a derivative, shallow and unworthy movie...The '3' I gave the movie is for photography and soundtrack. Really good in all scenes, conveys mood and context.The rest is crap.</fullReview>

Of course, it could have been redeemed if there had been something new about it. The problem is that it is just plain boring. The characters are tiresome and unappealing. The plot is virtually nonexistent. Yes, there is a bit of decent cinematography, but even that is pretentious and "artsy." It takes away the simple presentation of the story (such as it is), and when these flashy scenes show up, they are just such obvious eye candy. Don't bother.</fullReview>

We Americans are often considered prudish vs our European counterparts, but this film has more in common with porn than with an art film. How much does an actress get paid to swallow on camera? Compared to Irreversible in the description, in which a BRUTAL rape sequence that goes on and on, makes me wonder what people won't do on film. Surely there are redeeming qualities to the camera work and lighting, but where does the line get drawn? Snuff films??

		<fullReview>I can not believe, I am going to be the first review of this film on IMDb. Cool! OK, to the review...I saw this film at the Cannes Film Festival (Loved the festival and Cannes!) So, I and many others waited for at least an hour to watch this last showing at the festival. The movie starts off with a bang - two people pleasuring each other! And intermixed with the pleasuring there's arguing and lots of it. This movie is sex scene after sex scene with a little bit of plot in between. This film was also in 3D, so the "moneyshot" was a bit too real. The characters are somewhat interesting, but the motive behind the relationships are very fragile. And I am not quite sure about the end. It is rather ambiguous. For the longest time, you have no idea how anyone is affording to live in Paris and what they do besides have lots and lots of sex. After a while, it's not even sexy sex. And, to my surprise, plenty of people walked out of the film well before it ended. I am glad I saw it. It was an experience, but "Porn"...I mean "Love" wasn't exactly a good movie. Also, I can't see this film playing in American theaters. Even with strong editing, it'd be extremely graphic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I only rated it a seven out of ten but that's because I admit this film's faults. It certainly isn't near perfect but I felt very moved by the characters and their story. Lots of people may not be able to relate to this film however those of us that do can say that everything about this depiction of love has been experienced and is real. As a grown single adult living in today's dating world I can attest that the relationship between Murphy and Electra exists. Their obsession with each other and with sex that led them into a deep and possibly unreal infatuation was honest and thought provoking. Love sometimes doesn't make sense and can't be described or made logical. Their connection was what drove them into darkness, madness and despair. Love is completely all consuming on any level it's represented on. So many times have I given myself up for something that a year later I looked back on and couldn't reconcile my behavior, and so many times have I given myself up to something to only sabotage it before it completely devoured me. I don't know if I have been in love, but I have felt what these characters are going through and I wouldn't know what else to call it. In the vein of Harmony Korine and Lars von Trier I think Gasper Noe is a genius. Yes this movie is uncomfortable, yes the acting isn't great and yes the story is dry, but it's a genuine take on what relationships look like for some people in their mid twenties to early thirties and I loved every second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Sex and the Aesthetics of Euphemism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always have problems with beginnings ? the beginning of an article, the beginning of a film, the beginning of a relationship, simply because beginnings are crucial in setting the tone and pattern that will lead you all the way through till the end. Naturally being affected by all the negative social media propaganda that Gaspar Noé's Love (2015) has stirred, I was reluctant to even begin watching it because I am inclined to believe that films with explicit sexual content (except for Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac, and I will tackle why in another review) are made either to sell like cheap porn for lucrative reasons or to assume a false air of originality and experimentation. I have finally decided to watch Love after it was recommended by a trusted friend of mine, and at the end of the day, one has to constantly push their limits in terms of artistic tolerance.Back to the beginnings, Love begins with a three-minute scene taken in one shot by a steady camera of two people having what seems to be ? and what actually turns out to be ? unsimulated sex. After overcoming my feelings of discomfort, I started to understand what the Argentinian director is trying to do here. Is it a pornographic scene? It definitely is. But is it meant to be sexually arousing? I would have to argue for a no. Sexual excitement requires a certain amount of build-up, but jumping directly and unexpectedly into the act generates nothing but feelings of shock and unease that would need some time to fade away.The story then unfolds in a backward linear plot. We are introduced to Murphy (the man in the opening sex scene), a frustrated young man who lives in a small apartment in Paris with his detached girlfriend and their son. The memory-evoked reversed narrative is instigated by a voice message he receives from the mother of his ex-girlfriend Electra (the woman from the opening sex scene), asking for his help to find her daughter. The man and the woman from the first sex scene are no longer strangers; we get to see how they broke up, how they managed their relationship, and finally how they met, with a heap of very long unsimulated sex scenes in between.As a voyeur (a person who discreetly watches other people in intimate, usually sexual, positions) I was extremely confused since the enjoyment element was missing. Is it because the sex scenes were too many, too long, too real, or too unnecessary? In one of the scenes Murphy says, as a cunning gesture to voice Gaspar Noé's desire, his biggest dream is to make a movie like no other that truly portrays sentimental sexuality. He also tells Electra: "I want to make movies out of blood, sperm and tears. This is like the essence of life. I think movies should contain that, perhaps should be made of that." Well, we see a lot of sperm and tears in that film, there is no doubt about it. It is true Love depicts relationships from an exceptionally crude, raw angle I have never seen before. Sex in cinema ? and in life in general ? is an uncanny subject; it lies at the essence of everything, everybody knows it is there, yet nobody talks about it overtly.. not in realistic terms at least. The film feels emotionally real. Too real. And not just when it comes to sex, but also to dialogue and performance. In one scene, Murphy tries to get Electra back and he keeps knocking on her door, after a few seconds she opens the door, apparently under the influence of drugs, and screams at him in the most deranged manner you could ever imagine. The camera does not move; it feels like a terrified neighbor watching the scene from the stairs. Most of the camera movement and angles follow the same pattern throughout the movie: the neutral uninvolved medium shot. Mid-film I realized it was not the sex scenes that made me uncomfortable but the fact that the film is devoid of any cinematic, stylistic euphemisms. In conventional romantic films, there is an invisible line separating the romantic from the sexual ? love from desire. The subtle message is always: love is sublime and desire is vulgar. The reality of the things, and as presented in the film, is that both are inseparable in their sublimity and vulgarity.I cannot tell for sure whether I like it or not. Cinema, as Slavoj ?i?ek puts it, is "the ultimate pervert art" because it does not directly satisfy our desires but manipulates them. It does not show us our capabilities, but give us the illusion that we are capable. Cinema draws the line between imagination and reality and keeps crisscrossing the boundary: it takes imaginary elements and roots them in reality, and sugarcoats real elements in imaginary wraps. The trick is not to call a spade a spade, i.e. not to place two firm feet on one side of the spectrum; otherwise you would shake the balance between reality and imagination that the viewer cannot find in real life.Whatever your sentiments are towards the film, Noé ? purposefully or inadvertently ? raises some important issues: what if cinema does away with the aesthetics of presentational euphemism? Would it undermine its role as an artistic medium? Would it put the viewer on the defensive, being constantly faced with the unrefined reality of what (s)he dreads/desires?The way I see it is that Noé created an extremely stimulating film, not sexually as he probably desired but intellectually and sentimentally.I'm grateful I watched Love alone and had the chance to struggle with and make sense of all those feelings and thoughts by myself. I can imagine how uncomfortable it would be watching it in a movie theater with other people, let alone how the actors felt while shooting!</fullReview>

And a lot of misconception here is that these characters don't love each other, because of the amount of sex and with others. I find this movie very real very relatable to all of us.

		<shortDescription>Impotent movie about a potent subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love, no matter how clichéd and pompously it sounds, is lifeblood. It's the thing that forces us to make almost impossible, sacrifice everything, can bring unendurable pain and, at the same time, inexpressible pleasure. Arguably, the most important out of all our feelings that makes us humans. Of course, it would be a difficult task for any filmmaker to make a movie about such an enormous entity that's entirely sensory and barely explicable. Not many directors are capable to make a movie about true love instead of its sugarcoated surrogate we often see on screen. Gaspar Noé is one of those who can. He knows how to make irrationality look rational. Enter the Void proves it. Who else instead of him would be a better candidate to make a real love story? Unfortunately, maybe because the task was too difficult or Noé has lost his inner voice this time, no matter what, Love is a crushing disappointment.It starts out promisingly: a young man, Murphy, wakes up one morning next to his unloved wife and unwanted baby and gets a message that his ex-girlfriend Electra has disappeared. It forces Murphy to recall their passionate affair and come to a conclusion that he screwed up his chance of being happy. The romance between Murphy and Electra is showed through a series of scattered episodes that are supposed to create the whole picture of relationships between these two people. Corny but still lovely in its own banality story line quickly loses its charm, characters become annoying and the movie transforms into sluggish, hollow tripe. For about an hour and half I tried to justify all this vapidity by saying to myself that you have to be a romantic to enjoy it, this movie is an audiovisual experience appealing to your senses, not mind and similar blablabla but then my self-deceit has crashed into pieces. It became blatantly obvious that Noé's latest is one big bummer.He has nothing to say or doesn't know how. This movie, these characters... I just don't buy it. Murphy and Electra do mostly two things: they either argue or copulate. Rare shots of non-corporal intimacy are clearly not enough to add any meat to this decaying skeleton. There is no love in Love. Those few true feelings that could be found in the beginning lose their significance somewhere between 100th use of f-word and 101st shot of Murphy's erect penis. All that's left is strained, senseless sex: chill, vulgar and incapable to produce any sort of feedback, just as the entire film. Why were these two together? Why is loss of such an unpleasant person as Electra make Murphy so sad? Good luck with finding answers because the director doesn't bother to give you insight into characters he created. He likes to stare at their naked bodies, that's all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this film was about two tortured souls that didn't know how to love and used sex as a means to explore love.This is porn though. Yes, it even has a money shot. Those in the know, know what that means and yes very graphic. The penetration scenes don't seem to be real but the other kinds of sex acts are certainly real. It's male performers and star Karl Glusman, all have full erections. There is oral sex as well.Sadly it's not good full-feature erotica. The characters are all two dimensional and Murphy is a slut of a man that thinks he knows what love is, but can't curb his lust for other women and sex.The characters simply were not well-rounded and the film is entirely too long and I think that if it were more linear, it would have worked better. Furthermore if the film is going to have a lot of actual sex or sex acts, the director should have experimented and explored more. It's missionary, doggy style and spooning. At least be more creative.You want sexy characters to help get into the sex, regardless of the plot and talent helps. Invest in some actual porn stars.If you want to see how explicit it is watch the first half. However, it is not worth watching past that point.</fullReview>

A young girl and a young man know that they love each other and promise to care for each other but what they do destroys them and damages their love. Electra wants to commit suicide (and might have done it), Murphy is lost and doesn't know what to do. There are no more them as they were when they met but their love is - wrecked, twisted, unable to shine it lives in their hearts and in their memories.There's a scene in which Murphy says that what he would like is sex with love. He knows the difference between casual sex and loving.Erotic scenes though too abundant in the film are beautiful. Finally the young couple realizes that they do harm to each other by satisfying his or her crazy wishes and decide to stay apart for some time. What about their love? Do they care for it? Nothing of the kind. Each of them cares for oneself having sex or drugs nonchalantly. Love lost its home. Surprisingly enough but a truly loving relationship makes a triangle: you, me and Love. Is that the message of Gaspar Noe?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, actually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through his raw and often disturbing approach to cinema, Gaspar Noé continues to demonstrate himself to be one of the most innovative directors of today. I am quite fond of The Butcher trilogy (Carne, I Stand Alone, and Irreversible) as well as what I consider to be his magnum opus, Enter the Void. Frankly, Love is not as great as those other films mentioned, but is still quite good in its own right, and offers a lot more under its surface than one may expect or notice.Noé once said "there is no line between art and pornography. You can make art of anything . . . Anything that is shot or reproduced in an unusual way is considered artistic or experimental." With this belief in mind, explicit filmed sexual content can be art, but that does not necessarily make it good art. Good art in my opinion, often raises comments or questions on something in life or philosophy, whether it is in its context or its subtext. Love, I think, is good art, through its creative and experimental approach in film making and the commentary and questions it raises.The film on the surface, is an erotic melodrama with easy-to-hate characters and an abundance of explicit sex scenes. However, I strongly believe this is all intentional on the behalf of Noé, as he offers commentary and visual insight inside the intimacy of a sexual charged relationship.It should be NOÉ surprise that the film's commentary is on sex and its effects on a relationship and the individuals. The film was released in 3D, allowing the audience to view the couple in their most intimate state as close to the viewer's eyes as possible, whether they'd like to or not. The sex scenes are mostly honest as they are neither simulated nor rehearsed. The opening shot acts as a thesis for the film to come, as two naked characters engage in a sexual act; the film going straight into the "action." The film is told non-chronologically as Murphy, the young cinephilic protagonist and wannabe film-maker, looks back at his past relationship with Electra that ended due to unfaithfulness that lead him to having an unplanned child and staying with the mother, whom he grew to detest. Told through flashbacks, the story unfolds revealing more details about his sexually charged relationship with the emotionally unstable Electra. Most of the explicit sex scenes, once properly examined, appear to not be shown to arouse the viewer, but rather demonstrate the joy and pleasures of sex, and the importance sex can be within a relationship. Interestingly in more quick and less explicit nature, sex is also shown throughout the film in a more negative context, or leading to negative consequences when Murphy is shown cheating on Electra. I would argue that the film showcases that sex is meant to be between two people alone but presents the opposite side of the argument as well before refuting it. Murphy feels he must own Electra, going as far as to defend his manhood and his possession (Electra) by smashing glass against another man's head who appears as a threat to him and his relationship. Infidelity and excessive experimentation leads to tension and heartache within the relationship. The long sensual threesome scene fulfills both Murphy and Electra's sexual fantasy, but ultimately leads to Murphy having sex with the other woman again in secret and accidentally creating a child. This forever ruins his trust with Electra, all due to sex corrupting his mind.Murphy, throughout the film is a regular man corrupted by sex. To be frank, he is a jerk. Almost every conflict arises from the characters giving into unhealthy sexual temptation and then facing the consequences of it. Murphy faces the consequences of his actions and begins to regret and fall into depression, especially after hearing Electra had gone missing. He never meets up with her again, she remains in the past, only for him to further take responsibility. He looks back at his relationship and while most of it was in fact sexually excessive to an unstable and unhealthy degree, he truly loved Electra on an emotional level. Their mutual emotional bonding can be demonstrated in a flashback in which the two simply talk and stroll a park. The audience never learns the final whereabouts and fate of Electra's character, which I believe works well for the film. She is in the past, Murphy must take action and become a man. His biggest regret is not having a child with her. The film seems to argue that the objectively greatest thing about sex is the fact it can lead to another's birth. Two people create another. He made a baby, who he admittedly loves, with a woman who he doesn't. Murphy realizes he had never experienced the greatest thing love could had offered between him an Electra, the miracle of birth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the only movie that shows real intimacy and real love on the screen.It felt like being in someone, listening to him talk to himself. Just like I talk to myself. It felt very satisfying seeing the world trough someone else's eyes. It was very easy to not judge him because i became the head character. I feel it, the feeling of new-love as we say in Sweden. That strong feeling stayed inside me throughout the evening after watching this. That exact feeling you have when everything is crazy and your feelings are so strong. When you can move mountains with the love that fills up your chest. That anything is possible if you just have that other person by your side. And the sex is a very big part of telling this story truthfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noé brings us this couple that can't take all the sentiment inside and so has to pour it out skin on skin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love is a film representing Murphy's (the main character) trip to the past when he finds out his ex-girlfriend, Electra, is missing. As Murphy, a young man who is studying cinema in Paris, says in the film, his "biggest dream is to make a movie that truly depicts sentimental sexuality". Whether this character has some biographical connection with Gaspar himself or not, is something discussable, but his statement is undoubtedly related to Love. Some might say Love is a romanticised porno, with unnecessary shots and scenes which only purpose is to make it even more controversial than it would have already been without them. It is not a lie that Noé chose several provocative shots with explicit sexuality, and decided not to show the awkwardness of sex. Some say Love does not represent what sex really is about because of omitting that. However, if the point of the film is to "depict sentimental sexuality", if the title itself is summing up the whole point of the plot, is it really necessary that we see this couple literally cleaning up their mess, or going through the process of getting it right physically? Of course, if that's not important to Gaspar Noé, so shouldn't be most of the, as many say, cheap close- ups. The question is: if we all know what happens after sex, and we also know what happens during sex, what was Noé's intention? What is it that distinguishes Love from a regular porn when it comes to sex scenes? I believe that if Gaspar had represented the triviality of sex, most people would finally agree he did something completely different from the banality of most drama films related to love issues, and that he got the pornographic part to work perfectly because it represented sex exactly as it is. I also believe that these people are the ones mistaking Noé's goal. Let me break this to you: Love is not a porno; not because it didn't turn out like one after editing, but because it wasn't made to be one. Love is a drama, and what the film is trying to represent is love in sex. As Murphy claims, "(?) sex while you're in love. That's the best thing.". Right from the open scene, we are engaged in an intimate moment between this couple we don't know. We even get the feeling that the scene is going to end at any moment, because that's what usually happens. We don't know if they're in love, we don't know who they are, and we don't know what's happening to them. All we know is that there stand two relaxed people, enjoying each other calmly, and we can feel the love right away. Sex is the ultimate vehicle of transmission of love. The magnum opus of human interaction. Noé knows this, and he brings us this couple that can't take all the sentiment inside and so has to pour it out skin on skin. It was necessary that the film was as explicit and real as possible, so it could ascend to its own purposes (and expectations, too). Because if you want to do something different, you can't imitate what's been done, you can't imitate art, you got to imitate life. But if on the one hand Gaspar managed to create something entirely new, he also stepped on ordinary themes such as drugs, adultery and even violence. Once they put drugs on films, we know something's about to go down. Following the first scenes involving narcotics, we're presented with moments where Murphy and Electra try to elevate their sexual experiences to a whole new level and experiment all kinds of different stuff. Which, if I may say, doesn't exactly pleases Murphy. It is also likely that viewers will question the existence of love between the main characters since they cheat on each other several times, but it seems that what Gaspar was trying to do was to demonstrate how desire and love can work separately. While discussing the cheating part of the film with a friend, I was given a whole new perspective that I hadn't honestly thought of before that. The truly and real betrayal happened when Murphy gave Omi the baby that was meant to be given to Electra. Throughout the film, there are an extraordinary number of almost idyllic conversations about babies. Murphy says they did everything together, except for making a baby. They even picked out names for this imaginary child that never existed. It was like they had built a dream together and Murphy gave it away to someone else. That was something Electra couldn't forgive, and that was what killed her. Of course, Murphy ended up paying for what he'd done, broken and lost in memories of a love(r) long gone, and the moment of acceptance comes when he's desperately asking God for a second chance and for Electra's safety, while recalling the beginning of their relationship. I think everyone expected Love to be a soft-porn, something light in terms of emotion and heavy in terms of sex. Some actually see it that way, and most don't have enough sensibility to feel the deep complex plot. Love flows sweetly and gently, violently and roughly. But in the end, we feel it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extreme sex scene's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third full feature released by the notorious director Gaspar Noé. This flick should have been his first full feature but Monica Bellucci and others turned down the offer. they have seen the script and were okay with it but once they were told it would go rather explicit they declined the offer. And in came Noé's first flick Irréversible (2002). Monica did have to go full frontal but it never became nudity and sex on the edge of porn. Stiil the flick was controversial due the 9 minute rape scene and the fire extinguisher scene. Next came Enter The Void (2009) but Gaspar still wanted to make Love. No actress wanted to go that far so he went out to clubs to find girls willing to make a movie with explicit sex scene's. Never telling them it was for the main lead he finally found 2 girls and finally Love was shot.Of course it's Gaspar, so you know it will be a long and slow flick with arty shots just like in Enter The Void and that's exactly what we get here. But this time people could be offended by the nudity. The first minute it's already a girl jerking off a guy. in front of the camera without restrictions. Is it art or porn, that became the issue of this flick. The main male lead (Karl Glusman) is known for Starship Troopers Invasion (2012) and Neon Demon (2016). He told papers that there wasn't any stand-in for his hard on or for the sex scene's. No tricks no effects, the real stuff. The story tells us a bit that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Murphy (Glusman) and Electra (Aomi Muyock) are a perfect couple but want to have a threesome with their neighbour, a seventeen year old girl. When Electra is out for a weekend Murphy and the seventeen year one have sex but the condom broke. She gets pregnant but she's never the love of his life, Electra is. And when he got a phone call from Electra's mother that she disappeared we do get to see what went wrong and go deeper into the characters. So it's about their characters and their sex lives. As I said before, it's explicit with cum shots, blow jobs, jerking off , fist f*cking and entering sex clubs to the extreme and even a transgender still being a boy but also having huge juggs. But the discussion if it's porn or not, I say not because the intercourse or genitals are never shown...It clocks in over 2 hours, maybe a bit too long. But it's Gaspar so you know what you will get. Extreme shots, long conversations and no hold barred on every count. My only question is, can he go more shocking after this one? Not for everybody but that's typically Gaspar.Gore 0/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The way they put these deep feelings of love and intense relationship on the screen, is very well done. I can very much relate to a big part of the story. There were maybe too many sex scenes but actually, most of them were very real to me. There could have maybe some more details of the individuals' life (school, work, friends), but at the same time it keeps very much focused on the intensity of the couples relationship, which makes you live their story together with them. The film could have been a bit shorter (cut some sex scenes). But overall, it's a very moving film, it will stay with me for a while. A kind of love like this one is real (I confirm for all the haters out there)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had potential - I like Gaspar Noe, I'm not easily shocked, I appreciate risk-taking and sexual freedom in film and "Love" definitely had lots of both. Unfortunately, I echo what a lot of the other reviews have said, that it needed a better script and a better male lead actor. The main female lead, Electra, outshone her male co-star to the point where I was left thinking "Why so much trouble for this guy?". His acting felt forced, hollow, just...uninteresting. I actually think the movie could have even lost a bunch of dialogue and would have been better...because the photography, cinematography, music and editing was actually quite cool and kept it feeling alive...where the script was so poor that it made me laugh at moments which I'm guessing was not the intention:)Anyway, I'd say worth checking out/experiencing, if only for the super hot sex scenes that make up about 50% of the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the movie goes on for a long time, Murphy says he want to make a movie about love &amp; sex and its intensity when both are combined. Later one I thought to myself that the movie does exactly that, but had it not being pointed out to me directly, I would have thought of the movie a lot more. Also at a few points during the movie when I thought the sex scene was long, I looked around and like the photography; have I not pieced together that the protagonist is self-serving, I would have taken it a lot more in consideration of my appreciation.Also what was the point of showing the swinger/orgy place? Is it to show they reconciled each other for their cheating and now are open? Was it necessary to take so long to make that point? I like seeing real sex in a movie. They took it to a new level, although not from afar as Shortbus was pretty filled with sex. I think I just figured out why the orgy place chapter...I like a lot the tension between the 2 lovers, but writing this I'm realizing the protagonist is missing her so much but he haven't been this way all along, it's only because he got news of her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Love is a 2015 French 3D drama film written and directed by Gaspar Noé.--Plot: -The film revolves around the lives of a cinema school student named Murphy, and his former girlfriend Electra, whom he dated for two years, before sleeping with another woman, Omi, who happened to get pregnant as a result of Murphy's infidelity. This unwanted pregnancy ended the relationship between Murphy and Electra on a very sad note. One rainy morning, Electra's mother, Nora, calls Murphy to ask him if he's heard from the young woman, because she hasn't for quite a while now, and given her daughter's suicidal tendencies, she is really worried. For the rest of this day, Murphy recalls his past with Electra, filled with drug abuse, rough sex, and tender moments.--Reception: -The film received mixed reviews, with 41% on Rotten Tomatoes, an average rating of 5/10, sampled from 59 reviews. In its "Critics consensus" it states: "Love sees writer-director Gaspar Noé delivering some of his warmest and most personal work; unfortunately, it's also among his most undeveloped and least compelling. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100 from 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Critics remarked upon the egocentricity of the project; Indiewire's Eric Kohn described the film as "A precious but sadly one-note vanity project."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts with love making straightaway, it definitely makes sure the audience is aware what they can expect from the rest of the story. It shows how 2 people. Alex and Murphy, both in search to do something meaningful in life meet fall in love, have a fleeting moment where they get to live their fantasies. The movie is a kind of storytelling of a bit older Alex , now entangled with family life, has a sporadic comeback of memories of his former love Electra. The moments they spent together, and how their fantasies ultimately led to their separation. This movie is a love-story, kind of , with all the materialistic, worldly pleasures, and emotions encompassing it. Worth a watch. And the sex is un-simulated, that is what makes the emotions raw, pure &amp; undiluted. People calling it just another porno with story do no justice to this film.</fullReview>

The sheer length of the sex scenes (way beyond what is necessary to establish the feeble gist of what scant plot there is) tells you all you need to know.A CCTV camera in a college dormitory would produce a better film.Having said that, the filming and lighting is good for the most part so kudos to the technical team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in France, 'Love' is one of those arty films that features explicit sexual activity. Director Gaspar Noé reportedly said he wanted to create a film featuring a 'love story seen from a sexual point of view'; did he succeed?The film opens with American student Murphy getting a handjob from French girl Electra while he in turn fingers her - um - front bottom. This all seems very nice, but flash forward a few years and we see Murphy living unhappily with a different Frenchwoman (Omi), the mother of his young child. How he got from pleasant afternoon handjobs to dissatisfied (though responsible) domesticity forms the narrative of the film.There's a heavily improvised feel - and not just in the sex scenes: the more routine conversations are well played, but the frequent arguments/shouting matches are unfocused and boringly repetitive. Lead actors Karl Glusman, Aomi Muyock and Klara Kristin - the latter two apparently never having acted before being cast in this film - are competent (when they're not shouting). Muyock, especially, does a creditable job in showing Electra's rapid descent from wholesome student to attention-seeking slapper. The sex scenes are not the cold affairs some reviewers report them to be: true, they're not the height of eroticism, but they're enjoyable enough, with all three leads looking attractive sans clothes.And although the film being shot in 3D didn't add anything for me, I have to admit it made for an unusual money shot...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I waited a long time to see this movie and it totally fulfilled my expectations. Noe has done it again; not in a violent, kind of psychedelic way but he has beautifully showed us how deeply connected love and sex are. I felt totally identified with many parts of the movie; aggressive after-fight sex, promises of eternal loyalty, that dreamy state of mind that we are put on when we fall in love. I strongly believe a director can transmit a message without giving us the whole scenario. We don't know much about the main character's lives, but I felt like it wasn't necessary at all. What Noe accomplished to show us are those profound feelings of despair, need, violence, tenderness and connection with another person. The photography is excellent, the colors are so beautiful and the music so well chosen (and, a very important fact, selected/composed by John Carpenter) that in many scenes that show explicit sex you get both aroused and amazed.

		<shortDescription>For the benefit of sexual revolution!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About to speak of the film where widescreen nearly-pornography is rendered absolute, I prime you beforehand there will be no sentimentality in my review - I'll speak straight from the shoulder.So, hail the sexual revolution, as it was said by the Swedish Eurodance band 'Army of Lovers' in the 90s; these and similar musicians, so glamorous and possessing springness ('Mr. President', 'E-Rotic', 'T-Spoon', etc), rejecting the centuries-old dogmata, sang rollicking songs about Coco Jamboo, Dr. Dick and Sex on the Beach. DOGmata were thrown to the DOGS, even though the church didn't experience times of adversity in the West, unlike in our country, in long-suffering Russia; and in the world of popmusic, that happened a couple of decades sooner than in cinema, and let me express my view, why. Many are too timid to visit spicy film shows: imagine your stiff school mistress going to some tear-jerker and, by chance, seeing you entering another showing room with an exciting female bum on poster! But as for dance floors, there's hardly anyone but youth, and they haven't had dubious glances on themselves in ages. A pop band plays free-and-easy hits; everybody sexually hunts everyone; and what causes that small culpable circle to move, are ecstasy Disco Biscuits. But even before the disco time, time of messing about, the sexual revolution won in terms of clothes! 40-45 years ago, even for those times, and even in Russia, it was unlikely that anyone, except old grannies in their senility maybe, would be outraged at wearing short dress or a miniskirt by a young girl. Because all sane people understood: the majority wore shorts and mini not because they were sexually driven and preoccupied with sex. Girls feel HOT but it has nothing to do with being HOT, it's just summer weather! All in all, after comparative equality of men and women had come and condoms as well as birth control pills had flooded the market of everyday goods, sexual revolution began to advance with giant strides, no doubt about it. As a result, the present is full of TV music videos with blue subjects like cherries with cream, passionate glances and sighs, and satin female bare feet; what is the most popular book, is an erotic novel ('Fifty Shades of Grey'), which has beat even 'Harry Potter', 'Twilight' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. Thanks to the marvellous success of the bestseller #1, the film of the same name showed box office running into $ half a billion. All the rest films of 'free-and-easy' content still fail in business, but that's certainly not because they are not desirable; people are just still too shy to visit such showings, concerned about being caught by those acquaintances who consider the word 'sex' to be a synonym for 'lechery'...At that, all the hypocrisy around having sex is due to nothing more than the fact that sex organs, by some natural reasons, perform excretion functions as well... That's the only thing these organs came in for their 'ill fame'; but if they weren't connected with excretion in any way, no-one, I'm quite sure, would ever think about sex blameworthily! And the words literally (with neither biological terminology nor euphemistic connotation) nominating these organs and what they do - would never be considered 'dirty'!But it's high time to give up speculating about 'what would be if pigs had wings'; they would be angels, huh; if is a big word. Here comes 'Love' by Gaspar Noé. First of all, I can't but express my indignation at the virtual ban of it with us in Russia! It was shown officially just once, in Saint Petersburg, with some well-known oppositionists attending the showing. This dismisses the suggestions adduced in my reviews of the films 'Pouta' (Czech Republic) and 'Pouhdistus' (Finland): I said they were not 'banned', just ignored by Russian distributors on the grounds of unprofitability... I should have had not high opinion of our powers that be! I should have known that market laws wouldn't work any longer if politics intervenes in various branches of life!But what I'm still convinced of, is that it's public opinion in Russia that allows these people rule! It was curious for me to look through the 'Love' reviews posted by Russians! There were of course a couple of odd opinions. A religionist lamented his bitter fate: he was unable to drop the filmmakers in hell pan. A young woman lapsed into daydreams of her bygone love. But by and large, the prevailing public opinion can be reduced to: 'this is not the film we in Russia are in need of'; the whole globalising world doesn't keep in step - our beloved Russia is the only one who keeps in step. (Such a wild sentiment is just perfect for the current regime.) Some extolled Noé's talents to the skies and tried to find a black cat in a dark room, but there was no cat. Very few reviewers treated the film impartially. Namely, as just a film with mission to show that the civilisation (not Russia, though, I'm sorry to inform you!) has latched onto a fine art house film with sex as the lion's share of runtime! The box office is low, extremely low in comparison with 'Fifty Shades', but art house films are always getting next to nothing in comparison with blockbusters, not much of eyeopener! A 3D art house, are you kidding?! That Noé sure wanted to snatch a large sum. That you would probably ask me. And I'd answer: 3D here is not a blockbuster attribute, just a ground-breaking technical spec: the 'first 3D nearly-pornographic mainstream' status makes 'Love' a pioneering film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Gaspar Noe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I finally decided to watch Love. It is a film that is best to watch alone and I think it is because of self-examination. Throughout, it had me thinking about my own feelings on the subject of true intimacy. Yes, there are explicit sex scenes in the film although to me it wasn't constantly. I was willing to see beyond that. As I watched, I wondered about censorship in regards to nudity and sex in film. I am not appalled by nudity or sex. I understand that it gets laughed off because of being something so private and it is, but I never thought of it as remotely funny. I admire artists who reveal something that is so personal through their work. From what I know of Gaspar Noe, there were some similarities between him and the main character Murphy but the movie isn't autobiographical. Throughout the film he often ruminates on the true love of his life Electra. That's it, but it is beautifully filmed and played out. It's relaxing to watch. It helps that Murphy who is played by Karl Glusman is quite attractive, so at the same time I was admiring his body. I thought his character was a bit reckless. I wanted to see it in 3d and there are scenes when it would be effective, such as when a guy is pointing his finger directly to your point of view. Ultimately though I think the 3d effect would have been only a novelty as in all 3d movies. Viewing it in 2d doesn't take anything away from it. While I wasn't expecting an Irreversible Part II, I noticed Gaspar Noe certainly has mellowed since then although it doesn't mean what he does now is of unsatisfactory value. His work is presented in a more stable way and is a bit differently as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories fade and blur over time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Distressed and guilt-ridden upon learning that his former girlfriend has mysteriously vanished, an aspiring filmmaker loses himself in his faded memories in this characteristically graphic motion picture experience from the mind of Gaspar Noé. With his thoughts narrated aloud and intimate camera-work that constantly follows the protagonist around, the film captures the upset young man's stream of consciousness well. The non-linear nature of his flashbacks comes also across as an accurate reflection of the recollection process. Clocking in at nearly two and a half hours long though, the film runs incredibly long for a movie with such a relatively simple premise and bits and pieces grow repetitive quite quickly. Oddly enough, it is the sexually charged scenes that feel the most repetitive despite Noé constantly upping the ante with how explicit the scenes are; on the other hand, it is logical that the dialogue-heavy scenes come off better since those are the ones in which we actually see the characters interacting and learn progressively more about them. In fact, the bigger question is probably why the protagonist so often thinks of copulation when remembering his ex-girlfriend; are these the moments when he felt most intimate with her, and if they are, is he confusing love with lust? It is surely food for thought. Whatever the case, 'Love' leaves an indelible impression that is hard to shake. It is not as immersing and overwhelming an experience as 'Enter the Void', but it does a fairly decent job of handling a similarly dreamy narrative structure in which time seems to blur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Both effective and affecting, Gaspar Noe's "Love" (2015 France) will make you FEEL... intensely, albeit emotionally ambiguous, at times. This is a sensual (not suitable, at all, for young audiences), heartbreaking, histrionic piece, the final minutes, of which, have haunted me/saddened me/enlightened me throughout today. Critics and most audiences will not accept or understand this film (read: which means it's good), but I think this is honest, visually- succinct/dreamy, brave, and aware filmmaking. There are no rules here... socially or personally. I actually woke up today with the final line of this picture wooing me awake... and it kind of hurt, in a life-affirming way. Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex scenes can't save it from being quite boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love is the 4th feature film by Gaspar Noé. His last one 'Enter the Void' came out 6 years ago. As you can tell by the poster Gaspar does not make films for a general audience as they are mostly offensive, brutal and to a certain degree shocking (but that might be underestimating the jaded audience who these days have access to anything on the internet and as such are not easily shocked). Love might actually be his most accessible film as there is no violence but plenty of nudity and sex. Actually it's quite explicit, in the sense that the difference between real porn and this film is that 'Love' has a lot better lighting and cinematography. Now having plenty of sex scenes doesn't make it a good film. I found it rather boring actually and watched it 3 parts because it could not keep my attention. The film goes a bit like this: sex scene / fight scene (vocally, not physical) / make-up sex scene / nag scene / more sex / more nagging...you get the picture, this goes on for about 129 mins. That can get pretty tiresome. Gaspar's idea is that he wants a 'romantic' film where you also get to see the lovemaking and as we are all adults we should see it. But that in itself doesn't make this movie better. Certainly not if your characters are really not that likable. So my recommendation: see it if you are a real die hard Noé fan but otherwise skip it, there are lots of better movies released in 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Show me how gentle you can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest movies of all time! After "Irreversible" and "Enter the Void", I thought director Gaspar Noe would have reached his peak. I thought either that, or maybe he would have nothing left to show, but this movie satisfies what the characters in the movie are looking for. Towards the end of the movie, one character bemoans the complete absence of "sentimental sexuality" in cinema, and proposes to supply it, and earlier, one of the characters challenges another: "Show me how gentle you can be." This movie is Noe's offering to that challenge. This movie continues in the recent history of French movies that seem to keep erasing the boundary between pornography and art. And yet this movie seems to be one of a kind, thanks to how personal and vulnerable it seems. It seems to be a magnum opus, as do all of Noe's works. That's part of what makes them so thrilling to watch: they all have a distinct spirit of desperation infused in them, a hunger to be great. This movie seems to be ground-breaking in its camera-work, in its story structure, in its handling of nudity and sex. And it's very beautiful. It soars where the latest movies of many formerly great auteurs seem to strain and miss. The cinematography and editing are top-rate, and there are no more devoted actors than these. The soundtrack alone deserves to have a substantial essay written on it, the way it sounds 80s yet contemporary yet futuristic, the way it sounds menacing yet romantic yet hip and yet like the soundtrack to a porno. Perfection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 20 minutes in the movie I was already annoyed by this movie and checked how much time was left. I did survive until the end, although sometimes it was questionable why am I torturing myself. I still wanted to know what was there to show in the remaining hour and 40 minutes. Sex scenes were the only good thing about the movie, everything else was pretty miserable and I'm giving it 4 stars only because I support the thought that threesome often ruins relationships. One should have that with a total stranger on a vacation - no names, no contacts, no strings. If you have nothing better to do then watch it, but my suggestion would be to watch the sex scenes and then make love yourself meanwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and extraordinary experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing that i can say with certainty about "Love" is that I can safely recommend it to anyone that is interested in Erotic Cinema. Watch it at the theater, in 3D if possible."Love" is very much unlike any other film going experience that I have ever had, and I am not a stranger to films that show nudity and sex.Applying 3D to this picture was an excellent choice. It makes both watching the "action" and experiencing what is going through the main character's mind more immersive.I have not seen such a powerful portrayal of a troubled young man since "Taxi Driver", one of my favorite movies."Electra", the main character's love interest, is also well written and acted. The depth of her character and her flaws are also deeply rooted in the story and its themes.There is a poster of "Taxi Driver" hanging on the wall of the room of the main character and I think that "Love", like "Taxi Driver", has the potential to become a film that will be studied for the ages to come.The 3D was good but I think it could have been slightly better.The only negative aspect that I can think of are that the sex scenes did occasionally become repetitive somewhere halfway, but only sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2001 of the erotic cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most erotic film ever made.I didn't expect such an achievement from the director of Irreversible(a movie I hadn't liked at all).Oshima had tried to do something similar-and was given more credit to his effort than Noe-but I believe Love is better than The Empire of senses. It is filmed as a hard core movie, only with the exception that it is about love and people who are in love and have sex all the time;there are all kind of perplexities in the relations stemming all from the very nature of human feelings and human sexuality, but the film sticks to the theme of love in a way we have never experienced again in cinema.There is also a stylistic approach that reminded me of Kubrick(I do not think that it is irrelevant that the main male character says that he chose to become a director because of 2001). And last but not least, in an extraordinary soundtrack you encounter- among others- the theme from John Carpenter's Assault on precinct 13 during an orgy which can be considered the climax of the film(and I assure you, as a die-hard Carpenter fan, there is nothing ridiculous about that).So, the film may not be for everyone, but is a unique experience that does what others pose of doing, a perfect antidote for pretentious rubbish-like The Lobster-and a romantic, sensual, original and touching-if not a little too long in some parts- film that breaks through with more courage and devotion than the Warhol movies that it is referring to .A film about love in its purest form , about love as the most rewarding and torturing experience of humans.And, of course, about loss as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lush, Passionate and Stylish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you fall in love," says Murphy "you are a loser." Only part of him believes this. The other part stalks Electra anywhere she goes. She is the source of both intense passion and pain for Murphy. Into the night clubs of Paris with their pulsing lights and vibrant colors, alleys, subways, bedrooms and showers (especially these last two), we follow the young couple. The film moves back and forth in time and is about the joy and sadness of being in love. Love is intimate in two senses of word. In one sense the sex is raw and explicit (3D explicit) and in the second sense the film really puts viewers into the scenes. It is as if we are really involved in the film. This is the characteristic style of the director. It is bold, stylish, playful, intense, non-linear and extremely passionate. Noe makes appearances in many of the scenes in one form or another (when Murphy named his kid "Gaspar," many in the audience chuckled). Even the ending credits are stylish in terms of visuals and sound, and you can't stop watching even that. Noe really has the ability and courage to show such lushness in emotions and scenery. The cinematography is not as good as Enter the Void, nor is the acting, yet it isn't too far removed. Five of five stars. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now most people will not like this movie and I totally get it. I am fortunate enough to have seen it in 3D which I truly enjoyed dodging seaman was quite interesting. But for me this movie was excellent. The cast and acting was absolutely delicious. Like the Noe films I've seen, there are some great artistic shots and uncomfortable moments but I went in with those expectations and part of the joy is seeing how much you can endure watching. For me, what really caught my attention was the lead actor's emotional acting around heartbreak and regret, I know that feeling and I can almost feel his pain...the sex scenes become secondary after a while if you can find yourself connecting to the emotions of the story...and if you've watched enough unsimulated sex in film as I have, it actually isn't quite a big deal. I think Noe did make it his purpose to oversexualize the film a bit which at some points I found unnecessary but all and all, excellent film and just as good if not better then Irreversible</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memories, regrets and lots of sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It's what would normally be categorized as a cold opening, but somehow the term doesn't seem to fit the beginning of director Gaspar Noe's daring new film. A beautifully lighted, static camera opening shot lasts for a few minutes. It's startling in that the two people on screen are immersed in mutual manual stimulation in what has to be the most explicit and abrupt opening shot in film history. Red flags are waving ? Mr. Noe's exploration of love has little to do with meet-cute or Hollywood romance. Instead, he dives into the harsh realities of growing emotionally close to someone, and then having it crumble ? leaving only memories and regrets.Directly from that opening, we shoot ahead two years. Murphy (Karl Glusman) is now in bed with a different woman. A baby cries from another room. He goes to comfort the child as we get our first exposure to his inner-voice ? he feels trapped and beaten down. There is obvious tension between Murphy and Omi (Klara Kristen) as she takes the child and he listens to a voice mail. It's a frantic plea from the mother of his ex-girlfriend (we of course know it must be the one he/we became so intimate with in the opening). Electra (Aomi Muyock) has not been heard from in a couple of months, and suicide is a real concern.This voice mail triggers an onslaught of memories for Murphy, and it becomes clear Electra was the love of his life. The memories are fired at us in the way memories do ? sometimes quick, sometimes drawn out, and in a haphazard order that requires much assembly. We see Murphy's and Electra's good times and bad, understand how they mostly communicated through sex, and witness the turning point in their relationship ? they invite their bright-eyed new neighbor into their bed. Just like Murphy, you may initially think Europeans are so cool and advanced to avoid the petty jealousies and fidelities that Americans so value. However, the cool bubble pops quickly when in the blink of a faulty condom, the love of one's life is gone and the morning is soon filled with the cries of a baby.Much of the above is about the story and the characters; however, it would be an injustice to remain quiet on the unusual amount of sex ? explicit sex acts ? shown throughout the film. Director Noe (Enter the Void, Irresistible) has always been cutting edge, but a 3D sex-filled movie is pushing boundaries for most any movie viewer. It's artfully filmed and presented, so the only thing it shares with porn is the explicit sex. It reminds of the Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights, whose dream was to make an artful mainstream porn movie. Perhaps that is what Mr. Noe has accomplished.However one decides to label the film, it's a no-holds-barred look at the stages of love and how it can go bad so quickly. It's also an expose' on the lack of emotional maturity of so many men (especially American) who somehow think "protecting" each other is a key relationship step. Murphy has one scene where he begs Electra to save them from his poor judgment, and another where he says "sometimes it's better not to lie". There is also a theme of French vs Americans, with an emphasis on American's propensity for war/violence and possession, rather than freedom. It's difficult to say if audiences are ready for Noe's latest, but it's clear he has something to say ? and plenty to show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love hits you straight out of the box with the first scene. The sex was really, really graphic. I saw this movie in 2D and I can only imagine. I could not before, thinking to myself why would they make a romance movie in 3D?, but now I don't need to imagine, I can never get those images out of my head. They really went extreme.But I will say that I thought the sex scenes got me more emotionally wrapped up in the movie than the actual acting. I did like how a lot of the movie was about what is being shown and the action taking place, but I did not like the actors too much as they read their dialog, which sucks for them considering what they had to do on screen.Overall, I did find the the movie appealing. It reminds me of another movie with hardcore sex scenes, 9 songs, but instead this story about the run of a relationship is not linear, which is what made this movie interesting.It was a little hard for me to watch at times but I thought it was well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People whom watch this movie, they may get it in three ways:1- Majority of people: A good porno movie with lots of nice erotic scenes. This people may take shower after watching the movie! 2- Some people whom read books and they think they are thinker!: This movie was talking about freedom of relationship and sex! (some admire it and some others against it) 3- Few people whom watch movies very carefully and think deeply!, They maybe agree with previous two, but: They think this movie was a political message!!!??What? Porno movie and Politic?! What are you talking about, you Di*k head?!Film immediately starts by a scene when boy and girl are playing with each other sexual organ (masturbating), and they satisfied by this way, just hand-jobs, nothing else, even sucking!An American boy who was wearing green military jacket! had relationship with a French girl who was wearing Red dress. From the beginning to the end they hadn't serious relationship although they said to each other " I love you". Both of them cheated each other (though we didn't see any cheat from the girl, just the boy imaginations).French girl said to the American boy "I want F*k you all the time"!. The "ultimate fantasy" was "F*king" another girl (two girls and one boy), and they did it. Also later in movie, the girl told the boy: You wanted to F*k 2 girls, we did it, now I want to F*k 2 men".The voice over the beginning of movie said that the boy dislike his wife and family he created, even he said they took his place! and he is sick of this "bit*h"!OK, let me tell you why this movie is a political message, from my view:When they F*ed the blonde girl together, and she became pregnant, it became the main problem between the boy and the girl. Tough American boy made the blonde girl pregnant in another day when they were alone without the French girl, but don't forget idea of sleeping with 2 girls was ultimate fantasy of the French girl, it was her idea!One eye (the girl eye), when boy and girl are watching 3D photos, talking about death and both wearing black shirt, one eye (freemason watching eye).look at the freeze pictures after this time 0:48:00 (handsup, peace, submission, killing, death)In the movie, you can see the Freemason symbols everywhere.Masterpiece of the movie was dialogs between French police officer and the boy at the café: - here is France, different than America - forget your American feeling about possession and ownership, war, violence - Think like American in 60, f*k a woman in the back of a woman you love!, it develops your confidence and your trust - I feel (fill) my sexuality in good way! - I don't beat people - You can pick up any girl you want or you can watch, I LOVE WATCHING! At the end of movie, boy and girl were taking shower together, boy asked the girl to promise they will protect each other no matter what happen. Why he asked for protect, why not love, why not let's have a relationship, why not marry me? This question, the boy military jacket and conversation between the boy and police officer, tells me this movie is not about sex, f*k, relationship or whatever!It was a message from Freemasons of French to Americans politicians or American Freemasons. That's all.You can call me stupid, but remember that two times in the movie, director, splashed sperm on your face, you as a watcher!"The management warns you, if you have weak nerves or stomach, do not attend"The message was: Do not make war and violence, don't F*k-up the situation, don't F*k your trust and confidence, when you f*k a country don't own it, share it with others.Unfortunately, whenever I write a review, I write minimalist! just by noting to the main points of the movie, the rest you should get it by yourself, watch the movie again, and this time don't let the hot erotic scenes force you to become a Di*k-head without brain ;)Cinematography was great, music was OK, acting was not bad. I rate it 7, as a lucky number Freemasons love it!</fullReview>
