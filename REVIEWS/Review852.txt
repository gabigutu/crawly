		<shortDescription>Most Important Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My guess is that most of the people giving this film a low score hasn't seen it and just doesn't like what Michael Moore represents. I encourage them to actually see the film because everyone has a right to know the truth. The truth is this is the most important film ever made because it outlines the route problem of a lot of problems.I was lucky enough to catch the North American premier last night at the Toronto International Film Festival. Sitting in front of me was a man who seemed to be there out of obligation to his girl friend. Before the film started I heard him comment that he hated Moore, wasn't happy about having to see one of his "propaganda films". After the film when the lights came back on he was quiet and looked as though his world had been shattered. He joined the crowd in a 5 minute standing ovation and I realized this is not just another Michael Moore film.There were moments in this film when I felt sick as I learnt about the cruel calculated actions of people who I had once believed were the good guys. I watched family's lives be destroyed by a system they had all served. I saw clips of footage so alarming that I should have seen them a dozen times on the news when they first happened. Thanks to the kind of news we now have I had never even heard of most of the examples shown in the film. I promise you that no matter what political party you support there will be at least of few parts of this film where you will see facts that you'll feel you had a right to know about sooner.That is what makes this film so important, because most of it is about stuff you have never heard about and whether you like the guy delivering the news or not you need to see what the media hasn't been showing you. I can't promise you'll like the film but as a human being you owe it to yourself to watch this film and decide for yourself what you really think about Capitalism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The theater was completely silent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie last night at a free screening. The theater was packed and after the movie started you could not hear a sound from the audience for the rest of the two hours besides two or three times when applause errupted.You could feel that everybody in the audience really got the message.I only hope that Michael's parting words will come true and everybody will join his fight. As long as we are being led like pigs to the slaughter nothing will change. We have to stand up against the insurance companies, the exploiting employers, the greedy merchants, the predatory lenders. If we all say no, things will change.I will not be punished again for pre-existent conditions, car accidents caused by somebody else, retributions because somebody stole my wallet and I was punished. I will not fall buy trash anymore which breaks in a short time and cannot be repaired. I will not be talked into buying useless gimmicks which change every few months. etc.etc.Thank you Michael Moore, without you, I would have lost hope a long time ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Economics. Who in their right mind would try and make a feature length film about that subject? Michael Moore's previous work that included subjects about guns, General Motors, and George W. Bush, to the audience these were clear points for us to identify with, or in most cases, against.In his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story, Moore attempts demystify what economics and capitalism really mean to the vast majority of Americans. This is no easy feat. I must admit the first quarter of the film had me doubting if he would secede. I am not going to sit by and say that people who took out adjustable rate mortgages and then were foreclosed are not at all to blame. They bear a good share of personal responsibility. But so do the lenders who were drooling to make a profit via the art of deception.Soon afterwards we are presented with an example of capitalism gone awry. A judge in a US town was locking up juvenile offenders, for "crimes" such as throwing meat or criticizing a vice-principal online. The prison was a privately run corporation that was sending financial kickbacks to the very judge who was locking these kids up on absurd charges. Granted this was just one example, but a shocking one that could make you question just what are American values. This is where the film really started to get interesting. Are capitalism and Christianity compatible? What becomes of capitalism when you strip out regulation? Who actually controls the government of The United States of America, the top 1% or the bottom 95%? When the markets crashed last fall and the banks cried uncle, where was the oversight by our elected officials regarding the bailout funds? These are questions, and some answers, that make Moore's documentary effective and engaging. While he is reflecting upon the past he is also asking us, what are we going to do about it in the future?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating blend of the old and the new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was very impressed with the combination of comedy, tragedy, and historical explanation. Yes, there is a bit (or more) of playing to the camera by Moore himself--however, I enjoyed the grandstanding--kind of an investigative revenge fantasy to physically call attention to one of the biggest crime scenes ever. While the use of 1950s instructional film segments is played for laughs, other historical footage is literally breath-taking. My NY audience was utterly silent when we saw what FDR wanted to do, and might have done, had he lived longer. MY REQUEST, at least for the DVD version, would be to have more labels on the lesser-known political figures, so we could more readily identify the few, brave souls who spoke out in vain. I plan to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made and informative expose of the tragic consequences of unregulated capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading some of the other reviews of Capitalism: A Love Story, it soon becomes clear that those leaving low scores either haven't seen the film or have a particular agenda to smear the movie - one reviewer seems to think Angela Merkel's Germany (a centre right politician!) is 'Socialist'! It is this deliberate dumbing down in America of issues surrounding what capitalism is and does (as opposed to socialism) that enabled the conditions for the banks to exploit the worst off in American society and force the taxpayers to foot the bill by bailing them out - and why Americans are still without a universal free healthcare system. Moore takes great pains, and succeeds, in highlighting how this culture of demonising anything that criticises rampant and unregulated free market economics has been firmly established in US society. He has clearly undertaken a measure of research in the production - numerous sources/interviews and facts are used in the narrative - but the best thing for me was that he still manages to keep the more complicated aspects of banking and loans extremely accessible (I'm hopeless at maths!).Comments that Moore is a socialist are extremely juvenile - Moore is a socialist in the same way that Ghandi was a terrorist or Jesus was a trouble maker.All in all a very informative and inspiring documentary that dares to mention the elephant taking a big dump in the room.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore gets radical, in the literal sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his new film, 'Capitalism: A Love Story,' Moore's focus is more basic: the fundamental economic system, which is also political. Or is it just "our way of life"? For all the anger and sense of wrong of the pushed-through "taxpayer" bailouts of Wall Street investment bankers, the foreclosures, and the skyrocketing American unemployment, this film doesn't feel as urgent as 'Fahrenheit' or as well-researched (and freshly informative) as Sicko. Nonetheless it is more basic and for the first time Moore focuses on morals. He goes to the Catholic priest who married him and his wife, the one who married his sister-in-law, and their bishop, and all declare that capitalism advocates values that are un-Christian. (If capitalism encourages greed, greed is avarice, and avarice is one of the seven deadly sins.) This is touchy stuff, but it seems that the director felt the moment was ripe to bring it up. He was proved more than right when the financial meltdown came in late 2008: this was a sign that the greed was destroying us. And for a change, certain words seemed no longer taboo. Moore noted that Bush made a speech touting the capitalist system and while campaigning Obama said something about sharing the wealth that led the opposition to accuse him of being a socialist. A socialist! The word could as well be Satanist or pedophile as far as US conservatives are concerned. It's so inflammatory in this country Moore himself doesn't dare use the word of himself. When asked if he was a socialist by Amy Goodman on Democracy Now! at the end of an hour-long interview there was an awkward silence. Moore said, "I'm a heterosexual. . .I'm overweight. . . ." and then the program ran out of time. They say in Canada he isn't so reticent.As he tells it Moore was already working on this film when the meltdown came. The average guy sees the government bailouts as greed. Some progressive economists, such as Nobel laureate and NYTimes op-ed columnist Paul Krugman, have consistently argued that the bailouts were necessary; that they just haven't been bold and thorough enough. The concept that "the taxpayer" is paying for them is a little simplistic. In that sense we're all paying for everything. It's better to be saving the financial system than to be invading Iraq and Afghanistan and bombing Pakistan -- and it costs much less too.Moore jumps around, playing his old games asking admission to General Motors headquarters, or AIG, stringing "Crime Scene" yellow tapes around the Stock Market and big banks; following a window and door factory where all the workers were let go, but then decided to sit-in at the factory until they got their severance packages from Bank of America. There's a lot about foreclosures, how they happen, who has fought them, and who exploits them. There are several companies where the workers are actual shareholders who have a vote on what happens, a line operator gets $65,000 a year, more than some airline pilots, whom Moore reveals to be so underpaid some have had to resort to food stamps. Obama did once spout vaguely socialist ideas, but Moore shows how that was dealt with: big banks made him beholden by becoming major contributors to his campaign. Moore says Goldman, Sachs was the biggest, with a million dollars; actually the University of California is listed above that with a million five.Three are many tear-jerking moments here. Moore has a field day with a couple who're ejected from their farmhouse complex and even paid $1,000 -- the ultimate humiliation -- to get rid of the contents of their house. A black family in another sequence is helped by an activist group to return to their foreclosed house and reoccupy it, after living in a truck. Moore goes overboard on this stuff. As Felperin says, Moore would probably show puppies personally drowned by (Bush Treasury Secretary and former Goldman, Sachs CEO) Hank Paulson if he could.But the Michael Moore wants to wake you up and make you mad and the most powerful -- and important -- argument is that of the Catholic priests: that capitalism as it's practiced nowadays is un-Christian -- and in the terms of any spiritual system, morally wrong. Also important, if underdeveloped, in this complicated, effective piece of economic and political agitprop, is the historical line traced back to the Fifties, when life was relatively comfortable, college and medical care were affordable, through the Eighties, when President Reagan turned the country over to the corporations and the consummate evil yuppie character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone's Wall Street declared "Greed is good." Since then, as Moore rapidly points out, the wealth has been gobbled up more and more by the few at the top: the middle class has been ravaged and the poor have become more numerous.If capitalism, as an old Fifties instructional film here intones, is "our American way of life," then how come it's failing to serve so many Americans? At this point it would have been much better if Moore had been less "resolutely U.S.-centric" (Felperin) -- because capitalist economies exist in other countries alongside systems of social services, alongside socialist benefits for the many. It's not so much simply capitalism that is killing us (has not communism been proved a failure, or at least unrealizable in the real world?) but the cruel, Darwinian, selfish, do-or-die form of it that's practiced in America. Greed is not good. As Moore does point out repeatedly, ordinary and poor Americans have been hoodwinked by propagandists for American capitalism into thinking that the system is okay, however heartless and imbalanced, because they might hit the jackpot themselves someday. As Moore says, ordinary Americans are beginning to realize that just ain't true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you're not supposed to know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has never been objective. No documentary maker ever was. When you chose a subject, you've already taken some kind of position and Moore doesn't try to hide what he thinks.And he shows us worker's families being driven from their homes and brokers making profit on it. He shows business companies taking life insurances on their employed and taking all the money when the employed dies. He says that the Congress is in the hands of Wall Street and especially Goldman and Sachs. There are more examples.The interesting question is why Michael Moore is so alone making these kind of films in the US. The answer is probably that the investors don't want him or anybody else to do them. They want to go on, treating the American people in the most terrifying ways. And since money seems to decide so much in that country, such films are very seldom made. But you're not supposed to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Politics Of Greed, Fear, And Predatory Behavior Exposed By Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He took on our nation's obsession with guns in BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. He took on the politics of Bush/Cheney fear mongering in FAHRENHEIT 9/11. He even took on the health care insurance industry in SICKO. And once more, the tenacious rabble-rouser from Flint, Michigan, Michael Moore, takes on the powers-that-be in a cinematic broadside that needs to be seen--CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY.In this new opus from the man who has always gotten under the skin of the nattering nabobs of negativity on the Far Right, Moore posits some very chilling questions about our system of Capitalism: Is it really intrinsically evil? Should it be abolished? And he does so with the kind of simmering populist outrage that has been his stock-in-trade since his 1989 breakthrough ROGER AND ME (which is in fact part of the archival footage he uses here). In it, he details how America's financial system got overheated by deregulation and predatory loan practices that struck at the heart of the poor and middle class, the ones who actually make up the heart and soul of America and who are always the most vulnerable, leaving the rich to walk away with billions in taxpayer bailout money. It also shows us how corporate greed, far from enriching our lives, has actually corroded them, and subsequently corroded our political system so that the villains of this whole scheme are the same ones that buy off our elected representatives to sit there and save their sorry behinds.But for each horror story he tells us (and there are many, make no mistake), there are stirring examples of common people standing up against the faceless corporate bullies and exercising their democratic rights (what a novel concept!): homeowners in Miami who refuse to budge from a foreclosed home; union workers in Chicago who refuse to leave their place of employment, a manufacturer of doors and windows, even after Bank of America has foreclosed; people in Congress who have finally had enough and scream "BULLS**T!" to the corporate interests.All of this may seem like Moore is going to his usual excessive lengths to make his point, particularly when it comes to the idea of abolishing the capitalist framework altogether--a pipe dream, if ever there was one. But when doing a satirical documentary like this, a little excess can go a long way to expose some hidden truths about our country; and the fact that Moore exposes truths that we either disagree with or don't want to know about inevitably makes him a target for blind followers of the Far Right and the Palin/McCain/Joe The Plumber sect, whom Moore once again is able to skewer with their own words. And he doesn't go so easy on Bill Clinton's administration either, as several members of that administration themselves were involved in setting up the self-fulfilling prophecy that led to the near-complete collapse of the American economy in 2008.It was Michael Douglas' character Gordon Gekko who, in Oliver Stone's hard-hitting 1987 film WALL STREET, said to the audience at a stockholders' meeting: "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed works!" Well, as CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY shows, just the opposite is true. It is unrestrained greed and unrestrained fear that pushed America to the brink of total economic meltdown. And it is those same elements that have led Moore to the conclusion that Capitalism is evil. If he is wrong in his conclusion, then it is unfortunately not by much. And that is why CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY should be seen. We may not be able to abolish the capitalist system that has kept America a world power, but unless we do fundamental things now to place regulations on those that profit from greed, fear, and predatory behavior, then America may one day in the future go over the edge into the abyss with no hope to recover its lost greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hits the right notes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only criticism is that Moore fails to draw the distinction between economic systems and political ones. Capitalism, socialism, communism are systems for organizing economies. Each of these could be democratic, in that the people get to vote for laws, policies and actions of their government.Capitalism is often linked to "free enterprise" conflating it with freedom. It's really about the right to own property and make money from exploitation of the work of others. It is built on a system of credit and interest charged for capital and money.Communism has not private ownership of factories and the means of production, and no interest or credit. Presumably the economy is run by and for the people, not the managers or owners of the means of production.Socialism is also has the means of production owned by the state which is the people. The state provides for rights such as housing, health care, a job and education.And then there are mixed economies as well. Moore's film underscores the immoral nature of capitalism which places wealth over human needs. he shows how the system has been rigged for the wealthy who always come out on top, don't even play fairly and have workers believing that the system will reward them for hard work. But he shows this is a lie.His point is that is 95% voted they could turn the system into a just one. He's an optimist on that. The public has few options in elections and they are consistently gamed and stolen, and government officials accept LEGAL bribes from anyone so their constituency is the ones with the most money not the ones with the most votes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conclusive proof of Congressional corruption beyond a shadow of a doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1. You know the document Hank Paulsen "forced" the top 9 banks to sign to take billions in dollars in a one page letter? Did you know it contained one sentence, "This agreement cannot be reviewed by any court" clause, putting all of them above the laws you and I have to follow or be jailed? This one minute of the film is worth the price of the ticket. It conclusively proves the corruption, fraud, and taxpayer theft going on right before our eyes by our congressional representatives. 2. Delete a few f**ks, and this would be a "G" rated movie. Why would Michael Moore accept a very undeserved "R" rating? 3. Every fact stated in the movie can be proved. So why do his critics say he lies just to make money? Every moviegoer has been affected by the facts so brilliantly portrayed. Yet they prefer keeping their heads in the sand while their grandchildren are saddled with so much phony debt. 4. Michael didn't include it, but Goldman Sachs' tax rate last year was One Per Cent of their profits. Try paying a one per cent tax rate on your earnings and see what happens. 5. See this movie and tell your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore at His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant examination of capitalism and the kinds of social behavior it promotes. Moore has an uncanny way of saying the things many of us think, but don't dare say. He draws from examples in industry, banking, the judiciary, and congress. He nicely weaves together examples from history (including Ancient Rome) with those from the present day. He also builds a plausible argument for an overly cozy relationship between Wall Street and Washington since Reagan and suggests that Obama augers a potential end to that relationship. Those from all points on the political spectrum will find something to love about this film. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very emotional and polemic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start writing, I wanted to say that I began watching this movie (documentary) with an open mind and I'm not a Michael Moore hater or a capitalist or anything... Actually I come from Europe, but I'm not a socialist either!I just finished watching this and I was thinking when is this going to end, it's just way too long. As I like watching good documentaries, I thought this was a very bad documentary! There were nearly no facts presented and it felt kinda awkward a lot of the time. Their were a lot of emotions in it, watching poor people lose their homes, lose their jobs or getting screwed by idiots (example the corrupt judge). Yeah sure you need to feel sorry about them, with all the rhetoric Michael Moore uses and all the drama he builds up, who doesn't feel bad for them!? But assuming it was the fault of "capitalism" is just pure bullshit! And that some people worship money more than anything else and are greedy as hell, hasn't a thing to do with capitalism! It's the nature of some people that behave like this. Also the American culture provides the perfect breeding ground for things like this to happen. So it's the fault of the society that these things happen and not capitalism! Let me give you another example, in very socialistic countries like Venezuela you also have greed, corruption and an very elite top that have control and power over the majority. I don't want to defend capitalism or anything, but to make it short... Every system has it pro's and con's, there is no perfect system out there, but capitalism is as good as it gets. It's the society (politicians, media, culture, education and the people) who make the difference! That is also the problem of this documentary, you can see and feel that Michael Moore made this documentary with a clear goal in his mind: To defame capitalism by any means possible. And that is not how one should make a documentary! You can have your opinion but you should stay neutral and let the audience make up its own opinion, rather than shoving your agenda down peoples throat. I think this documentary becomes more awkward the more the time passes... For example he more than ones stated that capitalism is now over because of the financial crisis and with Obama now being president we leave capitalism and everything bad behind us and America will become the social "happyland"! I was thinking "WTF", nothing much has changed! Yes, we had an economic downturn, but as soon as business is up on its feet again, everything will be back as before and a lot of people will worship money and praise capitalism again... Nothing has changed! Thats why I say it's society not the system, but Michael Moore doesn't understand that concept! Instead he is using emotions and polemic to make a point! He for example asked some priests and a bishop what they think about capitalism and what Jesus would think about capitalism. Their answer was for example "capitalism is evil" and he continued and showed a short film about a capitalist version of Jesus where Jesus uses all the clichés of greed and capitalism. WTF!? These are not arguments, this is bullshit! Since when does it matter what a priest thinks!? Yes, the priest can have his opinion, but this doesn't make it an argument against capitalism. At the end of the movie he showed the pictures of New Orleans after Katrina with sad music in the background and said: "Why is it always the poor who have to suffer the misery? Why isn't Madoff up on the roof screaming for help? Or the head of Citibank?" etc etc... Yeah that is the kind of juxtaposition Michael Moore uses to brainwash the audience. What does Katrina have to do with capitalism? And why not stick with the truth? The people stuck in the NYC World Trade Center on 9-11-2001 screaming for help or jumping out of the window out of desperation were not what I would call poor people... And these kind of arguments and bullshit continues to the whole movie, so why is Michael Moore doing this?? Because he cannot argument on an intellectual level and thats why he uses emotions, drama, juxtaposition and polemic to get his point down. This is not what I call a documentary, it's more like a conspiracy or propaganda movie. If anybody wants to see a well made documentary about the financial crisis on an intellectual level, I would recommend watching the 3 part series of BBC called the "The Love of Money".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore holds back nothing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's latest feature, Capitalism: A Love Story, has everything I could want from one of his films: a hotly debated and relevant issue, information, personal accounts, funny clips, and great music. I enjoy seeing his films not so much to be informed, which I feel he does quite well, but to be entertained. That is something rare with a documentary. I don't think you can say the same about An Inconvenient Truth.Love him or hate him, Moore makes a fantastic film. This time he takes one the recent economic turmoil this country has been facing for the past year or so. Moore traces it's roots back to the Reagan administration on up. He presents a lot of facts, memos, and documents some companies and banks would not like us to see, but he does it because the people have a right to know.I can't say much about what went on because Moore presents a lot of data, but to the best of my ability I can say that there is an awful lot of shady activity going on behind closed doors. We look at the bail out plan proposed to congress. We see how companies like Goldman Sachs infiltrates the government and starts doing their own bidding. We see companies spend their money frivolously while workers and homeowners are losing their jobs and livelihood. Some of these banks and groups do terrible things that force people into uncomfortable and downright oppressive situations.One thing I expected to see from this film was Moore perspective and nothing else. I don't know what information he is withholding and what truths he is stretching, but I am impressed with how convincing some of his arguments and testimonials are. He plays on our heartstrings like a trained musician, hitting home with issues involving blue collar Americans struggling to keep their jobs, their homes, and their families together.Aside from the content of the film, the actual film itself is very well put together. He makes excellent use of stock footage from the 50s and 60s, weaving them perfectly to fit the film's flow. One thing Moore does better than most is his use of music to drive home a point or a feeling. Be it classical, rock, or country, Moore blends it all together quite nicely.This film makes you think. It makes you angry. It makes you want to do something, and that's okay. That is what a film is supposed to do. It is designed to evoke some sort of emotion and help spring it forth. That's not to say you should go out and do something drastic, but it will at least make for excellent conversation amongst friends and coworkers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But Only Tackles Half The Problem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judged purely as entertainment, CAPITALISM is an easy A. Michael Moore has a knack for blending humor with tragedy.However, this is a pseudo-documentary (more like video op-ed) about politics, economics, and modern American culture. So, I have to judge it also based on the arguments presented. As such, it's just a B-.The problem with this movie is while it does expose 'the haves' for their excesses, corruption, and greed, it doesn't turn the same camera on the protagonists in this film - 'the have-nots.' Consider the case of the family who is being evicted from their house, even being paid to essentially work as the cleaning crew for their foreclosure. The father describes how their mortgage payment went from $1700 to I believe over $2500. Moore fails to illustrate the fact that this couple had clearly signed up for an ARM - adjustable rate mortgage. They had the opportunity to lock in a fixed rate and chose otherwise. In this case, as in thousands of cases around the country, the homeowner has chosen to gamble, no differently than the Wall Street folks Moore condemns. He could argue that mortgage brokers didn't give its customers the best advice. But, that's like saying a car salesman didn't explain to me the benefits of owning a hatchback. They are all just salesmen. Only a lazy consumer listens and follows everything a salesman says.Further, while discussing how the Reagon era brought some terrible economic changes not the least of which was increased consumer debt, he never explores why normal people decided to rack up that debt on unnecessary consumer purchases. Lenders can only be blamed for so much. Predatory lending? Sure. But, even if they gave out 0% home equity loans and credit cards, it wouldn't address the fact that people were living beyond their means. No one saved. And, you can't blame any bank for that.Moore's exposure of the inherent corruption involved with the bailout bill passed just this past November was excellent and by far the highlight of the film. Not to discount the human element of the earlier scenes, but his account of just how deeply involved current/former Goldman Sachs executives where in the construction and execution of this bill really illustrates his core argument that 'the haves' are able to steal from the 'have-nots' with little to no repercussion.Nevertheless, his conclusion (and that of several featured clergymen) that capitalism is inherently evil is false. Unregulated capitalism perhaps. But, unregulated anything can be evil. Capitalism is actually more democratic than our democracy. Remember, we are a republic. We don't vote on issues - we vote for people who vote on issues. But, capitalism allows everyone the ability to make a profit equally (though it can be argued that access to education and credit may not be). Similarly, we each have a power as a consumer to vote with our dollars. This is something Moore failed to delve into - the idea that a consumer is actually more powerful than a voter. Anyone could decide tomorrow to stop shopping at Wal-Mart. It would be almost impossible for any organization/corporation/government to corrupt this simple relationship. You can pay off politicians. But, you can't really force people to pay someone for goods/services if they don't want to. Even with all their wealth, the top 1% can't make up much more than 5% of consumer spending. In this respect, they are economically powerless.Capitalism is not the problem. Corruption is. Moore asks the question, what would Jesus think of capitalism? I think he would be indifferent. Socio-economic systems are just tools to be used. It's like asking what he'd think about knives. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't want anyone to stab each other. But, it'd be nice to have when making a meal. Of course he'd be disappointed by the sight of someone losing their house. But, I think he'd be equally disappointed in the people who have lost the home. Greed is not a luxury of the rich. It's practiced by normal, working people everyday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the kind of useful plea and battle cry that you can either take or leave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is Capitalism? How do we define it in the 21st century? How did we define it even fifty years ago when America appeared to be riding high and the middle class did quite well without foreign competitors (without those, you know, other countries in Europe and Asia working at full capacity)? How is it a moral issue for someone to be fully invested (no pun intended) in a system that requires that high profits be continually maintained? How about, most importantly, when a system that Churchill once said was simply the "least evil" one available, corrupts people's lives, systems of government, and one's own immortal soul? More to the point, what would Jesus do? If you ask Michael Moore, or for that matter one of Moore's priests he interviewed for this documentary, he would not quite fit in the corporate world. At all. Unless they re-dub King of Kings, that is.These and many more questions are asked by Moore in his latest film, perhaps even more ambitious and powerful than Fahrenheit 9/11. He cites Ronald Regan as one of the key contributors, maybe the key one in political-theatrical terms, to how Capitalism is today, as he gives a speech early on with the CEO of Merryl-Lynch right by his side feeding him coaching on-tape. But it's really many other things that have just gone wild from the seeds of Regan's corporate free-for-all that let the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and jobs are lost as profits keep gaining. This latter point stems from Moore's first movie, Roger &amp; Me, and in many ways this is an epic revisit that shouldn't have to be, but is, of the things Moore was tackling back then with GM's closing of plants in Flynt, Michigan. By now things are completely out of control, and the set pieces in Capitalism: A Love Story all make up a narrative of abhorrent greed and corporate irresponsibility... perhaps that isn't even a hard enough word for some of the things shown here.From the judge who puts away juveniles to a prison in Wilkes-Barre, PA, that is run by a corporation that gives big kick-backs to the judge that makes its young misdemeanor offenders into pieces of property, to a gut-wrenching account of "Dead Peasants", which means that your boss, having filed a life insurance policy with their big corporate owner, will get paid the sooner you die, to the horror of airline pilot pay brought up by none-other than Sully the hero pilot, to just the simple use of the word 'derivative' and how incomprehensible it is to non-Harvard graduates, it all adds up. It's all presented with some sense of sarcasm, but always with a pill of truth, sometimes with people still dumbfounded by their foreclosed homes or those husbands and family members of the "Peasants." It's not that Moore is up to anything completely new in terms of his style. Indeed its the kind of film that takes into account Moore's personal history, which he's done in the past if not quite as informative (i.e. his original intentions to be a priest), while showing how things have changed for him in the twenty years he's been doing this (one guy he tries to ask a question with responds, "Stop making movies!") And, sure, Moore still tries to do his old tricks like trying to make citizen's arrests of the CEO's of the big banks, or pulling up a huge truck to get back the bail-out money that no one seems to know where it went. For better or worse, he still makes his movies the way he wants to, with lots of archive footage edited and scored at this point to a kind of slick, propaganda-style perfection.Even if its central end-premise to the audience mostly makes sense when coupled with Roosevelt's 2nd Bill of Rights- in a speech shown here for the sake of a heartrending climax - its how the film gains momentum as it goes along, how more and more it goes to lengths to bring the audience in as active participants, that makes it unforgettable. There's a lot in the film to be angry about, and more, even if the don't agree with the filmmaker, should be. What happened last year was, as one interviewee puts it, equal to a dam that burst but started as a small leak years ago. But there is some hope, or the possibilities of it, and that too makes Capitalism worth your while. It's the kind of bittersweet crowd-pleaser that also has some good storytelling; we see early on the sad plight of the factory in Chicago where its workers are told they have three days till they're fired. For those not informed on this whole story it may look like the end... but Moore brings it back around in the last quarter of the film as one of those triumphant stories of a sit-down that actually, ultimately, works! For a filmmaker who has been focused on the ills of American greed, of the richest 1% vs the other 95%, for so long, and for that to be such a mammoth undertaking to cover in two hours, to give just the slight glimpses of light at the end of the tunnel is invigorating.This is the kind of movie some people will rush out to see, and some will surely not see it, likely out of a personal disdain for Moore as a personality/filmmaker (I know both sides personally). But for those who give Moore one more chance - just as Moore himself gives one last roll of the dice to get an interview with General Motors after twenty years of attempts- the film provides vivid and horrifying insights into the state of the nation's economic (not)-well-being. And by the way, he isn't leaving America, so if he still hates it... I must have missed seeing it somewhere down the line. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't be chattering about how we're bound to the system of capitalism to be free, to have super powers etc. But this documentary intentionally twists all the rationale and reduces itself to a finger-pointing-populist-crybaby. It simply doesn't know what it's talking about.Capitalism, as we conceive today, has been around for about 600 years. According to this documentary the entity of capitalism has been run by big conglomerates, corrupted politicians and profit loving establishments - not by us. But after the mortgage crisis, we had enough and we realized there's something wrong. Congratulations.And this documentary makes its point by asking priests and bishops about their opinions on economy, since they're the all-knowing masters of economic principles. This is actually ironic, since "protestant ethics" is the major element behind mercantilism, a harsher type of capitalism.It also makes use of people whose relatives are deceased, who lost their jobs, houses etc. for pseudo-emotional purposes."How can those people lose their jobs, houses? Even if they still have cars? What happened to America? Capitalism, you're a bad, bad boy!" says the documentary. Did capitalism start to hurt middle-class American dream instead of distracting them by pouring a few million bombs in Iraq? Apparently.I won't bother forming an anti-argument. Looks like Mr. Moore doesn't know anything at all about how capitalism rose in the context we conceive today. I'd suggest reading about protestant ethics and Max Weber. And industrial revolution, great depression, world wars, Bretton Woods institutions, dollar as a reserve currency, energy crisis, financial bubbles... That means he should read a lot.I strongly suggest not to waste your time on this. If you want to understand economic systems, do what you should do and read some books. History of capitalism is interesting in particular, because it reveals how people prospered while others suffered, how low human could be and how the world became what it is today. But this documentary will only give you pseudo information and will try to agitate you with "they are to blame - not you" act. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak arguments and misleading information</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's film Capitalism: A love story is a two-hour critique of capitalism. This is nothing new from Moore, though it's his first sustained critique of capitalism. Unfortunately, and this is a major problem, Moore doesn't really have a clear understanding of what capitalism is. The US is a mixed economy. It is a mixture of capitalism and socialism. The government owns and controls parts of the economy to some extent or other. Thus when things go bad economically, it's not always capitalism's fault. Moore doesn't understand this. He doesn't know what crony capitalism or corporatism are. He talks about the bank bailouts and seems to think this is capitalism. He gives a perfect example of crony capitalism with the Friends of Angelo program at Countrywide. He thinks these are capitalism because they involve private companies. He shows us other private companies where workers get to vote on company policies, or private companies run as co-ops, and seems to think that this is somehow not capitalism. He waffles on regulation, at times criticizing deregulation, then saying that you just can't regulate capitalism because it's evil. His evidence is some theologians that say it's evil because it doesn't provide for the needs of everyone. Of course while these theologians are talking to Moore, they're not providing help to the poor and downtrodden. Does that make them evil? Does the fact that capitalism encourages charitable donations mean anything? They seem to be setting up an arbitrarily high standard for capitalism, which they can't themselves live up to.Moore wants to show how things are just getting worse in this country as capitalism further encroaches, but he only has anecdotal examples. The poor in this country live better than the middle class in most countries throughout the world throughout history: they have electricity, clean water, heat, ac, tvs, cell phones, cars, wardrobes of clothing, electronics, computers, internet, and so on. And that's the poor. The poor used to starve to death (and still do in many countries) now we have an obesity crisis. Everyone's standard of living continues to improve due to capitalism. Is that evil?The arguments mostly rely on misleading information and insinuation, rather than any serious exploration of facts. A good example is the case of the airline pilots. He looks at how poorly paid these local commuter pilots are. The reason, of course, is because they're on the lowest rung of the ladder, flying short, cheap flights. Careercast.com says that the average salary for a pilot in 2010 is $115,000. Those greedy airlines are really squeezing those pilots. This might explain why Moore's implication that poor wages lead to more poor airline safety is unfounded. At the time of deregulation of the airline industry in the late 70s, the number of airline fatalities peaked. That is, after deregulation, as the number of people flying was increasing rapidly, total fatalities were still decreasing. The most dangerous airline in the country is Comair, which has recorded 3 fatal crashes in 25 years, out of a total of 5.54 million flights. Moore would say those accidents must have been caused by greed leading companies to short on safety. Actually, the four world airlines with the worst safety record are all state owned: Cubana Airlines, China Airlines, Pakistan Airlines and Iranian Airlines. Cubana airlines in fact had 8 fatal accidents in the past 25 years on only 320,000 flights. Moore also clearly doesn't understand many of the issues he discusses. For example he talks about derivatives, and claims they're just sophisticated gambling, though he admits he doesn't understand them. But there are plenty of people who do understand them, and what they'll tell you is that derivatives are a way for companies to share risk. The companies let other people buy up some of their risk so that they can reduce their exposure. The investors share potential profits or losses. It's a system that tends to produce more stability in a market (one need just look at the erratic prices of the onion market, the only agricultural market without futures trading, for a good example). The derivatives can get complicated depending on the nature of what they cover. Could Moore seriously not find an economist who could explain this?In fact, when he says he wants to end capitalism and replace it with democracy he really shows his ignorance. Capitalism is an economic system and democracy is a political system. It's possible to have one, the other, either or both. They're independent. In fact, he brought Stephen Moore on (the only person he brought on with any economics training), who rightly pointed out that democracy has not historically overall led to greater prosperity, improved living conditions or improved human rights. It's controversial, but there's evidence to back this up. But capitalism does bring these, consistently and unambiguously. You'd totally expect Michael Moore to try to refute this or even just respond somehow, but he doesn't. He just moves on to talking about how capitalism is not guaranteed by the constitution (which is inaccurate: capitalism means private ownership, which is protected by the 4th and 5th amendments, not to mention the commerce clause in article I). By saying he wants to replace capitalism with democracy, he avoids the important question: if capitalism is so bad, what do we replace it with? Every system is imperfect, but what's the alternative? Should we adopt FDR's "Second Bill of Rights"? Is that better? Among those rights is the guarantee of a job. The Teacher Unions have effectively won that right by making it almost impossible to fire a public school teacher, but it's led to declining quality of education. Doesn't that violate that other right to good education? It's easy to talk in the abstract about how great something would be, until you actually have to put it in practice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore an easy target for the ignorant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does IMDb allow a brown-nosing, Ayn-Randian, GOPer to write the featured summary of Moore's film? There is no indication that this person has even *seen* the film, which only came out the day I am writing this. Critics of Moore, of the Democratic Party, of leftists, Marxists, Socialists, Maoists, Stalinists, defenders of civil liberties, intellectuals (all these groups bundled into one ball by the Fox Newsers), and, well, any group that doesn't just LOVE the glories of interplanetary cut-throat capitalism just want to jump down the readers' throats from the get-go, shutting off the discussion that is so crucial to a democracy (like ours, in theory). Why does IMDb allow such a soapbox to someone who is so clearly ignorant of his/her subject matter (i.e., Moore's documentary)? I, by the way, have mixed views on Moore, but I mostly feel positive about him. He is positively NOT "fair and balanced" (to quote the most cynical of slogans heralded by the most cynical of cable "news" outlets). Moore is clearly a propagandist. He by and large preaches to the choir, just as Sean Hannity does. But Moore is much more talented--and funny--than Hannity and his ilk, and he has, deep down, an infinitely stronger sense of humanity than the Fox News crowd. I don't hate capitalism, but it could sure be improved, scaled back and regulated. Unregulated capitalism = piracy, not freedom! I agree with Moore that Reagan did some awful things to this country, most of all his production of policies favoring the rich and hurting the poor and middle class. Sadly, there are many middle class people and even some poor who don't realize that the policies of the Reaganites--pushed even further to the right by Reagan's heirs--do NOT benefit but in fact hurt them. The middle class is shrinking at an alarming rate, and this shrinkage is not the result of the policies of Carter, Clinton and Obama (though they are not free from a bit of blame) but the policies of Reagan and the Bushes. To inform us all of this curious turn that has occurred over the past 30 years, Moore is very much on target. We should heed his words, even if they are not completely fair. (Who says he HAS to be fair anyway? He doesn't CLAIM to be "fair and balanced.") He tells the truth--not the whole truth, but a crucial part of it that is tragically ignored by the so-called "liberal media." We ignore Moore at our own peril.</fullReview>

Anybody with a mid-level knowledge of economics will see that there are no actual economic arguments contained within the film. It's purely entertainment, folks. I'm not saying that every accusation in the movie is wrong, I'm saying that Moore provides no data whatsoever to support his conclusions. Economics is a tough, unintuitive field and is all too often presented as simple cause and effect. Nope.Even from a non-economics critical thinking perspective, the movie is badly lacking. Many of the scenarios are niche occurrences - little relevance to discussing capitalism as a system.major point: why doesn't Moore interview AN ECONOMIST? Hm?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure, I have also posted this as a general comment on one of the threads for this movie. Anyhow...Personally, I think this was an engaging, thought provoking and well done movie, which I hesitate to call a documentary, because Michael Moore's films are quite unique and straddle quite aptly the balance between mainstream entertainment and serious documentaries.As always Moore's timing is impeccable and "Capitalism: A Love Story" has come out at just the right time. I think that he is only getting better and better with each ensuing release. This is truly what the doctor ordered! Just like with his last film "Sicko", this one invites people of all political, religious, cultural, ethnic and racial stripes to take a look at themselves and the world they live in, at their values, beliefs and at the overall human condition. One does not have to be for example a Democrat or a Republican, Liberal or Conservative, to identify with and feel for some of the people whose stories paint a terrible portrait of pain, suffering, neglect and abuse.With his usual mix of humour, melancholy, sadness and righteous anger, Moore creates a canvas of where our society is at today, not only the US but I would wager even the rest of the world! It is hard to ignore the plight of the faces behind the statistics. Numbers and polls loose meaning when the human quotient comes forth so strongly and one can assign flesh and blood to those that have fallen by the wayside.After watching this film one question popped in my head "What the hell has happened to us?" "Who are we?" How is it possible that we have become so desolate and empty as people, as persons, as individuals and citizens, that we have allowed ourselves and others to decay and fall so low and to such a state of degradation and misery?! Where is our decency, our compassion, our sympathy and even empathy in relation with our fellow human beings?! Have we become so alienated and zombified that we are only guided by our greed, hypocrisy and lust? I guess we have...There are two poignant moments in the movie, whose content I don't want to discuss specifically for those who have not seen it.One is the scene of a dog jumping around a table trying to get some of the food on the table being consumed by its human masters. Seeing that make me think that I am very much like that dog, jumping around and hoping for that promised piece of life pie, but ending up with the leftover crumbs thrown my way with a mixture of disgust and contempt by the powers that be! I am indeed a "Dead Peasant"! The other involves 5 of the most touching and relevant minutes I have ever seen on film, it features one of the best politicians and Presidents the US has had the fortune of producing and a stunning and touching wish for his country. I truly commend Moore's team of researchers for having found that particular piece! Unless we wake up soon to the reality surrounding us... we are truly lost!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a huge Moore fan, but this one is a must-see. I laughed at Moore's stunts, cried for the people losing their homes to foreclosure, gritted my teeth in anger at the unregulated bankers who took profit from grief, and I sat through the credits. If you must pay nine bucks to support the capitalist entertainment industry, put it where it will do some good - in the pockets of Moore, who can be trusted to do the right thing with his share of proceeds. He brings to the screen the plight of us consumption-driven, unsavvy middle-class plebeians in a way that the rest of the media can't, or won't.In this hugely entertaining film, Moore distinguishes capitalism from democracy. He argues that citizens should have the right to vote, produce, profit and prosper, but not to engulf and devour (my words, with apologies to Mel Brooks) their customers. Citing and hopefully reviving FDR's unrealized Second Bill of Rights, Moore seeks to empower those of us without the education or resources to fend off the one per cent who run the country, scam us, and bleed us dry. Worth the price of admission alone is the scene where Moore stretches a yellow "crime scene" banner around the headquarters of Wall Street financial institutions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY and the Politics of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Controversial documentarian Michael Moore has taken on some important news topics over the past two decades but perhaps none has affected every American more than the financial meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 as depicted in Capitalism: A Love Story. Done in his customary style of news clips, interviews, and enactments, he has fashioned a convincing indictment of greedy bank executives while being engaging and at times enlightening. He points out a startling fact: We used to be one income family, Wall Street and corporate profits were guided by sound principles, and our country had no business competition. It's a kind of history lesson courtesy of Moore as he also notes parallels between the demise of Wall Street and that of the Roman Empire, a comparison not without merit. His thesis is that since President Ronald Reagan came into office, the influence of Wall Street has increased to the point that, while Congress and the U.S. Treasury have promoted financial deregulation, many of them have direct links to financial giants such as Goldman Sachs. It would seem on surface to be a major conflict of interest, and that is the point. A handful of CEO's have benefited from running the country as a corporation and costing millions of jobs and livelihoods. Moore ties news stories to an increasing pattern of corporate greed. There is a juvenile facility in Pennsylvania financed by taxpayer money and corrupt public officials. There are college students beholden to banks with student loans, and we witness news reports of a recent plane crash in Buffalo, New York, for what appears to be the lack of funds for safety issues. Then there is the surprising practice of businesses like Wal-Mart that take out life insurance policies on its employees and collecting on the benefits. By contrast, he does show examples of companies owned by workers that operate efficiently and at a profit. His point is there can be win-win situations.As Wall Street sold 'derivatives', a risky form of corporate gambling, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that Americans tap the equity in their homes, and thus came the refinance boom for banks and a new found wealth for the masses-or was it? Using a home like a bank was a formula for financial disaster as the housing industry collapsed with foreclosures and the banking industry fell too. Moore makes his point with footage of actual foreclosures as sheriffs evict homeowners, and the cruelty is not only losing a home but in the cottage industry that has taken advantage of this agonizing process. Added to this is the preferential treatment that CEO's gave to each other and many lawmakers regarding mortgage approvals. The question that keeps being asked by Moore and others is 'where were the regulators' in all this? As Congress debated on how to repair the economy with a bailout of as much as $700 billion of taxpayer money, Wall Street used media abetted fear to manipulate lawmakers. It was a politics of fear. But not everyone was buying into the fear. Some members of Congress were brave enough to tell a sobering tale of a lack of oversight versus corporate bonuses being fed by the bailout.Moore shows that some people are fighting back. A new President (Obama) ushers in the potential for change. People are fighting foreclosures and forcing banks to prove chain of title. The laid off workers at Republic Doors refused to exit the factory, and with media coverage and a supportive President, Bank of America caves in and agrees to pay the workers what is owed to them. This event is not without precedent as Moore points out in 1936, workers at a GM Flint, Michigan plant also fought back. In an ironic, fascinating piece of history of what might have been, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed but never lived to see a second Bill of Rights which would address virtually every important concern for Americans including health care, education, and financial security. Then Moore makes this observation based on a private corporate memo that says 1% of the population in this country has 95% of the wealth but that the other 99% have an equal vote and the power to make changes (yet still hope to be part of the rich). It is this equal vote that scares the corporate powers. His conclusion is that the only hope for this country is for democracy to work. Some things don't come off well in the film; Moore appears to be grandstanding when he rents an armored car to make a citizen's arrest of the CEOs of Wall Street and get back the public's money. He even takes crime scene tape to cordon off bank doors. Also, an interview with actor Wallace Shawn seems a bit out of place. Wouldn't an interview with an industry insider have worked better? You may not agree with everything Moore espouses, but some of the information should cause anyone to research the facts and draw their own conclusions. If you are a fan of his previous films Sicko or Fahrenheit 9/11, then you will appreciate Capitalism: A Love Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Moore's put together an insightful film to remind us of the powers working behind the scenes to accommodate the laws and practices of law-makers and regulators in the U.S. to the needs and advantage of incessantly profit-hungry corporations. His approach is to analyze Capitalism as an economic system as a whole.He makes a strong case once again, not for the incarceration of executives (although he does at one point walk up to the HQs of a handful of financial behemoths with intentions of making a citizen's arrest- ha!) or for any sort of radical reform, but for us, the average working class, the masses, the voting majority, the "peasants," to defend our interests with our votes and voices, and maintain our awareness of the influence at play. He suggests we demand that the principles of democracy we so highly value in our political system be applied in the running of the business structures we depend on for our goods, services and income.He once again attempts to show us how we've been getting the short end of the stick by comparison to our counterparts in Europe and Asia, and applies other familiar methods in delivering his message: humor, infuriating examples of exploited Ameicans, his usual passively defiant antics, historical references and plenty of testimonies and contributions from qualified experts and politicians.This film will, at the very least, motivate you to do a little research and discussing of your own so you can come to your own conclusions and understanding of why we had a full collapse of our financial system in 2008 and where we might need to aim our attention and efforts to implement changes that will prevent its recurrence. Critics can criticize Moore and this film all they want but in the end, his objective, I believe, is to share information and encourage open discussion. Democracy affords us these privileges and, if we do not exercise them, they will once again atrophy with time and our indifference to enable the repetition of the abuses we witnessed throughout the duration of the GDub maladministration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather superficial treatment of capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While recognizing that the imbalance of the distribution of wealth is causing many of the problems we see in America today, Moore failed to tackle the root of the evil - the surplus value that capitalists have to constantly create for themselves, the alienation of labor, fetish of commodities and the devastating degradation of the environment caused by capitalism. Most of the movie, Capitalism, a love story, seems to be preoccupied with depiction of the wage discrepancy between CEOs and workers and the powerful influence of wealthy capitalists on politics. Moore rarely digs below the surface to show the monotonous, dehumanizing nature of most occupations in a society where capitalism has not ceased for a moment to strengthen its hold on the people's consciousness. Moore also fails to reveal the concealed relationship between capitalists and consumers under exchange of commodities. In a society where people are constantly subject to the influence of a flood of medias, advertisements and commercials to entice them to buy more products, to consume and thus to maintain the existence of surplus value, it is too hard to ignore the immense presence of the exchange of commodities in daily life and what it means for capitalism. Perhaps this movie should be better titled as "Capitalism, a superficial love story."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admire Michael Moore. He gets angry about clear injustices and does something about it by making his uniquely stylised documentaries. You will laugh, you will cry. No, really, you will laugh and cry - it can be powerful stuff.The problem with Michael Moore's brand of polemic/satire is twofold. The first, for which he's hardly to blame, is that his subject matter dates fast. The film is clearly a decentred mosaic of targets: Bush is the most familiar; the banking crisis and the 700bn dollar "coup-d'etat" bail-out are treated more as symptomatic than as central. The second is that his style is hectoring razzmatazz - in other words, propaganda. Whether or not he has good reason not to like something, it's the manner in which he discusses it, rather than the reason why that should be the case, which is the principal focus. I often stared at a screen whirling in not only unsupported but actually meaningless stat- graphics emphasising the badness of the bad guys.A lot of background work has gone into this film. Contemporary footage is intercut - at speed - with a great deal of archive and web-based video and stills material. You can give yourself over to this, roaring with laughter at Ronald Reagan's back catalogue of film roles preparing him for Republican government or agog at a company whose memo calmly notes that an employee is worth more to them dead than alive. It's thoroughly entertaining. I just wish that more work had gone into making this a temperate argument for the benefits of socialism or the guilt of its subjects. 6/10</fullReview>

His movies include a Sicko, Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine,etc. Each one attacking the CONSERVATIVE ideas.Well he has put out a new movie. Capitalism:A Love Story. I saw this movie and I have to say it's fun, informative, Michael Moore doesn't have a 2 hour long boring movie, which the average joe wouldn't understand. He tells the movie like narrator and even is kind of comedic and then switches to serious in a couple of words. I loved this movie. I don't agree with him on some of the ideas. But I get what he's saying.Very interesting movie. Even if you don't agree with him, you'll still be fascinated.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am always pleased to see a Michael Moore documentary because he fearlessly and often foolishly openly criticizes the greed and cruelty of the rich. This is populist because in a democracy it is truly democratic. While he occasionally oversteps the credibility gap and sometimes wrongly harangues employees (security guards and doormen who like him are plain Joes doing their job) the overall effect by the film's end is that the viewer gets some satisfaction of the expose and confrontation involved. Moore does do what most of might want to do but does it for us instead. Well, for me anyway, and I am assuming there is more than a few mees. Wall street suits needed a swift kick for their greed and this films does it nicely. Corporate America getting a reckoner in popular culture is a pretty good topic and Moore's film will do until news channels get the message too. I am at a loss to understand severe criticism of Moore and his efforts because at least he is making the effort to expose the rot. For that alone I will watch and enjoy a Michael Moore film. I read reviews carping that he is hypocritical because only a democratic capitalist system would allow him to make the film criticizing them in the first place. Yes and so it should. It is called democracy. Most rich people I know believe they are right in every case simply because they have a lot of money, it is an arrogance that basically says that if you are poor you are stupid, wrong and have no rights. Moore's challenges will always be popular because he refutes the right of the rich on that very basis and for that I will watch his films.</fullReview>

In a funny, comical way he tackles a very serious issue and hits right on the mark.He goes through examining, from all the way back of the Reagan administration, to the current time how corporations has slowly but successfully eroded democracy in US and replaced it with something that favours them.And the point is obvious, you Americans need to wake up as your country has been taken over by big money corps. Your government no longer serve you, the people, it serves the corporations.Hats of for Michael Moore for having the balls to tackle such a "dangerous" topic. Too bad he got such a bad rep in the US...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, with some smoking guns...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the key elements I took from this engaging docu were: * After World War II, the rich in America paid 90% tax on their earnings. This tax was used to build the nation...infrastructure and the like. However, America's prosperity was build on its industrial competitors (Japan and Germany) being reduced to rubble by US forces. So, as Moore attacks the capitalist system and seeks to provide alternatives, you can sense that these halcyon days for the US can never be returned to.* One of the "smoking guns" I alluded to is the practice of insuring the workers whereby the company is the beneficiary of the payout if the worker dies. These companies/insurance companies called this the "dead peasants" policy. Whilst the claim is often made that there is no class warfare in the US, you can see what the corporations REALLY think of their relationship with their employees...there IS class warfare, and the rich are waging it...you just wouldn't read about it, really.* The other smoking gun is a memo CitiBank sent out to its wealthy clientele which laid bare the class warfare being waged by the rich against the poor. CitiBank referred to a "Plutonomy"...in other words, the wealthy minority pillaging the national wealth...a case where capitalism is embraced, but democracy is feared...real 'banana republic' territory.* Film maker Michael Moore does pitch his movie at Americans, so you do get pointed references to capitalism being evil and anti-religious...claims sure to arouse anger amongst 'god fearing Americans' who have embraced 'the prosperity gospel'.* Even though Moore doesn't really provide (or seek to provide) a coherent alternative model for society/production, he does give examples of elements of such a future society...American companies that prosper and are a shining beacon to socialism...in other words, companies that are collectively controlled by their employees and reward them well. For Americans indoctrinated by propaganda against the evils of socialism, this could be quite an eye opener...or something to rail against, if you are a Fox News pundit.* We know that the US grew rich and powerful by the practice of slavery, but to see how American capitalism is striving for the next best thing now is interesting. E.g. in trying to break unions, you get airline pilots who would make more money working for McDonalds, perhaps! It's the Plutonomy exploiting the workers, no doubt. In other words, US business is aiming for the next best thing to slavery (for them)...McJobs with McPay.* You get insight into this Plutonomy...bizarro Robin Hoods, robbing from the poor to give to the rich. The corporate criminals whose fraudulent schemes almost sent their companies bankrupt got rewarded...the American tax payers bailed them out to the tune of around 1.5 trillion dollars! This is a corrupt form of capitalism...they were free to profit from their fraud, but if they failed, the tax payers bailed them out...and they got a bonus out of it, still! Yes, in Plutonomy capitalism you privatise the profits and socialise the losses. A great opportunity for a redistribution of wealth was lost with the current crisis...the frauds got to be protected from their greed, when they should have been bankrupted, allowing some mammals to succeed the dinosaurs. Instead, we get an economy which is for the sole benefit of the frauds and greedy. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith's ironic summation of the British conservatives' position on taxes and incentives is quite illustrative here:"The rich need more money as an incentive and the poor need less money as an incentive".* Not stated in the docu, but implicit in it, is, I think, that there is a 'worthy' poor. However, Moore echoes what has been disclosed previously...that the poor favour inequitable tax regimes because they hope to benefit from it one day, in the delusion that they too can 'make it'! In the face of this massive failure for Plutonomy capitalism, you'd think that maybe "the devil you know" may look like the worst option...but hey, it's their world! * Loved the analysis on Timothy Geitner...a senior economic apparatchik in the US. He is living proof of The Peter Principle. When such incompetence rewards the Plutonomy, you just know how he made it to the top! * Check out the end credits too, for great quotes, as well as just before that, on Roosevelt's plan for a 2nd Bill Of Rights. The end credit quotes show that even America's 'founding fathers' had 'bolshie' tendendies! That must have got elided from American history, right? If you would like more analysis of our current situation, I can't recommend highly enough the TV series "The ascent of money", especially after the first episode. "Derivatives" are lucidly explained in that, as well as other economic things (cf. Moore's humorous clips of so called 'experts' trying in vain to explain such concepts. The Australian series "Addicted to money" is also good, but not as forensic as "The ascent of money". It also limits itself to the current crisis, not the history of money, as the former series does.Anyway, you have to be a bit sad that the average American has fallen to corporate/government spin about the evils of a more socialist society and the benefits of their own perverse form of capitalism. It's a greater pity that real capitalism wasn't allowed to hold sway in the past year...the lunatics have well and truly taken over the asylum...how long till they rip us off again? Will we bail them out next time? My concern is that in the near future there may be just as big a financial crisis, caused by a wrong-headed attempt to address the current one...and we may have blown all our money at that point and have no ammunition to combat the next implosion. Just how stupid can we be? Stay tuned. Next stop: banana republic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We do not have capital or capitalism this is a legislative fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once we went bankrupt in 1933 the way the politicians and bankers designed it, we stopped using capital. Before the truth movement started, which is anything but truth, I heard about Michael's new film. I decided to research our economy and financial system. I then found out about monetized debt which I had labeled debting and debt crediting before 80 million other people heard about it.Before Michael's film was even complete, I knew we did not have capitalism because we do not use capital. BANKS CAN RUN OUT OF CAPITAL. Monetizing debt is simply the creation of a species of money, that species of money being debt, and giving more loans, devaluing more labor and properties and hyper inflating the economy by exponentially increasing the nations float capital.In fact even the GDP incorporates the creation of money through monetized debt which means those numbers are a lie. The creation of money is not earns, losses and exchanges. Worse yet, the GDP is based on CORPORATE FINANCIAL HEALTH, not the financial stability of the American people.So I waited as I watched Mike's new movie. I waited for the point he informed of us this fact. I waited and then? The movie was over! He did nothing. He told us nothing. He put on a quaint little charade for well over an hour and not once did he bother to explain the corrupt money system, what a species of money is, that we are in default, a national state of emergency for 80+ years, we are collateral for the debt and beyond.Mike's first 2 movies were really good and eye opening. Unfortunately they made him a lot of money and since then his work is bordering on satire. He has become an egomaniac and a Hollywood socialite. He has tens of millions of dollars, armed bodyguards and the best of everything...except gym membership and personal trainer.Michael Moore is unfortunately the best definition of a modern day turncoat but because the average person is legally retarded by the standards of the 90's, they will never put the pieces together and translate what the collective picture is telling them. We are DEBT SLAVES. The problems and economic crashes have NOTHING to do with mismanagement. They need to make the debt hole so big to ensure we never outlive the debt and eliminate their mafia economy and de facto democratic government destroying the Republic established by not the constitution but the declaration of independence.The constitution is what was created to charter the entire nation as a vessel and turn us into debt slaves. The constitution is FOR FACT, A CORPORATE CHARTER. It is only a constitution for those who? CONSENT TO BE REPRESENTED BY A CONTINENTAL DELEGATE.And I won't even open that can of worms because people go into blind, belligerent rages when you tell them the constitution is a lie used to turn them into slaves and collateral for THE RICH taking out loans upon the birth certificate with the bank of England and now, with the Federal Reserve.</fullReview>

But what those films did was got me thinking and thus I decided to check this movie out. This is a well crafted documentary and a important film that should be watched by many viewers. It's one of those movies that keep you thinking about today's economy and society after it's over. I don't want to get too deep into the issue and even if the viewers agree or disagree or somewhat agree and somewhat don't, it will keep the viewers thinking. And it can even be powerful sometimes. Even if the viewers know a lot about the issue that is going on such as "rich getting richer and poor getting poorer". But the way it covers the issues make it leave more of a impact and will probably want to deeply know more about the issues that this movie covers. I personally thought this movie covers the points really well while covering some powerful issues of greed. Especially how people commit crimes against humanity the legal way.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely not "roger and me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin this review I would like to say that "Roger and me" (also directed by Michael Moore) is one of my favorite movies, and T.V nation I think is a great example of early very liberal television (nowadays we have the daily show and colbert report). That being said, I also have to disclose I have two business degrees including the coveted MBA. So is this a good movie, well unfortunately no. This is not the capitalist pig that dwells within me speaking, but a lover of good movie making speaking out. The second half of this movie was timely and in general pretty good, the first half was uneven and at times a little stupid. The worst scene in the entire movie came just before the movie started to pick up steam. It involved a family, who both the husband and wife worked at walmart. Walmart had taken out a small life insurance policy, on the guys wife (I am assuming to offset rehiring costs in case she died) but Michael Moore slanted it to almost look like walmart killed this poor woman. Or at the very least hoped she would die so they would get a big payout. They had the whole white trash family gathered around the dinner table, crying for their mom, all the while implying walmart was evil and to blame. If you are going to attack walmart do it on unfair wages or supporting Chinese goods made in poor work conditions with no environmental standards, not complete bull pucky. Well that was a rant. Which is what Michael Moore at least inspires in people on both sides. That is what I like about him, but not this movie, I say skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearly the most focused and therefore best Moore film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has always been difficult to assess for me because I'm European (German in fact), and he has been frequently voted the most popular American in this country. When he got the Palme d'Or for 'Fahrenheit 9/11' in 2004, this was evidently less for the merits of the film and rather for the almost unfathomable contempt the vast majority of Europeans, and especially the cultural establishment, felt for the Bush administration. It was such a relief to see that there was this guy who single-handedly took on a gigantic machinery of election fraud and systematic disinformation. Michael Moore appeared to epitomize a true 'Spirit of the Nation' for many young Europeans, while his reputation back home seemed divided. His sometimes queasy handling of facts seemed secondary to this, even though it allowed him to be conveniently dismantled by his political opponents, also here.It would seem that Moore has actually realized this problem: that his immense popularity allows him to get away with almost every scenario he chooses to portray. So instead of taking the high road, he has surprisingly cut down his perspective in 'Capitalism' and focused on what he does best: recording the statements and destinies of average people and mold them to present a message that he has been delivering for the past twenty years, but never in such a concise, participatory way: that the only way Americans can change a system that has turned detrimental and destructive to themselves as to the whole world is by taking that change into their own hands. By being so overt about this, the claim that this is just another piece of propaganda does not stick. Of course it is propaganda! And never before has Moore been more ready to admit that this is what he's doing, resulting into an almost physical invitation to actually get up from your seat in the hall and do something. For this, he deserves all the praise there can be, for that is the ultimate pinnacle of what a film can achieve.The only grain of salt is that he continues to portray Europe and Japan as 'model states' which have a higher degree of voter participation in politics and blue collar participation at the working place than the USA. As in 'Sicko', these claims ignore the fact that the whole world has been engulfed by globalization, and that our banks have made he same catastrophic mistakes as their American counterparts, had the same measures taken to avert their collapse, resulting in an equally insane amount of national debt. The German government made a 120 billion dollar debt this year for instance, and you might have heard of Greece. Also, having been born in a socialist country, I cannot concur to the statement that it might be the better political system - socialism is a good idea on a communal basis, but politically it means a one-party state, and this has always lead to abuse of power. Moore would have been well advised to leave the rest of the world out of his picture as the rest of the film is truly a masterpiece of film making with a stance.You may want to catch the Austrian documentary 'Let's make money' as well, which follows the trail of our bank deposits and investments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the subject matter sounds somewhat dry, this is one of the most watchable documentaries I've had the pleasure to sit through. Right from the outstanding opening - in which life in Imperial Rome is compared to modern-day America - I knew I was in for something good.It's my first exposure to Michael Moore, and I'm going to be actively looking for the rest of his work on the strength of this. CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY brings together such topics as the recession, homelessness, greed, Wall Street and overall the power of the banks to make and break a nation in such a way that is never less than 100% engaging.Both editing and pace are near perfect; some of the actions that Moore takes are a little silly - such as the bit with the police tape - but they certainly get his point across succinctly. I look forward to seeing what else this filmmaker has turned his talents to.</fullReview>

He talked about government programs and called them private throughout the entire movie. This movie is god awful.I made 4 pages of notes on this movie before giving up. It never talks about the 2008 crisis being due to the government creating a no risk zone for banks (removing capitalism from their businesses).

		<shortDescription>A Suprizing Example of Michael Moore's Craftsmanship and a Great Documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure if Mike made his case that capitalism is unchristian. The Catholic church probably repudiates capitalism because it is eletist and the very word "catholic" means universal, open to verybody. Jerry Falwell and most other televangelists didn't seem to see adouble standard in their belief vs their lifestyle. And lets face it, there is enormous accumulated wealth within the Vatican. Like in so many other things ("eye for an eye" vs "turn the other cheek" etc.) the bible contradicts itself on this issue. While it's true that much of the teachings attributed to Jesus do appear to espouse socialism, there are many passages in the bible that espouse capitalism, even in the new testament! Matthew 25, Verses 14-30 for instance. See Below(14) For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. (15) And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. (16) Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. (17) And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. (18) But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. (19) Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. (21) His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master. (22) And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.' (23) His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' (24) He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, (25) So I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.' (26) His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: (27) Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. (28) Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. (29) For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.

		<shortDescription>A sturdy picture with a stimulating premise proves that sometimes less is Moore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Michael Moore fan. In fact, those close to me will already know I tend to despise his films. It's not because I always disagree with his thoughts nor because I find his films uninteresting, it's due to his underhanded approach to the subject matter at hand. Never one to stray from one-sided arguments or twisted statistics, Moore presents his opinions as if they are fact and has no qualms in attacking people personally if he feels they are doing something wrong. Does he seriously wonder why politicians or company heads don't comment when he suddenly shoves a microphone and camera in their face? Because it's neither the time nor the place to have a decent, intelligent conversation ? but I suspect Moore already knows that.As you can see, I'm definitely not a huge Moore supporter, which is why Capitalism's enjoyment comes as even more of a surprise to me. Moore still reverts to his same old antics of ambush and theatrics in parts, but thankfully it is kept to a minimum. He is off screen for a major portion of the movie, allowing his interviews and narration to take control instead. No-one doubts the man is both clever and confident (his capturing of young minds all over the Western World attests to this), it's his control and objectivity we want to see, something we get more of here than in his other, lesser, docudramas. This doesn't mean he has lost his passion for the issues, he just takes a more subtle (well, Moore's version of subtle) and intelligent approach to making his point instead of throwing in adolescent-aimed insults and attacks.His previous efforts at film-making have proved one thing though, Moore knows how to use contrasting images and words to devastating effect. In a few seconds Moore can elicit a thought or sensation by, say, showing us a bird's eye view of the inside of Wall Street which slowly morphs into the inside of a casino. Or by having scenes of a family sleeping in a van head to toe accompanied by Bush delivering a speech on making things better for low-income families. Undeniably persuasive and emotive, a few times they also come across as surreptitious and pervasive; a fine line which Moore blurs intentionally.If I may put Moore aside for a moment (which is awfully hard to do when he insists on making his films so very Moore-ish), the content explored is tremendously interesting. The debate on capitalism's effectiveness ? does it just make the rich richer and the poor poorer? ? and the argument for socialism is intriguing enough to warrant further research.A sturdy picture with a stimulating premise proves that sometimes less is Moore.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

Micheal Moore as a film maker or spokes man dosn't work out very well, some love him but if any of you have a knowledge in history or economics you can see straight through his story and every argument that he poses. Once he starts to talk about something he switches to a pity story, just because he dosn't have much to cover except those three unfortunate people out of the almost 300 million Americans. There were tons of holes in this movie, A. post WWII prosperity wasn't due to lack of competition in devastated Europe, it was due to increased war time production and baby boomer's over here. B, he views capitalism as a way for people to make tons of money to the point of it almost being illegal ( a prime example Bernie Madoff, Rob Legovich), without the view of capitalism as a political system that and most people benefit from it, sure there are some that don't but thats from corrupt people not the belief. C, he leaves tons of stuff out that don't support his argument, just like in bowling for columbine where he bought that rifle, he forgot to mention all the security issues and paper work it took to receive that rifle. This movie may be amusing too some people or in view of just in form of entertainment, but in view of him trying to persuade people its not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this film I didn't really know what to expect. Michael Moore can sometimes be his own worse enemy in being too radical for his own good. Since the failure of Moore to use Fahrenheit 9'11 to get Bush out, his influence and popularity seemed to be falling away. Sicko was a brilliant and eye opening documentary but it almost failed to hit the radar.The stock market crash of 2008 really makes this film. Originally this was going to be a direct sequel to Fahrenheit 9'11 and another attack on George W Bush. Had that happened I suspect this film would have gone straight to DVD. However unregulated capitalism and an unbelievable amount of greed and corruption changed the world in 2008 and this gives Moore his ammunition.What we get is Moore back to his best. You will laugh, you will cry and you will get angry at what you see. Moore isn't trying to win an election for the Democrats this time. They too become a target for Moore's anger, especially over their decision to bail out the bankers, who should have lost everything and ended up serving prison time. "Capitalism a love story" is at its best when Moore is chasing down those on Wall street who created this mess, and there are several nice homage's to "Roger and Me" throughout the film as well. The film also excels in interviewing some of the victims of the financial deregulations. We see people who have lost their jobs and their homes from getting dodgy mortgages and suspect loans. We are shown how broken and humiliated these people are. One family is paid $1000 to clean up their house and get rid of the furniture, ready for the bank to take it over and sell it on. But what really makes this film stand out is what Michael Moore discovers about how those at the top feel about the other 95% of the population. Even if you are not a Moore fan, you will blink hard at some of the discoveries he made about large corporations and banks and how they see the rest of the population. Cue again, heart broken families and leaked shocking memo's written by those at the top.This film needs to be seen by everyone, not just liberals. It is not a direct attack on Republicans etc, but an attack on how greed and corruption can take over capitalism when it is not properly regulated. Ultimately the film become poignant with Michael Moore's closing words. Is this really his last film? Maybe he now feels this film says it all and there is nothing more he can say and do. Yes this is Michael Moore at his very best; funny, angry and hard hitting. Without a doubt his best film so far.</fullReview>

Information glazed over by mainstream media is finally highlighted in this film, allowing viewers to understand the situation is worse than most have realized. Once again Micheal Moore has managed to powerfully exposed what others have not had the courage to do.Comparing America of today with the decrepit Roman Empire, illustrated how close America is coming to the brink of its own demise. The introduction of Reaganomics was only the beginning of this road to disaster. The determination and will of the displaced American workers shows hope and promise for future generations. We, as Canadians must use this example so as not to become complacent or passive regarding the lure of possible riches, as espoused by the right wing zealots.</fullReview>

He is quite a master at this type of thing and is the best of this breed of shoot from the hip filmmakers. His conservative critics love to personalize the assault on his audacious claims, usually starting their witticisms with: "the fat guy", or "needing a bath", Michael Moore is at it again.When debating, if you are in trouble and can't refute the facts, begin your attack on a personal level. So when you see this you know you are doing something right and MM knows that is exactly what he is doing. Something right."We need the deviate in society", says Lenny Bruce, "we need the deviate to tell us when we are screwing up". The voice from the wilderness that is heard and headed, or at least draws attention to the kind of things that the Mainstream Media is reluctant or restricted from presenting.Love it or hate it. Mr. Moore's relentless rants and brightly lit mirrors are a welcome and fun way of telling us when we are screwing up and we do screw up quite a bit so he is here to stay. The scruffy curmudgeon, the gadfly in the ointment, is a sorely needed entity picking away at our peccadilloes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst Michael Moore movie so far.Before you begin stoning me, I like Michael Moore. I appreciate what he stand for and in my mind, anyway, he is intelligent enough to decipher the difference between socialism and the kinds of dictatorship and nepotism practiced in Germany and Russia during the 20th century.It wasn't socialism, folks--any more than this is a functioning democracy, hee. Seriously though, what Michael Moore does so well is give a voice to the little people who have been screwed over by stupid politicians and corrupt government officialsm and evil corporate emperors. The parts of this movie where he juxtaposes interviews with these people against the interviews and images of suffering "Middle Americans" work the best.The parts of the movie where Michael Moore acts as narrator to the entire 'drama of the bailouts' rub me the wrong way. I don't feel he has any right to speak for everybody in that way, to tell the story of EVERYBODY in that manner. However, I still want him speaking up!Keep talking, Michael Moore. Keep fighting, those jerks ain't seen nothing' yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film try to explain why the world is going to hell. And in the beginning, he says that the capitalism is responsible of our misery. What is certainly right, almost by me. He says to, that the mode of production is responsible of the economy, and politic and social situation. And is interesting that the purpose of the capitalism being the profit. The own good is the really important. The other people doesn't matter. And as long as the production being organized by and for the profit, we will never can be a equal society, because we need a production in where doesn't matter the own good but common good. And that's the opposite to the capitalism.But in the end he says that the democracy is the answer to our problems. Well, I think he's wrong, or almost when he talks of this democracy. The mode of production is the owner of the poor people, and the misery. The democracy as we know is servile to the rich interesting. The democracy means power of the people, by the people and for the people. And the people is the working class. So, the real democracy is a system where the production doesn't mean profit but good. Except that, the film is really great. Give you hope, and show you that is possible being different. And that the world as we know could be different. And you can see that the real evil, and the mother of many problems are not the 17 years offenders like many rich people want to us believe. More criminal that everyone, are the bankers, and the government and the businessman, and the people that usually we can see in Forbes magazine. And how all are corrupt by the money.But the most interesting is the example of the workers that take the factory, and refuse to accept the bank's order. And how the people helped theirs, and how the American people, still can think in some different way. Anyway, the film is really great. I'm Argentine, and if you like this kind of film, you would like Pino's Solanas films, are the same kind of documentary, and show about the cooperatives in my country, which were born after the 2001 crisis. And it's nice when the priests talk, because they are totally right. Jesus wouldn't like city bank, I guess... He fought against these kind of people. People that sanctifies his name, and they shouldn't. And the film have also, funny scenes and lines. Like the beginning and Jesus scene... Nice. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Michael Moore flick loaded with info and attitude. As usual he develops a down-to-earth rapport with his audience, weaving an accessible yet comprehensive argument. And...as usual with Michael Moore, he is sort of preaching to his choir of liberal movie fans who were likely only introduced to the new wave of politically-aware theatrical documentaries thanks his name.However I do think Moore does a commendable job in deconstructing exactly how we've got ourselves into such a hopeless mess and illuminates the frightening truth of how corporate America treats the regular citizen. Moore brings a real humanity to his film in exploring the sense of despair and uncertainty that comes the foreclosure situation and the ramifications for small businesses in America today. Hardly groundbreaking stuff but I would rank it among his better documentaries and did found it to be an entertaining and illuminating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Capitalism: A Love Story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that I almost didn't see "Capitalism: A Love Story," or rather, begrudgingly saw it out of obligation, because the film reminded me why I once fervently defended Michael Moore as a filmmaker. Between his sardonic sense of humor and his mixed-media aesthetic, dredging everything from educational film strips to YouTube videos to his own back catalogue up onto the screen, he puts together a hell of an entertaining documentary. But invoking Moore's name today elicits about the same reaction as Sarah Palin's; you get a "Oh, that nut," look. The idea of him conjures a smoky, megaphoned muckraker shouting on the steps of the capital at whoever will listen.And okay, there is an element of that to "Capitalism," but it only serves as a requisite slice of the pie. It's the footage that's being played almost exclusively in the trailers (Moore attempting a citizen's arrest on Wall Street CEOs and papering the buildings with crime scene tape), but where the film plays these scenes for ironic laughs, they come across as pompous and grandstanding in the ads. The concept of selling an audience on the most audacious aspect of a film is hardly a new one, but in this case it may only reinforce the negative stereotypes associated with Moore's politics.The usual suspects do make brief cameos, namely George Bush Jr. and Dick Cheney, but since leaving office, Moore has come to view them as harmless caricatures rather than legitimate liabilities. If he can squeeze a laugh out of the audience in comparing Cheney to a Roman emperor, that seems to suffice. Politics in general take a backseat in "Capitalism," but expectedly remain a vocal backseat driver. His opinion is as ubiquitous as always, and if "Fahrenheit 9/11" labeled him a terrorist among his detractors, than "Capitalism" will undoubtedly add socialist to his loathsome repertoire.In truth, Moore simply takes a blue-collar stance on the economic issue, with a grass roots approach to examining the effects of the collapse. He trains his lens on families whose homes have been foreclosed, spouses whose partners have made giant corporations millions through their death in what's colloquially known as "dead peasant" policies, and teenagers who have served prolonged and undeserved sentences in juvenile hall to boost the profits of the independently run facilities.The film ends on a dour personal note for Moore, who suggests he can't continue pushing issue films without the support of his viewers in setting right his outlined wrongs. I took that statement with a grain of salt until I remembered a story that broke about two months back, the seemingly unprecedented news that documentary filmmaker Michael Moore was considering directing two narrative films. It remains to be seen whether his futile attempts at political impact have really worn him down, or whether the topical well is simply running dry, but "Capitalism: A Love Story" proves that the man still has a sustainable artistic vision.And perhaps the most significant triumph of "Capitalism" is its accomplishments as its own film. Moore doesn't rest on his laurels or harp on his past successes, he constructs his film like he always has. His reuse of "Roger &amp; Me" footage is well integrated, and his clout actually adds a new layer to the security guards' tired delivery of "It's Michael Moore, the documentary filmmaker," when radioing their superiors. If I have a gripe to this effect, it's that Flint, Michigan is almost becoming a punch line. Can we get through an hour and a half without Flint somehow sidling its way into the conversation?If, like me, you're a relapsed Michael Moore fan, I still can't recommend "Capitalism" highly enough. The film won't win over any haters, but for the rest of us, it represents the auspicious director at the top of his game. I guarantee it's the most fun, accessible, and hilarious film you'll see about the collapse of the American economy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not in love with it and not sufficiently outraged. Film felt flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capitalism: A Love Story, is Michael Moore's latest exposing documentary. After taking on General Motors, the Bush Administration, and the health care industry in some of his previous films, he this time tackles the issues of greed, capitalism and corporate dominance. He shows us real life examples of people losing their homes, jobs, savings and hope, powerless in front of the great, evil, out of control machine that capitalism has become. As is his habit, Moore narrates and conducts his own interviews. There are funny bits, like when he asks a few bankers to define derivatives and credit default swaps and no one seems able to give an explanation that makes any sense. Other parts were more repetitive such as when he visits the headquarters of big banks with yellow "Crime Scene" tape and tries coming into the buildings to make "citizen's arrests". This was mildly funny for a few moments but it came up too many times throughout the film. Also I found that the footage of what happened to some hard working Americans- though very sad- was not edited enough and too long.The rest of the movie highlights what led the United States to the grim financial situation it is in now- going back to FDR and his proposal for a Second Bill of Rights guaranteeing certain basic economic freedoms, through a more comfortable time for the middle class in the 1950's, followed by immense deregulation during the Reagan years which resulted in gambling by financial institutions, enormous inequalities between the rich and the poor (the part about low pilot salaries was particularly frightening) and finishing with the icing on the cake, the huge tax payer funded bailouts. Overall this film is a very important one to have made and to be watched but I did not think it was one of Moore's finest. I am not in love with it nor am I sufficiently outraged by what I learned. The movie felt flat. In my opinion it went to too much length to prove a point we already know- greed is not good.

		<fullReview>Another great, informative film from Moore. This subject matter was long long over due. He tackled it masterfully bringing a lot of dirt to the surface for the audience to see. Even though the subject matter is quite serious he masterfully manages to keep it entertaining. and that is necessary b/c in this day and age people's attention span is quiet short and if they are not moved or entertained they could lose interest. He keeps it serious, he keeps it informative, he keeps it creative, emotional and funny. He brings real people to the scene to avoid the film to become dry and statistical or turn into a financial documentary. He relies son people's stories to bring life an demotion to the film. This is the style an approach that Moore has successfully employed in all his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Critical but Thought-provoking Investigation into our Financial System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Defying mediocre reviews from critics, and even from a trusted friend, I saw Michael Moore's Capitalism -- a Love Story. Having enjoyed all his previous films, I figured I'd like this one as well. I did, not only because my politics overlap his, but also because "investing &amp; capitalism" are favorite interests of mine.Mr. Moore does not disappoint. Using footage from as far back as FDR's administration up to last year's financial meltdown, he movingly covers society's inequities and suffering, and how the symbiotic relationships among financiers, bankers, and legislators combined to bring us to our current situation of high unemployment and foreclosure rates.Some of the populist themes addressed are the low pay of airline pilots, union down-sizings, how Goldman Sachs employees (Paulson, Summers) manage to be appointed to regulate the financial system, foreclosures, how privatizing enriches well-connected capitalists at the expense of the citizenry, how Countywide's "Friends of Angelo" program benefited lawmakers at the expense of the average guy, FDR's vision of a second Bill of Rights to include Health Care, and the devastation of people's lives in Flint, MI &amp; New Orleans post-Katrina. Bush, Reagan &amp; the GOP are not treated kindly. The meltdown in the Fall of 2008 is covered, including the day the Dow fell 777 points. (Ironically, Dow's closing price today (11/11/09) is close to its level after the above drop, even though it fell to an ultimate low of 6,470.)As an MBA and investor in stocks, I support capitalism. However, as a Democrat and liberal, I empathize with the financial suffering of the jobless and those without health care. "Socialism," or at least some such policies like social security, unemployment insurance and minimum wage laws are clearly beneficial. I feel somewhat guilty to see that each time another few thousand workers are downsized, my stocks appreciate in value, although my net worth is still off about 20% from its peak.Are there any exaggerations or points he could have made to support capitalism? Yes. The bailout to the financial giants were loans to be repaid, not gifts; partial repayments have already been made. Second, the opportunity to become rich gives capitalists the incentive to develop breakthroughs in science and technology. Third, over-regulation provides disincentives for foreigners to invest here and incentives for U.S. companies to hire and invest overseas. Was the bailout "essential for the survival of the U.S. banking system?" I leave that question to the historians and academics. While the movie does a fine job identifying problems, it offers few solutions. None of these points diminish the observations of Mr. Moore, whose presence and narration lend gravity to his charges.The film has not generated the interest his previous ones have, possibly because the public is beyond being shocked, and perhaps because a more empathetic president leads our country. The movie is on its last legs in theaters, and may not be around much longer. If you're a Michael Moore fan, you should see this film despite its lower profile compared to his previous works, even if you find room for disagreement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Micheal Moore's Capitalism:A Love Story-One of the year's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Micheal Moore is at his absolute best when dealing with issues of class and genre. Perhaps it's because of his legitimate Irish Catholic background,but whenever he talks about the struggles of poor Americans(and yes,there are plenty of poor Americans with little hope of upward mobility)the fact that he's a rich filmmaker becomes pretty in consequential. And now,more so than ever, Moore has come out as a radical modern-day leveller,advocating revolt against an economic system that we are taught to worship in high school civics class,but that rarely gets a balanced treatment.Capitalism can mean free enterprise,market pluralism and a host of other classical liberal ideas that are,in their own way,naively utopian. But as Moore unambiguously demonstrates in this work of agitation and propaganda,it can also mean corporations take out insurance policies on the lives of employees,effectively profiting from their deaths. Or it can mean that real estate speculations,one of whom openly refers to himself as a "vulture",and a "bottom feeder",buy up foreclosed homes at rock bottom prices and sell them at obscene profits,all while displaced families sleep in make-shift shanties.Many of Moore's antics,like his quest to make a citizen's arrest of the entire board of Lehman Brothers,is not only hilarious and outrageously ridicious,but a waste of precious film,not to mention his impromptu interpretation of the Constitution in D.C.,are intentionally fatuous. But "Capitalism" also contains one of the most powerful scenes from any of Moore's movies,where a Catholic bishop offers communion to striking workers in a Chicago factory in this year of our Lord,2009. "We are with you,"the bishop tells the strikers,"and we will not abandon you."It is a serious defense of human dignity,coming on the heels of infuriating footage of what Moore rightly identifies,and with significant theological backing,as the serious degradation of humanity that can occur in capitalist systems. It is also a significant part,maybe the most significant so far,of the mainstream of socialism that is taking place in America today,and righteously so from the director of "Welcome to Columbine",and "Farenheit 9-11".</fullReview>

Moore is over-the-top in places and some of the content is more propaganda that fact but it is very interesting and makes you think about what is important in life.Capitalism isn't the root of all evil but it is certainly the cause of the some of the world's evils and the sooner people realise this the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old - Same old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a parody of the old Soviet era films, or really any old style socialist propaganda, then watch this film. Or watch any of the others he's made. The style is all the same: right wingers are the cause of all the problems in the world. Big Government is the solution and never does anything wrong. Except when GW Bush is in charge, then it's not. He trots out victims like they're in a freak show and asks cheap, emotionally leading questions similar to: "How did you feel when mommy died and some capitalist making money off of it?" to a small child. Note that he carefully chooses white, working class victims not because he cares about such people but rather because they're increasingly not voting for his agenda.And that's perhaps the only real fun in this film: checking out all the logical inconsistencies and self-contradictions either he doesn't catch or doesn't care about as well as the dishonest ploys he tries. I caught the film for free on showtime and the leftist critics would be pleased: I was enraged at the lies partly because I know they've worked. But I took some solace in that fewer people have watched his films than Triumph of the Will or Fall of Berlin or Battleship Potemkin. At least THOSE films had some originality! Really, go IMDb THOSE up and get some popcorn! One of the greatest ironies is that he's a capitalist himself making money off of true believers (the few that are left in the states, anyway) willing to fork out 10 bucks to go see one of his boring, predictable, monologues that doesn't tell them anything they don't already know. "People who disagree with us are stupid and evil! We care! They don't! Did you know that?" Er, yeah, we know. Or at least we know that's what you think. If only it were really true.Should a conservative watch these films? Perhaps we should because the true-believers are sure to repeat these lies and misleading arguments at cocktail parties and we should be ready for them. They are quite easy to refute. When their arguments are torn down, leftists generally get angry and leave the room and lick their wounds. Make a note of each argument and even image that he uses and then look it up online.For example, and this is no spoiler since it's another film, in Bowling for Columbine, he showed a young gunshot victim being dragged up the steps in his wheelchair implying the evil corporation didn't have a handicapped ramp. Of course, that's not true. The ramp was there (It has to be, by law). He lets the viewer draw that false conclusion by electing not to use it. You have to pay attention throughout the film to catch all the lies.</fullReview>

Moore is good at directing movies, montage is smooth, video stills and extracts are perfect, but the whole plot is just a RIDICULOUSLY STUPID PILE OF POPULISMS.What he does is - he puts financially ignorant rednecks above all the rest and demonizes the highly educated countrie's elite. This is plain communism.In his attempt to show capitalism as an evil, he shows himself as a complete moron. What he fails is - he fails to understand what capitalism is. He doesn't even mention the complexity of the market system - why? Because: -1. He doesn't understand it -2. Even if he did it would be not that entertaining for the pop-corn eating mass.And, yes, there are more un-educated people out there in US, who share his idiotic, in very polite words, point of view. He goes even beyond - gives you a pure sophism - mixes his ignorance with a couple of authentic "sad truths" (like stock market crash, low pilot wages). But hey, we do not live in Utopia.There is much more to laugh about: Priests claiming capitalism an evil deed, Moore's attempts to find truth about capitalism in Constitution, Moore's asking for a one-word explanation of such a complex instrument as derivative ... oh, C'MON, GET AN EDUCATION FIRST.PS. If you are from the non-thinking and uneducated average - you should love the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important watch even if it divides opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a documentary maker who just seems to find things that seem like fresh problems, but really he's always having a go at the government. Capitalism: A Love Story is a documentary movie that highlights the economic system and what it has and hasn't brought to the average American since basically the end of WW2. Moore investigates bailouts, government posts held by corporate big wigs and basically as always throws a few punches at George W. Bush (not literally of course). He very much gets into the whole story, I believe that Moore has made this so that anyone can be interested, not just people who know a lot about economics and that is pretty important for him to have achieved. Now I'm not going to pretend I know all about the economy of the United States of America, or that I knew all the details about the crisis that shook the USA between 2007 and 2010, but Moore helps you understand. Now OK he doesn't always explain so well but he gets it right in terms of letting you know what went wrong, or why things were morally wrong etc, sure even Moore seems confused a lot of the time with some terms but it doesn't matter because you can see where the wrongs are in this and who made them. As with some of his other documentaries like "Fahrenheit 9/11" and "Sicko" he really gets at government, in fact you could even says he tries to rally people to make a change, and it works because his message is convincing.Now some parts of this I did feel don't really get you on his side, I mean with these type of documentaries the main person is trying to turn you onto his side throughout, the first scenes I felt did not. He paints a picture of the hypothetical view of what people will think of the USA in how ever many years, one is a cat on the toilet and then the contrast is a family being evicted. Now the eviction part is explained by the end but really he does little to make you feel for them because their predicament isn't explained well enough and it doesn't start the movie off that well. I think this is also one movie where really your political affiliation may affect how you might see this, if you're on the right you might have reservations on this, on the left you may full heartedly agree or if your in the middle you may find this has a few good points but ultimately fails at some others. For this isn't about political affiliation though, no this is more a question of what is right for everyone in the USA, I'm not from the country but it isn't hard to see in this documentary some of the hardships of the average person particularly during the crisis. I didn't quite like Moore's personal use of Catholicism to try and get a point across, He should if he wanted to make that point have used all religion and not just his own to try and say that for religious people it is morally wrong, but to be fair whether you follow something or not the wrongs in this are plain to see for all.So overall Moore has produced a convincing documentary, maybe lacks some of the more cutting edge arguments he brings up in previous one's but still by the end I feel wins you over. It can't have been easy to make it about this, instantly I feel many will be turned off by the economic side because it is confusing, but Moore like I said before gets it across to you well and in a way that you can finally at the end, understand.</fullReview>

He's talking to Wallace Shawn as some kind of expert on capitalism. Moore gives a simplified history lesson. As a follow up to "Roger &amp; Me", it's a bit too scattered. There are some interesting stories like the corrupted juvenile detention. The airline pilots aren't that interesting. The way into the story is Sullenberger but all he could muster is archival footage. The life insurance policy story is not that compelling because it's actually an useful tool for companies. Unless the companies work to kill the workers, it is more tasteless than harmful. Moore brings in religion into convincing a certain segment of the population. It's not until midway that he finally tries to explain the financial crash.The most disappointing part is that he throws up his arms when trying to explain derivatives. It's too easy. He should try to explain derivatives instead of not expecting the audience to understand it. There are some interesting personal stories and some insightful revelations. The movie could have been streamlined into a much harder punch at the financial collapse.</fullReview>

This is no exception for that rule, but it isn't as good as previous works of his (Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11).Like in his other works, Michael Moore attacks the system as he looks for social justice, having been in a catholic school, I can understand that feeling of helping people in need. Here he attacks capitalism in general and has fun with ideas like "whether or not Jesus would be a capitalist".Michael Moore uses art as a device to change the way people think, thats what I love about him. He knows how important art can be in people's lives and therefore makes movies that are important not only for the world in general, but for himself as he tends to mention his home town in his movies giving us a feeling of comfort, like we're talking to a friend and not just some journalist.I wonder if Michael Moore has endangered his career with his socialist views, like Jean Seberg and Luis Bu?uel have before him. I hope he does keep making movies, because every now and then in the middle of all these mind-numbing blockbusters coming out, I need to watch something thoughtful like "Bowling for Columbine".I'd recommend it to anyone who liked "Inside Job", "Sicko", "Fight Club", and/or "American Psycho".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capitalism: A Love Story (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore puts aside the majority of his comical shenanigans. It helps the film in terms of sincerity, but damages it's entertainment value. Moore usually has a way of making us laugh while getting us to think. Here, however, he makes some misguided choices. Actor Wallace Shawn discusses politics, Moore asks priests if Capitalism is evil, and he only interviews people that fail to define what derivatives are. His commentary and added effects to news archive footage is sometimes well done, but usually lacks subtlety. As always, he brings forth some horrendous injustices. It would just be nice to see him offer a defense for his accused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fall Of The American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capitalism: A Love Story is a documentary that features Michael Moore,who also has written and directed the film. It centers on the late- 2000s financial crisis and the recovery stimulus, while putting forward an indictment of the current economic order in the United States and capitalism in general. Topics covered include Wall Street's "casino mentality", for-profit prisons, Goldman Sachs' influence in Washington, D.C., the poverty-level wages of many workers, the large wave of home foreclosures, corporate-owned life insurance, and the consequences of "runaway greed". It also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a sin and if Jesus would be a capitalist. This theme is of course not serious but satirical, shining light on possible ideological contradictions among evangelical conservatives who support free market ideals.Twenty years after his influential debut, Roger &amp; Me, Michael Moore returns to his roots by pulling back the curtain on capitalism to reveal the insidious role it has played in the destruction of the American dream for many people. Back in 1989, auto workers in Flint, Michigan were lamenting layoffs and wondering how they would support their families without jobs to pay the bills, or benefits to ensure their health. Flash forward two decades, when cities all across the country are feeling the same pressures that Flint residents were back when GM left them high and dry. With an average of 14,000 U.S. jobs lost every day and taxpayer money constantly being pumped into failing financial institutions, the question must be asked: how long can this go on before the entire system collapses? Is there really any hope for Americans who are losing their homes to foreclosure and seeing their savings get wiped out at an unprecedented rate? In order to seek out an answer to this question and many more, Moore takes a trip to our nation's capitol, engaging average Americans in conversations about the prospect of repairing America's failing, debt-ridden economy along the way.Moore is always visually playful and subversive, and even when dealing with such serious and depressing topics entertaining; but he's also game enough to examine America's mythology of prosperity.Also,he is brave enough to discuss about the fall of The American Dream as he acts as our tour guide into the rotten core of his beloved country. And once again, his heart is in the right place.This is one fun and entertaining documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's a great film, because it chews the problem from many viewpoints. Set aside your preconceptions and listen carefully. A lot of matters which are discussed in this film, not so evident to many people. It not invents the wheel, but summarizes well. Intelligent viewers may find answers to questions, that are lurking in the back of their minds. What should people do? How do you fight corporate greed? You don't have too many options, that is clear. You may also think at some parts, that Moore is not right. So what? At least he is searching for answers in order to make people's lives better. And that is in itself a great achievement. I don't think a lot of us can say that about ourselves. Of course it's lot easier to lay back in your chair and judge with cynicism -Oh yea he is a big fat communist, with loud propaganda, pointing finger. I didn't realized until now, that the fear of communism in the USA is still freakishly strong and some feel entitled to make it equal to real democracy, and can only think at the borderlines of different ideologies. What I learn from films like this and by reading a lot of judgment of it, is that I have to think for myself and people who think they have to express their opinion against something, should do the same.

		<fullReview>Some eastern sea that lay heavily in the dawn, attended in its farthest far horizon by titanic walls of smoke and crowned by spires of fire and hot gouts of burning oil arching in the air. This deceptive sea reflecting the sky above made of crude oil. Michael Moore mounts his camera on a helicopter and takes us through the desolate landscape of Kuwait's oil fields yet there's no politics involved, no topical Gulf War content. These oil fires the result of the scorched earth policy of Iraqi military forces retreating from Kuwait in 2008 after conquering the country but being driven out by Coalition military forces. In a truly apocalyptic manner, Michael Moore simply invites us to "come and see" the works of man. Reciting short passages from the book of the Apocalypse as sweeping aerial shot after sweeping aerial shot expose a land ravaged by war, the earth tarred far as the eye can see, a vast steppe of black tending to the rim of the world, the skies charred by enormous fires and billows of smoke. This is really a documentary on the apocalypse, on some end to the world, the Capitalist Manifesto a paradigm of all humanity to end it with. A truly awe-inspiring spectacle of destruction and abandonment that mirrors man's insubstantiality when measured up against nature in his own power to destroy it. Not a documentary in the traditional sense but mostly a plot less 60 minute expedition in the deep recesses of a stuffshirt nation that lets the grandeur of its visuals see it through with Kubrickian aplomb.Michael Moore stands among us like an extraterrestrial peak. He has sat in his throne for a long time, above the moving and multi-coloured field of US politics, like an effigy of the leader, a strange monolith, a sublime visitor, a solitary enigma.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michel Moore fights against capitalism, however he does by bad way. He shows the catholic church saying: the capitalism is evil and Christ would'd approves it. Mainly The Cinnecitta Christ. USA isn't a catholic nation, The Catholic Church is a capitalist organization and the argument doesn't convince. He says: the banks lends money and you don't need to pay. Michel thinks the banks are charity associations. He's obviously wrong. Intentionally wrong, maybe. By the Michel's mind, you go to the bank, loan a money, spend it and game over. The bank cannot put you off your house. You have only rights and no liabilities. And does who believe that American government gave 700 billions dollars to the banks? The US government doesn't have this money. The budget deficit would not allow it. To me, Michel made bad campaign against capitalism. Thus he is as guilty as those people whom he points his finger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally engaging and interesting but fails as a whole and has the usual Moore problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an open goal right? Capitalist countries have just turned their back on the free market system and have bailed out the banks with public money; repossessions (by those same banks) are on the rise; employment is high; mistrust of corporations is on the rise in the public mind and generally, while "capitalism" is the system that the majority of us would favour, it is clear that something is, at best, not working. It is the subject that cries out for a good documentary and it was unsurprising that Michael Moore has stepped up to the plate to deliver it ? like an international footballer receiving the ball in front of an open goal. Unfortunately for the viewer, it turns out that the "open goal" in this metaphor is South Korean and Moore is Nigerian international Yakubu in the 2010 World Cup. For those who don't follow global sporting events, this is my very laboured way of saying that Moore more or less fluffs it.Perhaps I am being unfair though because Moore doesn't make a mess of it ? it is more a matter of him failing to make the most of it. There are plenty of good things in here, plenty of things that I either didn't know at all or only partially knew. The segment on Dead Peasants insurance policies was quite shocking to me while FDR's 2nd Bill of Rights was new to me. The other parts such as naming and shaming certain senators for loan arrangements, the influence of Goldman Sachs within the Treasury Department were good to have as reminders and the stats/quotes in the end credits were good. The problem with the film is that it is best to talk about it in segments because as a whole it doesn't really work. The subject is as broad as the title and as a result Moore doesn't really have a focus on structure ? he more or less just bounces around the subject on the way to a conclusion that he has in place from the beginning. The bits of the film that make an impact tend to be isolated segments where the real situation is making an impact ? not him as a filmmaker. He should be brilliant at building his case and presenting it but this film just doesn't work that way.Part of the problem is that he knows he is preaching to the converted, so why should he build a case? Why should he convince? Why should he debate? He says at the end that he wants others to stand up and in a way this film is two hours of this call ? an emotional call to action by showing what action can do in some examples and also showing how the established system is broken in others. I mean, I agree with him to a point but I find this annoying. The weaknesses in the material/structure also leave his usual problems exposes. Harassing security guards as usual, doing dumb stunts like putting crime scene tape on wall street, these do not build a case and they are nothing to do with the topic other than being talking points and "entertainment".It is a shame because this film came at the right time to appeal to a mass audience and capture a national mood. However by being unfocused, taking easy shots and failing to structure an overall argument in an even-handed way, Moore yet again turns his back on the congregation and just plays to his choir. For a filmmaker of his skill, his stature and his enthusiasm to do this, it is hard not to be disappointed with the overall result, even if it still has elements which are interesting and engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very sad what has happened to our humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore, you either love or hate him, but one thing I think many people could admit is that he does bring up valid points. From violence in America to 9/11 and the Bush administration to health rights in America as well, he takes us into a darker time in our country where millions of people have lost their jobs and we are in one of the worst economic states of our history. While his documentaries are biased, I feel that this is Moore's strongest work since Bowling for Columbine. Looking into the saddest moments where people are forced out of their homes without any other solution, one of the most graphic videos of family being evicted, I couldn't hold back my tears. Then there was a town so determined to have a family brought back to their home by standing up to the police and state, again seeing how people just did the right thing and stuck their neck out to save another life was so heart warming. Moore shows the down right greed that most of the country's leaders have done to the people of the world while they get richer, we get more poor. There is no denying that Capitalism: A Love Story will send chills down your spine and remind you that there are still decent people out there willing to lend a helping hand.Moore uses an archive video to compare the modern-day America with the Roman Empire. Then shows home videos of families being evicted from their homes, as well as the Condo Vultures, whose business flourished with the increasing number of foreclosures. Moore describes back to the past "golden days" of American capitalism following World War II, and a speech by President Jimmy Carter warning Americans of the dangers of worship self-indulgence and consumption. The film then cuts to the kids for cash scandal, Captain Sullenberger's congressional testimony regarding airline pilots' poor treatment, and the exposé of dead peasant insurance policies that have companies profiting from the deaths of their employees. After referring to Dr. Jonas Salk, who selflessly gave away the patent of the polio vaccine for the public good, Moore wonders about how the brightest of America's young generation are attracted into finance instead of science. Continuing his research on the fall of our economy, our society, the good, the bad, the evil, trying to find the reason why we became so much more concerned with money over helping our neighbors.One of the things that really got to me is that he shows a bread factory in California that offers equal opportunity for all the employees and no one is ranked higher, only by position but they don't look down at their employees. Made me want to move to California and apply for that job as much as I could. While our country is trying to recover, this damage wasn't done over night and it isn't going to be fixed over night. But like Moore said is that Silk offered the cure for polio for free, not for fame or money but because it was the right thing to do. The right thing to do? Seems like a foreign sentence now a days. Moore offers us a little history and what we can do to make our country better again and how just helping someone who is in the scariest situation with their money problems or just having a roof over their head can go a long way.8/10</fullReview>

Most people, themselves included, rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption in government. With the 911 terrorisst thing they have a way of kidding themselves into thinking they are really doing something important, Got the black "Investigate 911&#x2033; t-shirt and hat, Went downtown and marched and shouted all the appropriate slogans, then it's back to Starbucks for a "tall" lotte....Working with fascinating ideas and quite an intriguing subject, this film is always interesting to watch, but with a rather dull script it fails to be totally convincing or riveting. There is not much proof to back the ideas up either, and one of the biggest mysteries of the world, Stonehenge, is not even mentioned. The reality is that Michael Moore, activist and outspoken millionaire-warrior for the underdog, utilizes, in this feature, a pattern of his own invention to create a timeline of his own invention, and then predicts world events that have already happened.I think we can wrap it up there. That's the true beauty of Capitalism: A Love Story - it was written with one group in mind but can apply to almost any of the myriad pseudoscientists, For Fox to try to make out they are mentally disturbed (Fox &amp; Friends), like they did is out of order. Remember the Masonic Thought Police ? they are working on certain vibrations associated with crystals and aromas in conjunction with the case of Flight 77. Along with HAARP and other secret, Tesla technology, the stage is set for some surprising fireworks. Stay tuned, we shall discover whether this hologram we are "living" in is God's, or not, very shortly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be required viewing for any true American patriot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary is about what went wrong with unbridled capitalism and why we need to be reclaiming America. We used to have a middle-class in America, that middle-class is rapidly deteriorating. Michael Moore illustrates how the deregulation led by the banking industry over the past 3 decades has destroyed America in order to benefit a handful of people. This was started under President Reagan who effectively gave the keys of the government away to Wall Street. Moore also profiles middle-class families all across America who while doing all the right things were completely destroyed by bankers and how this is spreading like wildfire throughout the nation. Moore senses hope in the form of our new President - Obama, a man who was so unlikely to win but when it looked as if he was about to the Wall Street bankers switched gears to begin supporting him. It was almost uncanny, he even reveals a memo to its wealthiest clients that a major Wall Street bank sent out which outlined how America is not really a democracy, and that it was a good thing, America was a Plutonomy - owned and controlled by the super- wealthy. It outlined the biggest risk to this was a revolt by the people and that "one man, one vote" was a major threat - essentially that democracy was a threat to American "capitalism". Anyone who loves this country, any TRUE patriot, would watch it and absorb it and help fight the fight against the hijacking of America by big business.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Michael Moore does it again ? another great film of his to add to the list! An examination of capitalism, the financial crisis, and with a smothering of 'greed is bad' to top it off. I have to admit the religious overtones in the film were somewhat distracting for me (given I am not personally religious), and I can't say I am completely sold on the 'Capitalism is Evil' message the film strongly conveys. I don't think capitalism is evil, it's just gotten out of hand whereby now profit is the most important thing, damned be the consequences of lives of innocent people. That said, perhaps with some reining in and regulations in place (not to mention the rebirth of ethics), I am sure capitalism could be OK. But I digress? back to the film? it is an interesting documentary, engaging, informative. I give Mr. Moore a lot of credit for putting forth another perspective to the masses, at the very least we need to start questioning our governments, lawmakers, corporate bosses and the like. We need to bring back people power, and realize that we truly do have the power in democracy. Thank you Mr. Moore for your film, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will recommend it to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore can be an infuriating film maker. His basic trick of trying to talk to people who don't want to talk to him seems pretty stale by now, and filming people crying on camera doesn't really boost his case: people die under socialism, too. But his film about capitalism is far from without merit. Moore provides no solution to the problems of economic management; but he does ask in whose interest the economy is currently managed. The conclusion, that a capitalist economy is managed in the interests of the owners of capital, is hardly surprising; but it's notable how rarely this view is expressed in the mainstream media, which more often transmits the eternal refrain of the wealthy, that there is no alternative to protecting their money. The consequent imbalance of wealth in the U.S., where this message has been most pervasive, is especially extreme. With governments the world over now looking to make severe cuts, it's never been more important than to make sure we ask why.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Moore film, so you'll either love it or hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Although it reportedly got a general release earlier this year, I was unable to find Michael Moore's latest condemnation of American culture at any local theatres, and it would seem to have been a most limited release in every sense. Strange, since it's themes of the state of the American economy are more relevant to us than his commentary on the American health care system in his most recent film Sicko which doesn't really concern us in the slightest but was released in far more theatres, unlike the recession which has been a global issue affecting most countries around the world and where America rests at the epicentre. His films may no longer be the box office draw they once were, and I suspect he may have come to be seen as corny and predictable in the eyes of many, and so this may explain the poor distribution of this, his latest. Indeed, Capitalism: ALS is entirely formulaic in terms of being a Michael Moore film. It's as imbalanced, one sided, preachy and self righteous as you'd have come to expect from him, and if you've not been a fan of him up till now, this is highly unlikely to make you see him in any new light. However, you can't dispute his passion on behalf of his medium and the thorough research and evaluation he does to argue his case and as such, I found it as likable as any film he's done. I was shocked to finally be able to see it as a premiere on Channel 4, but found the constant ad breaks to be a bit distracting, as well as the late time it went on till, so luckily it was released on DVD the following Monday, where I was able to give it a more detailed examination.It opens with Moore subtly juxtaposing the collapse of the Roman empire with the way America appears to be going at the moment, with the use of slave labour, brutal bloodsports for entertainment and the brutal treatment of prisoners. All this before asking: how will their society be remembered in years to come? As a dumbed down culture, or as the country where the banks lure innocent home-owners in with loans before catching them out with hidden charges that allow the interest rates to soar, only for them to declare foreclosure on the homes of the poor saps who were suckered in? Moore is careful to point out that he owes an (at least materially) happy childhood to capitalism, with trips to New York every summer, a new car every few years and his father enjoying a secure job, and so sets out to make a film not condemning capitalism but rather examining how it went wrong, starting in the Reagan years, where tax cuts were heaped on the rich, while ordinary joes were made to work longer hours, live on borrowed money and have their unions crushed. From here, he forwards it to the present day, where newly qualified airline pilots are made to live on food stamps, employees at chains such as Wal-Mart are worth money to their employers dead and innocent young people can be locked up by privately owned detention facilities in small towns for no reason but financial gain. We also find time to hone in on the stock market collapse (where the normally placid Moore shocks by blurting out 'what the fu*k happened?' to an interview subject) and the power of the people in standing up to the heartless corporations.Moore provides another two hours or so of thought provoking views and food for thought, in his own style on matters highly relevant to a lot of people. He would seem to have a Marmite effect, in that you either love him or hate him, and that should be your guide to whether you want to see this. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how he does it, but it's the fourth time I've sat down with a Michael Moore movie and each time I get the same sensations: I feel my hairs stand up from fear, my blood boils with anger, my eyes well up with tears, and my heart remembers that life should be simple to live.Wow! This movie is not for the weak. I was hesitant walking in, thinking he wouldn't be able to do it again. What else does he have to talk about? Aren't we tired of his voice already? Isn't this anti- American?But he makes a pretty convincing point that it's not. Socialism should be studied and debated, and whatever fruits it has should be investigated and implemented, if any. That's the point of the movie. And, it's done in a very smart and caring way.Bravo.Overall, I'd say the politics are stronger in this one than all of his other movies, though in "Sicko," the film-making technique might have been a bit tighter. But, why choose? I recommend watching "Sicko" first, and then treating this like a sequel. However, if you can only watch one, I recommend this one, "Capitalism", because it sums up everything Moore has come to believe about America, and because it rocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Capitalism: A Love Story (2009) *** (out of 4) Michael Moore's documentary taking a look at the financial issues striking terror in America as more and more people are forced out of their homes, losing their jobs and finding any hope for their futures taken away while the richest of the rich just keep getting stronger and stronger. I'd be lying if I said I was a fan of Michael Moore but I can always be open when viewing any film. Even though I'm not a fan there's simply no way to deny that the man has a talent in creating these documentaries even when he takes liberties with the truth. Several of his earlier films are items that I really wouldn't call documentaries but CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY is one of his better films because, like ROGER &amp; ME, he's fighting for the poor and not just simply going after headlines. This film offers up testimony from those most effected by greed, those who have lost their homes and of course those who benefited are the ones refuses to go on camera. Moore uses all of these stories and mixes them in with news clips showing how this downfall could have been prevented but instead of doing something to help the poor it seemed like more and more was done to make sure the rich could get more dimes from those with no money. The film, I'm sure, takes some liberties with facts but I think the end story is something obvious to see. There's no question that Moore knows how to tell a story and that he knows how to take information, milk it for everything it's worth and then add it to the fire and create more smoke. Moore does a very good job here at showing exactly what happened, who benefited from the bad stuff and why nothing was done. Of course, in the end, nothing really is shown to be working and there's really no answers in regards to the future. We're shown the one "hope" but viewing this film three years after its release has shown that this hasn't worked either.</fullReview>

The US president actually sent in national guards to protect the workers instead of the capitalists. Unlike what is happening in communist China now, those evil communist leaders claim that they represent the Chinese people, but they are all doing harmful things towards the Chinese people in the interests of rich capitalists.If Michael Moore would have made a similar movie about the Chinese government, not only will his film be banned in China, but also he will be put in jail for anti-government act.It is true that why Germans and Japanese are making better and reliable cars than the cars made in USA? If USA has the ability to send troops with sophisticated weapons all over the world, why can't the USA government help to make best cars? It is not that hard.Michael Moore is a brave man for making such a thought provoking film. I wonder if he has ever got threatened by any of the capitalists in the US, because what he said about them is mostly true. In the USA, he still has the freedom to make a movie about the greedy side of capitalism without having to worry about his life. That is what is so good about USA.On the other hand, we have to admit that the government will probably always be operated by rich capitalists who work for the best interests of other corporate capitalists. So far, capitalism seems to be the best system so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does Michael Moore do it? The man has never made a bad film. Capitalism: A Love Story is another triumph in documentary filmmaking. It's both thought-provoking and good-natured. Moore clearly presents the flaws of America's economic system, especially how the current economic recession came about. He combines archival footage, undeniable facts, eye-witness testimony, humour and drama into a very entertaining package. The United States remains the richest country in the world, but it's undeniably creaky. There's corruption and even injustice. Moore, however, doesn't criticize this system just for the sake of criticizing it. He cares about the state of his country and its people. These problems are current and are not in the past. Three years have passed and there's still widespread unemployment. In conclusion, Capitalism: A Love Story is one of Moore's best films. In my opinion it's his best since Bowling For Columbine (2002) because it tackles issues that were and will remain important. In addition, Moore provides examples of how to improve the system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good Film From Provocateur Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's latest project doesn't just go after Bush, or health care or General Motors... he goes after the very foundation of American economy... the system of capitalism itself. A very bold film that is sure to alienate, he gives it his all.I was more hesitant about this film than any other Moore has made, afraid that his tendency for hyperbole would go overboard on this very controversial topic. But, I must say, he was actually more reserved than usual, stuck to his facts, and made what may be his best film yet. That, and it has a video clip from Parry Gripp, so that can't be a bad thing.Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, Larry Summers, Timothy Geithner are presented as "people who get promoted because they're willing to say absurd things" rather than the correct thing. Goldman Sachs and Treasury Department are seen as having a revolving door between them. It is not a stretch to say that government is populated very heavily by the corporations they should regulate, be it in finance or elsewhere.We hear of pilots making minimum wage, having to give blood and work second jobs -- despite holding hundreds of lives in their hands each day. We are told of life insurance on employees ("dead peasants" insurance) which once covered important people but now can extend to the lowest of employees... gambling on death.Moore presents another idea: worker-owned businesses and co-ops. He says that democracy and capitalism are not compatible. (He uses "democracy" as a euphemism for socialism, but his point is that majority-rule democracy should not lead to minority-rule capitalism.) Is he right? I don't know... his views weren't as radical as I expected, and even if his solutions aren't correct, he highlights the problems like no other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More anarchistic and anachronistic than futuristic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hundred percent Michael Moore, no doubt what-so-ever. Emotional to the utmost. Founded on undeniable facts and truths, note the plural of these truths. He oscillates between the good old Christian truth, the good old socialist truth, the good old founding fathers' truth, and even the good old Framers' truth, without forgetting even the truth of F.D. Roosevelt. Only one is missing, Abraham Lincoln. The point is that the Founding Fathers and the Framers were building a constitution that excluded the majority of the population of the first United States and were to exclude that majority for quite a while (Blacks, women, Indians, non-propertied and non-taxable residents). The Constitution is of course something that can be perfected but the meaning of the quotations from and by them Framers and Founding Fathers has to be taken in their context if we want to capture their truths. And that's the main problem with Michael Moore: he builds a patchwork of quotations, references and facts that has an emotional meaning and impact but that does not stand any serious reflection. Instead of building an argumentation that would be homogeneous in time and place, absolutely impregnable in logic, he overkills his single targeted bird with a dozen of stones and a few bullets, and even here and there a rocket. That overkilling alas neutralizes the argument and sterilizes the demonstration because of the anachronistic nature of many of the arguments and the non articulated nature of the accumulative train of his thought, or rather thinking. Of course capitalism is greed, and it is all the horrors that lead to the worst crimes and wars. But the market economy is not capitalism. The market economy is here to stay because the economy, that exists since the beginning because the homo sapiens is an economic species, can only bring us the future and more means and more justice, but capitalism is only one way of managing that market economy and it is the worst way possible nowadays. And alas the film leads us to some vague democratic ideal in the workplace. What is it? A cooperative form of management? Or a more important and decisive role for the unions and the workers' representatives? Or plain state socialism? The film is in fact exploded in all these directions and brings no clear perspective, not even a direction that could have several slightly different lanes or roads. And we cannot forget that his antics in Wall Street are only possible because everyone in Wall Street accepts him to do it, including the bankers, the traders, the financiers and the police. That sounds and looks very well negotiated and produced. An interesting message but too emotional to lead very far on the highway to the future.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore certainly knows how to entertain. He balances depressing economic facts with silly songs about Cleveland. He shows crumbling towns along with toilet flushing cats. He keeps us interested while educating us on what happened to our economy.We get to see deals like Wilkes-barre Pennsylvania where teens who did trivial things were sent to a for profit facility and the judges pocketed $2.6 million. We get to see airline pilots who make $16,000 a year and get food stamps.And then we see companies profiting from the deaths of their employees. Mortgage companies compared to the Mafia.The most important revelation was the fact that the financial executives all got jobs with the government to deregulate the financial industry, and we all know what happened. Moore is not blaming Republicans only, he holds the Democrats just as much to blame.An excellent blend of truth and fun. Everyone should see this because the rich and powerful would not want you to.If Jesus preached today like he did in Galilee, they would lay Jesus Christ in his grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Michael Moore offends anyone with this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then perhaps they are the ones who hate the US and what it really stands for. In his most desperate state of spirit ever, Moore travels around the country and shows the realities of banks being deregulated, Wall Street big shots playing with pension funds like drunk gamblers in Nevada blowing their kid's college fund at the tables and the general greed and predatory desires of so many in corporate circles who think they're being smarter or just luckier through cronyism than the average adult makes their exalted positions like a license to print money. The honest efforts of millions are undermined by the sneaky motives of CEOs who wave flags and then sell them out for pure profit reasons.The future of the nation FDR wanted to usher in wasn't to be as long as the greed parade from Washington, DC to the entertainment crazed nightmare that is Los Angeles has degenerated into the prime examples of almost unlivable cities (unless you're rich, of course). Crime rates are rooted in senseless drug policies that make marijuana possession almost a greater offence than murder in many minds and filled up the jails and prisons to beyond capacity. In a priceless clip, Donald Regan is seen and heard telling then President Ronald Reagan (in a public speech, no less!) to "speed it up!" Just what kind of windbag has the audacity to order around the commander in chief? Apparently quite a few, as the top executive office is seen as a bought and paid for catbird seat by bigwigs in the huge and very deep pocketed industries that spend huge amounts on campaign donations and sending lobbyists to get their agendas put through, demanding the affairs of modern nations revolve around their bottom lines.If capitalism is going to improve in the 21st century, everyone needs to spend less on what we don't need, especially if we can't afford it in the first place. The state of industry has gone down the other side, like a roller coaster that can't climb higher and has to come down hard and fast. The bell curve of finance is only bright if you're living in the past when things looked up towards innovation and the corrupt jerks at the tops of the pyramids get exposed for who they really are. Seeing the often pompous Moore wanting to make a citizen's arrest and rolling out yellow crime scene tape near the heart of soulless business makes me proud and I think if anyone's bothered by that, they're the real enemies of pride in their country."Capitalism" is one of the best of 2009 and I maintain it's a companion film to "The Informant", directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring a very funny Matt Damon. Watch both and the reality of what we are stuck with for a very long time suddenly doesn't just look possible, it seemed downright inevitable!This is my 100th comment and I wanted it to coincide with the 100th review for this film.

		<shortDescription>Capitalism: A Love Story, Socialism: An Addict's Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I watched Michael Moore's movie named "Capitalism, A Love Story". The movie is really a docudrama. Historic archive footage, news video and interviews underscore the points he is trying to make.The ultimate goal of the movie is to place the vices of capitalism against the virtues of socialism. Before we go any further, let's look up these terms in the dictionary, and find out what they really mean.Socialism (WikiPedia) "Socialism refers to the various theories of economic organization which advocate either public or direct worker ownership and administration of the means of production and allocation of resources." So there are two options in socialism ? either the workers own all production, or the government, or both. A group of workers is not prohibited from pooling their resources and starting their own business. That means socialism in the context of the movie is about government ownership and planning of production and resources.Capitalism (WikiPedia) "Capitalism is an economic and social system in which capital and land, the non-labor factors of production (also known as the means of production), are privately owned; labor, goods and resources are traded in markets; and profit, after taxes, is distributed to the owners or invested in technologies and, industries." The term "government ownership" is notably absent in the definition of capitalism. If you watch the movie, this is not the type of capitalism Moore is vilifying.Government "A Government is the organization, machinery, or agency, through which a political unit exercises its authority, controls and administers public policy, and directs and controls the actions of its members or subjects." The simple truth is that the government controls us with the threat that you will eventually face violent action if you do not comply (hence the term "law enforcement"). Our government is the only entity with the exclusive, monopolistic and legal right to initiate force against others.What figures in his movie are portrayed to be the bad guys? We see bankers, politicians from both sides of the fence, big industry laying off people.What Moore fails to grasp is that the underlying problem really is our government and the way it works.Banks are just an extension of the Federal Reserve. The Fed's former chairman Alan Greenspan, as Moore pointed out, opened the money taps and made it possible for banks and individuals to lend (and spend!) cheaply. People were told house prices could never go down, but of course they did. The Fed was the main cause to the housing bubble which popped not too long ago. Did people buy above their means? Absolutely. But would those loans even have existed if we had a more prudent Federal Reserve? Highly unlikely.Big industry (GM is highlighted in the movie), just like the banks under Bush, have been bailed out. Is it a surprise? Not really ? Bush was the friend of the financial industry; he deregulated them and gave them huge leeway in devising all kinds of structured loans and derivatives, in exchange for campaign money. Just the same Obama bailed out the automobile industry as a handout to the unions who had a great part in getting him elected.Because of taxes, regulations, unions, minimum wages, etc. etc. the American worker has priced himself out of the labor market. Their productivity is no longer in line with their compensation. So more and more of our labor is exported to various Asian countries. And again, this is not because the American workers have no skills ? but purely because the government has made them too expensive.Our government has also ensured that companies can "incorporate" ? meaning that a fictitious entity (a business) can assume the same rights and responsibilities as an individual. That makes it no longer possible to hold the owners personally liable for actions in the name of the company. A corporations is merely a legal framework, in a free market without government intervention, corporations would not exist.So we see that Moore's problem is not with capitalism per se, but with our government interfering with it. Our political system is the root cause of all the problems Moore managed to put into his movie.It must now strike you (hopefully) as very, very strange that Moore, towards the end of the movie, is advocating an economic system that is completely run by the same government he riled against in his movie ? socialism. Do we really want the government to run the economy at gunpoint? Remember, in a socialist economy all resources and means of production are owned by the government, and are laws are enforced by violence.All of Moore's perceived problems would not exist in a truly free capitalist market economy, one that is completely free of government intervention. People would be wealthier overall because there would be no government favoritism for large banks or corporations. Because there would be a much smaller government, there would be less property taxes, less income taxes, higher wages. Cost of living would go drastically down.Unfortunately Moore's answer is not more, but LESS freedom and MORE violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love means having to say you're sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Michael Moore's film about the evils of capitalism is a love story, I'd be hesitant to find out what happens when the love affair ends. Reminiscent of his first film Roger and Me about the sorry economics conditions in Flint, Michigan, Capitalism: A Love Story is a personal essay about an economic system that Moore believes is one in which greed is the only value. While the film is not as coherent as some of his earlier work and often feels a bit tired, Moore makes some very telling points about a system that, according to the director, is one "of giving and taking ? mostly taking". As evidence, he cites a Citibank memo about the United States having become a "plutonomy," with bank executives gloating over the fact that 1 percent of American society now controls more of its wealth than the bottom 95 percent.The film begins by looking back at the emergence of the middle class after the defeat of our economic rivals Germany and Japan in the Second World War. Moore describes the changes that occurred in the country during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush that led to deregulation, tax cuts, the diminished power of unions, a massive increase in household debt, and a growing disparity between rich and poor. According to Moore, we are told almost from day one how wonderful our economic system is and that the profit motive leads to incentive and innovation through a spirit of competition. In reality, however, he states the system is far from that and he uses the current economic conditions that have led to home foreclosures, bank bailouts, and the collapse of the auto industry to emphasize his point.The documentary includes several examples of a system that has become dysfunctional. One shows a privately owned profit-making juvenile detention center in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania where two judges received payoffs from the owners for extending the terms of more than 1,000 juveniles sent to the facility. Another example reveals the fact that many corporations take out life insurance policies on their employees (known as "dead peasant insurance"), and make themselves the beneficiaries without a penny going to the survivors if the employee should die. He also brings up the condition of airline pilots like Sully Sullenberger, the hero of US Airways Flight 1549 who saved the lives of 155 passengers. Many airline pilots have had their pay cut drastically in recent years and have been forced to live on food stamps.A very moving sequence shows President Franklin D. Roosevelt, too ill to go before Congress, calling for A Second Bill of Rights in a radio address to the nation a year before his death. This Bill of Rights would guarantee citizens a home, a job, a decent wage, medical care, an education, and a paid vacation. The segment was never broadcast. Though filled with some grandstanding and confrontations in the in-your-face Moore style, Capitalism: A Love Story generally makes its points quietly, only asking that as citizens we begin to speak out against injustice. "Evil cannot regulate evil," Moore says, so it's time to do what Washington will not "and take our country back." "That's what really scares them," he says of those who run the plutonomy. "That we can still vote: We have 99 percent. They have 1 percent." The director underscores his appeal with provocative images such as driving an armored car up to AIG corporate headquarters and demanding the company return federal bailout funds, and unraveling a long "crime scene" yellow tape around Wall Street buildings. Although the film's main focus is on economics, Catholic priests are brought in to condemn the excesses of capitalism as unethical and unjust. This inclusion serves to underscore the fact that our society, more than needing a different economic "ism", requires a shift away from a philosophy of materialism to a new idealism and a renewal of compassion towards the less fortunate.</fullReview>

The themes he deals with, capitalism and greed, have ran through all his films and this last one almost feels like an accumulation, or even a final presentation of a Mooreian ideology which he has developed.Moore is at times dishonest, he is a show, I wouldn't have him politician. Yet he does it all to good reason. He fights from a moral stand point in a system which has gone out of control with greed and fear. He wants to instigate change. He wants people to rise up out of their seats and yell..."I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!"</fullReview>

(He puts much of the blame on Reagan, but this was going on before he got there and accelerated under Clinton.) He isn't completely partisan, he lets rip on Democrats as well, which he should.He also points out that the perverse relationship between Capitalism and the Christian Right is probably against everything Jesus actually had to say.

		<fullReview>This isn't Michael Moore's best film, but it may be his most important.Moore shows us how the CEOs of America's wealthiest companies really see the US: A land of "peasants" who unfortunately vote, politicians for sale, and workers who can be fired at will (and if they die, can be cashed in for a life insurance policy). Yes, a company actually did refer to its employees as "peasants". You can't make this stuff up. We also see a Citicorp memo that describes the US favorably as a "plutonomy" rather than a democracy, and warns that this corporate paradise is threatened by citizens' voting rights.Moore's film isn't totally depressing; he highlights a few examples in which people fought back against banks and won (at least temporarily). He also interviews Marcy Kaptur, one of the few Members of Congress who speak the truth about what's happening.My main criticism of the film is that it focuses too much on home foreclosures. Not all Americans have lost their homes, but almost all Americans have seen their real wages decline. I wish Moore had focused more on the overall decline in the standard of living. The bad judgment of individuals who took out sub-prime mortgages or bad home equity loans is never mentioned.Moore notes that regardless of which party is in power, Goldman Sachs has been running the country. Unfortunately Moore has all the evidence to back this up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty years ago,Michael Moore,a journalist writing for Mother Jones, etc., wrote &amp; directed a film entitled 'Roger &amp; Me',to get to the bottom of why auto workers in his home town of Flint,Michigan were being laid off from their jobs at the Ford Motor Company,where he tried to seek an audience with (then)company president,Roger Smith, only to be shown the door. Since then,he has written a series of books,hosted two television programmes,and directed a series of other films,keeping a watchful eye on what's screwing up America,big time. The good/great news is that his latest effort,'Capitalism:A Love Story' is another contribution to his impressive back log of projects. 'Capitalism:A Love Story' goes directly for one of America's evil empires,Wall Street,and corporate greed,in general. Over a period of two+ hours,he points fingers at the usual suspects &amp; makes facts known about some of the smarmy going's on among the CEO's of the major institutions of greed. As with other Moore projects,scads of vintage film footage,representing middle class America is in store (as well as his usual penchant for sarcastic humour,among some pretty shocking statistics,as well as video footage,both recent &amp; past). Prepare to hoot &amp; applaud your favourite victors,and boo &amp; hiss the villains (there was applause aplenty at the screening that I attended).

When people told that banks profits from deaths of employes, when shown the immorality of finance system, by stealing from those, who don't have anything, or cheating on government and whole society. Yes, that was really good done, congrats Mr. Moore. But then it became ridiculous - maybe some find it ironic or even funny when Moore enters an armored car and try's to get the back the money from banks, by just asking with a nice $- signed bag in his hands. I don't. It took all the seriousness the move made it worth looking. Finally I was upset of the Utopian view which he made that all may be end up well, by showing some rebellious Workers - No Mr. Moore - thats not enough. Finance system won't collapse because some thousands go on strike - it takes much more : Organization, studies in Marxism, teaching young's , and and and. So he simple didn't get in the essence of capitalism-critics: All in all and populistic show up how capitalism f**** society. But still worths a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somehow, some way, Michael Moore needs to get his own network and give us news about what is really happening happening rather than the gunk given to us by the Fox, CNN and MSNBC morons.My wife, who watches a lot of news, leaned over to me during this movie and said "How did I miss this on the news?" It basically confirms everything we all know to be true. There is no government, there is no religion, there is no media. There is only money and money creates greed and greed creates power hungry evil types looking to put the rest down because of their short comings as people.You think Al Quaeda's cause is actually driven by religion? HAAAAA! They want world domination and they bomb people to instill fear to get it.In this country, the corps own everything. Nothing is done by any president or govt official from the White House all the way on down to the corrupt state of NJ without someone financially benefitting from it. That part about the policies on people dying and the company gaining from it? What the eff!@!! No shame.Why should any of us vote for Govt officials at all. Unless we are in a dire situation, I'm never voting again. Big deal, it's my right...it's my right to vote someone in that'll sleep with hookers with my money, start a war with my money only to build big business overseas and gain gagillions, live their fat cat lives with my money.What seriously would have happened if Bank of America collapsed or AIG went under without bailout. Why is GM still in business? The whole city of Detroit is a ghost town. Who would have cared? In 20-30 years it will be a few rich, ruling like kings over the poor. We tried to get away from England for this very reason and after 250 years we are finally coming back to being ruled by evil. The human race is messed up.Folks, sorry to break it to you but we are all being farmed by the machines and this is the Matrix. We are nothing and we continue to believe and feed the system because we cannot think for ourselves. We believe what we hear and have too much tunell vision.We let it get this way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again Michael Moore scares the pants off of everyone...now if we only knew what was true?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can say one thing for certain when it comes to film maker Michael Moore he knows how to put together one heck of a case. If the guy were a lawyer...well I wouldn't want to be against him. I still have trouble swallowing a lot of his information given his antics and his very clear opinions about politics etc. It would be like if Budweiser made a movie about whether beer was good for you or not. Still Capitalism: A Love Story is perhaps his most disturbing film yet. Maybe I only feel that way because it touches home more than some of his other films. I can't honestly say the American Healthcare system, guns in schools, or even 9/11 truly directly effected me the way some of the issues brought up in Capitalism has or will in the future. What Moore shows us in the film is nothing short of a dangerously powerful coupe by the Business world that could essentially result in the downfall of our society. Does that sound a little fire and brimstone? A little extremist? Well welcome to the very believable and very scary world of Michael Moore.Moore's films can almost always be described as the good, the bad and the ugly. The good is the way that he presents his information, but that also plays into the bad. Moore does appear to provide plenty of factual 'investigative journalism' and provides what might seen like conclusive evidence that proves his point. What few realize is that we aren't seeing any other side of things. I am not saying that Moore is wrong, or that the film isn't worth believing, quite the opposite. Perhaps I am only trying to convince myself that the world isn't quite as bad as he makes it out to be when perhaps he is correct and that the business world is almost unforgivably corrupt. The bad is the grandstanding he does to get his point across. But see this is what mainstreams Moore's documentaries and makes them so incredibly entertaining. Boating out people to Guantanamo Bay to try and get health care for them, or trying to return bullets still lodged inside the shooting victim or in this case driving an armoured truck up to the front door of the corporate banks to try and get back the money lent to them from the 'American People.' There is nothing cut and dry about his information or how he provides it.The Ugly side of Michael Moore is that his films are meant to scare us into reality but he definitely sways towards the left and attacks the right vigorously (something for the record that I have NO problem with personally.) By showing news footage and historical clips of President Reagan, President Bush, John McCain, Sarah Palin and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger sticking their foot in their mouth (something they do frequently without any clever editing I admit) and showing them seemingly being lead by big business he attempts to prove his point. He does it such an incredibly seemingly honest, straight forward and entertaining way that it will leave you shocked at what could be going on right under our noses. If nothing else Moore is the master of entertaining documentaries. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore is film's greatest hero. Down with Republicans and bad same-same Democrats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He really is a hero. His detractors are merely insecure, ignorant, scared and mostly a mixture of all of those things. This film documentary is better than true. It's extremely entertaining and moving, as engrossing as the best written, fictional film. Sure there are a lot of holes. Mikey will be hypocritical on some or all points, wake-up and smell our human truth; you cannot live and have ideas without being somewhat hypocritical, at times at least. However to nit-pick and seek to disarm this (fat) man, is to miss the point that he makes a brilliant addition to the great political debates, polemics. Wow, 2 hours, flew by, how many documentaries manage that? (Even Norman Finkelstein drags a little for 1 hr and a half. I LOVE Finkelstein!) Okay, so there must be holes, Republicans et al will find them anywhere, everywhere, (given that they can't tell the difference between where they do poo-poo or where they eat yum-yum, no wonder they have problems with finding holes!) Beautiful is my catch-phrase of recent. I want more beautiful things, I have been angry, young and pseudo-ascetic for too long . . . Beautiful is a tall order for a documentary, talk-talk film/s. But Mooresy has done it, better than ever - COME MANIPULATE MY EMOTIONS ALL YOU WANT, when the greater truth is being gotten at, who can complain. Fantastic work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does capitalism work? Not really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really opened my eyes and has taught me that capitalism does work only if it is used in the right hands, like using superpowers. You could use your powers for the greater good, or you could use them for self fullfilment and personal use.This movie taught me that its OK to be rich, buy expensive cars, plasma screen TV, go to europe every summer. But when you also have power especially if you have much more power than others that you can take advantage of and affect them, that's when things go bad. Like when they said to reinvest in their homes or something and become rich but what really happened was that they ended up losing their homes.Also what the hell happened when Bush allowed deregualations and free markets to the big businesses. That's why we are in debt. Because people took everyone's money and used it for themselves.Capitalism can't work, something that can work is Democracy. And that is what our country was built on. Not survival of the fittest but everyone works together, and everyone survives. You want proof. It's happening right now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent in some ways; its religion &amp; economics are way out of focus though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore's team has assembled a worthwhile film. The film is entertaining and delivers some good information. Best parts of the move were the most gritty &amp; real parts -- _some_ hard reporting and some "you-are-there" super-excellent film clips. Workers, home-owners &amp; President FDR are luminous in their roles. Oscar-worthy performances. Worst parts are: panders to old empires; has some totally uninformed theories about history; and blurs the line between "socialism" and "democratic socialism" for most of the movie. They don't mention a lot of information they could have read in David Halberstam's _The Reckoning._ They do not go very deep on why the workers in Germany &amp; Japan received "The New Deal" since WWII. ... just that they did. Maybe it was because religious inertia was swept away there but not here. Just sayin'. I love the positive _feelings of religion, but read _Science and the Modern World_ by Alfred North Whitehead and see if you can fix some of religion's problems, please. Quoting Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in the movie was great! Uh, doing so only in print as the movie *ends* was okay, I guess. But when we observe the air-time given to Catholic priests and bishops condemning capitalism, then Tom - Ben - John seem slighted. Is it fair to credit the Catholic church with being our main hope? Michael Moore accuses capitalism of crimes -- yet does not document the religious backgrounds of the players. I guess the idea we're supposed to get is that Catholics are not to blame. Well, show that.... document it... fairly. Not as if this were a court at the Inquisition. If workers could control their destiny, would they still have a modified form of capitalism? There are some structural problems with previous forms of socialism which the movie should have illuminated instead of creating an impression that the bogeyman was able to operate without opposition from the Catholic church until it was too late. The movie also forgets until near the end that capitalism's link with the Constitution was not forged by the USA's founders. Apparently, the movie-makers chose to _equate capitalism with financial greed and corruption -- while the real problem is that capitalism has -- with tacit approval even from religious leaders, it seems, from "on high" -- been too _lax in allowing financial greed and corruption. The Constitution did not allow corruption. More likely, religion allowed it, since church says we're "all guilty" and therefore let's be forgiving. Forgiving is good. Being too lax is a problem.Religion has sometimes focused on condemning the vices of the working class and all too often, it seems, religion allowed the vices of the rich. I am very moved by my understanding of Christ and the story of Jesus, even though I wish I could read his autobiography. Contrary to what the movie songs said, if Jesus were in America today, the Bill of Rights would protect his freedom to speak.... and by the way, when I criticize the Catholic church, or any religion, it is with the desire they might experience the beauty and joy which is supposed to be life's companion eternally. I believe they mainly wish the same for us too. So all this is just a communication problem we're working out. That's why it is troubling that this movie still clings to the idea that insider Catholics are the answer and our Constitution's founders' intentions are a mere afterthought. I do not want to leave this review on a down note, so I'll just say "Galileo was Catholic" "Ben Franklin was Quaker" "Thomas Jefferson was Deist" "Isaac Asimov was Jewish, or perhaps atheist" and so on. Michael Moore made religious leaders an issue in this film and that's why I mention these other persons as examples. In this, no religion (or lack of religion) was ignored for cause -- it was just a casual list, okay?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Miles Davis of anti-capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore has a pretty good knack for making documentaries that capture the spirit of their times. Bowling for Columbine (2002), for instance, tapped into the feverish gun control debate in America; Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004) was released in the aftermath of the disastrous Iraq War of 2003; Sicko (2007) prefigured the recent US debate on state- run healthcare. In the midst of a serious economic crisis, Capitalism: A Love Story appears to be a timely investigation into bank bailouts, bankruptcies and the return of mass unemployment. So why do all of Moore's stunts, dashed-off analysis and gloomy conclusions in this film feel so tired and out of date?To begin with, Moore makes an apposite, albeit superficial, comparison between the dying days of Rome and contemporary America. He introduces some clips from what appears to be an old educational reel titled Life in Ancient Rome, which he then juxtaposes with more recent totems of American power, including the Metropolitan Opera House at New York's Lincoln Center draped in the Stars and Stripes. He makes the point that America's long-standing support for the free market has gone the same way as countless failed businesses: from unqualified confidence to directionless decadence. He proceeds to flesh out the scale of corruption in modern American society, using human-interest stories to elicit viewers' anger.Indeed, his well-worn directorial devices in this latest film reveal his limitations. As in his previous films, Moore inhabits the role of the burly, conscientious documentary-maker on a mission, who nevertheless lets people's stories speak for themselves. He intercuts these testimonials with a morass of kitschy stock footage and B-movie warnings that what we're about to see is 'truly one of the most unusual movies ever made' (except it isn't). The scenes where Moore battles it out with stern-faced corporate security guards and tries to access the high-seats of capitalism through silly stunts have a groaning over-familiarity to them.As in his previous films, Moore reveals an absolute aversion to the notion of personal responsibility. For example, he blames Ronald Reagan's policy of expanding the availability of credit for a lot of the current economic mess. The film offers the rather lame notion that no individual could possibly have been expected to understand the terms and conditions of the loans they signed their names to and that they were coerced into doing it. But in taking this approach Moore in fact reduces autonomous individuals to hapless victims. As a result, the burden of private debt is all the fault of rapacious financial institutions, riding roughshod over ignorant, ordinary Americans. He then borrows some divine authority from the Catholic Church by simply labelling capitalism as fundamentally 'evil'. Now that's telling 'em.This is where Capitalism: A Love Story really falls flat. Far from analysing the subprime meltdown, the credit crunch or the slump in productivity in the West, Moore avoids any coherent argument about how and why the crisis happened or why the consequences were so grave. Instead, he blurs and improvises one ill-conceived idea after another, becoming the Miles Davis of moralistic anti-capitalism.Moore is on firmer ground when he isn't strong-arming security guards or jabbering incoherent theories. The more effective scenes are the straightforward interviews with people who have lost out to unscrupulous employers. In one scene, he visits a widower whose wife was unknowingly insured by her company ? a dubious practice called 'dead peasant insurance' ? which earned the company quite a substantial amount of money when the woman died. Like many of the stories Moore explores, dead peasant insurance might not be massively revelatory, but it is effective in generating outrage and empathy amongst viewers.In many ways, it is precisely this kind of posturing that makes Moore's films such hits with liberals on both sides of the pond. In Moore's universe you can appear outraged, concerned and engaged with the world without having to fight for or justify a better alternative. Moore's conclusion, for all the leftist rhetoric in the film's title, suggests that the politics of TINA - There Is No Alternative - is very much alive and well in the US.Capitalism features strikingly retrograde ideas dressed up as faux radicalism. It's all very well to bemoan 'selfishness' and 'greed' in modern society, but when Moore conflates rational self-interest with anti-social behaviour and disregard for others, he is justifying clampdowns on basic freedoms and rights. By equating individual freedom only with degradation and amorality, he is going some way to legitimising the culture of unfreedom prevalent in both the US and the UK.Even more disgracefully, he borrows a quote from Roosevelt to suggest that people who are unemployed 'are the stuff of which dictatorships are made'. Raising the spectre of the masses voting for demagogues has long been the conceit of political elites. Moore is foolhardy for repeating it here, especially when the idea of limiting mass democracy looks set to define the new decade.After two decades of filmmaking, Moore's methods and arguments are essentially the same, but the impact of his films has grown ever weaker. Indeed, Capitalism repeats many of the same tricks and devices used in Moore's 1989 film Roger &amp; Me, about the effect of General Motors downsizing in Flint, Michigan. But whereas that film appeared fresh and amusing 20 years ago, the same shtick ? harassing security guards, staging publicity stunts outside corporate offices - is now wearisome, irritating and rather contrived.The main weakness of Capitalism, though, is that Moore doesn't quite know what to say. In his better films, like Bowling For Columbine and Sicko, his persona as affable, single-minded ordinary bloke was effective, but here the subject matter - capitalism - seems too big and complex for him.When one Wall Street employee asks Moore 'Why don't you stop making films?', it was one of the few sentiments in the film I could sympathise with.</fullReview>

Moore specializes in sardonic humor in order to deliver his messages. Unfortunately, he is preaching to the converted. Those who are of the upper class or who watch Fox news will never change their opinions.Meanwhile, this film shows how the working class continues to be treated like garbage while the big shots like those of Goldman Sachs and others of the upper class get bailed out time after time. The corruption is so ingrained, with a revolving door. between corporations and government.t that it will never change, but at least Moore is trying to make a difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important and enlightening, though far from perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an important, immensely enlightening movie, even though it's hamstrung by Michael Moore's usual problems: a scattergun approach, a slight disingenuousness and an unfortunate propensity to exploit his subjects, even as he fights their corner.The first half of the movie has some great things in it, but it's a mess, jumping from one idea to the next in a haphazard manner that suggests a stream of consciousness. It includes a gutting section showing families being turfed out of their houses, a hilarious if obvious juxtaposition of Presidents Carter and Reagan, a succession of revealing statistics about rising executive bonuses and spiralling foreclosures and an incongruous comic song about Cleveland. The highlights are an investigation of corporations benefiting from the deaths of employees that's chilling, if sometimes a little playful with the facts, and a focus on Citibank's notorious leaked memo in which they lamented the fact that the poorest 95 per cent of the country still had 95 per cent of the vote. The apparently indiscriminate jumble of scenes in this first hour is what the whole film would doubtless have looked like had the banking crisis not intervened, handing Moore a peerless example of exactly what's wrong with the current financial system. And what he does with that subject is great.You can quibble with the filmmaker's cameraman zooming in for a greedy close-up of a sobbing child, or lampoon the frankly crap stunts that play second-fiddle to the main narrative here, but the portrait of the banks screwing the little people that dominates the film's second half is utterly superb: scrupulously researched and passionately presented. Beginning with some heavyhanded editorialising about banking terms like "derivatives" being used to hide dodgy practices - a point that's pretty poorly made - we quickly move onto the good stuff. Moore explains how Alan Greenspan and the U.S. Treasury encouraged Americans to obtain subprime mortgages, investigates Countrywide Financial's VIP loans programme and zeroes in magnificently on the bailout of major banks pushed through in 2008. Some of his revelations are just gobsmacking, like the FBI's estimate that 80 per cent of mortgage foreclosures during the financial meltdown were lender-induced. Moore also implies that Obama attracted widespread support because he was accused of being a socialist, which is clearly nonsense, but the last hour of this film is so sure-footed and insightful we'll let that slide.As someone who studied history to degree level (I won't go as far as calling myself a "historian"), I found three backwards-looking segments of the film particularly rewarding. Moore holds up Dr. Jonas Salk - who discovered a vaccine for polio and gave the patent to the country - as a personal hero, and you can see why. When Salk explained away his utter selflessness by saying: "Could you patent the sun?", I burst into tears. I was at it again (and I don't regard myself as someone who cries that easily) when Moore recounted Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision to send in the National Guard in support of striking workers in 1936 Flint, before the director utilised extraordinary footage - long-thought lost - of the greatest President of the 20th Century unveiling his plans for a Second Bill of Rights. The proposals, identified by Karel Vasak as representing the 'second generation' of human rights, would have guaranteed all Americans "a useful job, a decent home, adequate health care, and a good education".I would question whether Moore is really railing against capitalism itself, or just the model favoured in the US and Britain since the late-'70s. He frames the debate in terms that suggest a socialist government would be incompatible with capitalist society. That's obviously not true - take a look at Attlee's administration in Britain. What the director is actually questioning is a system of largely unregulated capitalism; bowing to the free market. Though a form of capitalism, it's an economically liberal strain, known as "monetarism" or "Thatcherism". Self-defeating to the last, Moore also keeps suggesting that America needs a revolution - nice way to scare the crap out of anybody who might think you've got a point, Michael.Despite its obvious shortcomings, though, Capitalism: A Love Story is an important, even landmark work. That's because the subject is so crucial, the movie so timely and the high-spots so damn high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore may think this is funny, but it's really not. okay, i admit it. when i first saw this movie i thought it was all hysterically funny. on a second and third viewing i wasn't really laughing anymore, i thought it was just plain scary.i support a certain amount of free enterprise, but not at the expense of human beings or the integrity of this country. putting profits above people has gone far enough. it's not American and it's certainly not Christian.as a detached observer i just wanted to sit back and laugh at all the ironic humour and pathos of contemporary society. as a Christian, this film started to make me feel guilty and made me feel a certain outrage at the way a lot of us have been treated.anyone who thinks Michael Moore is the enemy ought to have their thick heads examined. resisting Michael Moore is like resisting the Red Cross. but lets face it some people actually do resist medical treatment and help.you need help America. you are friggin' nuts. hey you all drove me bonkers. i guess it takes one to know one and i know for a Christian fact you are all crazy mad and in a toilet with your crumb bum values. no matter how you try to rationalize it, the Christian Bible condemns mammon and material things. Jesus said you must give it all up to follow him. i know it's hard, almost impossible, but as a nation, we aren't even meeting Jesus half way. we are just collectively damning each other to hell.the Christian Bible tells us FAITH, HOPE, and CHARITY. that's CHARITY dummies not love of money. so put some restrictions on your hell bent greed. it's showing and it's embarrassing and frustrating.this movie at first seems real funny. but it's not. it's a sad reminder that we've probably hit the point of no return and have really messed up democracy and the American dream.time is running out for me personally and it's not much longer till i can have almost nothing to do with society and it's evils. i'm at a point where i won't even be able to write reviews much longer because i feel God is telling me that i should have little to do with any of you or any of this.i'm giving you a heart felt warning folks. if you don't change immediately by 2011, i wouldn't wanna be ya. i know you all love money and business, but MANKIND IS YOUR BUSINESS. i didn't want my last words to the human race and to America to be "SEE YA SEE YA WOULDN't WANNA BE YA", but that's unfortunately the way it's working out. my hands are tied here. i'm trying my best.

		<shortDescription>Tragicomic Genius! Possibly His Best Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think anyone watches a Michael Moore film to be informed so much as entertained and agitated to discover truths on their own (he is after all a documentary filmmaker, not a faux news reporter). I view Moore as the ultimate conspiracy theorist, but instead of theories he is connecting (selected)dots of documentary evidence (facts from history that cannot be refuted after all unless one believes most of history is a gross conspiracy). He then masterfully weaves them into pure satire that to me is 10 times funnier than all the supposedly funny pundits on television. Compared to their single sycophantic riff notes you've got an entire symphony of bipartisan hilarity! And indeed,I enjoyed many a deep belly laugh with this film - some parts were so funny I immediately watched them a second time. Truth can at times be much funnier than fiction.What I don't like so much about Moore's films is the tragedic half, when he follows or interviews real people and it's obvious that there's a whole lot more to the individual's story ? but we only see snippets of their lives. It feels like a manipulative emotional effect. But of course that is the purpose of propaganda, which I believe is the role Moore plays with these films: the People's Propagandist. Some of his allegations may seem stretched, but that only (hopefully) inspires people to learn more for themselves. And any discomfort one feels in viewing another's misery is intended, bluntly so. This film was different from all his other films in that he interviewed his Dad and showed a lot of footage from his own young life ? I think this is one of his best partly for that reason. It helps to make the film work in the way that Ross McElwee's film Sherman's March worked so well, because it included more of this personal element. Moore's choice of music, editing - and, as ever, his knack for boldly asking precisely those same questions many of us have in our minds at just the moment when we want answers - make this documentary a 10 in my book. It made me want to watch all his films all over again. And this is what art should do.</fullReview>

Moore moves from the personal - his own history, and that of his family as blue-collar workers, to an overview of an economic system, and does these difficult transitions smoothly, to present a rounded picture of actions and consequences. And at times, this movie just makes you GASP! How did Paulson get away with it? Are the American people really just going to just lie there and let the bankers rob them blind??

		<shortDescription>One film that every American must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is treating a very sad topic. It gives us an inkling on how the USA is run and by whom. I will give only one spoiler: did you know that the wealthiest top 1% of Americans hold as much wealth as the "bottom" 95%? Americans learn in school about Moby Dick and the Pythagorean Theorem but have no idea that they are taken for a ride of epic proportions. It is scary that, for the few people at the top, it is just a numbers game. They amass oodles of money they cannot spend in a thousand (normal) lives while nonchalantly discarding the lives of millions. The scary thing is that those who are hurt the most "believe" in the system. Most believe that if the bank fat cats will not get their tens of millions of bonus money, the country will turn into a North Koreea. The majority of the Americans have no idea that the alternative to the American system - the one that Moore advocates - is not Albania or North Korea but countries like Sweden or Norway where market forces work but there still is some decency in the way the wealth is shared. (As a matter of fact Moore's film gives example of two small companies in America where fairness, decency, productivity and profit taking can work well together.) Finally, the scariest fact is that 210,000 IMDb people voted for Avatar (a fun, entertaining alright film) and only about 6780 bothered to see and vote for this one that is actually a must see for every American and for every fellow outside USA who worships the American system based solely on old Dallas reruns.</fullReview>

Focusing more on the everyday out of luck person, and the few rare examples of Socialists work environments. The tone of the film was almost like he had tried his best through out his career, and now he's tired, but he has to keep going even with false hope.

		<shortDescription>A Very Interesting Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nonetheless, and this will probably not win me any friends, but I think the film ignores a massive segment of the population while addressing some very serious issues that affect many others. It is kind of funny in a way, but in none of MM's films does the world of apartment dwellers ever looked at. That might sound like a trivial point but many people have never owned one home, never mind lived in one for decades. The entire concept of people being torn from whatever place they were used to, to live somewhere else, is decades old, and often involves people who live in apartments. That segment of society is often relegated to oblivion, and in a way MM's observations also ignore what it is like to not ever own a home, and be tied to the ball and chain of renting a unit, often around people who don't care that they create problems for you-re mega noise and other issues, which is a completely different Universe to live in that what it is like to live in a house, where you, and you only, control who comes and goes near you. In a kind of way, MM's films are like-and now all we have to live in is an apt, oh end of days-well, that 'end of days' has been faced decades ago by millions of people, for reasons equally valid and repugnant often, as the sorry tales of egocentric business and government madness that fill MM's films.Not much in Mikes films is news to many, but I like him, I just think-egad-he is naive-things have been worse than he thinks for longer than he recognizes. Have a nice day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, Moore does not always show everything, and some of what is left out puts what he is campaigning against in a less negative light. Yes, his films can be pretty manipulative. Nevertheless, he always raises strong points, and as is the case with everything he's put out, those are the ones I truly hope people will hear and remember. This goes over the history of capitalism for the last hundred years or so, and the way the US economy has changed in that period of time. Captain Mike uses his capable editing to do more than play on our emotions; he creates many funny(and several downright hilarious) sequences using clips from various sources(movies, advertisements, news shows, etc.), and one bit is shot and cut in the manner of a big-budget Hollywood flick, to great effect. The most compelling of the arguments presented here remains those which are not questions of political stance, but ones that can not and should not be ignored. By far, the best of this is where it reveals that numerous of those earning extreme profits are *not* those producing items that are popular, among other facts. Sadly, this does go off the deep end here and there, such as when he draws Christianity into it. Bad move. That probably will cost him in the long run, and will be something that Republicans will use against him and this documentary. On the whole, this is enjoyable as well as unsettling, and I hope that the ideas of it will be heard by countless of people who are willing to look at things from both sides. There is infrequent moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone, though all viewers ought to research for themselves, and, as in all cases, not blindly accept what we are told as the truth. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit at the top of this interview that I'm a rampant liberal. I'm all for universal health care as an option for people who need it (if you think there's no money for it, re-think the places we're inappropriately spending money now), I think harmful greed needs to be kept in check to ensure that corporations don't abuse their workers, I think money needs to be taken out of politics and I think there are politicians in America whose highest priority is to see the current president fail and whose second or third priorities are to actually vote for or create legislation that could advance America.Hmmm, might I like the latest Michael Moore film? "Capitalism: A Love Story" is a call to action. Moore has a beef with the way capitalism has run roughshod over hopes, dreams and lives in America. Does he have a legitimate gripe? Yes, but these are some of the shakier waters Moore has delved into in yet. Capitalism is the reason most people choose to live in the good 'ol U.S. of A., how can you rail against it? Moore makes some good points: - Ronald Reagan appointed the CEO of Merrill Lynch to the Secretary of Treasury, sparking the beginning of the marriage of business and politics - Businesses are taking life insurance policies out on their employees and are naming THEMSELVES the beneficiary. Companies are starting to make money if you die. A little something called "Dead Peasants". - The richest 1% of America makes more money than the bottom 95%. This inequality creates instability in the country.Moore methodically tells fifty or so quality, involving stories to back up his case that the financial status quo in the U.S. needs repair. But it's the percentage inequality that resonates most with me. When a country doesn't care for its most downtrodden, the downtrodden get desperate. That's memorably shown in this film, too.Over the course of reviewing Moore's films for a decade now, I've often stated that he's created his own genre, infusing himself into the documentary template. Even more than in "Sicko", Moore's takes an on-screen back seat. The footage, the stories, carry the day. Moore has only a couple of scenes where he does his routine antics, and they are carried out with full knowledge that everyone is on to him. The result is hilarious.One of the things that struck me most about "Sicko" was the British Parliament member who said people in Europe keep the government in check, and in America, the government keeps people in check. That theory is further expanded upon here. Moore is trying everything to bust through American sit-on-your-hands apathy and crying out for action! These guys are outnumbered, and if more people who felt they got a bad slice of American pie stood up, the voices would be deafening. "Capitalism" shows a microcosm of this in the story of Chicago's Republic Windows and Doors, firing its entire unionized workforce of over 250 people, giving them only three days notice, and failing to pay legally required vacation and severance pay. This was a compelling story when it happened and is still compelling today. It made national news, it caused national reaction, but these reactive moments are few and far between. (Moore probably wisely leaves out Gov. Rod Blagojevich's role in helping the Republic workers. Although he was instrumental in bringing their plight to media attention, he later turned douchebag).The highlight of the movie is an eye-opening bit of previously-lost film in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt lays out a proposal called the "Second Bill of Rights" for America. This would provide, for all Americans, a living wage, a home, medical care, and education and freedom from monopolies. Coming out of WWII, this was an excellent course for the country that was never followed through due to FDR's health. Never has a president handled war and the economy as deftly as FDR, hearing his never-realized vision told directly to camera was a haunting and sad moment.Making the media rounds recently, Michael Moore often told the story of Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine. You know what he did with the vaccine once he created it? HE GAVE IT AWAY. It was better to help people survive than to make money. That concept seems lone gone in the world brought to light in "Capitalism: A Love Story". We must be in the part of the love story where the Titanic sinks. I hope we make it to the part where we throw the expensive diamond in the ocean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen all of Michael Moore's movies and recognize they come with a considerable amount of bias and theatrics. This one I found to be far more educational than his previous films. Moore educates the viewer about the recent history of capitalism and the government subsidized raping of the American taxpayer in the name of the "free market." He gives a nice criticism of mass media as well which has become more and more theatrical and less informative as the years have gone by. This may be why Americans are increasingly turning to John Stewart and Steven Colbert for their news - at least these guys acknowledge they are comedians.I digress. Take this movie with a grain of salt and appreciate the biased source. Then sit back and prepare to be revolted by the shenanigans the super rich and the government commit on a daily basis.

		<shortDescription>Whatever your world view, Moore is a superb maker of documentary films and this one shows why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, in Flint, Michigan, Michael Moore and his family lived what they thought was a good life. They had the basic necessities, with father working for a company that made spark plugs for the 50's auto industry, and they had money for some "fun" things, too. In addition, there was enough bucks for the children to attend college and start the process over again. But, ha, something funny happened on the way to the secure middle class existence. With help from the United States, the countries of Japan and Germany rose from the ashes and made better cars than Motown, resulting in a tragic loss of jobs for Americans, when the foreign autos flooded our market. Also, "profits" became the be all and end all of a company's direction, so that even when GM was pulling in billions of dollars, it was dismantling its workforce. Then, in Moore's view, came a leader who believed in the rich getting as rich as possible, President Ronald Reagan. No more high-scaled tax rates for the wealthiest, oh no. He cut taxes, putting the country in debt, and started the path to unlimited riches for those in the top 1 % of the population and a decline in quality of life for everyone else. The result is the "mess" we are in today, especially the bailouts of those wealthy banks, like Goldman Sachs, AIG, etc, who tanked under their own directions and their "pocketing" of key legislators in the U.S. government, who gave them the cash, at the expense of the losing-their-shirts under classes. Is this any way for a democracy to act? This is a fine, fine documentary, for it is interesting, thoughtful, and amusing, in parts. Naturally, the subject matter, however, is very sober indeed, such as the tale of the poor folks in Peoria, Illinois, who lost the home and land their family owned for 40 years, due to predatory lending and nasty fine print. Or how about those Fortune 500 companies who, after taking out huge life insurance policies on their workers, benefit greatly when these same folks die but the never give a dime to the grieving families? How could this not give one pause? But, the greatest strength of this film is the ample "spark" it provides for a heated debate. Now, here is a film that should be shown in every college economics class in the world, for it will undoubtedly make tongues wag incessantly and spur individuals everywhere to further research and reflection. Thank you, Mr. Moore. You may have your detractors, but there are few folks who can put together a film that moves and illuminates situations as well as you can. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 'Capitalism: A Love Story,' Michael Moore turns his unflinching camera on the American economy.However, good as Moore is on his policy of turning over the rocks of what ails the current failed system, (at least failed for 95% of Americans) I feel he could have done more with his exploration. He looks at the banking system, the chronic and systemic unemployment, the foreclosures and the tax payer bailouts but the film lacks outrage.The heartbreak is there, the sometimes surprising spirit of the completely downtrodden ? laid off workers taking over a factory, the newly homeless retaking their homes - but on the whole the focus is scattered - for example, too much time was spent on the corporations taking out life insurance on its employees. Capitalizing on the 'peasants' even in death. I'm sure no one was surprised at that.With Michael's films, I get the sense that the people who should be watching aren't. He is preaching to the choir. None of what he 'exposed' in this was a shock to this particular viewer. We are all bystanders to and complicit in the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor and middle-class to the uber-rich. In history. He is almost eerily prescient when it comes to the great financial collapse of 2008, but again this was not new information for any of us digging deeper for our news than CNN.And still, the word 'socialism' is one of the worst words you can utter in the USA. Even though capitalism is killing everyone, and killing them slowly and tortuously. In poverty and ill-health. Meanwhile socialism is practiced by their overlords and masters - the banks and politicians enjoying unprecedented wealth and health care. Courtesy of the very peasants they subdue and brainwash into subsidizing them with precious tax dollars. And enforcing untruths about universal health care and the possibility that they too, some day, may join the ranks of those in charge.No question that Wall Street is a crime scene, supported by the politicians. But when protesters are routinely clubbed and jailed by the police and the press ask carefully scripted questions of the power mongers, what are the peasants to do?8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Important and Relevant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, So I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and now I am writing the review. Nevertheless, Capitalism is a very important film to watch, like most of Michael Moore's films are. They deal with current political and social events and Capitalism was no exception. The whole premise of the film was trying to explain the financial crises of 2007- present. I think Michael presents a very real picture on how our economic system affects those who have very little and how it benefits the rich and those who "have it all" and our need for expansive economic reform here in the United States and the world.The Good: So many great case studies on this flawed economic and social system, from homeowners who barred themselves in their home, only to have the whole sheriffs department come and evict them forcibly. To airline pilots who only make 15,000 dollars a year, and people wonder why pilots overshot Minneapolis by 200 clicks, these pilots face one of the most stressful jobs in the world, yet need to hold another part-time job to make ends meet. Of course you do have your comical and informative 1950's footage explaining capitalism, the profit motive, competition and the evils of socialism. And of course you have Michael Moore very comically trying to get into various corporations from General Motors to Goldman Sachs to try to speak to the CEO's and get some of the bailout money back for the people. Moore also points the connection of the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve is mostly staffed by people who worked for Goldman Sachs and a variety of other financial companies who have been in the spotlight for mismanagement. Henry Paulson and Alan Greenspan are no exception. The anything goes "laissez-faire" mentality that Alan Greenspan advocated during the Bush years is one of the reasons why the system is in distress now. He also mentions that Citigroup in an internal report labeled the United Stats not as a democracy or a freemarket but a Plutocracy, where the top 5% of the people control 90% of the wealth, and where social mobility was stagnant at best. Moore also delves into various philosophical questions such as whether Jesus would be a capitalist or not. His conclusions I agree with. He also interviews several clergy from both the Catholic and Anglican communities who believe the freemarket is evil. He also explores the desecration and decline of his home state of Michigan, once Americas industrial powerhouse, now a sad shell of its former self. In the end the most impacting part of the movie is when Franklin Roosevelt comes on screen and calls for a second bill of rights in which all Americans would have a right to a job, a decent livable wage, universal healthcare, freedom from unfair competition, monopolies, and bad business practices,a home, and recreation. All for the greater pursuit of happiness. I almost cried when I saw Franklin Roosevelts face and his dedication for justice for the American People. His second bill of rights should be a vision we make a reality in the coming years.The Bad: Of course some people are gonna hate Michael Moore and his films no matter what. And some people will be turned off at the relatively simplistic way Moore explains capitalism. And some people will also be critical in how Moore interjects religion in his movie. To me its all good, however it would have been nice to have a few proposals for alternate economic models. The Second Bill of Rights however for the most part sealed the deal.The Ugly: From Citigroup calling the USA a plutocracy to the gritty decay of cities like Detroit and Flint. There is much ugly in this film, but it all comes with the realization that reform of the system is of utmost importance.Conclusion: Moore paints another realistic picture on how the financial decline affects ordinary Americans and how the system must be reformed. I urge every American to watch this important and relevant film.Supra Score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderful documentary because, first and foremost, it tells what you cannot see or hear otherwise. It is a great research project that gathers not only information on the collapse of capitalism but also brings out some of the best American minds and activists you wouldn't know they existed had Michael Moore not put them on silver screen. It relieves you of your captivity to the idea that capitalism is the best economic system ever existed, shows alternatives such as the employee owned businesses or the long lost FDR speech video which was not even in the FDR library.The film is a documentary as a documentary should be, an eye opener with dependable information. But it is also a bold statement against the oligarchs running a feudal system that parades as a democracy, a voice for the people who have no voice and finally a call to action.What more would you possibly want from a film? I have watched this funny and dramatic movie among a packed audience in Istanbul October Film days and at the end there was a big applause. This movie rings the bell anywhere capitalism has plundered people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capitalism: A Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Capitalism: A Love Story is the new documentary by filmmaker Michael Moore, in which he tries to get his point across that the system of capitalism is ruining America and all the damage it has done and a lot of the stories and people you may not know about who it has affected and he asks the big questions about it such as why did the ridiculous bailout of Wall Street even happen? I think with any documentary you have to have some interest in the subject matter of the particular documentary in question. I have seen a lot of documentaries about things I did not know as much about, or had little, or no interest in and therefore did not much care for the films. Also, I have seen documentaries on people and events that do interest me and I have found most of them to be fascinating and in some ways entertaining films. Michael Moore makes films about America and things he would like to see changed there. I am not an American and have never and probably will never live there, but I do watch a lot of American news programs that we do get here in Canada, so I do follow what is going on and the current news. Within the past several years politics has really fascinated me and I get a lot out of watching the daily political shows on television, whether they be Canadian, or American. So with this in mind I was looking forward to seeing Moore's latest film on capitalism because it sounded fascinating and I find Moore to be a very good documentary filmmaker because I feel he researches his films really well and always has a strong case and argument to make. Not to mention that his films do come across as very entertaining because he throws his unique blend of humour into it as well. The film shows people whose lives have been destroyed by greed and altogether what capitalism consists of. We see people losing their homes and some who are really struggling to get by, while others are doing quite well for themselves and seem to either be oblivious, or don't care about the ones who are suffering. Is this democracy? Is this what America was built on and is this what the Bill of Rights says? Michael Moore examines this and suggests that why can't the more well off people help the less well off and why can't there be more things to help the average person, so there wouldn't be the class system that there is there and that everyone gets the same treatment no matter where you work, or how much income you bring in. I know there are a lot of people who do not like Michael Moore, his films, or the things he represents. I'm quite surprised I haven't heard more backlash on this film from more Republican or right wing newscasters, or figures arguing that the film is just a cry for a socialist America. Because in most ways that is what the film is suggesting and you seem to have so many people who are just terrified of the word and what it represents. I have also heard of people who say that Moore does not have his facts straight and it is all very one sided. Yes it is one sided, but when you are trying to get a view out there, shouldn't it be? I mean how many newscasts, or newspapers do we read with some bias, or political side to which they are reporting? We see it everyday folks, whether we know it or not. Capitalism: A Love Story disturbed me and left a lump in my throat and a pain in my stomach after I watched it. This was not because I did not like the film, or agree with it, but because of the evil and greed represented and shown in the film and just seeing all the people who have suffered because of it. At times it is hard to watch, but if you are interested in current affairs and the state of America and one man's view of how to make it better, this film is essential viewing. Whether you agree with it, or not, this film will have you talking and may even get you to rethink some of your own points of view on the subject. A powerful and thought provoking film that is so masterfully done it is disturbing, but in the way that leaves you wanting justice and to see justice and a good way of life follow through. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Capitalism?" "A Love Story?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to Crooks &amp; Liars for economics. Michael Moore's latest documentary "Capitalism: A Love Story," implies two things with its quirky and unusual title: On the one hand, the movie is an open indictment of our failed and corrupted system of capitalism in our country, and on the other hand is about how the crooks on Wall Street love their money, and ours, too. (Note that the United States is not a purely capitalist society, but has many elements of socialism as well, since the government pays for things such as education, the post office, and libraries.)"Capitalism: A Love Story" is not saying that capitalism is bad, it is saying that it needs to be reworked before our greed truly gets the better of us and we find ourselves sinking into an even greater financial abyss. This may very well be Moore's most instantly accessible film, perhaps more than his "Sicko" (2007) three years ago. We can all attest to the current financial mess, and how it seems that rich people in suits on Wall Street get even richer off of the misery of the poor- and working-class people who are being made to suffer the worst because of the financial fallout.Now I will not pretend I even have the slightest clue about how economics truly works, and I don't think Moore does either. But what he does with "Capitalism: A Love Story" is show how our current financial system has failed, due to uncontrolled greed (one of the Seven Deadly Sins) and unregulated business practices. Capitalism, at its core, is about self-interest and self-enrichment, and we cannot deny as human beings that this is not in any way good; I found it comforting that Moore, who for the first time delves into his Catholic beliefs on film, interviews several Catholic priests who all attests to the evils of greed and self-interest. They are right: if Jesus were still alive today, He would not be a capitalist and according to Moore, there's a special place in Heaven for those who worship the almighty dollar over human dignity.Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" (2004) is probably his best film, in my opinion, but "Capitalism: A Love Story," is perhaps his most accessible. As I stated earlier, we've all felt the pinch of unchecked greed and self-enrichment. I'm up to my neck in student loans for college, and I know that it will be decades before I'm able to pay them all off (and for the record I know I'm not the only one, but I'm just making the point that I know where Moore is coming from). The film's ending note falls upon FDR's proposed "Second Bill of Rights," which would have given all Americans, among other things, many privileges that other countries such as those we defeated in World War II get - Germany, Italy, and Japan - including free education and health care, and have yet to be embraced here; but this dream was not realized due to his death less than a year after it was proposed, and so Americans were made to suffer through years of unchecked capitalistic greed.That time seems that it is now coming to pass with our current financial crisis, and unchecked capitalistic greed is what got us here in the first place. I'm with Moore; I refuse to live in such a greedy country, but I'm not leaving (mostly because I can't afford to and I have nowhere to go).10/10</fullReview>

It exposes the truth of how this nation is truly ran, and it's both frightening and disgusting. Moore isn't going after capitalism itself, he's going after the entities and people who have corrupt it. Why do so many not understand this? Whether you're liberal or conservative, a democrat or republican, an independent or a libertarian, go see this film or rent it when it's released on DVD. It's an honest film. You don't have to like the director to enjoy the film, those who decide to not see and/or judge this film negatively simply on the fact they don't like Moore, are the real losers here. Our country is on the verge of economic collapse, and it's the people who are and were in charge of this capitalist economy that brought us here.The politicians belong to the people, unfortunately, they're owned by the banks and corporations. We need something different whether you believe it or not.Amazing and honest film! 10 stars</fullReview>

They must have what used to be referred to as a conscience. They must not be money-worshipers. We are now witnessing the equation: Freedom = Money. It becomes more and more obvious that this doesn't make for a healthy, nurturing society.

		<fullReview>...No pun intended . Micheal Moore basically told the tale of a once proud nation that had values of helping their fellow man morph into a nation of greed. Greed that has taken corporations into the abyss. Moore explored his own personal life story of the way he was raised in a middle class family. Growing up with one parent working and still enjoying the American dream. As time has gone by, more and more corporations have bankrolled public servants and what we have ended up with is the consumer being trampled. Many Americans back in the 50s that were overly wealthy , were paying 85% tax and still living the richmans life. The bailouts,the attack on unions, benefits declining, the wars for money, tax cuts for the wealthiest were all relayed in this film. Mr. Moore , of course, adding his usual humor and entourage to settle the score. My one criticism is that he was not as hard on Obama for the bailouts as he was the GOP. Many of the things stated in this film , I already understood, still it was enjoyable to see Michael Moores usual style. CAPITALIZE on this wonderful film, another winner from Mr. Moore.</fullReview>

(That's basically free food).Another is where morbidly obese Michael Moore manages to get up 5 steps to the GM building before, mercifully for him, being stopped by 3 over-weight cops.In one sequence we see a 5 or 6 bedroomed house with a swimming pool that has been repossessed. Well I'm 43 years old and I have never once lived in a property with a swimming pool much less owned one so why am I being asked to feel sympathy for these people? And the other bunch who winge about their plight on a cell phone from the comfort of a gigantic 4x4. Yes they are morbidly obese too. Are these victims or bad guys? Anyone outside America surely wouldn't have a clue.There's more &amp; more of this stuff in the movie which is the latest in Michael Moore's hilarious series that seems to try to convince Americans that they are the victims of their own success.It doesn't matter how corrupt you want to make out your politicians are, you're all richer than everyone else and that, after all, is what counts.</fullReview>

Its a critique of capitalism with hard proof that a regulated free economy leads to poverty and chaos. Its made by someone who loves America more than most, but that relationship, like the course of all true love, never runs entirely smooth.See this if only because there are villains in America that want you to remain ignorant of the crimes it brings to light. If you are Christian, this is an updated Sermon on the Mount, more potent and true than what you will generally hear in church. This is Friar Tuck's film, not the Bishop of Nottingham's.Its also great comedy. Playing Errol Flynn to the evils of corporate America is as good as it gets in these times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile warning once again from Michael Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about the BIG players, the CEO's of corporate giants, from the banking industry, and the insurance companies. These are the people, who through lobbyists, own our government. These are the same people, who pushed for the deregulation under Clinton &amp; W, who needed to be bailed out, with no strings attached. The movie showed how Carter tried to rein in the American people, but then Ronald Reagan freed the people. It's been a mad dash to the bailout, ever since. After the bailouts, these banks wouldn't use our money to renegotiate mortgages to keep hardworking Americans from losing their homes or lending money to companies who provide American workers with jobs.

		<fullReview>Capitalism: A Love Story (2009)I could not hear everything because of all the laughter and applause from the audience. If you lost your house and life savings with Bush and his rip off Republican Congress, this movie will make you feel better. Watch members of Congress tells us how they were lied to. Watch Corporate America admit they don't care about you or America, just money. See our towns turning into slums, America turning into a poor country like Mexico. Watch corporations tell Bush what to say and how long to say it. Listen to religious leaders explain how America is not following in Christ's footsteps. Americans wanted out of Iraq, no bank bailout and better health care. But it didn't happen. Our representatives are looking out for corporate interests, not ours. The ruling class calls us peasants and admit we no longer even have a democracy. Watch as Michael Moore tries to have everybody arrested who ripped you off. Watch, laugh and figure out how they ripped you off so they can't do it again. Learn how to take back your country and return to a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael again proves to be at the top of his game. A good look at how those on the bottom get ticketed and pay the bill for the top!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love him hate him ,agree or disagree with him you have to admit that Michael Moore is one great film director. He again proves he's at the top of his game with his latest "Capitalism: A Love Story". He's took on GM, the NRA, the Bush administration, and the health care system, now enter his showcase of just how bad and evil that the capitalist system can be for many and benefit so many at the top. The times are relevant too now with the bad economy and with the crashing of many banks and job layoffs.Moore as always blends his message and points by using vintage footage of news reels and parody sarcasm to show a comparison while at the same time the viewer is informed and entertained. Starting off he shows how our leaders were similar to that of Ancient Rome and by their dirty doings the empire crumbles for the people. You as the viewer even feel sad as the scenes of real life people from all over the country being put out of their homes because they couldn't meet payments. As Moore shows a lot of this stems from company, factory, and corporate layoffs as the company brass make more money by cutting jobs, it was vintage and historical to see old clips from Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigian where much of this downsizing started "Roger and Me" was revisited.Interestlingly enough your informed a little history lesson about how good the capitalist system used to be in the 50's and 60's when everyone lived well. Yet in the late 1970's warning was giving that excess and owning goods would corrupt and bring downfall by then President Carter. Never fear America had a plan elect ex Hollywood poster boy Ronald Reagan who as many remember the times of the 80's was more excess, bigger and better more goods is a must "Greed became good". Moore even points out that Ronald's treasure secretary had ties to big business and Moore feels that this time period is when those at the top benefited most as income for the top continued to climb while those hard working folks salaries stayed frozen. Which is still true as many relate to this problem today. So many live on credit and debt is so common yet that's what the card companies want more debt riches them more so they can raise rates and fees to tie you down many many years.Even more grossing is how you see the family of a Wal-Mart employee in tears when they find out after her death, that Wal-Mart had a secret life insurance policy and it was taken out after her death yet it benefited the company and not the hurt family in need. Also Moore showcases he feels that Capitalism is a social disease as religious people give opinions stating that it helps the rich and that Jesus would not condone that standard of living remember Jesus helps the poor.As always Moore put many politicians out even Democrats too as after the banks collapsed the taxpayer money that was used to bail them out was basically robbery of the American people! It was only just and poetic as Moore drives around with money bags asking for our money back. We need a truthful refund! True in many ways this might be a vehicle for socialism, as all of us in America were taught work hard play by the rules and move up the economic ladder and earn money and social status is rewarding, which is OK but yet Capitalism has so many evils as clearly shown here the greed, corruption, and political connection to lobbyist and corporate America have destroyed our system for hard working folks as those at the top have gained and stayed in power and will probably continue to do so. Still some hope is found as Michael Moore shows by the rally of ordinary laid off factory workers and new worker employee owned companies are new routes for many against the evil and corrupt ways of our capitalism. True many have different opinions and thoughts as even when regular folks live above their means they hurt themselves. Still the greed, corruption and under the table tricks of those in power needs to be exposed and brought to light. As America shouldn't be a bad place to live. And Michael Moore should be cheered for by showing the evil way of many as this film really pushed for a new economic and social revolt against the system and those in power. Because for to long those on the bottom have been getting ticketed to pay which is unfair while those at the very top just bypass their way thru by not owning up to guilt and responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Diane and I saw this brilliant, yes -brilliant, movie in Fremantle this afternoon and we were both totally absorbed by his dissection of the sickness that is contemporary America. I was struck again and again by the amount of nonsense that the Americans absorb over and over again. It is as inescapable as the moon on a cloudless night that Americans have been fed the most ridiculous dose of mythology that is beyond belief, except that it really happened.There is a point about half way through the film where Moore discloses some emails sent out from the offices of Citibank that display the arrogance of the elites and their total disdain for any brain power in the 99% of the population that isn't them; I certainly include myself in the group and undoubtedly every person reading this comment. Americans kid themselves that they will ever move upward into this aristocracy of wealth; sure, they can get some of the trappings of wealth, a few baubles but the class system in the States is more solid than anything in the Middle Ages.Further, Moore examined the president that brought Americans (for whom they named an aircraft carrier; there's justice in that move) their greatest tax imbalance between rich and poor in their history?Ron Regan. As a foreigner I am totally stunned that seemingly intelligent people would just roll over and allow these kind horrendous tax cuts for the already wealthy to just happen, with no outrage, no dispute, no revolution?no nothing! Then, on top of that mammoth stupidity comes the two Bushes, father and son; these two just kept the ball rolling with further tax cuts, obscenely enriching those that were already rich. Americans continued to accept further tax cuts for the rich while their jobs went off-shore and their cities died, unions were broken and money poured into Wall Street. See this film and weep for the stupidity of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore challenges authority, questions assumptions, and champions American values.He is absolutely correct that America was not founded as a capitalistic nation, but technically neither was it founded as a democracy. That does not dull the point that when the 95% of the people at the bottom of the income ladder rise up against the 1% on the top they will win every time. No one understands this better than the 1%.Unfortunately too many of the 95% have bought into the warm, comfortable story of the "American Dream." Ninety-five "percenters" used to aspire to wealth as a result of hard work and perseverance; now they buy lottery tickets. George Carlin had it right when he said, "They call it the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it." Indeed, "The Matrix" was a contemporary political commentary, not a sci-fi thriller.But here's Michael Moore's main point -- the tea-baggers and the Code Pink activists have more in common than they realize. They need to marshal their anger toward Wall St instead against each other.When cries of "I want my country back!" are heard from both the right and the left, something fundamental is amiss. Moore tries to point out who are the real victims and the real villains.What do we do in the face of the established plutocracy? Rise up. Organize like the Republic Window and Door workers did. Start business co-ops like machine manufacturers and the bakery in Moore's film. Do not go gently into that good night. Fight back. Not with torches and pitchforks, but with brains, sweat, and yes, votes.One-"percenters" love to dismiss the power of the ballot box. That's because they fear it so much.It's not their country. They just bought it. They may have the money, but the rest of us have the power. Should we decide to use it the outcome is inevitable.Everyone should see this movie (Is it rated R to keep it out of high schools? Shame, that's where it should be seen and debated).Everyone needs to get tickets to this film. Then get angry. Get organized. Get together. And get even.That's how we get our country back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confuses Corporatism-Statism with Capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with most of the film, except for the mistake of calling this system "Capitalism". Virtually all of the excesses in the film revolve around people abusing political power for money, which has nothing at all to do with Capitalism as such. The real evil described in this film is the fact that politicians and judges are given power over us, literally at the point of a gun, to legislate for or against specific activities. The correct solution, in my view, is to minimize how many of these powerful people there are, get rid of the government's monopoly on force and the dispensation of justice, and eliminate any situation where the violence of government can grant favors to people willing to bribe bureaucrats, judges, and politicians. I really wish Moore had taken a look at libertarian solutions to these problems instead of releasing this piece of agit-prop for more of the kinds of special interest regulations that got us into this mess in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw most of CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY tonight via SBS. Moore makes a case against capitalism and then tells his audience that if 'evil' is just removed, democracy and 50s working class standard of living in Flint, Michigan can be restored in America herself....with the help of local Catholic priests and bishops. A sometimes amusing flick, ultimately though another unsatisfying exercise in radical liberalism. The sentimental cosmopolitan republican Gore Vidal once said that Harry Truman was the President most responsible for setting up the 'National Security State'. Michael Moore seems to think it was Reagan. Anyway, the longed for democracy has apparently been achieved amongst WWII's losers: Japan, Germany and Italy....(sigh) more progressive nationalism than you can shake a stick at, Moore's CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY. Capitalists and landlords made up the ruling classes of the USA from the get-go...along with the slave owners. There were no good old days of democracy--that story is 'mythistory'. In fact, democracy and capitalism are incompatible and only accepted as being necessarily connected by the majority because so many believe that the system can be run 'fairly' and with 'Justice', beliefs Michael Moore encourages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore takes on his largest target yet, and exposes some cracks in the edifice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Is this the United States Congress, or the Board of Directors of Goldman Sachs!?" Perhaps this subject is too big for one film to encapsulate, but Moore has a jolly good go. He is really taking on neo-liberalism rather than capitalism itself, as he continually advocates that America should follow the European and Japanese examples of more moderate, mixed-economy capitalism.He misses the point entirely if he characterises these economies as fundamentally 'socialist', when they are merely more successful capitalist societies that integrate bits of socialism in order to keep the majority happier. They are not countries which guarantee full employment or affordable homes for all, as any British or Japanese citizen would be able to tell you.However, Moore does capture some of the core injustices inherent in capitalism and particularly the neo-liberal economic model; he rightly dates the advance of this model to Reagan, though concedes that FDR's dream never comes to pass. The clip of FDR, outlining his never legislated 'Second Bill of Rights' is well selected and opens up some tantalising 'what-ifs', though clearly American individualism was always going to be too strong to succumb to his moderately socialist aims. Moore covers the causes of the economic crisis adequately and graphically shows how people lost their homes and jobs so that the bankers could continue to receive bonuses once their supposedly 'free market' businesses had been bailed out by the state.The film is very insightful on how embedded Wall Street and the stock market are in terms of the running of the government; this 'elite' being disdainfully wary of the 'peasants' who could potentially overthrow them. Moore is not critical enough of the Democrats, however; excusing their eventual caving in and support for the bail-out of the banks, and implying that the mere election of the Obama is itself reason for believing that things will change. Whilst 33% of young people did indeed express faith in socialist ideas (only 4% less than backed capitalist ones), there is only one elected socialist senator, Bernie Sanders, whom Moore interviews. He undercuts his own 'hope' message by making the relevant observation that Tim Geithner was appointed by Obama after a failed stint as regulator within the Federal Reserve. Moore exposes the back-room deals and does concede some disillusionment with most of the elected politicians (Christopher Dodd, for example, is singled out). He makes the valid point that direct action from the people is the only way to establish any gains - giving some concrete examples where unionisation or occupation of foreclosed homes, has led to some redress against the capitalist system.It is arguable whether the planet can afford for all to reap the benefits of FDR's dream; if it is ever to be enacted, consumerism itself must be drastically cut back. It is a self-evident truth that free market capitalism has failed not just the USA but the world, but it is far from clear that a rehashed Keynesian social democrat approach is a viable alternative.Moore should have spent more time honing his central argument regarding alternatives instead of the toothless attempts to make citizens arrests of the bailed-out bankers; he could have made the point that these are in effect robbers of tax-payers' money much more succinctly.BBC documentary maker Adam Curtis has perhaps been the best at capturing the gaping void at the heart of neo-liberalism, in series such as "The Century of the Self", "The Power of Nightmares" and "The Trap". With this film, Moore has a reasonable stab at nailing it, though occasionally undermines his own case by inconsistencies and inadequately checked facts. Same as ever then, but it is still good to see somebody at least trying to tackle the elephant in the room that is global capitalism and the stock market. When he is providing good evidence it is a scatching indictment of the capitalist virus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of MM's worst movies. Not that he is known for fair and balanced documenting but this one didn't even fake an attempt. Nor, as I recall, did he offer any better solutions as we look to rid ourselves of this evil. He lost me when he began embracing squatting as a way for people to remain in their homes (as opposed to paying rent or living in more affordable accommodations or perhaps not having children you can't afford to raise). By making the eviction guy out to be a heartless criminal he severely cheapened his argument. That guy was the messenger PERIOD. As for he and the sheriff leaving and Moore claiming victory, I have a feeling Moore and the tenants may have won the battle but lost the war. Those guys left to avoid Moore and his camera.Nonetheless, Moore does provide a much needed service in giving the public new ways to look at politics and our society. Many of us assume that these issues (Gun control, health care, TARP, etc...) have circumstances that we can't control and there are people fighting for us somewhere and they must know what's best. Moore reminds us that that is not the case. Your interests are not someone else's until it becomes in their interest (election time). So, like him or not, Moore reminds us that we can,and should, question authority and I wish there more people like him out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting stuff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A documentary by Michael Moore can be an interesting experience. I have seen a few of his earlier films and they're always controversial, but always interesting. This one tells how capitalism has been exploited by the rich few to get richer from the hard work of the many poor of America. It's quite shocking to think that in this day and age there are people begging on city streets in a supposedly advanced society.The documentary tells us the history of how the banks got people into positions of power in the U.S. government. And how they used that power to change the law in order to rip people off so they could foreclose on their properties. The sub-prime market was also talked about, and how, when this scheme blew up in their faces, they went to the government and got a bail-out fund. Quite despicable behaviour. There is a lot more covered in this film, but these are the main points.I always find with Michael Moore films that he presents information that the viewer is expected to believe are facts without any supporting evidence. It shouldn't be too difficult to get some supporting data, should it?While I don't always agree with Michael Moore's point of view, he does ask some very probing questions. I guess his stunts are quite interesting as well. For instance, putting 'Crime Scene' tape around the big banks on Wall Street, or turning up in an armoured truck to collect the tax payers' money from Goldman Sachs was pretty cool. This is a very interesting film that is worth seeing, but don't always take Mr Moore's facts as given, he's just as liable to bend the figures as any banker.My score: 6.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I regard myself as fairly to the left of the political spectrum but I am very surprised with the rating for this movie here and most of the comments. Like most of michael moore's recent work, everything is completely one-sided and it seems he's not living in the real world. Let me give an example, while its always sad to see people being evicted from their house, if they cant pay the mortgage, they cant live there anymore, they shouldn't have lived beyond their means, should have read the paperwork, not said they were earning 100k etc. Taking this one step further, if everyone can stay in their home if they default on their loan, then the whole banking system would definitely collapse, maybe thats what moore wants? The bits on companies making money off life insurance policies from dead former employees is reprehensible and that should have been the bread and butter of this movie as no-one can defend that. However, the US is a capitalist country and people like Moore have made a great deal of money because of this very capitalist system he now decries. This really is one of the greatest acts of hypocrisy ever. And while its very noble to go back 50 years and to want everyone to have a guaranteed job, pension, nice house etc, that was in an age when there were only 150 million people living here, not 300m, life expectancy was barely in the 60's, not in the late 70;s etc. This utopia existence is not possible anymore here or anywhere else in the world, Moore should come down from cloud cuckoo land and make his next film about real issues in the real world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs less Moore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Love Story", like most of Michael Moore's documentaries, seems to be believe that the world went to hell in the 1980s, when Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan crumbled with the election of Reagan. But Moore has a nostalgic view of things, blaming the lack of trade unions and "corrupt politicians", when in reality capitalism was always amoral (so amoral as to "employ" slaves) at best, immoral at worst, and only appeared to get worse because various technological progressions ramped up and escalated its contradictions. Yes, unions did act as a buffer against the worst excesses of capitalism, but it was only a matter of time before it became physically and technologically feasible for corporations to simply cast aside American labour and replaced it with the modern equivalent of overseas slave labour.More bizarrely, Moore then turns to Catholic officials to bolster his arguments, presumably to get all those religious fundamentalists and Bible Belters on his side. But why consult officials from a wholly repressive institution, let alone one mired in child molestation cases across the planet? And why not mention that, despite Pope Benedict XVI's outspoken criticism of the "cruelty" of capitalism, the Vatican itself has long been one of the world's poster boys for both capitalism and Colonialism.Moore then goes about hassling security guards, Citibank, the Bank of America etc, but it's all a publicity stunt for the cameras, rather than any kind of real action. Of course the question of where exactly radical agency now lies is an issue which has stumped philosophers, both past and present, for eons. Many now think that no action is possible, unless the world is deregulated into the absolute free market it craves, such that it somehow eats itself all up (a process some have dubbed "accelerationism").Moore then says he wants to replace capitalism with democracy. That makes no sense. Capitalism is a monetary system, democracy a political system. His definition of Capitalism is really Corporatism, or perhaps he believes (rightly so) that because corporations control politics today, that it can now be termed a political system. Regardless, capitalism always morphs into corporatism and Moore's points on the banking industry are worthwhile. He then spends the majority of the film's second half targeting crooked elected officials and bankers who stole trillions in 2008 and then, despite the fact that they should now be bankrupt, continue to receive multimillion dollar bonuses and bailouts. Moore then mentions that the US Congress refuses to audit the Federal Reserve to see where all these trillions went and points to polls which reveal that over 75% of Americans want to audit the Federal Reserve. Will this ever happen? Regardless, all these lines of inquiry have the effect of personalising the problems of capitalism and avoiding the structural, unresolvable problems inherent to capitalism. Of course if Moore were to tackle the core problems of capitalism he'd put off viewers; math and neo-Marxism are hard to make cinematic.The rest of the documentary consists of jokes and little sketches, which are funny in an irreverent way. Moore works best as a comedian.Incidentally, while film-makers, critics, Bush-bashers and left-wingers congratulate themselves for agreeing with Moore, across the Atlantic, film-maker Jean Luc Godard issued what was perhaps the best critique of Moore. Moore's films, Godard says, with their delirious, post-modern aesthetic, in which clips from films and TV shows are ripped free of context, evacuated of their content and repackaged as ammunition, themselves trade in the superficial aesthetic of capitalism. Moore denies the role pop culture and the Entertainment Industrial Complex has in ideological indoctrination, and instead goes after easier targets. "Moore doesn't distinguish between text and image," Godard says. "He doesn't know what he's doing." 7.5/10 ? Well meaning, and certainly its rare for a mainstream film to even bring up the "c" word, but one is better off reading books. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the Michael Moore-isms here, e.g. comparisons with "Europe", the cheap tricks, e.g. trying to force his way into banks to get his monies worth as they've squandered tax-payers' cash, this film works. Mainly as a wrecking-ball of sorts, as I mostly deem this film as a vehicle to get to Americans, not to reach the global market. Which it incidentally does; the world economy is not very much unlike the American one, as we're all victims of globalisation and corporations becoming bigger than governments. Moore's strength lies in simplifying stuff and using humor and tragedy in parallel to reach his goal, to display how the richest people in America get more and more money while the working class, the people at the bottom and those beyond that are trampled on in the name of Money. Even though I think Moore tramples logic in the face by trying to show how capitalism is anti-Christian and hence bad (as I deem Christianity to be just as bad, if not worse than capitalism), I feel this is a film that is current and worthy of watching - albeit with two open eyes, a critical mind and a will to delve further into politics and other ways of living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Capitalism: A Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'd either enjoy Michael Moore's documentaries like a one man force exposing the inadequacies and falling of man and the system in his extremely subjective viewpoints presented in a hard-hitting manner, or dismiss him as another hack and bad filmmaker, just as how someone during the documentary quipped in telling him to stop making films. By now Moore's reputation is notorious, and it's a bit of a riot watching how he's now in probably every watchlist and blacklist in corporate America.Capitalism: A Love Story takes a square look at the current economic system that America has firmly rooted in place, fueled by the basic greed of Man, and the expose on corruption, nepotism and perhaps even plain stupidity. Undoubtedly the last few films in Fahrenheit 9/11, Sicko and now this, has proved that Moore still has plenty of bones to pick with ex-US President George W Bush, never letting go of any opportunity to ridicule him, not that it's hard to do so anyway, and not to mention the very pointed finger that puts the blame on Reaganomics as well, and the manipulated actor of a president.In some ways, this seems to come full circle with his first feature length documentary Roger &amp; Me, revisiting his childhood, his hometown of Flint, and General Motors. Never mincing his words, the film looks at everything from how the man on the street has to struggle with bringing home the bacon and being evicted from their homes and jobs, as compared to the golden years of the American Dream where the lofty ambitions back then, has now evolved into the nightmare that is now. From the unequal distribution of wealth to the more recent, topical bailout plans as passed by Congress, Moore's film does a little bit more than to set up stories and interviews, and goes to great lengths linking all the old boys clique and shady conspiracy theories that Corporate America, or more specifically the bankers, possess this insatiable greed that has to be quashed by common sense, and power from the ordinary folks.In fact, it's more like a rallying call to stand up against injustice committed amongst communities by corporations who hide behind lawyers, and serve as a warning, by the finale, that there is still belief in Democracy being the opposing force toward Capitalism with its one man one vote system, despite a small percentage of the population hoarding all of society's wealth. It even went to speak of a movement and possible revolution that could be brought about by the working class against the elites, because there will be a tipping point that enough is enough.It's quite pro-Obama too (no prizes guessing which party Moore endorses), with scenes capturing the euphoria in his campaign trail promising Change, which in recent days the newspapers have tried to question with Obama's falling approval ratings. While Moore's antics may seem dated, repetitive, childish and attention seeking even, you can't deny the fact that the film would appeal to the sandwiched class, no matter which country, who feel the squeeze because of poor policy making, or corruption amongst the lawmakers. It's chilling to note that with inaction, we'd allow the powers to be to practically walk away unscathed from things that they are held accountable.And that's what we should be guarding against, rather than to swallow bad treatment lock, stock and barrel. It's nothing shameful asking for what's right, and what's due process. You may not agree with everything put forth by the documentary (such has that voice-over onto scenes from Jesus Christ Superstar), but it will set you thinking how the US's checks and balance would still be found wanting in the face of craftily engineered coincidences that seek to benefit the usual suspects. The greed of Man knows no bounds indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's last movie, "Capitalism: A Love Story" deals with much more complicated issues than the ones he addressed in his past films. Though the title of the film would prompt the viewer to believe all is about capitalism, it is more about the corporate takeover of the US government. Micheal Moore's point is that we're now living in an oligarchy rather than in a democracy. The director shows his usual theater scenes (e.g. the attempt to make a "citizen's arrest" of some Wall Street executives )but this kind of stunts end up seeming not that inspired and successful, because no one, even Michael Moore himself takes them seriously any longer. This story is a real hotch-potch of ideas that have been already expressed. However this this film, like others Michael made, is funny as well, in addition to being entertaining and moving. There's not much about capitalism to learn but it makes people see terrible abuses of the "system". This film is entertaining and, of course, thought-provoking, it would rate a B in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film overall but weak on concept of Capitalism at large</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was as usual well put together and with ample entertaining footage embedded into the documentary. But the focus on foreclosures was far exceeded everything else as if fall of capitalism can totally be explained and its virtues rebuked by having many foreclosures. If you see this film in 20 years when the real estate is doing very well and there are no foreclosures then this film loses its power of persuasion. Because of that this film may not stand the test of time too well. I also wanted to see More emphasis on corporate America and its power of absorption and loss of individual identity. Touching on corporations gobbling up more and more corporations and taking power away from individuals. The The film still touched on many interesting subject matters and convey them very well. Overall I enjoyed and it was smart in many levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Michael Moore film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Michael Moore's most superb documentary yet. Moore examines the historical beginnings of Capitalism, and how it has deteriorated into its modern, virulent form. Mainly, he exposes the sinister exploits of huge corporations, and the banking system in this country. Much of this film deals with the devastating impact, that modern Capitalism has had on the lives of most Americans. Moore interviews families that have lost their homes, due to bad mortgages orchestrated by greedy financial institutions. He chronicles lots of other examples, of how many Americans are brutally exploited by their employers, and corporations in general. Moore even talks to pilots of some of the largest airlines. Many of these highly skilled pilots, are so underpaid that they have to resort to food stamps, to help them afford their groceries.This film is a glaring wake-up call, to Americans who are fed-up with being trampled by the cruel excesses, of our Capitalist system. After seeing this movie, viewers may be inspired to fight for their rights against the oppressive corporations, and the profit-mad banks in this country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my survey of documentary types, there is the personal campaign film. Michael Moore, subsidized by the Weinstein brothers, is the best example of this. The film is not a matter of discovery, though our reporter presents himself as a detective. It is instead an essay on what he believes, with the evidence paraded before us. Whether you like these things depends on two factors.The first is the most important. In the US today, politics is a matter of tribalism, with the chief goal of vilifying "the other." Tribes stick close together; some have their own TeeVee and Radio networks, other rely on blogs, books and movies. These are all tailored to the members of the respective tribes. They are consumed because they entertain in the sense that the viewer of a movie feels better about themselves. It is a fractionated patriotism, both sides claiming to be true Americans.Notwithstanding that, the illusion is given that the argument is sound, that the facts are true and they add up. On this score, Moore did a good job on "Sicko." Here he does a profoundly bad job. His facts are wrong. His theatrics are baseless. His arguments vague.The movie follows Moore as he interviews places and people who have been destroyed by what he calls capitalism. This is interspersed with experts: a couple loopy congresswomen, an actor, priests.... He makes the reasonable assumption that GM made a mistake by not listening to him (since his first movie). Despite being the world's largest corporation, GM suffered as a result and survived because it bought politicians to "bail it out."But he is in way over his head. He conflates three things that are largely unrelated: free markets of goods, a parallel liquid capital market that finances production, and the corruptibility of elective democracies. These have at root nothing to do with each other. There is no question that the US is in trouble because of the mix of weaknesses of these three, but an understanding has to go deeper than vilifying "the bosses."A strange example is his focus on employee insurance. Large companies take out insurance on higher level employees, payable to themselves. The insurance company has carefully computed that it will win the bet overall. That is their motive. But the employers like Walmart can win too, because they have an investment in keeping their employees alive; namely that they have found them, trained them and integrated them into the company. Losing an employee is a real loss. So if one dies, Walmart is partly able to cover their investment to pay to hire another supervisor.This dynamic helps jobseekers, or at least a good case can be made so. It is why liberal lawmakers encourage it. But here, the somewhat complex dynamic is reduced to human tales of companies benefiting from death, while crying children starve. Let's hope that the Weinsteins not fund any more like this and make Moore go back to putting together a good case. He did in "Sicko." He could again. There are plenty of targets.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You're correct about some of it being mislabeled as capitalism. But this doesn't mean that what is being said loses its importance. Regardless of whether it should be labeled as capitalist or socialist moves the things discussed in this film are still problems that needs to be addressed."Human beings are competitive in nature" Wrong. Once upon a time that was the understanding, but now it's understood that there is no such thing as human nature. There is only human behavior, which is developed based on environmental influences. Scarcity brings about competitiveness. There is no such thing as a human instinct to take advantage of one another. We're not born corrupt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative, humorous, and heartbreaking....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know where Michael Moore stands on political issues. We've known this since his films gained popularity about 10 years or so ago. He's already ripped on capitalism in his previous movies. If you're a conservative, you clearly don't like him or his viewpoints, and that's OK. That's your right and this is America. That being said, I am going to judge this movie on its merits. I believe that if a conservative filmmaker in the same vein as Moore, but of course with opposing views could also make very good movies, I would also give them strong reviews if their films were well-made.This film has its share of humorous moments, as Moore is wonderful at editing clips of old, random video footage to make you giggle. However, just like in his other films, these clips are used sporadically to break the tension about very serious and heartbreaking subject matter. You sometimes wonder if some of these heartbreaking interviews with people are staged, as Moore seems to be able to get them to cry on demand, yet they always appear genuine.The one major flaw of this film is that Moore does not propose any solutions to the flaws of capitalism. He chooses not to delve deeper into the subject matter, and instead uses the 2 hours to simply complain about some folks being "rich and powerful." I feel that "Sicko" and "Bowling" did a much better job of looking at solutions, along with questioning why the problem is such a problem, rather than just complaining. If Moore believes in flat out socialism then he should say it and make a strong argument for it. It's easier for someone to just pick out the flaws of someone else's solution rather than come out with your own, and that's pretty much what Moore does here.All in all, I still give it a 7/10 because it is well-made and Moore does bring up a topic that the general movie going public never really bothers to discuss. It's certainly very controversial, but I give him credit for trying to get a meaningful dialogue going. He just could have had the guts to take this subject matter to a deeper level.</fullReview>

Now I know his movies are basically garbage.He's extremely critical of TARP, which he portrays the taxpayer just handing over to cash to wall street. The taxpayer received just about all the tarp money back and interest, which completely destroys his argument He dumbs down to a lot of stupid, ignorant Americans.

		<shortDescription>Is Michael Moore Biting The Hand That Feeds Him? Just Asking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great ironies of this movie, of course, is that Michael Moore is himself a product of the system that he spends two hours condemning. I'm sure he supports a lot of good causes, and donates to a lot of charities. I visited michaelmoore.com and saw reference to a couple of them. But I found myself wondering as I watched this - would he be making movies if he wasn't going to make some profit off them? I don't argue with his critique of a system that does indeed concentrate more and more wealth and power in the hands of fewer and fewer people. I don't argue with the fact that workers are largely anonymous, theoretical concepts to those with the wealth and power, to be fired or laid off without any real concern for the personal devastation caused. I don't argue that the political system, dominated by money, has become largely a tool of the wealthy. I don't argue with any of that, but still ... Michael's making something off this. He doesn't look like he's suffering. I think he's sincere in his critique; he means what he says; he really doesn't like the system. He's not being a hypocrite in that sense, but he may be biting the hand that feeds him! He also seems to be making his profit off the suffering of those he's trying to help. Let's face it - he wouldn't have had a movie if people weren't being fired or evicted.All that aside, I thought this was one of his weaker movies. His personal bias - always in evidence - seemed much more overt here, his anti-Bush sentiments (referring to Bush as "Chicken Little" at one point - what's he going to do when Bush has been out of office long enough that he can't really be used as a whipping boy anymore?) are still front and centre, and his closing scene (the citizens' arrest idea, with the bank building being wrapped with "Crime Scene" tape) came across to me as ridiculous. I can buy his critique of the system, but the movie as a whole still disappointed.The one aspect that I really liked was the religious aspect. It's about time that someone called the extreme right on their appropriation of the name of Jesus Christ to support their abuses. They claim the name of Jesus because there's no way for them to claim the teachings of Jesus, since as the movie quite accurately points out Jesus' teachings are hardly sympathetic to capitalism or the capitalist system, and it might be well for some of the right-wingers to actually read the Bible they claim to love - especially Acts 4:32-37, which offers a portrait of an early Christian community which we today would clearly call a socialist community. That passage begins with these words: "Now the whole group of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed private ownership of any possessions, but everything they owned was held in common." Interesting. So while it didn't completely save this movie for me, I did appreciate the challenge to the right wing on the religious issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old plot wrapped in a New Age package with nothing exceptional as expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impressed by his unique style of direction in "The Colombine Incident", I had my own expectations from the star studded movie based on the impact of terrorism and its innocent targets in America. But the movie is nowhere close to the director's first attempt and has nothing new or exceptional to offer in terms of content and storyline.To begin with, "Capitalism: A Love Story" is not a fun filled, youthful movie as suggested by the catchy &amp; colourful promos on air. Instead it's a dark &amp; intense docu-drama, dealing with a serious issue of capitalism and its silent victims. The appealing political element associated with this in the movie lasts for only a few minutes in the first half and then the story moves on to its original plot. So, the relief element with all the interviews and other scenes and captialsm angle is only there initially and it all becomes pretty run-of-the-mill and snooze-inducing later on.The script department is the main culprit with nothing new to offer to the viewers. It's the same as any other of this film-makers films. Just a fat guy and his editing software, quite underwritten and unimpressive, leading to a somehow weird and uninteresting climax.The plot had the capability to win over its viewers, but the execution makes it a little drag after a few initial absorbing moments. However the biggest positive point I see in these small budget experimental types of movies is that they provide an opportunity to many budding technicians, music directors and documentarians who wish to prove themselves in the industry. In simple words, the climax is the major letdown The director, Mr. Moore, who showed great capabilities in his first venture, "Roger &amp; Me", stumbles this time with an ineffective script written on an old story plot. The good old "Roger &amp; Me" is only visible in some particular sequences in the movie, like the one where a guy goes on to search for the brown bread and then kidnapped in a van. Otherwise, Kabir is not able to meet his own set standards of excellence in "Roger &amp; Me".Moreover, I couldn't understand the need of lifting an entire sequence from the 2006 Oscar winner movie "Slacker Uprising" and using it in his most prestigious project having great expectations. The scene where the $700 billion bank bailout takes place, which for Mr. Moore is a conspiracy, a robbery, is straight away taken from the movie "Slacker Uprising", where the same sequence was used to show the Financial crisis of 2007-2009, the transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration, and the recovery stimulus.In few words, "Capitalism: A Love Story" is like an old wine presented in a glossy Yash Raj bottle. It is just an OK movie with nothing new or exceptional from a brilliant director, Mr. Moore. Would love to see him, back in form again with his next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unfortunate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will just say in case "SPOILERS WITHIN" -- it's hard to describe the documentary without describing it in some detail, so I'd urge anyone to see it before reading anything about it. Go in open minded. So beware of SPOILERS.I would only say this movie is unfortunate insofar as Michael Moore made it. There is an extremely important message or rather perhaps story behind it. As to how the economy became what it is, or was, in late 2008 through (now) 2010.Michael Moore is so left wing, some of the things he's troweling out are untrue or mangled versions of the truth. But there are some very true things going on here as well. It's unfortunate because one can dismiss this documentary as junk left-wing Michael Moore trash, and it's understandable since Michael Moore has made so much of that sort of trash.This is sort of different. An interesting part is that it's entirely bipartisan in its criticism of the financial sector. Blistering criticism to be sure. He attacks Democrats as well as Republicans -- Robert Rubin, Christopher Dodd, the Clinton Administration, and it goes on. Of course the very far left folks like Dennis Kucinich, Bernie Sander (self described Democratic Socialist) and Marcy Kaptur come off quite nicely, but that is to be expected in a Moore movie. He even manages to crowbar in a reference to the Iraq war from 2002 -- a stretch to say the least.At one point, among his clownish behavior, Michael Moore prompts Marcy Kaptur into agreeing with his characterization of the TARP bill as a "financial coup d'etat." Which is sort of stupid. Even if you are against the TARP bailout, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan votes, it's not that.When a movie characterizes events in such extreme terms, the real truth may be overlooked because the extremity is so easy to dismiss. Hence the unfortunate part. To be fair, Moore didn't just follow the rather inane tactic of "blame Bush first, last, and always, for anything and everything." A tactic which over time will become clear that it as silly as it is. He points fingers all over the place, many well placed, though his conclusions are not so well placed.It really is too bad, that this very important story of the meltdown of the U.S. economy related to sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages, and the practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and other financial institutions, is being told by Moore, who very much likes himself so much, it gets in the way of telling it.Having just seen it, I don't think he even mentions mortgage-backed securities (MBS), an extremely important part of the story.There's a weepy part when a family can't repay the loan they made on their house so it was foreclosed upon. A distressingly common thing happening in 2009 and 2010. But it lacks the basic understanding that banks don't want houses, they want people to pay their mortgages on loans that they were given. And I hate banks to be quite frank, but it's true.VERY MUCH A SPOILER: Almost at the end, Michael Moore says one of the most stupid things I've ever heard in a movie: "Capitalism is an evil, and you cannot regulate evil." The very system of economics that allowed him to make this unfortunate movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike, Just watched your latest film. I am a registered Independent Voter. I really can't stand some of the nonsense that this two-party system "provides" us with. I like to learn every thing I can from people of all walks of life. I have friends that are Democrats and Friends who are Republican. I had not remembered learning of the second bill of rights growing up. They did a good job suppressing it. You learn something new every day. While it seems like FDR had his heart in the right place, I find it hard see how this could be productive. For these rights to be a given, would come at a great cost to our individuality. It seems like a platform for complacency and would lead to a lack of innovation. How do you provide everyone with a house, a job and expect them to strive to be better at it. Why bother; it's a right, right? I can think of no better way to incentivize laziness. People are taught not to think of themselves as animals but the fact is we are mammals on this planet that have to survive just the same. Why do some thrive and others die. It's life in the big world. If we kick back and say hey government gimme gimme, that's what you'll get, big government telling you what you can and can't have. We would be a nation of ambitionless drones. Where would you draw the line at what a decent living is, and what an acceptable amount of recreation is. Is that your answer to Capitalism, yikes? I hope not. Do you want the "man" telling you when to get back to the office or when to sleep, and Eat? Might as well have a right to eat Filet Mignon- but only once a week, or once a year. When does it end? What if I want to eat Lobster at the same time? Umm we ran out of money, I guess you'll have to settle for the government-apportioned sandwich to go with your government apportioned size house. Do I get a bigger house if I have more children, guess so, since they all have the right to a home, maybe they should have there own room also. You know what you and Rush Limbaugh have in common, profiting off being a poster boy for extreme beliefs. Would you be willing to give up your money to live in that society? I doubt it. Time to go back to the coal mine Michael here's your shift, it is your right to work, you don't have to, but you'll have to give back this house.(or not, hmm I see a problem here) Oh you have a camera and made a lot of money with it. Too bad we taxed it down to almost nothing and forced you to get up every day to work at the mine. Give me a break. I think I want my money back for the movie I rented. Maybe I'll drive up to your house and wrap some crime scene tape around it.

		<shortDescription>More of Moore's BS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go again! We first became familiar with Michael Moore when he tried to tell us that General Motors somehow owed more to it's employees than their wages - which were inflated well above the cost of labour in other countries because of the auto- worker's union. According to Moore, if some overpaid schlob decides not to change jobs for 20 years then somehow General Motors has an obligation to keep the plant open. Of course he never explains why General Motors have this obligation because they don't! Yet somehow a lot of people agreed with Moore and since then he has been making all sorts of other equally ridiculous claims and the response has been confined applause. There's never been such a shining example of Capitalism than the rise and rise of Michael Moore on the backs of the people he claims to care about. This movie is more of the same. Apparently Capitalsm is no good because wages are determined by supply and demand - not by some arbitrary belief system. For some unexplained reason pilots should apparently be paid a lot more money even though there is a massive oversupply of people who have the skills and want to be pilots. As usual though the reason isn't explained. And the movie just goes on and on like that. Moore doesn't care that Capitalism has been proved - conclusively - that it provides more people with a higher standard of living than any other system. Of course Capitalism isn't perfect - no one ever said it was - but it is unquestionably the best system we have had so far. If you listen to Moore you'll believe that human greed only crops up in the Capitalist system and not in any others - which is, of course, completely ridiculous. But that is what the real problem is - greed. And since greed rears it's ugly head in all systems it is greed that is the real problem - not Capitalism...</fullReview>

It's sad when it shows people being evicted. And it is mind blowing when you realize that teenagers are being put into jail on offenses that don't seem against the law; and then the Judge gets a kickback payment for condemning them.This movie calls into question whether Capitalism is good. But it doesn't show how bad the alternatives to Capitalism are. So, it is a biased attempt to influence the audience. Because we are there to be entertained, not to learn with the disciplines of a college classroom, we easily accept the activities, horrors, of the location shots as being an indictment of Capitalism.This movie will grow some new Socialists and Communists. But for me, it was a sad way to be entertained. Thankfully Michael Moore made me laugh when he put yellow crime tape around Capitalistic buildings.Perhaps the true hero of this movie is the Sheriff who stopped evicting people from their homes.Because economics is a complicated subject, I suspended my critical view of this film. I saw it as entertainment; and I saw it as propaganda. Should I turn on my critical view, I would no longer be entertained. And I am sure I would find flaws in Moore's economics.So, if you see this movie, sit back and allow it to entertain you knowing that it uses propaganda devices to encourage you to act on Capitalism for change. What changes? Well, you need to understand the complicated issues of economics and political policy and history to know where to point. Don't let Michael Moore "take you there". Just let it entertain you, like a good horror movie should. Arrive sober, mouth open, with a new interest in economics. Maybe this movie will give you a reason to get better grades in Economics 101 and Poli Sci. Oh don't, oh don't become an instant communist activist. Keep all your thinking under control as you leave the theater.</fullReview>

Keep in mind that the players (the industry) just like on a sports team will use any means to cheat and game the system. That is why we have referees and officials to keep the order. As pointed out in the film, "officials" now have a stake in the outcome of the game. It is sad that, once upon a time, the rich made their fortunes by building businesses that created goods we wanted and needed and created many jobs in the process. Not true anymore, and that was the saving grace of the movie that this is pointed out. Unfortunately, and in typical Hollywood style, a man in a white horse rides in and saves the day (Obama). Angels sing and tears of joy flood the screen. And just like any other Hollywood movie, it's all fantasy. Obama employs the same crooks that got us into this mess.</fullReview>

Moore even points the finger at Chris Dodd.At the end of the movie he says capitalism is evil and should be replaced by democracy. The point he neglects to get is that when people don't have to work to attain, they become lazy and demand the government do more for them. Then they elect socialists to further their agenda.

Basically, Moore is looking into American Capitalism, the system where if you are poor and can't afford to keep something, then the authorities have permission to take this something and give it to someone else. The film also focuses on other big financial troubles, especially the crisis starting in 2008, in Britain we called it the "credit crunch". With appearances from Thora Birch, Wallace Shawn and Moore's father who was affected financially too, oh, and footage from the likes of Jimmy Carter, John McCain, Barack Obama, Sarah Palin, Ronald Reagan, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Arnold Schwarzenegger, all doing stuff that creates financial problems. I know almost nothing about financial stuff, but I suppose there were some interesting facts, even if Moore seems like he wants us to think his way only. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Capitalism is a social system based on the recognition of individual rights, including property rights, in which all property is privately owned. A full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism?with a separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church."-Ayn Rand. America is not and never has been a true Capitalist society, but we have been the closest. Capitalism means freedom, the more free a society is the wealthier its people become. Not Anarchy freedom, but freedom of individuals protected by the government. But in a mixed economy like America, there can only be one outcome, and Moore's movie shows what that is. It is mostly the law makers of the government that caused this crash. Any company that needs or uses government assistants to start or keep running will surely fall in the long run. Government has worked for a long time with the companies that are the root cause of the housing crash. Protecting the banking system, which is fundamentally controlled by the Federal Reserve, is an established government function. It is completely unclear why the government needs to or should bailout insurance companies, investment banks, hedge funds, car companies and foreign companies. If we do not define our policies, morals, ethics, and ideals then what are we to fight for? Fighting against the "rich" is ridiculous, who the hell are the rich? We need to fight against the people in government positions that are controlling the economy, or the companies that are in business with the government. A true business man can stand alone, with out government support, and that's what all businesses should do. It has been proved time and again that a business that works for the government with government subsidies will be corrupt. From the big 4 of the railroads, to the Freddie Macs and Goldman Sachs, it just doesn't work. Government needs to keep their hands out of business, and business needs to keep their hands out of the government. If this never happens, then we will never be free. Micheal Moore's film had some things right, but when you blame the everything on Capitalism and Freedom, you are signing your own death warrant. Every society that has existed has had crooks and robbers, and they have always worked with the ruling body, with bribes and trade. So please for your own sake, make up your own mind, and don't group the worst of society with its best philosophy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Michael Moore's past work (particularly Roger &amp; Me, Bowling For Columbine, and Fahrenheit 9/11) and the hype around this film led me to believe that it would be his best work, or at least as good as those, so I went to see this film with that frame of mind. It is a good film, but certainly not among his best. Other reactions at this showing were mixed, with some loving it, and some hating it. I seemed to be the only one in the middle.Unfortunately, while it is at times a very moving film, and an indictment of financial deregulation, and an exposition of some truly evil business tactics, it really fails to make the case that capitalism needs replacing. Further, it seems to imply that the replacement for capitalism should be Catholicism, the wealthy organization that owns its own shiny golden city-state (The Vatican) and is perhaps best known in North America in recent times for raping children, although it has other gifts like repealing equal marriage rights from loving gay couples, and opposing life-saving condom usage. WTF, Mike?I expected this film to make the relatively simple mathematical case that capitalism, even without derivatives and globalism, is a Ponzi scheme on a massive scale. The size of it is used to confuse people from the basic mathematical rules that necessarily prevent a rising tide from lifting all boats, and rather encourage mass drowning.I expected this film not to let anyone off the hook. While some remarks were made about Obama, he still comes off looking pretty good, even though he voted for Bush's giveaway of US taxpayer cash to line the pockets of the financial parasites on Wall St who were already sucking the country dry.I expected this film to present a viable alternative to capitalism that the average viewer would accept. Roosevelt's proposed Second Bill of Rights was nice, but Moore didn't illustrate what that would actually mean. The right to a decent job and a decent home pretty much means no more cheap crap from China, and so probably no more Wal-Mart to sell cheap Chinese crap. In the face of the WTO, and US indebtedness to China, how is this going to work?Despite my major disappointments with the film, it still gets an 8 from me for exposing some really evil things that I had no idea were happening, and for introducing us to some of the real people doing these things, and more importantly the real people affected by these things. Every US citizen should see this film, to see just how badly and brazenly they are being screwed by the people they put their trust in to represent them, and to run the economy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but with some flaws.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I got out of this movie was that his idea was that Capitalism is detrimental to democracy. He did have good points but there were some flaws.It came off as saying that capitalism is all out bad, he even had priest going against it. That would be like saying money is evil. both aren't necessarily evil, they just make people do evil things. Communism's downfall is sloth, Capitalism's downfall is greed. Both systems can work if you control these flaws. Since both are deadly sins, it would have been good to see it addressed with the priests but it wasn't. So it does feel like some of the focus is misplaced and that is something I felt watching the movie.But he was right about many things, that democracy is hurt by capitalism, as he showed with the democrats switching on the wall street bail out last year. There was also many fine examples of how we as people, are nothing more than numbers, and in some cases, commodities to corporations (ie corp. taking out life insurance policies and the Wilkes-Barre children prison incident) where we are investments or even worth more dead to the company.He doesn't offer a new system instead of capitalism, just reminds us that it is our right to stand up against such injustices. As was pointed out, they have the money to buy politicians, but we are the majority and its still one person, one vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was fifteen years old, I was making $3.50/hr scooping ice cream for Orlando tourists. Unfortunately for Mr. Moore, most people who watch this movie are not currently adolescent Mint Chip jockeys.The first half of "Capitalism: A Love Story" is a meandering eye-roller consisting of Moore's habitual attempt at a main street heart tugger; rife with his ubiquitous middle America sob stories. While one's heart cannot help but to go out to these people, it is impossible to overlook the inherent flaw is his argument: How did they end up in this situation? In no moment of the film does Moore explain why these poor Americans are being "unfairly" evicted from their homes. Is it because they are victims of corporate America? Is it because aliens defecated on their crops? Or, is it simply because they bought a house that they could not afford?There is a difference between feeling sorry for someone and consenting fault on that person for their problems. While the two are not mutually exclusive, Moore depicts neither to the correct degree. He fails to drive home his idea that the audience should pity these people, even though he (and the melancholy musical accompaniment) says we should.The second half of the film redeems itself slightly, although not without the same Moore-ish propaganda. As an admitted fiscal conservative, I was hoping for a big 'ole bail-out bash. While Moore fires at this, he uses his left wing pundits as ammunition, watering down any validity to his claims. Once again, a Moore 'documentary' fails to show the sides of both aisles.Additionally, Moore's wrapping of various corporate headquarters in Crime Scene Tape and screaming 'citizen's arrest' over a bullhorn is nauseating. Done more for show than putting 24"s on a Saturn, the sequence is portrayed solely for the film's trailers and does little to support the accuracy of his claims.After watching a film that I don't particularly like, I often attempt to reconcile the message behind the facade in order to give me a reason for wasting my time and money. In this case, I can't find one. In "Capitalism?", Moore's whining is at its best, and his solutions to an obvious issue are at its worst (socialism? seriously?).Ice cream scoopers take heed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Thumbs Up - Way Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen every film by Michael Moore and have enjoyed them all to a certain extent. "Roger and Me" had been my favorite until "Sicko" came out. Now, I have a new favorite - "Capitalism: A Love Story." Though Moore's film is not thoroughly anti-capitalist in the film (he states that the '50s were "good times" - even though most people of color in the US wouldn't have agreed), the over-riding message is clear: Capitalism needs to be replaced with something better. He suggests, "democracy." I believe that would be an excellent start.The reason this film is my new favorite is that even though it is very sad and infuriating to learn the results of rampant capitalism in our nation, he also includes victories (however small) in fighting back. The workers at Republic Windows in Chicago fought Bank of America and won. A family in Florida fought being evicted and won; and a US Representative from Ohio said on the floor of the House that not leaving your home is the best way to fight being evicted. I thought it was amazing for her to give this advice! She said that with all the shenanigans involved in the mortgage crisis, no one really knows where the mortgage is held and therefore you should stay put rather than being forced out.I saw this with my slightly apolitical girlfriend and we give it two thumbs up - way up! She said the only let-down was that the audience didn't say, "let's go start a revolution" when it ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Moore's smartest, most thoughtful, and most entertaining film since Roger &amp; Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Michael Moore a lot, but I didn't think I would have found another movie that matched the brilliance of Roger &amp; Me. I never thought that until I walked out of the theater after I saw Capitalism: A Love Story, an entertaining, interesting, smart, and thoughtful documentary about how the government harms people in order to make money off of them. Michael Moore explores everything from how innocent teenagers get locked up for no reason to how all to how those great insurance companies actually have fine print naming outrageous things you have to do to join their companies. The fascinating thing is that both of those and everything in between is just so the governments and banks can make money off of you. The most fascinating thing he explores is how the government and banks evict poor people from their home and give them 1,000 dollars if they agree to do so, or arrest them if they don't. It ends up the government and the banks get 20 times more than that just for doing it. If you're a Michael Moore fan, see this film right away, and if you're not a Michael Moore fan, then see this right away. Anyone who doesn't walk away fascinated and frightened at how our country makes money must not be fascinated by anything and must not be able to be frightened at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A valuable, albeit incomplete, critique of capitalism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is classic Michael Moore. From the spot-on editing to the big-band rendition of "The Internationale" that accompanies the credits, Moore presents a finely honed critique of American capitalism that is, at once, funny, sad, infuriating, and inspiring. He even has the honesty to pillory the Democrats, although his love for Obama is unmistakable.He may be forgiven if he focuses only on corporate greed, which is an important, but ultimately secondary issue. His focus is sharp enough to be useful.Sadly, he fails to discuss the underlying cause of the current economic crisis: a rather simple set of economic principles that almost everyone?except for Marxist economists?studiously ignores.Capitalism is an economic system in which private investment flows to where it receives the highest return on investment (rate of profit). This is fundamental. A principle of Marxist economics is that the only source of value is human labor (the Labor Theory of Value).For the last several decades, the rate of profit has been falling. Financial deregulation allowed for the creation of new investment possibilities, none of which actually created any value, but which offered artificially high rates of return. Therefore, money flowed out of manufacturing, where the rate of profit was falling, and into these phony "derivative" instruments (credit default swaps, etc), where the rate of return was enormous.As an analogy, think of a bowl that has, say, 5 egg whites. As you beat them, they increase in volume. But there are still only 5 egg whites in the bowl. The flow of investment into financial instruments was like an egg-beater. It looked like there was more value being created, but the actual value never increased; it was based on nothing real. It had to eventually collapse because it did not represent real value (which can only be created by human labor).Corporate greed is nothing more than an attempt to maximize the return on investment. And boards of directors have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to make this attempt. It makes no difference if the return is maximized by producing things that people need, or by producing things that harm people, or by shifting investment into derivatives, or by smashing unions and lowering wages, safety, and living conditions. It's all in a day's work for capitalists and their representatives in government.This is where Moore's film fails. While his delicious attacks on corporate greed are fun to consume, the real meat and potatoes of the crisis are left off the table. Indeed, the problem is not that Moore is a Marxist; the problem is that he is not a Marxist.This being said, I think that this film is still worth seeing. While it presents only one facet of the issue, and although it does not present a real socialist alternative, it stands on its own as a valuable, albeit incomplete, critique. If it gets people thinking about the reality of the class system in America, it has done its job.(Note to previous posters: Capitalism has nothing to do with democracy; fascism, which is anti-democratic, is a form of capitalism. For Marxists, socialism, in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the working class, is inseparable from democracy. One simply cannot have one without the other. This was hardly the case in the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, etc, which were never socialist. Okay, the Soviet Unions was socialist for about 6 months. In China and Cuba, the working class never took power; they were basically smashed.)As a postscript, the comments by jedmondson67 ("Capitalism - A Lesson In Economics, 1 October 2009") are problematic. I do not know where he studied economics, but almost everything he writes is wrong. His definitions of capitalism, socialism, and communism are simply unscientific. His view that the U.S. is socialist and not capitalist illustrates his basic misunderstanding of both political economies. A simple correction may be useful: Nazi Germany is an example of what is called "national socialism," which, despite its name, is a form of capitalism. It did not destroy the German capitalist class; it saved them from a growing radical workers movement.On the other hand, the "democratic socialism" of Marx is the result of the working class taking power. This is hardly what happened in Germany, and, contrary to what he thinks of the New Deal, it has certainly not happened in the U.S.</fullReview>

Despite the different subject matter, Capitalism gave me that seen-it-all-before feeling: people good, corporate entities bad. And I'm also getting tired of Moore's antics, which, while usually entertaining, were quite trying on my patience this time, and don't really befit a documentary, especially once that serves as propaganda. Actually, aren't documentaries supposed to be neutral and let the facts do the persuading?

First, those problems he showed are the problems of corruption and high degree of integrity between some huge businesses and the government. Second, we do not have free markets to blame. Markets cannot be free in the central banking system, as the money supply and rates are manipulated by the Fed. What are the alternatives? Socialism? In socialist countries the degree of the very same integrity is higher and corruption is only worse. If we have problems with corrupt government officials or businessmen why don't we throw them to jail instead of changing the sytsem?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The proof that "Capitalism: A Love Story" is a surpassingly stupid movie is evident from its heavy breathing over FDR's abortive "Second Bill of Rights"?which, if the President had but lived to push it through Congress, would supposedly have established economic justice and equality by law. This second Bill of Rights was actually included in FDR's 1944 State of the Union message. Here's his list of proposed new rights: "The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education."Now of course this is all humbug. However attractive these so-called rights might seem in principle, a government attempting to enact them would soon acquire near-totalitarian powers. And no conceivable government could obtain the necessary data, much less mobilize the wisdom, to make these rights effective. Even in FDR's day, the promise of economic planning was a sad delusion. A national economy on the US scale is simply too large and complex to be managed by government experts and bureaucrats. For these reasons, one would have expected Moore's film to be greeted with hoots of derision. But since, as the French say, a fool can always find a bigger fool to admire him, "Capitalism: A Love Story" was saluted in certain quarters with hosannas and waving palm branches.Moore proposes replacing evil capitalism with "democracy." And though he's leery of using the precise word, the astute viewer soon grasps his point. Socialism! Socialism will save America from the greedy clutches of corrupt politicians and their sinister corporate paymasters! Okay, so maybe this idea didn't work too well in Russia, China, etc.?but whatever his deficiencies as an economist, Moore understands his audience well enough. He knows that few of them learned any history in school and are largely unaware of the catastrophic results of every past attempt to establish socialism. He also knows that people like to be told what they want to hear?in this case, that they can have all the goodies they want for free if only a "democratic" government existed to provide them. So despite the stupidity of his film, I suppose that I must concede to the filmmaker a certain low cunning.Moore being Moore, he drives his point home in a typically heavy-handed manner, with the usual collection of sob stories. But while it's tough to lose your house because you can't afford the mortgage payments, that's a relatively minor tragedy compared to a sojourn in the Gulag or a bullet in the back of the neck. I doubt that the pathetic victims of capitalism he parades across the screen could endure living in Cuba, North Korea or Vietnam for even a single day. And that's why Moore's expose of American economic injustice is largely bogus: He measures America against an airy ideological fantasy, a socialist paradise that has never existed and never could exist in this real world of fallible, imperfect human beings.Grownup people understand all this. Michael Moore, of course, is not a grownup, and his film is merely the power fantasy of an arrested adolescent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore is a brilliant film-maker. Sicko should have won an Academy Award but wasn't even nominated. Don't expect empathy from the Hollywood community. After all, the artistic elites in Hollywood are just as likely to be as greedy as the banking industry. As we learn and see in this film, capitalism can be a great evil even the priests agree that Jesus Christ would not be happy with the lack of equality between the rich and the poor. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It's heartbreaking to watch a family like the Hackers lose their home and earn extra money by cleaning it out. They are not the only ones. There are too many foreclosures! How did it all happen? How did our country turn into this situation? There are 50 million people uninsured or under-insured like myself. Millions unemployed and a growing homeless problem in our country. Michael Moore seeks to ask questions and makes some surprising discoveries. He can't do it alone. I would be more than happy to help if I knew how but I'm keeping my head above water to survive. All I can offer is my prayers and hope that it gets better. But it is really those with wealth and power that have the ability to share it among the works or peasants. I was horrified that a young widow's husband was worth more dead than alive by his own company. In fact, his company earned $5 million dollars for his early death because they insured his loss. Can you imagine how did this happen? When will it change for the working class?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what it is about Michael Moore documentaries but they just leave me feeling bored. I can't think of any Michael Moore films where I didn't agree with the subject matter, but Michael presents his material in such a jokey I-don't-really-care manner that it loses any urgency it could have had. When Michael does want to get serious he gets weepy and shows sad images, almost as if he wants you to cry into a tissue and not raise a fist to those in power that are screwing you over.Michael uses the same formula for this film that he has for all his others, gather data, a few "experts", perform some comedy bits which are followed by the weepy parts. In the end he'll ask everyone to rise as one against your oppressor, but what does it really matter as long as you see this movie in a theater or buy the DVD? I find it funny that whenever Michael is staging his stunts, like his public pestering of companies or organizations, nobody is ever there urging him on or joining the protest. I'm very liberal but it's hard to get behind somebody like Mr. Moore, somebody so soft and whiny.Overall, if you have a television and have been paying attention to what our government has been doing you won't find anything here that you don't already know. If you think the bailout was for our benefit than you'll be absolutely shocked and flabbergasted by such displays of sheer arrogance on the part of our government. . .people whom we elected.

If he could, he would realize that he's NOT protesting capitalism in this movie, he's protesting GREED, a deadly sin that does every bit as much damage in communist countries as it does in capitalist ones.Moore could have made the exact same movie in any given communist country ? wait, no, he couldn't, because communist countries don't enjoy freedom of speech. Moore has not lived under communism. I have. The very same, sad tales of the powerful exploiting the powerless occur in communist countries.The solution is not to demonize capitalism; the solution is to follow the teacher Moore himself says he admires ? Jesus Christ. If Moore were to extend his own thought processes to their logical conclusion, that should be the topic of his next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To make it clear: I gave it a 2 because when I watched it with my friends we had a hell of a laugh almost every minute the film was on. Of course, most of the time we didn't know whether to laugh or cry.... This is a great movie if you're looking for a politically-biased economic comedy, but for a documentary, it lacks in factual accuracy on so many levels that it loses face and credit after only a few minutes.In the first half of the movie, Moore shows us a few examples about how bad capitalism can get. Is there social injustice in capitalism? Yes there is, people are not equal in wealth and that is an issue which is probably the toughest questions humanity has to solve. But what are some of the few examples that Michael Moore emphasizes about the evil capitalism?1) Wal-Mart "peasant insurance" - Wal-Mart quit taking out this kind of insurance in 2001. Way to be up-to date. Other than that, it has nothing to do with greed, it simply costs a lot of money to replace a deceased colleague.2) "GM fired 20.000 people..... and after that, it went bankrupt." - For God's sake, the sentence starts in 1989 and finishes in 2009. How can you possibly put 20 years and two events that don't correlate whatsoever, in one sentence?3) Illegally sending young people to juvenile home - the judge was arrested, how is this a good example of capitalism being bad? It's like Michael Moore has never heard that corruption is way higher in socialistic, autocratic countries. 4) Obama was against banks and the $700 bn bailout in the beginning but Goldman Sachs donated $1 million to his campaign and then he was turned the other way around. - I mean, c'mon. Do the math. Taking advantage of children who had lost their mom and having them cry on screen is very low and disgusting. It is emotional and is an excellent tool that Moore uses to get people more angry and feel sympathy - this is how he makes up for the lack of factual accuracy and research that he should have done before filming a movie.The topic would have been good but after such lies and factual inaccuracies, would you believe any other words he says? I wouldn't.This movie can hardly run for the title 'documentary' as it only contains straight-forward lies and half-truths that is vary far from being informative. This is excellent for a comedy movie but if people actually take what he says to the bank (haha) they are misled into thinking that punishing the bankers and the rich will actually solve anything.And also, a personal point of view - I live in a country that had communism 20 years ago and still is very-very socialistic compared to USA. Corruption is everywhere, people are motivated to steal, not to work and government bureaucracy rots inside every person's mind. Socialism is not only 'respecting pilots and nurses' like MM says, it's so much worse, open up the history books and you will see. Once you defeated socialism in the Cold War and even though I was geographically on the other side, I'm thankful and proud of you, USA. Don't give up on and turn against what you have all fought for an what gives hope to half the world... you're the best country in the world for a reason, and that is democracy, freedom and capitalism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone can critique. It's easy to find problems and yell about them with a megaphone. The hard part is coming up with a solution, something Moore is incapable of doing.Every country in the world has problems with corruption, bribery, unemployment, and inequality - most on a MUCH larger scale than us. The countries that have succeeded in creating a working system with more equality and higher GDP (Luxembourg, Norway) have MUCH smaller populations, and you can't claim their system would work on a greater scale. It's like his "communist bread factory." That's great with 100 employees. Now try having a democratic vote every time an issue needs to be passed with 20,000 employees and offices scattered globally. Not quite the same. Likewise, FDR's speech on giving every American jobs, a house, and a paid vacation sounds great in theory, but where are these magical jobs going to come from?

He makes some good points, but in the end he focuses exclusively on generating outrage without presenting any alternatives. Maybe if he spent more time pushing the audience to action with implementable changes and less time trying to arrest executives, his movie would actually accomplish something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a review of reviews if such a thing is allowed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have not seen this film but I've read the bad reviews on this sight and thought i should point out something. Of the half a dozen bad reviews, who all use nothing but authoritarian arguments, which, as you know, are no arguments at all - of all these bad reviewers, there is only one, who has commented on other films as well, which make these reviewers very suspicious indeed. All in all this is typical for how power operates: Paying people to write bad reviews or write them yourself under different names. The mayor part of these reviewers, with only this review to their name, are thugs just like their employers, who created "jobs" for them. This is just another example of how capitalism works. Capitalism have created jobs: meaningless, non-productive jobs which totally enslave their worker in a fog of nothingness. Capitalism hasn't created a single productive job. Inventors have and most of them are under the shoe of capitalists preventing them to go on making great inventions, since such inventions would lead to the freedom of everyone and not just for a few utterly savage and extremely evil people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Informatively Funny But Purely Idealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is quite enjoyable to watch and you do end up learning a few fun facts here and there. It is very reminiscent in the style of Michael Moore's earlier works like Fahrenheit 9/11 and Sicko. Fun facts I learnt that I didn't know previously: 1. That most members of the US Treasury all previously worked for Goldman Sachs 2. That a US Juvenile Penitentiary was owned and operated by a private organisation sending teenagers for pure profit 3. That companies take out life insurance on their employees so when they die they earn a profitThe movie is insanely funny with references made to Bush and comparisons of Mortgage companies to the Mafia, scamming and hustling people out of their money. The major issues with the movie is that it is trying to sell you the idea that capitalism itself is evil, and the alternative - socialism is a better system. The ending is incredibly weak saying that we should replace capitalism with something good for all people, i.e. democracy. The fundamental argument in the movie is that capitalism has replaced democracy as democracy has been tainted by self-interest. The fact is that self-interest will always exist as it is how we survive, it is programmed into our genes. Booms and busts have occurred throughout history from the Tulip Mania in Europe during 1600's to South Sea Bubble in England during the 1700's to the Dot Com bubble during the 1990's. They cannot be avoided due to the one variable involved, mankind. The emotions of fear and greed will always be prevalent. This is what caused the Sub-Prime Crisis. However one cannot blame the Sellers (i.e. the Mortgage brokers and the banks lending the money) nor the Buyers (the borrowers) as it is in the Sellers nature to sell his/her product/service at the highest price and it is in the Buyer's nature to purchase the product/service at the lowest price. It is not the Seller's fault if the Buyer is uneducated. It is the same as the parable of the scorpion and the frog. It is in the Seller's nature, just as it is in the Buyer's nature. Without capitalism there is no personal ambition, no need to undertake any endeavour because there is no personal gain, there would be only collective gain such as what exists under socialism. There would be no allocation of value. Michael Moore poses the question throughout the movie along the lines of why should a normal worker be paid significantly less compared to a CEO? The answer is purely based upon the value contributed and thus the more value you contribute the larger your share of the pie. The movie becomes frustrating to watch as he tries to argue his point repeatedly. By the end of the movie it becomes so frustrating to watch you'll want to throw up in your own mouth. The film is not a documentary as a documentary is objective. This movie is purely biased and one-sided. To top it off the film itself is a capitalist piece of work. It was made for profit and personal gain, the people involved in the movie will be paid, as too will the companies involved. This in itself is a hypocrisy and flaws Moore's argument to the core. Moore also includes personal relations in the movie and their opinion on capitalism. He includes his father who worked at General Motors and his priest. Once again this is not objective and is purely subjective. Watch the movie purely for entertainment value and maybe you'll learn a few fun facts here or there. Do not expect to be mystified and awed by Moore's intellectual greatness as the movie is flawed to the core. Anyone above a kindergarten education will realise this and understand that this is not a documentary, but purely a movie. The definition of a movie is a capitalist endeavour for entertainment purposes to its audience, for a profit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Moore's and a liberal but I was really disappointed in this movie. There was too much whining and not enough substance. OK so there are a couple of corrupt judges in Wilkes Barre PA -- so that makes the whole system suspect? There are bottom feeders in Real Estate and Goldman Sachs hires all the top Econ grads -- that's news? On the other side of the coin he shows one successful socialist co-op business. Aren't there any more? I wanted to see more alternatives to the usual fascist capitalism that has been wrecking our country. The difference between last November and 1929 is that last November we COULD bail out the banks, so we are in a decline, not a free-fall. If Obama would just end the Middle East wars -- didn't he run on that promise? -- we could bail out everybody and fully fund universal health care for most of North America with what we are flushing down the toilet paying exorbitant salaries to "contractors" (read mercenaries) in Iraq and Afghanistan. Moore made those points but too subtly for American audiences. This one is too hip for the room...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm mad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I went to see this. I saw corporations taking advantage of people, and capitalists exposed as the force of evil in this country. I was mad. I wanted to yell at the screen how I felt. "I'm mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!" I saw families being evicted, because banks force them to take out loans that they can't pay off with ridiculous interest rates. I saw greedy "vultures" buying these homes so they could turn a profit, with no regard for whoever got thrown out on the streets. I saw corporations were taking life insurance policies on their employees, and when they died, the families were deep in debt, but the corporations collected on these "dead peasant" policies. How could a country as great as ours be so evil? Michael Moore's answer: Capitalism. I agreed with him, for a while. Large corporations should not have the ability to do this, and they should be regulated so they cannot. Of course, Capitalism has allowed these people to get to the position where they can influence the law so that they are no longer regulated. Michael Moore, the hero of the film, exposes this "plutocracy". So far, this film was going somewhere. I was struck in a place documentaries often don't hit me, but eventually Moore loses his flame. He starts pushing socialism on us, trying to explain why it would be better than capitalism. People deserve a right to health care, and free education. What he uses as an example of this is horrid. He says that we should be more like Germany, where the government can take over a corporation to create more jobs, and the large corporations/state takes care of those workers. But, we're in America, the land of opportunity. Everyone here has a right to an education, can take out loans if they choose to, and can climb as far up the ladder as they want. He uses the example of pilots, that make only ~$20k a year, and have to work second jobs to do what they love. He tries to make us think, "No wonder they crash planes, they're so underpaid!" but, these are at regional airlines, and ~$20k is the starting salary. If they were ex-military pilots flying on major airlines, then they would probably be making about twice that. Some airline pilots make up to $300k a year!! No, Michael Moore doesn't show us the land of opportunity, he shows us the bottom of the barrel. Those pilots are making very little money, but they are doing what they love. I am sure that they will receive raises at some point, and eventually they'll make it to a commercial airline and make some real cash. In Germany, or other socialist countries, people take tests to see how far in education they can go to maximize production. Somebody who may like piloting may not necessarily be as good at it as someone else, so they might not even get the chance to fly for a living. That's how they save money. Here in America, we have opportunity, and that counts for a lot. On the other hand, there are a lot of terrible, disgusting deals happening with huge corporations. They're robbing us blind, and something needs to be done about it. This is when I saw Michael Moore's agenda. He says that large corporations, the secretary of the treasury, and all of the top politicians are in on this. They try to bail themselves out, by saying that the great depression will come. He shows image after image of Bush trying to get a $700 billion plus bailout passed, but due to the action of the American people, it never does. Then he says that the American people start acting, and got Obama elected. Thank god. But wait: Who passed a $780 billion bailout for large corporations? Obama Yes, that's right it was all Bush's fault(Moore could never stop pointing that out), and now Obama is here to save us, by doing EXACTLY the same thing. I couldn't even tell what he was going for at this point. He wants us to start a revolution, and start asking for our money back. His idea of a revolution was him performing for a camera, pretending to try and go into a bank to make a citizen's arrest, which was exactly what I saw in the advertisements. The only other option he gives us is to vote for Obama, who is supposed to be SO much different than Bush. Who passed the bailout? Obama. Who's expanding troop presence in Afghanistan? Obama. Who appointed Tim Geithner to Secretary of Treasury? Obama. Obama is just as much of a pawn as Bush, but Moore insinuates this is purely because of corporations. I was glad he chose to mention Bernie Sanders. He's someone who really does support Socialism, and could bring it into fruition successfully. However, the problem is much graver than it seems. We are already powerless against these corporations. They will destroy Democracy, and they will use anything to do it. Moore's movie was not life-changing. It was painful at times due to real footage of victims of corporatism, but I think more likely than not, he was just using these people to make another buck, just like a corporation. I doubt his sincerity, and doubt the kind of action he asks for will do anything. He does have some really good points/footage in the first 3/4, so I'll give it a 7/10 for that, but the last quarter was a boner, 0/10. With that I say 5/10 total. So, maybe people will react to this strongly, but Moore pushes their faith in the wrong direction. I WISH people would take action, but they likely won't, and this movie will be the one that keeps pointing people further and further down the spiral. To see a better movie about what is going on in America, Google(video) "Freedom to Fascism".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is timely but not every funny. I really wanted to laugh more about our present economic circumstances. Moore is usually better at showing us the hilarious irony of our situation and how really dumb we are about the things that go on around us. The stories were nice but a little too sentimental, so much so that after awhile I just got tired of hearing them. I was hoping for more on the inside story. We all know what Wall Street and our government have done to the American people, I was more interested in their explanation of what they had done. But I guess maybe all of them refused to appear on camera. If I had been Michael Moore I would have gotten an actor to play them and them and wrote them a very funny skit. Too bad he doesn't know any writers from Saturday Night Live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment with attitude, bias and some flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Capitalism: A Love Story in NYC yesterday and enjoyed it quite a bit. I have seen most of Michael Moore's earlier films and this one is very much in the style of the others. One review quoted on the movie poster called this Moore's "Magnum Opus", but I think that Sicko is a more compelling film. Capitalism is as much notable for what is left out as for what it includes.Michael Moore is foremost an entertainer, and only secondarily an advocate. His point of view is unmistakable, but it's his presentation that makes the movies work. Capitalism opens with scenes of bank robberies in progress, and the metaphor sets up the theme: capitalism has been stolen from us. Moore wants back the happy middle class capitalism he enjoyed as a child. What happened to it?He shows us heroes (FDR) and villains (Reagan, banks) and several stories of the devastation wrought by "bad capitalism" on regular people. We see a family being evicted due to foreclosure, factory workers laid off with unpaid back salaries and kids locked up in a Pennsylvania for-profit facility owned by the sentencing judge. President Carter is called Debbie Downer and President Reagan a spokes-model.Because we are well set up to accept his message by the state of today's economy, it is frustrating that he forfeits so many opportunities to tell a coherent story and provide guidance on how to fix things. Wallace Shawn is chosen to "explain" capitalism (Robert Shiller of Yale or Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia could actually have done so) and "socialism" is suggested as an answer without any explanation of what that might mean other than perhaps higher taxes.Factual and compelling arguments are the coin of the realm of polemic vehicles such as this, but Moore leaves money on the table by not offering some that are well known by economists. For example, our global trade imbalance with China led to China having huge quantities of dollars that they had to do something with. They loaned them to American banks at low interest, leading the banks to greatly expand their lending, which caused relaxation of lending standards, escalation of home prices and a lot of dangerous loans. Economists talked of a "global credit glut" and "record low risk premiums" while the boom was going on, and we know what happened next as the loans started to go bad. This suggests some issues with capitalism that might have added to Moore's argument.Instead, we get yet another replay of Roger &amp; Me as Moore is denied entry to GM, AIG, and Goldman Sachs' headquarters. There is no payoff like the interview ambush of Charleton Heston that closes Bowling for Columbine.You probably know how you feel about Michael Moore movies and this one is unlikely to change your mind. I enjoy them, learn some things and feel a strong sense of outrage. You can't make anything better if you can't see what's wrong with it, and Moore excels at seeing what is wrong and in presenting it in such a way that you get angry. It's a talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore is a fraud and a hypocrite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moore's latest film takes the position that capitalism is evil, big corporations are soulless greedy entities, and strongly hints that socialism is the way to go.Moore conveniently fails to mention or even acknowledge that he is part of the very system he is criticizing. He has produced a product for sale and expects it to generate income. He is out to make a profit just like any other business owner. Does he guarantee his employees a job for life with free health insurance and a yearly paid vacation? I doubt it. Yet, he expects the government to provide these same things to it's citizens.The film discusses the recent bailout of the banking industry, the problems in the mortgage industry, and provides examples of some questionable corporate practices such as employers taking out life insurance policies on their employees and a youth home that was being sent patients by a local judge. However, these are not indictments of capitalism as a form of economic organization.If Moore wants to take on the problems of corporate greed and government corruption, fine. Those are certainly issues worth discussing. But they don't have anything to do with whether or not capitalism is evil. And, for Moore to hint that socialism is somehow more effective and humane shows that he is ignorant of history and does not really understand what he is talking about.</fullReview>

He has done Americans the greatest favor since the start of unions. We might just see a shock wave roll over America. People might get up from this movie and act, and some of those will become the new leaders, and change will come, eventually. The gutsy manner in which Michael tackled people and objects is both funny and exciting. There are stories that will cut to your core. If you are prone to anger, bring a sock to bite on.

		<shortDescription>Bashing and trashing - left and right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see or hear someone bashing conservatives or bashing liberals, It's a safe bet they are operating in the spirit of pure self interest. This applies as much to Michael Moore as it does to Rush Limbaugh. But self interest is not a sin. It's a personal tool that supports personal as well as community survival and progress. Michel Moore is surviving very well with this tool and is probably supporting the survival and progress of others. Another tool, community cooperation, is a social tool that aids in survival and progress of the community and its individuals. Recognizing self interest and cooperation both as useful tools and employing them in balance is smart. Imagine two teams of carpenters, one with saws the other with hammers. Will they build a better house by recognizing the value of both saws and hammers, or by insisting that the other team has the wrong tool??Treating self interest and cooperation as icons for the purpose of identifying friends and enemies is less than constructive. (Extreme examples: Hitler - Stalin) Let's hope viewers of Capitalism ... are struck by the need for balance, not pushed to one pole or another.</fullReview>

When it comes to how the middle class has suffered in the current recession, and the wealthy have prospered, Moore is unparalleled in driving home the thesis that short of a voter revolt, the rich class may win the war.Despite Moore's consummate showmanship?he inter-cuts old footage from the Depression and uses music such as Woody Guthrie's to solidify his points?he hasn't made the impact that his Roger and Me (about GM's poor treatment of its workers) did twenty years ago or Bowling for Columbine did seven years ago. Perhaps I'm too used to his intrusive interviewing style (although he's restrained in Capitalism), or this time around he has picked a topic we've intimately lived through, so there are no surprises.He still can discomfit as he does with the story of the juvenile correction facility owned and operated by a private company which paid a judge to send minor offenders to its jail. Moore's point about the clash between capitalism and democracy needs no further parsing. However, we do need suggestions for remedies from him.At times, Moore seems to be the only voice crying out for the rights of the people in difficult financial times. Well, he's not; for instance Warren Buffett laments the dominance of his wealthy class while he leads an austere life, and Moore lives a comfortable life, thank you.At the close of the documentary Moore says, "I refuse to live in a country like this, and I'm not leaving." He cannot live in such a country as he's described for the last two hours, but he's not leaving. Once again he speaks for many of us who are outraged at the excesses of Congress and the wealthy but choose to stay and fight another day because this is still the best country in the world and worth fighting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like our free enterprise system. I appreciate how people, from all walks of life can achieve and advance their dreams. Like Moore himself has done...on the wings of capitalism. I like being free and paying my own way. I don't want a socialistic system. I don't even want to entertain a discussion point on whether we should have the government provide everything. What do I want at Moore's movie? Entertained! Pure and simple. I lived in England for 4-l o n g years and witnessed first hand, the lack of drive and motivation; the vanishment of motivation; the government run television and radio stations...at a time when we were starving (as it were) for good, American music of the 60's and 70's, when pop-pirate radio stations off the coast of England, in international waters gave us what we wanted, with the British government trying to electronically block their signals, remain in control of EVERYTHING and stiffle progress, and oh...TAX the British people to an obscene, 65-70% rate! I don't want that in my America. When YOU come up with an idea...I want to be able to evaluate for myself and not have some government yokel decide for me, whether I can have your service or product. And that's EXACTLY were socialism leads! Now, to be sure, I'm sick of the tremendous greed infiltrating all aspects of our lives here, in the fields of health, finance, energy (oil companies), sports, politics, entertainment! I'm sick of the fact some CEO can work for 8-weeks and be paid a $60M bonus. That needs fixed...before it destroys what we have here, no doubt. But, let's not sell the farm or sell out our founding forefathers or the many tens of thousands who have died in wars, sacrificing their very lives for this country and for the freedoms it has blessed our lives with! Moore is one of the biggest benefactors of capitalism. Just look at his ugly, fat gut. He eats good. In fine restaurants everywhere. His bank accounts and pockets are filled with tons of cash. He loves capitalism! If not by his words...but by the results of his actions. I didn't go see Sicko. I don't agree or listen to his rants on republicans or whatever.

		<shortDescription>A painful 2 hours.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While my car was in for routine service, I took in a movie, Michael Moore's latest oeuvre, "CAPITALISM ? A LOVE STORY", a painful two hours.Opening with vignettes of people being evicted from their foreclosed homes, in one case 7 police cars pull up to a home with four occupants who show no evidence of resistance or violence. At another house the man complains to the sheriff that he was told he had 30 days to vacate. "No," says the sheriff showing him an eviction notice effective immediately.In Pennsylvania two judges are sent to jail (HURRAY!). They ordered a county owned juvenile detention center demolished. It was replaced by a new private detention center. Owners received handsome remuneration from the county for each inmate. The judges began an express train of juveniles sentenced to serve time there. Juveniles who were interviewed in the film said, one had a court appearance lasting a total of 2 minutes, another 4 minutes. No defence arguments were heard, no mitigation of the crime or misdemeanor allowed. One girl was sentenced for 6-9 months. Keepers were allowed to extend a sentence without a hearing. She was kept there for 18 months. The judges got a percentage of the take.Moore goes to Wall Street asking for an explanation, "What are derivatives? What are credit default swaps?" Traders brush him off. Consulting academic experts, one professor fills a blackboard with mathematical formulae that would befuddle Einstein.He interviews the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, asking where are the billions of dollars Congress gave financial institutions to prevent economic collapse of America. She says, simply, "I don't know!" "But," says Michael, "You are the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee!" She answers, "There was no requirement that financial institutions respond to inquiries or provide financial reports!" And now for the really SCARY part. Captain Sully Sullenberg, hero of Eastern Airlines Flight 1549, the pilot who landed in the Hudson River January 15, 2009 saving the lives of all 155 passengers, the man who checked the isles of the aircraft (TWICE!) as it was slowly sinking to be sure no one remained on board, testifies before congress. His main concern is airline safety. Not unrelated is the problem of continuing cuts in pilot salaries, to the point where pilots are telling their sons and daughters NOT to choose their father's profession. (Much like doctors.) By this time, a large number of congressmen have departed, leaving a nearly empty hearing chamber. A tragic case in point was the small computer plane which crashed on landing in Buffalo NY killing all 50 passengers and crew. Recorded on the approach was the conversation between the pilot and co-pilot commiserating on low salaries, a senior pilot now earning LESS THAN THE MANAGER OF A TACO BELL! The co-pilot, a young woman earning $14,000 to $16,000 a year (depending on overtime), says she has a second job after finishing her flight working as a waitress in a café. Terribly sad and plain frightening for us as passengers.I have published this capsule review to save you time and money. The film, unlike "Sicko" and his other movies, is almost devoid of his usual brand of humour. Any lighter moments seem merely retreads of his previous patterns and lame by comparison. So it is heavy going and depressing.My cell phone rang. My car was ready. If it had been done sooner, I might have walked out earlier. The movie gets one star (out of 10) for entertainment.For a strong, frightening and painful dose of reality, 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Are our citizens so ignorant of American history that they have forgotten the meaning of the Constitution, the sacrifices made in the Revolutionary War to make this country free.Michael Moore doesn't want you be patriotic about your country, because it is easier to control people that are not. I say reject this propaganda garbage and let Michael Moore cozy up to Fidel Castro by himself.

		<shortDescription>Capitalism - A Lesson In Economics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Moore clearly failed his high school economics class, he cannot decipher Socialism from Capitalism. So I am writing a concise lesson for him and his supporters.There are three major economic systems - Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism.In Capitalism people have private property and control the means of production, and exchange goods and services in the free market. There is NO government control or ownership over means of production, everything (including the monetary system) is privatized. The United States, is therefore not a true Capitalist Nation. Capitalism produces the highest standard of living out of all the economic systems.In Socialism the government controls monitors and owns most of the means of production. They regulate prices, wages, and exchanges. There is however some privatization. Socialism produces a lower standard of living than Capitalism. The majority of the population is lower middle class that has been enslaved by the state. Nazi Germany is an example of Socialism.In Communism the government controls and owns everything. There is no private property. Communism, like Socialism is often brought about through the use of force. The goal of Communism is to make everyone equal, however attempts of Communism have only made everyone poor. Communism produces the lowest standard of living out of all economic systems.The United States of America is no longer a Capitalist Nation, and it hasn't been since the socialist policies of the New Deal, which only deepened and prolonged the great depression. World War II was the reason the United States came out of the Great Depression.This film is a half-hearted attempt to demonize Capitalism, when in fact the United States is more Socialist than it has ever been. Michael Moore attacks what he calls "Capitalism" which is really SOCIALISM, under the guise of Capitalism.Want proof? Take the recent bailouts to AIG and other corporations by the government for example. These are examples of Socialism, where the government steps in and "helps", by using the tax payers money. In true Capitalism, these corporations would be at the mercy of the free market, and they would have to pay for their poor decisions. There would be no government intervention to ensure the CEO's get their bonuses.Not convinced yet? Take the housing market crash for example. The rise in the housing market was brought upon by the Government. The government flooded the housing market with subsidized loans for low-income housing. These loans were federally insured, thus the corporations had no risk in lending to low-income, poor credit individuals. So when these individuals over-extended themselves, bought houses they could not afford, and defaulted on the loans, their homes got foreclosed. Yet again another example of Socialism, not Capitalism. In true Capitalism, these loans would likely have never been made, or would have been at such high interests rates that the individuals simply could not afford them. There would have been no boom, and no subsequent bust.Human beings are competitive in nature, and instinctively look after their own enlightened self interest. Michael Moore is no exception, he profits from his films. Moore exploits people and distorts facts for financial gain. He presents himself in a manner that makes him appear to have the interest of the American people at heart, but he does not. He is simply after your money. Do yourself a favor and pass on this economically incorrect piece of propaganda. Stand up for your freedom and liberty while you still can.To jrfinkel - Thank you for your ignorance. I am sorry that because YOU don't agree with centuries of economic history and fact it automatically makes classical economics incorrect. I would expect someone from Chicago to be a little more educated on the subject. After all this is the home of the prestigious Chicago-Schoolers! Milton Friedman, ever heard of him? Of course not you believe in a free-lunch, and would rather read Marxist fiction than economic history and fact. Human beings ARE competitive in nature, and this does NOT inherently make them evil! Try reading Ludwig Von Mises - The Impossibility of Rational Economic Calculation in a Socialist Commonwealth. Do yourself a favor and read theories from several economic schools of thought (Chicago School, Keynesian, Supply-Siders, Austrian, etc) then post your opinion, don't cite one because it's all you know and has NEVER worked. As for my definitions of the economic systems I could go in great detail, for a long, long, time, but I had to "dumb it down" for Mr. Moore and the other "Marxists" out there to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so here's the lowdown, before jumping to dry conclusion:1) In this picture, Michael Moore is REALLY MAKING A FOOL OUT OF HIMSELF!Putting yellow crime scene tape around NYSE and standing in front of AIG building with the money bag is plain stupid, no matter how you slice it. Yes, he is populist, not academic, however, even a media person must make constructive argument to generate interest from a rationally thinking human being.Moreover, by acting this way he is actually alienating his would be supporters. NY Times and New Yorker magazine - not exactly bastions of conservative power - are not generous in their reviews of the film.2) For the love of God, when will we ever learn to take things seriously? This means NOT fast tracking through mortgage applications, before signing your name for a hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt. Or actually going to the library or Google to learn SPECIFIC things about financial instruments, interest rates, economic bubbles and so on, as opposed to getting your knowledge from dumbed down CNN reports.If even half of us did that, trust me, the world would be a BETTER PLACE. Confiscating AIG's executive bonus will not do, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The communist Michael Moore is back, with more Marxist propaganda!,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly think that Michael Moore gives Democrats a really bad name. He always attacks the United States and gives his point of view which is always Marxist in thinking.Take for example a few years ago when he was promoting his film, Sicko on CNN, he blatantly attacked the network's health care expert, Sanjay Gupta, who shot down many of the points presented in Moore's film, and instead of graciously accepting some of the doctor's viewpoints, Moore went on a complete fit about how the network was distorting his viewpoint.That is why Moore is a complete hack, and his new film, Captialism, plays like a broken record of the same left wing viewpoints that he's shoved around the country for the past 20 years.As usual, he blames Americans for the downfall of the American dream, stating that hard working people should be punished because his home city of Flint Michigan has been hit hard in the recession, he attacks many corporations, and his viewpoints makes it easier for Republicans to attack Democrats on many economic viewpoints.Michael Moore is a complete hypocrite who refuses to debate the real issues and that's why a similar film, which is a must see called Michael Moore hates America, absolutely upsets him.That's why Moore's new film, Captialism, is a complete joke, he blames Republicans for the current economic crisis, when Democrats have their own share of the blame for the mess we are in as well.Michael Moore is the hypocritical limousine liberal. (He preaches socialism, but makes millions off of his products, so, his success is a result of CAPTIALISM!) This moron spews out his Marxist/Communist rhetoric yet he lives in a million dollar penthouse in New York City. I think that Moore should give ALL of his money to the poor and then maybe I would take this fat slob a little seriously, until then, the man lies about everything! Michael Moore is a joke, and that's why no one takes him seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone understand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean has anyone that gave this over 7 stars ever actually read into anything. Yes, 1% of population has most of the money but that 1% pays for 95% of all taxes and create thousands upon thousands of jobs. Its always one sided with moore and always a flashy cut. This movie just reinforced the idea that moore does not appreciate America nor does he realize what people did to gain the freedom that he wants to take away. Can someone who liked this movie please read the constitution!??!?!?!?!Moore's next movie should Constitution: a love story because he seems to hate it.And why wont he leave, if he hates it soooo much. I still don't understand his argument?!?</fullReview>
