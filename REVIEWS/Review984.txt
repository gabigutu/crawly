		<shortDescription>Great movie, good story. Who doesn't like fighting robots??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw an advanced screening on Sept 22. I thought it was going to be another one of those cheesy, campy, not really believable, warm fuzzy, type of underdog/rags to riches movies. I was actually surprised. It had some great plot twists, it had a real story line. And while yes, there is some language sprinkled throughout, it did make a good family movie for older kids, 10+ (my opinion). The ending wasn't quite what I was expecting, but looking back I think I liked it better for that. Who wants an ending they can see coming the entire movie?It had some great comedy moments. The relationships between the actors felt genuine and not overdone or forced. The robot animatronics was good. The robots themselves were fun and imaginative and definitely made me wish we really had this sport. I would so be there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving cheering is an excellent movie. It is like Rocky on adrenaline and with a whole lot better acting. Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo all have great performances. Dakota who plays the son really makes the movie, but all the actors performances are great. The guy who thought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead. Real Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a long time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Real Steel" is the cheesiest movie I've seen in quite some time. After a promising start, flick starts getting over confident in telling its story. A Story we've already seen before in "Rocky" and its many clones.Set in a future where the only difference seems to be fighting robots. Hugh Jackman plays an out off work boxer and grade A a**hole, who is hopeless at getting new robots fighting. Jackmans life is supposedly turned around when the son he abandoned as a baby turns up and helps in finding an old robot, who ends up being great in the ring.As I wrote above, the film starts off well. Jackmans playing a character that only cares about money and winning until the kid turns up. Even the kids doing well until he starts teaching the robot how too dance (and yes he even teaches him "the robot," sigh!) and like most over confident child actors, becomes the irritating c*cky kid in the movie.I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that the old robot wins and Jackman ends up caring about more than just himself by the end off the flick, but the way they go about this is seriously corny, and the way in which Jackman started out makes me not want too root for him so much by the end.Overall the films story maybe isn't as predictable as you'd think, and is saved from a worst rating by this, and its light sprinkiling off funny moments and cool robot designs. Round one though is better than round two. Which seems determined to out-do "Rocky" and all its many imitators, in an attempt to win the award for corniest movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much when I saw this movie - and I'm not really a fan of movies where kid's are the lead - but, I was pleasantly surprised with this one.Even though this was a "formula / underdog" type of movie, it had me cheering for Atom, Hugh Jackman was great and so were the cast of characters.The CGI was excellent, I really connected to the characters, and it was just a fun, guilty-pleasure (c'mon, boxing robots - who DOESN'T want that !) type of movie.Not quite "A Space Odyssey:2000" but then again, it's not supposed to be.FUN. ENTERTAINING. GREAT ACTION.Recommended !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only found out this movie was a Spielberg production when i saw it on screen. I immediately knew i'd be faced with a lot of cheap kodak moments and teary-eyed kids wrapped in a formula of family-fun Steven has been repeating since ET.I wasn't wrong. But i had no idea how bad it was going to be. At least Goonies 2, i mean... Super 8, managed to actually be entertaining. This movie has no surprises, it's just predictable turn, after predictable turn.The acting is terrible across the board, but i can't blame the actors for not putting an effort into such a depressing tale. Goyo is a promising talent, unfortunately the lines he was given are so out-of-character and cheesy for a kid his age, no amount of talent could be convincing. He likes Robot boxing and he's so into video games he's even fluent with Japanese, but he's no nerd, he's all grown-up and can haggle like a moroccan couscous salesman on a couscous black Friday, and to top it all off he looks like the coolest kid ever, even though his mom has just died days ago. And, like that's not horribly incongruent enough, he spends half of the movie showing off his dancing skills like a Bieber wannabe. That's one seriously schyzophrenic kid!But the bad acting and atrocious storytelling doesn't end there. Some of the people in Real Steel are more cartoonish than the robots: Ricky, Tak Mashido, Farra, look like villains out of a Disney Channel Show. Most of the footage of James Rebhorn and Hope Davis should've stayed on the cutting room floor. They are lost on screen, clearly with no chemistry as a couple and not enough lines on the script to work with. Every time they're interacting on screen you can actually crack a laugh at how they flay their arms at each other clueless, like two crash-test-dummies in slow motion. But the way they keep awkwardly eyeballing Hugh Jackman during every lousy dialog like they're asking to be put out of their misery just makes you terribly sad again.The final scene with everyone crying in rapture at Hugh Jackman performing video-fitness, had me ripping hair out of my head! I'm in awe of all the positive reviews this movie is getting. Either this movie premiered on IMDb's opposite day, or i had no idea this site had such a huge userbase of 9 year olds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a little gem Real Steel could have been. Well before its release, and before any intricate plot details became known, this sounded like an intelligent film in which robots are forced to engage in brutal fights for the entertainment of their human masters. Where the story would've gone from there is left to the imagination, but it appeared to have all the makings of critically acclaimed, self-conscious science fiction. The final product differed heavily from initial expectations, however, and we are left with a hollow, albeit bearable alternative prompting those such as myself to ask: What could have been?In the very near future (2020, according to director Shawn Levy) the human art of man-to-man combat has become obsolete. One-time fighters have been replaced by robots that do the dirty work while their human controllers reap the rewards. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is one such promoter, recently down on his luck and who lives not for the bright lights, but to make just enough money to survive. At this most inopportune time, he is forced to take care of his estranged son (Dakota Goyo), whose burgeoning friendship with an outdated sparring 'bot named Atom convinces Charlie to give the big time one last shot.For a movie that has the skeleton to accommodate exploring the concept of human qualities in machines, a la Blade Runner or Artificial Intelligence, as well as (warning: pretentiousness ahead) the theme of 'ethics and morals of humanity', it actually does everything it can to avoid those topics entirely. My hopes for such a film were all but dashed with the casting of a child- a sure sign that the story would be strictly focused on Max and Charlie's relationship, and in that respect the plot seems unnecessarily restricted. This results in an inherently out-of-place scene in which Atom, all alone before a big fight, gazes into a mirror as if to question his existence. Its inclusion into the final cut is sure to whiz above the heads of its pre-teen target audience, while more mature viewers might interpret it as a cheap attempt to inject some heart far too late into the story.Indeed, its family-friendly status is the biggest letdown of Real Steel. At the forefront is the misguided characterisation of Charlie's son, who is portrayed as, in my opinion, a spoiled brat who's so cocksure of himself all the time that a little part of you wants to see him fail. The child as an authority figure may appeal to those of Max's age, but it detracts from the contrasting, gritty realism of Jackman's character, and shuts down any hope of character-based realism in the process. Other attempts to please the male tween market include obvious allusions to toy lines and video games, as well as a mind-boggling assault of product placement, which becomes more than a little irritating during the second half.The script is not disastrous. The writers dabble in clichés occasionally, but not quite to the point where it numbs the mind. On a more negative note, the screenplay does allow for an assortment of cringe-worthy moments (which some might call 'heart-warming', depending on personal perspective) that include dancing robots and the introduction of more than one excessively cartoonish side character, again limiting the level of engagement one can make with this movie.The action set pieces in the film were visually pleasing, exploiting a decent amount of camera angles to give the viewer an intriguing look into the mechanics of robot rumbling. The CGI is impressive, and the clunky (as opposed to slick) movements of the robots actually work well, reflecting what a realistic fight between two heavy machines would look like. Jackman does his best as always, but he alone can't salvage a once-promising prospect that instead settles for being the very definition of blockbuster mediocrity.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No splitting this Atom, it has got a rock solid heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is directed by Shawn Levy and collectively adapted to the screen by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven from a Richard Matheson short story called Steel. It stars Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.Set in the near future, robot boxing is a big crowd pulling sport. After a struggling robot operator is introduced to an 11-year-old son he has never known, they stumble upon a discarded robot at a junk yard....We can all moan about the mimicry of an idea and the clichés that dominate Real Steel, but you really got to hand it to the makers for what they have achieved. They have crafted a family film that's perfect in this day and age. The story is one that any adult Sylvester Stallone fan can acknowledge and appreciate, the human heartbeat pleasingly steady, while the premise of big colourful robots beating the crap out of each other delights youngsters and us adults who are young at heart. Film pretty much does what any other film of this type does, lays on the syrup in the last quarter where second chances and family strife come thundering through the plotting. Undeniably it's hugely derivative, events are joystick operated to get an emotional response from a family audience, while product placement reins and the script often sags under the weight of unoriginality. But it does uplift the spirit and getting to the end is easy since it's so much berserker fun. Yes it's Atom the people's champion, yes it's David V Goliath and yes! It's Balboa V Creed. Nothing wrong with that really.The cast don't really have to offer up much beyond being adequate within the context of the material, though a muscular Jackman finds good paternal chemistry with young Goyo. In fact Goyo is pleasingly not annoying, always a bonus is that. Inevitably the robots are the stars, they're a triumph of design and visual effects and a sight for sore eyes, while Levy has a good handle on staging the fight sequences; even when cribbing from Balboa. The near future look is terrific as well, with Fiore's colour photography very appealing. Coining in over $290 million at the worldwide box office (over ?180 million in profit), Real Steel found the family audience it was looking for, proving once again that there is a market for simple and effective popcorn carnage. It's not high art or intelligently scripted, but was anyone seriously thinking that was going to be the case here? If you want brains with this premise then seek out Twilight Zone episode "Steel", starring the excellent Lee Marvin, otherwise just sit back and enjoy the ride and let the botty bots and human interest raise the pulse and gladden the heart respectively. 7/10Home format release is a sparkling print, extras are annoyingly short but the blooper reel is fun, we get a stunt deconstruction, and we learn about the influence a certain Mr. Spielberg had on the production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am against Corny/Cheesy Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had low expectations and I am sure many people did so too, however I did rather quite enjoy the movie for various factors in which I will List: Every scene had purpose - No pointless scenes which have no impact on the audience. The Ending - Original and Motivating, showed it had a moral to the story (If you watched the movie, you would know)HOWEVER, unfortunately the kid put me off immensely. I appreciate his confidence in acting but his screaming and his cheesy lines were just off putting. I also noticed that his technological understanding was ridiculously high, which is rather unrealistic...And that is an understatement.That being said, I can sense a 'Real Steel 2' and would hope it turns out as good as this first one. Sequels are very hard to perfect especially for this movie, but I digress.This movie is worth watching and if you plan on watching it, be sure to prepare your tissues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been waiting to see this movie for a long time, saw it today and it was worth all the wait.The move has a perfect blend of emotions, Robo-fight(very Importantly not over done) and some comic scenes, what else do you want? For me the robot fighting was great. Have been following Huge Jackman's movies off late and all have them have been good including this one. But apart from all of that the movie has an embedded message that there are things that sometimes you can not handle or overlook when you have other priorities but you can always make things right, it may be hard but it can be done.The kid Dakota Goyo did a good job as well.So I would say go out there and see the movie, worth every penny that you will spend for the ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out well enough, hugh jackmann at his best: quietly driving a truck along a dusty road. his character, Charlie, is the cliché boxing, two-timing douche-bag roadrunner type, in this case set in a futuristic time (although the only futuristic pieces in the movie are robots and cellphones, and a truck that for some reason has windows where the driver's feet are), where robots do the boxing for you. Charlie is trying to win fights with the robots he buys or puts together from scraps, but does not demonstrate any skill, interest or dedication. He gets distracted and has no heart for the machines he uses. When he gets the news that his ex-girlfriend dies, he shows no emotional reaction, except for trying to swindle her rich sister for the custody of their only son, which he agrees to take on for a summer in order to receive a paycheck. The rest we can predict from here, and does not deviate from our most boring projections. What could have been nice about this movie? almost everything. The script could have been smarter, funnier, sharper. The characters feel unnatural, especially the lead Charlie. He doesn't seem to know is he's a good guy or just a loser going along with the success of others. In a good movie, the protagonist classically undergoes a life-changing transformation, in this case the bonding of father and son, which changes the father's attitude towards life in general. However, the change has to be believable. In this case, it lacks severely. When willing to forgive the corny story, the action also leaves a lot to complain. Where is the cool slow-motion tearing apart of metal? where is the cool martial arts / mma type fighting? the makers could have gone completely NUTS on this, but instead it's not very exciting. BAD, BAD, BAD. Want action and entertainment? not here..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't lead us down the road of "coolness"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My response to Real Steel is almost parallel to Hugh Jackman's reaction to the robot fighter Atom in the film. Upon initial advertising and trailers, I wasn't impressed by the film one bit. It looked like another film that glorified the "coolness" of robots, and then tried to tack on a contrived story of a father and son relationship. Never did I believe I'd see it and actually award it a positive score. Just like in the film where Jackman doesn't believe Atom has what it takes to be a successful fighter, and then is greeted with a rude awakening.The film takes place in the near future, 2020 according to director Shawn Levy, where human boxers have been replaced by large metal monstrosities that do the dirty work while the humans occupy the controls and the commands for them. Charlie Kenton (Jackman), a former boxer, now spends his days using the robots to fight, but finds himself in a rough patch of failures.After being informed his ex-girlfriend has died, whom he had a child with, Charlie must now take care of the kid for three months until his aunt and uncle return from their second honeymoon. The kid is eleven year old Max, played efficiently by Dakota Goyo. The two meet awkwardly, but experienced moviegoers like myself know that these two will soon become a cheerful father and son duo.During a junkyard visit where Charlie and Max are searching for new parts for their robot, they stumble upon Atom, a small, yet relentlessly strong bot who is abandoned but still able to fight. They repair him, and then discover that with voice recognition and shadow effect, where the robot mimes the moves of a human) that he is a bot with a strong amount of potential for success. The rest of the film depicts the father and son's efforts to take Atom all the way to the championship.The digital effects work very well together, and are much more eye appealing than the similar ones used in the Transformers series. For one thing, the fight scenes are coherent, entertaining, and extremely well scored by Danny Elfman, who this time gives us some delightfully different music.The robots are captured using a variety of digital techniques. Some are animatronic, some are used through motion capture animation, where actors get fitted for special suits and imitate the motions of the character, and some just plain ol' CGI. All of these three techniques are blended very well together, and make for a very entertaining visual spectacle. Even the motion capture isn't as sketchy and glitchy as it normally is. In Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 it was clearly jerky and underdeveloped, in Mars Needs Moms, this same year, it was unnecessary and obtrusive, but here, it seems the effects team has gotten their act together.I think the only fault here is the screenplay. but what makes it a bit better is the fact that the cast approaches it with optimism and the mentality that they will "make it work." Jackman certainly does, pulling off a sleazy, ignorant father who grows to appreciate his son and his job a bit more, and Dakota Goyo, like I said before, hits almost every note just right. The problem is the screenplay hammers us with several movie clichés we've seen many times before. The rags to riches story has shown itself many times, not to mention one's rise from humble beginnings to a successful career. At least Real Steel recognizes the movies it's paying homage to, like the whole end scene that slightly mirrors Rocky.Director Shawn Levy has successfully made success out of two underdogs; the film itself and Atom. His previous flicks like Just Married and Night at the Museum were lightweight innocent features that failed to include anything on the same level as Real Steel. By the end, the film had given me a feelings I like to possess when I come out of a film I thought was going to be lackluster; reassured and surprised.Starring: Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo. Directed by: Shawn Levy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2 hours WASTED!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when this flick ended the only thing that would cross my mind was "at least it was not the worst way to spend 2 hours of my life". coming to rethink of it though, i can't recall of any worse. arguing with some civil servant over bureaucracy to get some paper issued is actually more fun.let's see what i can recall of this film to justify my point. 1. the father; a 35+ y.o ONCE-talented boxer who ALMOST won to the world champion.a. decides to take on robot-boxing at which he SUCKS yet he still gets to fight (?!?!) b. has a relationship with his trainer's hot daughter ... NO WAI! c. repeatedly loses money yet he still gets to spend more(wanna know how. got jealous at this point) d. has abandoned his ex-gf when pregnant and now she's dead decides to sell the custody of his son to the boy's rich aunt (life's a bitch :P) but he still gets to keep the boy temporarily for some lame reason. 2. the son; dislikes his father at first (but why?!?!) a. has a flair at playing video-games, hence controlling fighting robots (the movie's point not mine) b. believes the 40 y.o robot he finds for his father at some junkyard has potential (seriously?). more than that, he comes to believe that the robot has a soul (yep). c. reprogrammes the robot (most 11 year olds actually do that, no biggie. at 11 i reprogrammed a satellite)3. the trio (father-son-robot); win fights, get admitted to the world championship and ALMOST win the fight to the most advanced robot EVER made and manage NOT to get wasted from round 1 'cause as foretold the robot's got a soul (my 1996 Cyrix can beat your i7 EASY, apparently it has more SOUL) 4. they all live happily ever after and the whole world loves them (you didn't expect that did you?) there have to be even more clichés which i refuse to recall. god i seriously need to somehow delete those memories from my brain ... any 11 y.o. interested in doing that for me?

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that something is happening to IMDb's credibility. If you see the reviews on the "Immortals" you'll think the distribution companies are trying to deceive people. Same here.I gave this movie a 6 after much thought cause a) The robots looked real and b) I'm a nice guy.I'm not saying it is that bad. You won't get bored and it is not as stupid as it could have been if you know what I mean. It's that there is NOTHING ORIGINAL about this movie. Every scene till the ending, we, as viewers, have chewed and swallowed over and over again. I would have mentioned a few examples but i don't want to spoil the movie for some. Read all the other negative reviews if you like.Plus, what's the deal with the kid people saying he acts good etc? He's not so bad but I am really surprised that so many people mention how good he is in their reviews and almost no one is saying that he does not sound like an 11 year old talking. He reminded me of Justin Bieber to give you an idea who they probably had in mind when they wrote the script.I am also surprised that although many refer to movies they copied in this one, no one mentions an 80's anime called "Plawres Sanshiro" which to me is obviously where they took the idea from. Maybe this anime was not released in the west.So, if you are stoned and have nothing else to do, you can watch it but keep in mind that it is in my opinion one of these movies that will very soon be forever lost and forgotten in the sea of uninspired movies that Hollywood pays it's lackeys to serve to us.p.s. There is no way the last fight's outcome was fair!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heart Of Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on what everybody said, Real Steal is like Over The Top plus Rocky with Robots. Over The Top because there's a man, his son, and a truck. Rocky because it's obvious. Put these films together and add robots and minus Stallone. Real Steel is not very innovating though but it's excitingly great and has plenty of heart. It's also the return of Hugh Jackman although we just saw him a little last June. There are lot of things to recommend in Real Steel.The premise isn't really that intriguing. It's boxing replaced by robots. Films with Giant CGI Robots are not innovating since we have Michael Bay's Transformers. But the heart and soul lies to the relationship of Charlie and Max and their robot, Atom. It's fun to watch them. The fighting scenes are pretty exciting. That is what most underdog fighting movies do. The only problem here is the weak major antagonist. It's not really that threatening or a big deal. Ricky was more threatening than the gigantic Zeus.The filmmaking is pretty decent. Well shot scenes. The CGI robots and the music score are good enough. Nothing to say about the production design except Charlie's truck. It looks fascinating for some reason. The performances were great. We don't see Hugh Jackman in action movies after two years and there's a small cameo of him, flipping off two characters(it's obvious but I won't tell you the title). Here in Real Steel, Jackman is energetic and somewhat perfect for the role. Dakota Goyo is a bit charming. Chemistry of him and Jackman shines through the film. It's fun to watch them together.There aren't much new here in Real Steel but in the end, it's enjoyable and has plenty of heart. The climax isn't so much overwhelming but it intends to be more heartfelt. Again, it's like Over The Top which the father is trying to make his son proud and Rocky because it's boxing and add some robots in it. Even without thinking much about the robots, there is always human heart in this film. Hugh Jackman does it again. The underdog fighting movie genre does it again. It's really a fun film for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very rare that I don't expect much and much less is delivered.The story is complete crap. No details of it makes sense. A fighting robot costs only 50k? A robot from the waste yard can almost kill the undefeated champion? A 11 year old boy can extract a 1000 pound robot ALONE while it is dug up in earth AND about 50 meters down a cliff?Wow...that story was uninspired. The actors were doing their best and you see their potential. But this movie has not only crap story but incredible artificial emotional scenes.I really wonder what possible reason Hugh Jackman or Evangeline Lilly could have had to play in this movie other than a really big load of money.Don't watch this movie, really. Even if you are on of the "I didn't expect anything and so it was cool" guys. It's really not worth your time. If I had not promised to watch this movie with a friend I would have gotten out after 30 minutes max not being any curious what would have happened next.Only nice thing were the animations. Real good work. Soundtrack was really crappy by the way.So 2 stars for the good acting of a real bad story and 1 for the animation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this film was first announced about a year ago, I immediately added to my film schedule months in advance: It had a cool name and hey, it was a movie with robots and the always hot Hugh Jackman! Then the trailer came out, and the story was revealed to be touching family film about a dad and his estranged son with robots thrown in. A sweet family film? Ugh. I immediately took it off my viewing schedule. Then the reviews came out, and even Entertainment Weekly gave it an excellent review, saying that it is actually way better than you would expect. Pair that with big box office, and my curiosity started to come around again. Finally, it got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects, and thus, I no longer had a choice.And I am here to tell you that you should not believe everything you've heard...my initial reaction was wrong, my second one was right: "Real Steel" is a big load of absolute junk.Set in 2020 or something, when boxing has been replaced by robots, Jackman plays Charlie, an ass ex-boxer who impregnated a girl and whose son comes back to haunt him fourteen years later when she passes away. "Forced "to spend a summer with this kid, they realize they bond over boxing robots. Robots, mind you, that seem to FEEL something when they are hit (like, c'mon...).With an absolutely juvenile script that is just as much pieced together from every cliché family movie just as some of these robots are pieced together with junk, "Real Steel" is nothing more than a high-tech Lifetime movie with one of the most preposterous scripts of the year. Every line is meant to tug at your heartstrings and make you feel fuzzy inside when it's not trying to impress you with its mediocre visual effects. It's tries to be nothing but "cute" from start to finish, so saccharine that it quickly ends up nauseating.Right down to the kid using "shadow technology" to make his robot do some silly hip hop dance moves. Like, really? What person over the age of twelve enjoyed this film? "Real Steel" is nothing more than a scrap yard of emotional manipulation that really has no redeeming qualities for any adult. But yeah, your kids will probably like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the near future, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former boxer with an interest in robot boxing. He is struggling for cash and will seemingly give anything to get a robot good enough to raise some funds. Charlie discovers that he has an 11 year old son (Max played superbly by Dakota Goya) but he is not really interested in getting to know him.He signs custody over to the boy's aunt in exchange for cash but Charlie and his son have to spend at least one summer together. They don't get on very well together until Max shows an interest in the Robots. It is a very nice father &amp; son development story and as the film progresses I began to like the characters more and more. The film overall is very entertaining and unique in its own way, it has awesome special effects &amp; the robots all look superb and have cool names. The fighting techniques of the robots are excellent including voice recognition and the ability to copy human movement. The film is very uplifting and has some great character development after a rocky start to their relationships. It is is good, imaginative family fun that boasts an excellent soundtrack to go with the craziness. 9/10 and straight in to my top 10 of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charlie is a douche, kid is annoying, robot fighting cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a loser in robot fighting. His robots are old out of date junkers. His showboating costs him his last robot. When his kid's mother die, he's left with the kid. Not only does he want to abandon the kid, he blackmails the kid's aunt (Hope Davis)'s rich husband (James Rebhorn) holding the kid hostage. Ladies, he's a real keeper.My biggest complaint is that Charlie is a huge douche. Why do they have to go big douche? He could be a loser without being such a horrible douche. He's a douche. Why would I root for a douche? Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) is hot for Charlie. She lets him stay in her gym. The kid (Dakota Goyo) is real mouthy. When he's told his father sold him to his aunt, the big thing he wants is his cut, half of the money. Neither of them are that likable. I guess the point is they grow together. But I lose interest in these characters pretty quickly. I do like the robots thought. Robot fighting is kinda cool. Other than that, there's nothing much to watch this for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badly Clichéd and PG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steel" starring Hugh Jackman and directed by Shawn Levy is an awful clichéd bunch of trite. It reaches into the dozen or so boxing movies in a grab bag of hackneyed and rip-off situations from much better movies. It tries to be original by throwing in robots as the boxers, but ultimately the outcome is more like a bad video game movie. The one where the story gets washed away by unintelligent and patronizing dialog. Hugh Jackman instills some needed energy, and the sci-fi concept has some merit, but the PG script and storyline is steaming turd. An "R" rating, adult script, and tossing out the whole father/son mush would've sharpened the movie some. The music is gawd-awful and brainless with a mix or rock, rap, and cheesy dramatic interludes from a soap-opera, and the romance is perfunctory. Overall bad - not recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman movies, this is what drew me towards this film in the first place. After reading the initial reviews I was very hopeful and was looking forward to watching it. However I was very wrong, I don't understand why it is rated so highly. This movie was awful, most of it made no sense, the acting was really bad at times and there was no structure to the movie. The writer has wasted a great concept which had a lot of potential, this movie was cringe worthy to watch and I found it hard watching it to the end. So I will save you 2 hours of your life by telling you to..AVOID THIS MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive CGI and Poor Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2020, boxing is no longer fought by humans that have been replaced by robots. The former boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) drives his truck to promote fights with his robot Ambush. When he has just lost a fight, he is summoned to a hearing and forced to take care of his unknown eleven year-old son Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo) since his mother has passed away. Charlie loses another fight with the Noisy Boy robot that his girlfriend Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) has just bought and he goes with Max to a junkyard to collect part of robots to build a new one. However, Max finds an old sparring robot named Atom and Charlie teaches him how to fight box. Atom becomes a winner and Max and Charlie becomes closer to each other. However Charlie has an agreement to deliver Max to his aunt and her wealthy husband. "Real Steel" is a film with an impressive CGI but a poor story. The idea of using robots to box is uninteresting and silly, and the relationship of the annoying Max and Charlie is strictly a business and never a father and son love. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Gigantes de Aço" ("Giants of Steel")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a high budget cheesy piece of garbage with boring dialogue, predictable plot and one-dimensional characters that nobody cares for.At first it reminded me of A.I. Artificial Intelligence (which is a brilliant movie), but then as movie went by, I got more and more disappointed. You see, AI was smart, it had a very interesting plot, it had scale, it had interesting characters, interesting dialogue and good humor, it was real good sci-fi. Real Steel has none of that, it's just a bunch of special effects and a few actors who don't give a sh*t about their roles.The worst part is predictability. I could see where movie was going an hour in advance, and that made it just so damn boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Just Rocky With Robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a lot more than just "Rocky" with robots, though it does borrow heavily from the Rocky franchise, and it does have the heart of the first Rocky movie especially, it also has shades of the other Stallone movie "Over The Top" thrown in too. It is great family entertainment that both me and my son loved. Plot In A Paragraph: In the near future, where Robot Boxing is the worlds most popular sport. Former boxer Charlie (Hugh Hackman) struggles to make a living with patched-up robots in dodgy venues. When he unexpectedly has to look after his 11-year-old son Max (Dakato Goyo) for the summer, they go on a road trip, things look up for him as they bond over a robot Max found in the junk yard. Hugh Jackman is a handsome man in great shape, has charisma in spades and also happens to be one hell of a good actor. Dakato Goyo is not as annoying as most child actors in this type of role. Evangeline Lilly is great as Bailey, Charlie's landlord/friend/occasional love interest. All the cast do well in their roles Kevin Durand is perfectly annoying (he does so well, I'm disappointed I never got to see him get his comeuppance) James Rebhorn is as reliable as always and Anthony Mackie is fun in a supporting role too. Though the movie does follow the cliché of the stubborn child, teaching his immature father a life lesson it is very entertaining. A great father and son movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had this movie for quite a long time now, but I thought it was going to be a cheesy film, so I never watched it. What a surprise! Although it feels like a very expensive kid's movie, I have to admit I had not enjoyed any aimed-for-the- adults movie so much for quite a long time. The movie and the outcome of every single match were very predictable (it's a kid's movie after all!) yet it somehow managed to get me all excited. Right now I'm thinking if I've seen a real action movie that came close in delivering this level of joy and excitement???Face/Off maybe. The CGI used here is some of the best I've seen. You can't tell if the robots are real or computer-generated. The actors do a really great job in showing a wide range of emotions, although the ending failed to make me all emotional due to the childish nature of the movie. The fights were really exciting, even though the end result was clear from the start, and this has to be the movie's greatest accomplishment. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who feels he/she can still communicate with the child within.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forced sentiment and uninvolving sports action leaves generally average and predictable noise for children only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's ignore for the minute the fact that this film was pretty much critic proof ? it really didn't matter what was said when it released, those that saw the trailer and thought "two please" were going to be there no matter what to see robots hitting each other. I apologise if that sounds snobby, but I don't mean it that way because in fairness, although I waited for the DVD, I still came to the film prepared to leave my brain at the door and enjoy some family-friendly sports action. Sadly I wasn't quite prepared for how low-level the vast majority of the film is.I'll deal with my personal problem with it first ? the sports side simply isn't exciting. I say that as someone who gets weepy very easily when it comes to sports movies ? the underdog coming good to defeat the champ while the music swells thing pretty much always has me pretending that I need to blow my nose in another room for the next 5 minutes; but yet here? Nothing. The final fight is reasonably good and at least doesn't totally overdo it, but I never felt into the fights, never felt the drama of the or got lost in them as a spectator. And again, at the risk of repeating myself, I say that as someone who was on the edge of my seat during the main fight of Rocky 6. Real Steel doesn't really deliver in this realm and it is a real shame because that is an easy string to pull for the audience.Part of the reason it doesn't work is the fact that it is all special effects. They are very good effects, but they are still special effects and I found myself watching it with a bemused curiosity like I did when Robot Wars used to be on BBC2 on a Friday evening. Indeed, that is how it was for me ? just bemusement rather than investment because the things are not real and never even felt close to being real. This isn't helped by the way the film is as predictable as it is clunky. The direction of the fight story (from junk yard to title shot) is as obvious as the emotional journey (bad relationship to good one) and the writers seem to have struggled to raise their energy for such a predictable trudge, because the dialogue is corny as hell and clunks around the screen more than the robots do. The cast do what they can and I did feel for Jackman working his heart out, but even he struggled to make it work.Of course working with Goyo, he was always in a tough spot because this kid is annoying from start to finish. It doesn't help that Goyo is given dialogue that doesn't suit his character but also he spends most of the film being an ass, just like Jackman has to do; so after a while you realise that while you know where these characters are going, you don't actually like them very much for a big section of the movie. Lilly looks cute, not much else while Mackie gets a nice pay day for doing nothing much.The sequel will come of course and it will be more of the same because it will sell like this one did, however it is hard to not be disappointed with it. OK it is for kids but why does that excuse it from being a good film? The sports action is noisy but heartless and everything else about it is clunky and predictable; the effects look good and technically it is impressive but it just never gets going and it always feels like the producers decided that the concept and the effects would get people in the door, so as long as they deliver on the concept (robots hitting each other) then there is no real need to worry the details (details like character, dialogue, heart and general plotting). Average at best this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I knew it would be bad.. but I didn't think it would be this horrible...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Garbage' is one word that can be used to describe this movie.What started off with mediocre promise just went completely down hill.Getting straight into it, the CG was pretty good. Although not spectacular. You won't be seeing any 250 Million dollar budget Transformers CG but the job was pretty well done. Though I think that the shadows could have been done far better and definitely some of the fight physics. I have an eye for detail and it just bugged me sorry...This movie is basically a small sci-fi melodrama.You have your typical trailer trash main character 'Charlie' (Hugh Jackman) who makes a living pitting his robot boxer against others but back in the day after losing a big title fight and not being that much of a good boxer himself, he naturally has absolutely no self confidence and is nothing but your typical drunk, low-life, slacker etc. We've been here before more times than I could count.Then you have your typical washed up girl 'Bailey' (Evangeline Lilly) who has had feelings for Charlie for as long as she can remember. She's basically the bread and butter of what this movie tries to be in regards to a minor 'romance'. Apart from knowing a bit about Robots, and crying in a few scenes we don't see her do anything at all. I'm serious.Next you have 'Max' (Dakota Goyo) your typical smart-alec 11 year old teen who plays video games and thinks he knows everything about life. He's meant to be the 'reasoning' in Charlie's life. Naturally he dislikes Charlie at the start because the man isn't exactly a father figure and doesn't care about the kid at all to begin with. (Oh man how many times have we all seen this before?) He practically develops a 'bromance' with his robot later on in the movie.To cut a long and terrible story short. Charlie blows all of his money time and time again on making stupid decisions in bouts with his robot. He loses all of his bets like every normal gambler and develops staggering debts. Luck would have it that whilst on a 'salvaging' (stealing) trip to the local dump Max gets into an accident and the arm of a dead robot saves his life. Needless to say Max falls in love with it in an instant, forming feelings somewhat related to 'detachment personality disorder'. Obviously Charlie thinks it's junk and wants nothing to do with it... Ugh... do you want me to keep going? This is all so predictable right? So the robot works and with a bit of tweaking and tons of luck it starts winning fights from the ground up. The space at which this robot goes from utter trash to a winner is within 10 minutes in the movie. It's way too fast and totally skipped. It fits in really badly with the whole story.Robot, Father and Son all begin to bond and go on to win some more fights. However after a big match Father and Son get beaten up by someone Charlie owes money to (we saw that coming way back). So Father decides "Oooh it's too dangerous!!" *roll eyes* so much predictability.On the verge of giving up father Charlie realises what a fool he's been and sets out to make "the only right decision in his life" (Oh god... seriously) They challenge the unbeatable robot 'Zeus' created by a Russian looking woman with an obvious Russian-style name, and your typical Japanese mobster/gangster/genius who has massive anger management issues. Your typical 'bad guy' Duo...Basically they win the fight but lose the decision. The funny thing is this 6th Gen 'Zeus' is shown demolishing amazing robots and is supposed to be able to 'think for itself and see a weakness in every opponent' but it can't remotely stand up to a 2nd Gen sparring bot... Charlie takes the robot into 'manual' mode and basically fights the last round himself. Realising that he really had talent after all. Yeah, give me a break...I also forgot to mention how when you finally get to the last fight against the 'supreme unbeatable robot' they don't even show you the whole 5, 1 minute rounds. You see the first, and the next 3 are sped up in an instant (low budget much?) and then of course you see the last round. Extremely disappointing for anyone watching. Everything has been leading up to that fight, but it was rushed, boring and you didn't even get to see the whole thing. It was like when the Quidditch World Cup was taken out of Harry Potter &amp; The Goblet of Fire movie.Throw in tons of crying, horrible acting. I can't believe the same guy played my favourite character 'Wolverine'... the movie is just so badly put together it's emotionally confusing. It's not a family flick, it isn't a chick flick (my wife hated it), it's not even an action and it surely wasn't really entertaining. Horribly done and when more people watch it and review it properly the score on IMDb will show properly.There is a mountain of 'HP' product placement here as well as Dr. Pepper product placement and well basically the whole movie is just American product placement. Throw in the worst soundtrack to a movie in history.. I mean seriously.. this movie took all the old songs that I listened to in racing games on Xbox and Playstation 2 as well as half the songs from 'Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift!" Seriously really! D- I rate this movie. There are far better things worth your popcorn. If I had seen this in cinemas I would have been very angry at the waste of money. You can tell a movie is bad when it is 'rushed to Bluray'.</fullReview>

You're supposed to fall for the kid who's father is a screw-up but it's hard to feel sorry for a manipulative kid who's no better than his own father. Some have suggested that this is "Rocky" on steroids but the script is anemic at best. The closest you'll get to an emotional connection is to the girlfriend running the gym. At least she knows where she stands! For the rest of the cast, it's like lost sheep. Baah! Seriously, this movie, despite the hype, is one you should take a pass on. There are a lot of much better actions movies out there. If you're into a retro vibe then pick up some James Bond on Blueray, sure to appeal to both men and women. Any of the Jason Bourne (Idnetity, Supremacy, Ultimatum) videos are far better than this piece of tripe. Then again, your mileage may vary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This sci fi "action" film is an entertaining, though still standard Hollywood fare, besides the basic premise, it is completely standard and clichéd ridden, its structure, story and characters are all taken from basic Hollywood models and they follow the standard script by the book. The basic premise of the film is that in the future people like watching joystick robot fights instead of real people fighting, a rather absurd premise, but interesting all the same. Though it also seem rather ludicrous that a massive highly sophisticated machine such as those 3 meter robots would cost less than a car.I would recommend this to someone who likes the ludicrous premise but not to anyone else. I found it to be an enjoyable guilty pleasure, but I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First outing to see Real Steel, I got to witness one of the most extreme examples of poor theater behavior. A family of about 15 sat in the front row, directly in front of me and my wife. Their kids had no interest in the movie, so they ran around and yelled and played. The dad sat at the end of our row talking loudly on the phone, and then about 10 minutes in to the movie plopped down in front of me and had a conversation with his wife who then started texting and talking. I imagine this is what it's like at home for them. I could have taken a hammer to each of their? phones.So we walked out before Atom even makes an appearance.Try number 2: on DVD. No interruptions except to replenish booze supplies and a chance to focus on the part of the movie I completely missed in my blinding rage.To summarize?big robots fight each other for sport. Former sleazy boxer fancies himself a robot fighter. Big bad robot beats everybody. Reality check ? this is just for fun, unless you owe money and then you'll get an unholy beat down at the hands of robotic thugs. The future sure is scary. Sleazy boxer has long lost son, who has a womanly figure and shrieks like one too. Womanly son finds robot, beats many other robots, we all cheer even though in the end nobody changes a single ding-dang thing about themselves. Got it?For being a super-future film full of cool robots, the film sure was predictable. No surprises, except for the final match (although.. I'll explain). Hugh Jackman phones in a random performance as Charlie Kenton, Dakota Goyo acts his heart out but still comes across as a bit embarrassing, and Evangeline Lilly sits about like a hat stand showing her brand of talentless acting. Let's be clear here, I wasn't expecting good performances or a storyline that even made sense. I don't care about story or characters in visual feasts ? I just want action and lots of it! Real Steel really failed me in two big ways.First, if you're going to have a bad story with bad actors at least make it bad enough to be funny. Grab the worst takes and do the audience a favor. The movie wasn't bad enough to be enjoyable, but it also didn't excel in any big ways. Hugh Jackman is arguably a very good actor, but the director at least managed to make him look like a classic "foreign guy playing an American tough guy" mis-cast. I would have liked a few more obviously mispronounced words. Dakota Goyo could have been better if it wasn't for his ear-splittingly annoying voice. I enjoy kids movies, but the acting by a lot of child stars come across as a Jar Jar Binks addition rather than an impressive performance by a young person. See Super 8 ? no shrieking children there.Second way Real Steel let this Fat Man down was on the pretty CG action. If you think big fighting robots, you've got to imagine that at least 2/3 of the movie should be action. No no. We didn't even get to watch the entire final fight ? 5 rounds at 2 minutes each. We got a crossfaded 30 second recap of rounds 2 through 4 and then got to watch the last round in slow motion. Spit my beer, why don't you. I'm going to spoil the last fight and to my co-writer Queer: SHUT UP! I can't talk about the finer points of story structure in mindless children's films without a little spoilage!Atom ALMOST beats the big bad robot, but can't produce the KO and loses in the decision. I wonder why? Maybe we'll get to see a rematch in:REAL STEEL 2: Rematch City The Reckoning!It drives me insane when studios are so confident they've made a winner that they just go ahead and plan on a sequel. Jumper ended in a similar fashion and.. I've yet to see a sequel to that, unless you count Chronicle maybe.It's not a terrible movie, but really wasted a good idea by skimping on the action. Sure dad may have learned a lesson, but in the end he still doesn't have custody and probably faces so restraining orders.</fullReview>

First off, sentiments. If the relationship between the father and the son is important for the story, develop it, and if not, just don't put it in there, but to see characters showing great feelings for each other out of the blue and with no explanation whatsoever really reminds me of a B-class 80's action movie.

		<fullReview>For a film that, after seeing the trailer, I preemptively deemed "the dumbest movie ever made", this was mildly enjoyable for a while. I wish that Hugh Jackman would do more films like The Fountain or The Prestige, that utilize his impressive emotional range, but even in a role like this he has such a great, likable presence that makes him enjoyable to watch and easy to root for. It's unfortunate that the writers had no idea how to write a child role and turned in a character that was right from the start doomed to be one of the most annoying things of the year.Dakota Goyo could probably give a half-decent performance under the right writer/director, but here he's saddled with a mess of a "too cool for school" kid that grates on the nerves almost immediately and only gets worse as it goes on (the scene where he grabs the microphone in the ring might honestly be the most annoying thing in film this year). Hard to care about the father/son relationship when I wish the son wasn't anywhere near the screen. The subplots with Evangeline Lilly and Kevin Durand are dreadfully thin and totally worthless, but in a film loaded with clichés it seems kind of silly to complain about a couple of smaller ones tossed on top.Still, in spite of everything, I think my graveyard low expectations helped me to kind of enjoy it for a while. It wasn't anything great, but it was some inoffensive, light and easy entertainment and didn't bog itself down too much with the clichéd melodramatic themes for the first hour or so. Then came the second hour which was pretty much one nauseatingly saccharine moment after another. By the time they did a slow motion shot of Goyo and Lilly crying while watching Jackman box, I had completely checked out and resigned to hating myself. On a side note, it was nice seeing Anthony Mackie in a small role just having a lot of fun after doing such serious stuff for the past few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Kaante was his first brush with avant garde (read modern), new millennium movie lore, then with Zinda, director Shawn Levy gifts Hollywood its first full-blown art-marries-remake flick. One which has a delightfully new idiom and features career best performances from both Hugh Jockman and others. It's a coming of-age film for those who prove that behind the beefcake is a barrage of histrionics, waiting to explode. And here, it does. The film scores i9n almost every department. The story may be inspired from a TWIGHLIGHT ZONE episode, or so we are told, but is doesn't matter because no one's really seen it. Essentially a thriller, the film follows the desperate attempts of Jackman to find out who his tormentor is: who is that mysterious robot atop the junk heap and, more importantly, how can it be exploited? His leads are few?? just the taste and the smell of certain kind of fried wontons which he was fed everyday. With the help of the spunky girl, and a day long encounter with bots all over town, he finds the boxing ring which served them and eventually manages to reach his mysterious conflict. But only after we have been treated to some gritty encounters with a sledge hammer swinging bot who is essentially a washing maching walking. Naturally, he is impervious to all blows, except those of the emotional kinds which are effectively delivered by his arch enemy. And who's the arch enemy? No Spoilers here, fight fans. It's a brave new remake which dates to completely break the mould of all TWIGHLIGHT ZONE and Rocky RIPOFFS. Shot exquisitely (Levy is the cinematographer too) in a cold chrome light in the murky bylanes of the continental US, with s funky music score (Vishal and Shekhar, Strings, Shibani Kashyap), Real Steel has compelling performances by all the actors - they almost redefine the portrayal of pain and vulnerability, despite their machismo- then the ladies lend excellent support.it is not the TWILIGHT ZONE episode called "steel" but still a fine remake even though the story is stolen pretty much from Rod Serling's masterpiece series! Bravo Bollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went in to the theater expecting a lot from this movie..I was disappointed by the end of it. Hugh Jackman's acting was worse than the kid playing his son..Evangeline Lilly had a very little role- a major part of which was cheering for Jackman's robot to win. The plot - lots of questions left unanswered. Why did the owners of Zeus want to buy atom - the old sparring robot? Does Atom actually understand people? Does he have special qualities? There's a scene where atom is looking at himself in the mirror..which builds up anticipation in the audience about atom having human qualities etc etc..which is very conveniently is left out by the makers of the movie.Disappointing. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meh...... Solid family entertainment I guess. Kinda clichéd at times, son teaches dad to grow up?! How many times have we seen this?! Could have done without them. The robot fighting is pretty bad ass. But when you think about it, in a world where robots are built to fight for sport, not security, not too protect humanity you'd think the rest of technology would've caught up with this advancement. I mean, gas guzzlers, iPhone 5, hp crystal-pads hardly sync with autonomous battle bots. At the very least you'd imagine these bots being used as some form of law enforcement or security, but no. There are still no autonomous GREEN vehicles, yet they have built robots that can anticipate maneuvers and react accordingly with speed and precision. In the universe of Real Steel, somewhere down the line, human technology veered off from the advancement of the human race into the satisfaction of primal pleasure. Again the plot is clichéd but okay, the rest, characters, dialog, direction was good but nothing you'd look at twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall a surprising and entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had pretty low expectations of this movie. The premise of remote controlled humanoid robots boxing was not really my cup of tea.However, a very good friend of mine, whose opinion I value highly, had suggested the movie with great enthusiasm and loaned me the BluRay copy to watch. I put this off until a rainy Sunday afternoon where there was not much else happening and I had the house to myself.The first fight scene between a robot and a 'non-robot' almost had me turning the movie off with a high and mighty "I knew it"?but I continued? And I'm glad I did.The movie turned out to be multi-dimensional, with splashes of humour, a nicely understated but always present romance, and the developing father/son relationship was really quite heartwarming. The action was exciting, and sometimes edge of my seat.I was extremely thankful that they never really gave the robots any emotion, as this would have made it uncomfortable to watch. I never really felt for the robots themselves, and for that I was truly thankful. The story is really about the relationship between the father and son.Hugh Jackman was believable as the single minded, down and out ex-boxer with a money problem. And not to bad to look at either?boy was he buff for this movie?damn! Dakota Goyo was enjoyable to watch as Max (the son), and I loved the confidence he exuded as an 11 year old with total faith that everything was going to work out? The shadow boxing program that allowed him to dance with Atom was a nice little touch, although, I wish they'd continued that for the final showdown ? I felt the absence of this. Evangeline Lilly was really great as the love interest, and I was happy to see her reappear on the screen after being "Lost"! The antagonists in the movie were well cast, in that I hated them on-site! Especially the rodeo guy.There were a few moments that had me scratching my head? such as who leaves an 11 year old for the summer with someone he's never met, even if that someone is the biological father? And the ending left me wondering what kind of relationship the father and son would have from that point forward; I would have liked those ends tidied. But, overall it was an enjoyable, and pleasantly surprising, few hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world of cage matches and underground brawling, boxing seems sadly tame by comparison. And with ever-increasing technological advances, robot death-matches may be a coming attraction destined for a venue near you. Though probably not in the not-to-distant future depicted in this Hugh Jackman science-fiction movie.It's 2020 and Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a boxer whose days in the ring are long-behind him thanks to the emergence of robot boxing. He now controls other fighters (robots) from the sidelines. Unfortunately, he's had a long run of bad luck and is in serious debt. He's then hit with the news that the son he never sees was recently orphaned when his mother, and Charlie's former girlfriend, died. At the custody hearing he sees Max (played by Dakota Goyo), Max's wealthy Aunt Debra (played by Hope Davis) and her husband Marvin (played by James Rebhorn). Marvin (Rebhorn) tells Charlie that while they want custody and know that he doesn't, they have plans for the summer and they are willing to pay a six-figure sum if Charlie will care for Max until they return. And at that time he'll relinquish all claims to Max. Soon Max and Charlie find a robot to replace the one lost in Charlie's most recent bout and embark on the process of training it and repaying Charlie's debts.I wasn't expecting much from this film given the premise and the fact that some of Jackman's previous films (the X-MEN series and Wolverine follow-up) left me disappointed. I was surprised and very pleased to see this film outshine those in execution and conclusion. Jackman's role isn't all that different from ones past but the tone and supporting characters make for an extremely enjoyable two hours and seven minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that a successful Hollywood script is one that seems to do something new by recycling trusted parts of bankable film ideas. This one ? to judge from the tickets sold ? picked good enough bits. Father stuff; coming of age stuff; techno; Karate Kid; Iron Giant.But a viewer demographic must be a vexing thing to these factory filmmakers, because some viewers will see the cobbled together being and see parts that were missing, parts that would have made the being stronger. Such was the case with me because I saw this foremost as a boxing movie and I looked for the cinematic thrills that could have been there.After all, the boxing movie is one of the primary paths where we evolve our notion of the camera. Scorcese of course, but many others brought us novel ways to think about who we are in the choreography of how a closed bit of the world dances.And that wasn't here even though our combatants are computer generated and our greatest advances in camera choreography have been in cameras whose placement and movement are not restricted by physical bounds.Nope. None of that here. We may as well have just been watching muscle cars in a demolition derby.Boxing, some might say, is the only true sport. One man against another and the first one that cannot continue loses. Sport ? at least this notion ? is about losing; the dream is about winning. It is a strange thing, the notion of contest. It is between two men, but if it were truly pure, they would go off and conduct the contest in private, as many do with say the contest of chess.But this seems to have been designed more for spectators. Rules having to do with space. With gloves and rests designed to make it last long enough to be worth traveling to gather in large numbers. Commentary and statistics that one can carry from contest to contest. A personality industry so we believe we have some choice in who we prefer.These are exploited here, well enough I must admit. But there is no dance.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman...Huge waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I need to preface this review with one statement. My skills at movie making are not even as good as Uwe Boll's. Rather than list spoilers I will say that the ending was a twist on what I thought would happen. But, the path to get to that twist was paved with glitter glue and rainbows. It is beyond me on how IMDb users give movies like BloodRayne a 2.8 and Real Steal a 7.1. And I have not even seen BloodRayne. My thought is that 80% of the people who watch BloodRayne would know that the acting, directing and plot are going to be abysmal and would then say...wow...this movie is just like what I thought it was going to be so I will give it a 5. Who watches BloodRayne and thinks maybe 6 or 7 tweaks could have raised their USER rating from a 2.9 to a 7.1? BloodRayne was never meant to be a 7.1. I guess I need to remember that some people may have given Real Steel higher scores because they were looking for CGI instead of an intriguing back story and believable characters. Oh well, to each their own I suppose.</fullReview>

Couple that with bad music and the kid doing black-inflected "dance moves" with the robot, bad enough to make you feel embarrassed for even watching, and you got yourself a typical piece of affected feelgood crapola. The bird-brained demographic who enjoyed the Transformers movies and Armageddon will undoubtedly swallow this one down and ask for seconds.I would give this movie less points but I'm afraid it's not possible. The only reason it gets two is that the action was halfway decent. Beyond that it was a waste of time.

We all know what this means for the boring Hollywood industry.I had said it and I say it again, one more step down and Jackman will hit WWE's payroll. Jackman is a good actor and we all need to make a living, I can understand.This movie is utter thrash. Not only does it rip from movies like Rocky or Over The Top - and Stallone wrote Rocky, but it's just plain bad. It has none of that underdog coming back to the top through effort and pain spirit. It's all about gimmicky robots and a petulant child. The young actor is quite good, luckily we can see him play in some quality movie. Please don't waste young talent on stuff like this.It's violent, it's not about a sport - boxing is a sport because human train to achieve such levels of dexterity and endurance. It's just a vehicle for product placement galore and bad music and CG. This is no family movie despite what those douches would have you believe. It has no soul or value. Do some meaningful activities with your children and talk with them. Hollywood makes a terrible nanny.Please vote with your money. Say no to turdish stuff and support independent, original ideas, or even Hollywood but with quality direction. Good luck - you'll need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear fellow film fans. If this painful piece of ''Disney'' junk isn't proof that Spielberg is on Disney's payroll, than I'm all out of bright ideas.Or maybe it's just Spielberg, trying to compete against Disney? Who will know and who will tell? One thing is for sure though: Real Steel can't be REAL!?! I watched it yesterday night, but to be true, I woke up with the feeling that I just dreamed the whole lot. This just can't be real! Real steel was one of my most anticipated films for 2011, but it just hit the bottom shelf for the most obsolete film of 2011. But please, don't get me wrong... If there was indeed a Disney stamp on it, I would have fell for the cheesy masquerade, maybe... But for a near future robot fighting film starring Jackman? This just can't be real! The corniness, the corniness... oh my god! The lack of credibility, what the heck! The lack of depth, God save the Queen! The characters, the plot, the twists, the story-building... they just aren't there. It's like a Giant walking through the forest drinking Fanta and eating mushrooms, making it all up along the way.Summing it all up: Real Steel is an exploitative, rampant, brazen, malevolent and harrowing piece of junk for the REAL FILM FAN (unless you're under the age of 10).But please, DO find out for yourself if you still have any doubts! Why still 2 out of 10??? Damn, for the effort I'd guess?.Good luck watching this awesome film!! (You'll need it, really ;)</fullReview>

NO ONE wants to see little 11 years old kids dance around with there robots like nobody is watching. 5. the part where he ran into the robot boxing ring and jumped up and grabbed the Mic from the guy who describes the fight, and starts yelling something, i didn't hear any of it because of his annoying voice, and for some reason eevery one likes what he is saying and starts clapping for him and what not. The only futuristic things in the movie were the robots, the cellphones and the computers that the Asians used in the last 2 fights. the movie could have been so good but they managed to put a little annoying spoiled brat in there to ruin the movie.</fullReview>

This is more than an average boring boxing movie. It also showed me that when no one else would believe in you all it takes is one person to show you that yes you can do anything, It also showed me that no matter how many punches life gives you, you get back up and keep fighting, Don't give up , don't back down.

		<fullReview>Real Steel? TMG says Real Stupid. This movie is just dumber than dirt from the get go. I am sure some eleven year old boys who are into sci-fi and robots will think this film is really cool. But if we judge any film by that standard, snot on a grasshopper's back is entertaining and cool too.Hugh Jackman plays a forty something eleven year old named Charlie Kenton who never grew up from playing with toys. The year is around 2020 and apparently the world has descended into a bunch of violence crazed degenerates who never bathe and spill beer everywhere and all love robo-boxing. This is a great start for a film targeted at pre-teens. During the scenes at the "Crash Palace" I really thought I was watching some outtakes from Waterworld (1995) and Dennis Hopper would come back from the dead with a black eye patch on. This just goes to prove what a piece of junk $100 million can buy you in a movie.Charlie is a former boxer, irresponsible no-mind, who builds boxing robots with money from loan sharks. His lucky day hits when he learns his ex-girlfriend has died and has left him with his biological eleven year-old son Max (Goyo). For the good of no one, Max's Aunt Debra wants to adopt Max, so Charlie makes a deal with her uber wealthy husband for Debra to keep Max for $100,000.00. Max's loving Aunt Debra then immediately turns him back over to Charlie for the summer while she and hubby vacation Europe. This is all just dandy.Little Max turns out to be a way too smart, way beyond his years smart ass of a kid, who of course is a genius at building half-ton ton, artificially intelligent robots. He runs from county fair to county fair with dear old Dad building and fighting robots against skin heads and the dregs of society?which is pretty much the entire earth at this point. All the while, Charlie manages a ridiculously contrived relationship with the daughter of his former boxing trainer. In the interim, we get a 2010 film tech adaptation of father and son playing and updated 1964 era version of Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots.Charlie and Max, down on their last dollar, build a scrap heap robo-fighter from a junkyard and name him Atom. No spoiler at all what happens next as they rise to the top of the robo- boxing world and find love. I wanted to just puke. If this terribly written plot and cliché driven dialogue represents the future of of anything, I don't want to live that long.I did notice a few things along the way. Goya looks and acts amazingly like young Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) in The Client from 1994. I wondered if they were actually brothers. (Let's hope the promising young Goya fares better than Renfro who died at 25 from a drug overdose.) I noticed, oddly enough, that all cars in 2020 all look like 1990&#x2032;s models. I also noticed that giving an eleven year old boy a line like "Anything you don't need, you just throw away" is not even heart inspiring in a totally absurd movie. One hour in, I was bored to death and was frankly surprised few adults were walking out. Perhaps they did not realize films like 50/50 and The Way and The Help were showing right next door. Real Steel even made Thor look inspiring, well written fun and believable and I didn't think that was even possible.And what is with all the scenes of prairie windmills in this movie? It really looked like the Director was trying to make some political statement on energy for no reason. Fact is, if those absurdly inefficient bird killers on the Kansas plains are still running in 2020, we are all in real trouble. Maybe we will all be wearing sleeveless shirts, go un-bathed, and drink beer all day while playing with robots and reading Al Gore's biography. Nah. . . . I don't think so. It might be cool if Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots comes back though.</fullReview>

I found myself watching only the robot boxing on normal mode and every time there was an father-son or "never give up and cheer" tale i couldn't stand watching it so i forwarded the DVD. I swear i won't pay a dime to see a movie like this in the cinema from now on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very definitely a kids movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wtf! I mean W-T-F! This film was shocking. OK in 2000 the special effects alone would have made this a great movie but its 2011 now and the special effects in this are pretty much the norm.This film had a good IMDb rating and so i thought I'd give it a go at the cinema. What I got was vomit inducing sentimentality, characters that were either borderline parodies of themselves or entirely unbelievable and a story-line that left a lot to be desired. In addition the science required a suspension of disbelieve that was beyond me. I mean; fighting robots that operate via voice recognition, or even more laughably in "shadow mode" where they simply copy what they "see". Where's the immersive VR suites with biofeedback? That would have been a lot more believable. Fighters controlling their robots via the web from the comfort of their homes. It wouldn't have taken a lot to make this aspect of the film a lot more believable. Also it was set too near in the future. By the time we have robots as advanced as these we won't be filling up trucks with fossil fuels (something I noticed happening more than once - sponsorship from big oil?)In its defence the kid actor was pretty good insofar as he could be with the sh1t script he's been given and the idea that kids would speak Japanese in the future due to the superiority of their online games was a nice touch (though I think Chinese is just as likely).All in all a huge disappointment. I left the cinema after the final showdown about 5-10 minutes before the film ended when I just couldn't take any more of the attempted tear jerking. My friend left after an hour and preferred to sit outside playing on his phone until the film ended. An 11 year old might like this. Any adult with a normal IQ will not.Oh, and watch out for the prolonged Budweiser product placement at the beginning of the film. Considering this is a kids film I thought that was a little bit naughty!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Junk. Real Junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so predictable from the get go (with exception of one later scene) and full of clichés, that the fact that it is only boring to some extent and not stupid only in a moderate way, will not land him a rating higher than 1/10. And there is just no sense in describing what exactly is wrong with it, because if you take such used up sport or parents-children relations stories like this one, and then execute them in (at best) a mediocre way, you don't deserve attentionOf course there will be those who will say "But wait a minute! Isn't this suppose to be a family movie, for the so called everyone? Or enjoyable at least for the kids? And as such shouldn't be hold to standards of serious / realistic cinema?". Well, this picture was (correctly) rated PG-13. And as for the family values presented in this picture, they are dubious Because what does the father teach his son? To break and entry. To loot someone's property but at the same time to ditch his partner in crime when you get tired. To avoid paying debts. To litter on the street. To not trust police in case of being mugged and beaten, by simply not reporting a crime. To not go to the hospital after being beaten. And on top of that, you can add a cruelty toward animal for fun (to which amongst other things the son is not exposed to)Just like you can eat real food or junk food, you can watch a real movie or some junk movie. And this film is big pile of junk. For real</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Came across this film a few months ago and was blown away. Simple premise of lonely boy desperate for a father figure finds solace and friendship in a fighting robot. Yes it's cheesy and some what predictable but the whole film made me smile throughout. Hugh Jackman plays the wayward father looking for direction while his son is looking for the father he never had.The robot is the pragmatist that brings them together. Fight scenes are good and the interaction between the characters is charming. Many films of father and son coming together rely on a love interest this thankfully doesn't . So sit down and enjoy and film that will leave you feeling warm inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future, robot boxing is a top sport. A struggling promoter feels he's found a champion in a discarded robot with the helps of his son. Yes, Hugh Jackman is a struggling father who begins his past career of boxing a broken robot that symbolizes himself. Despite the extreme stupidity described, the film is very entertaining and, surprising, not as sappy as it sounds. Hugh Jackman knows the kind of film he stars in, not trying too hard to be something he's not in this film. He delivers a fun performance that sets-off his annoying son. Being a Hollywood blockbuster, "Real Steel" gives an entertaining show that touches on emotional issues that children and certain film-goers can appreciate. I wouldn't' rush back for more, but for what it's worth, "Real Steel" is a knock-out (pun intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film filled with unexpected heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the premise of the robot boxing in this film so I was excited to see it but I did not realise how emotional and fantastic this movie is. This movie sees robot boxing as the new top sport and a father, son and broken down robot go for the title. Now Hugh Jackman is one of the best actors in Hollywood today and he absolutely owns this role. He starts off as an arrogant character but due to the great writing and the great performance you end up liking his character and rooting for him. Now I wasn't sure about the kid when the film started but he really grew on me as the film progressed and his relationship with Jackman was what really drove the film forward. Evangeline lilly plays jackmans love interest and she is a really great addition to this film and delivers a pretty memorable character. Kevin Durand and Anthony Mackie have slightly smaller roles but they both do good performances for their roles. The films story is a little cliché but it does it so well that you really don't care. The father son relationship is done fantastically, the romance is done well and the underdog story really works. The script is mostly good with some really great emotional stuff in it. But sometimes the dialogue becomes a bit wooden and hard to relate to. The style is awesome, all the robot fight scenes really work and build up to this big fight feel and it is great. Overall this was a surprisingly great movie that you should definitely see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fights scenes are pretty good, but it's just a shame that I didn't find much to care about here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********************WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS*************************In some ways this film wrong-footed me almost from the get-go. Firstly, we have Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman)a down and out former boxer who now works as some kind of robot trainer and in the first instance pits his creation against a bull. I mean why a bull? Why not another robot? I've got to admit to finding that fight a little bit uncomfortable to watch if I'm honest. I also found it hard to take to Charlie as a character; he's a horrible individual; he goes around running up huge debts, hasn't bothered with his son since he's a baby and then isn't interested in being with his son even when he's given the opportunity to make amends. I always find it more difficult to get involved with a story when I don't like the characters and this is certainly the case with Real Steel. However, what makes it worse here is that we're not really given any explanation for Kenton's fall from grace or why he has problems with his son or his late wife. It wouldn't have hurt the writers to give us a bit of insight into what makes Charlie tick and what makes him behave the way that he does. For this reason I also wasn't impressed by the glib and lazy plot device towards the end where Charlie 'sees the error of his ways'. It's almost like the writers think that it's OK not to develop a character and then make them good at the end. The reality is that it's rather lazy.I also found Charlie's son Max (Dakota Goyo) to be a rather smug and self-righteous know-it-all (particularly at the start). Thankfully he did become less annoying towards the end, but as a result I found Charlie and Max's hard edged characters tough to live with in the first half of the film. I also found the relationship between Charlie and Max to be a little forced, far-fetched and not particularly believable. In the middle part of the film you'd think that a strong bond had existed for years and it's only towards the end that we're reminded that Charlie had been an absent parent for years. There was definitely a lot of phoniness here.The good news is that the fight scenes between the robots are pretty good (although there's nothing spectacular) and the final fight with Zeus was pretty cool - even though it felt like we were watching re-hashes of Rocky (particularly the bit where Atom is tiring out Zeus), but it was at least fun to watch. The film also took an unusual turn by Atom not winning the 'big fight'. Although the film still had a happy ending and Atom was deemed a hero for going the distance with Zeus, I still admire the writers for not making the film entirely predictable.At the end of the day you watch a film like Real Steel to see robots punching each other and if that's all you want then this will be a pleasant viewing experience (albeit the fights were a little short for my liking). However, for me the cliché ridden story, poor character development, and unlikeable characters dragged this film down for me making it a fairly average film. In fact, the only person I cared for was Atom and you know you're in trouble when the only person that you're rooting for is a robot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Real Steel" is the imaginary future of sports, robot boxing. Which, why not that seems logical with the way technology has been going. They build these huge, mechanical, and smart fight robots from metal and scraps. Even programmed controllers, voice command, and shadow functions. With all these parts to the robot they even made they have cool or extravagant exterior designs. The robots are from the future however the plot of the story is not. It's about a dad (Charlie) who has success earlier in his life from boxing, who has now retired and is in desperate need of money. When he divorces his wife she re marries an older wealthier guy. When they leave on a trip and ask Charlie a favor to watch a kid he sees as a way to get easy money from them, and so with that money he receives he goes out and buys fighting robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REAL STEEL has a corker of an idea: in the immediate future, human boxers have been replaced by robots. It's a cool idea and I'm sure the Japanese have already done it. Unfortunately this is a weird hybrid between a kids film and an adult film. Frankly the stuff in the 'robot underground' is too dark and gruesome for young kids, whilst much of the boxing is too tame for older kids. The plot is basically a reheated version of THE CHAMP as a former human boxer cum robot boxer pilot has to look after his annoying, brattish son. Inevitably they bond over the sport and take their plucky 'bot which can learn to the championships, where in the course of what seem like weeks they go from amateur to fighting the world champion (inevitably sleek, evil and Asian/Russian). Daddy learns to accept responsibility, whilst the kid learns how to beat up robots real good; it's a heartwarming story. No prizes for guessing that they end up as a Real American Family (tm) by the end. The fights are sub-ROCKY and it's never that clear how they actually win the climactic match, beyond the fact the writers want them too. If you really have to watch a flick with the kids then this isn't too bad, but it's pretty generic otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(61%) A better than most were expecting, including myself, family sci-fi action drama that has Hugh Jackman to thank for much of its success. Jackman brings his great screen presence, bubbling personality, and charismatic charm lifting what could have been an unlikeable character into someone you really do root for. The plot is very similar to both Sly Stallone's "Over the top" and of course "Rocky", but everything is done well enough for this to be on the whole quite exciting at times, meaning this has the power to bring on enough thrills and spills along with a very enjoyable ending. So it may not have an original bone in its body, but as far as well made family friendly movies go that parents will enjoy as much as the kids, then look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real steel. A movie that certainly lives up to its name. Plus it has Hugh Jackman. So technically, what more does one want? In reality, if you are going to watch this just for him, you will be mightily surprised. The movie completely takes over and you enjoy the movie for what it is and not for the actors that bring it to life. The emotional bond between father and son, between childhood friends who turned sweethearts and the battle between one man and himself is all so beautifully woven. This movie has robots, fights, boxing, emotions, a story line, survival of the underdog and so much more. I have wanted to see it for such a long time and i am really glad that i finally got down to watching it. Much Much worth it. I personally think it is a movie for all ages, men and women alike, for the movie teaches you one important life lesson. If you work hard and you have faith, nothing and no one and stop you. You are unbeatable, unstoppable and will remain undefeated. Bottomline - Must watch for movie buffs and non movie buffs alike.</fullReview>

The actors did their parts quite well and there were some scenes that stood out. Since the robot couldn't talk, we didn't have to translate what it was trying to say. In that respect it was a step up from the never-ending "Rocky" series . There were comic book elements throughout - expected - and one dimensional. A few of the parts were genuinely funny but putting a kid in such a brutal world struck me as a bad choice all around. I felt like I was watching a fixed game.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat, futuristic robot boxing tale undermined by predictable character machinations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Real Steel' is based on the 1956 Richard Matheson short story, 'Steel', which was later made into a Twilight Zone episode starring Lee Marvin. You might recall in the Twilight Zone episode, Marvin gets into the ring with a robot opponent after boxing has been outlawed in the future. 'Real Steal' doesn't aspire to such tragic heights: here, the robots are merely controlled by their human handlers at ringside with WiFi-like control boxes.What 'Real Steel' does have is a solid plot. The New York Times may be correct in assessing that it is a "well wrought out entertainment". On the other hand, it's basically geared toward the pre-adolescent market with a very predictable storyline.My problem with the film are with its principal characters. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, the former boxer turned robot trainer/manager who is pretty much a caricature of a dumb, impulsive, child-like man who's solely driven by material concerns. This is a role that probably would have been better played by a young Mel Gibson in his heyday. Here, Jackman tries hard but fails to make an unlikeable character, likable.Kenyon is unsympathetic from the get-go--welshing on a bet with the sleazy promoter, Ricky, and then skipping town. The dark moment of Real Steel's second act, when Ricky and his goons beat up Kenyon for failing to pay up on the bet, is indicative of why we're unable to root for Kenyon, even after two thirds of the story is complete. Even Kenyon can hardly protest, as the beat down appears not to be completely unjustified.And then there's little Max (Dakota Goyo), who Charlie accepts $100,000 for from the boy's wealthy aunt and uncle, in exchange for full parental custody. The precocious Max, for my tastes, appears to be a little too aggressive and confident for a preteen, and the sight of a father and son, interacting on just about the same level of maturity, comes off as more comical than realistic.The strength of 'Real Steel' lies in the escalating tension of the fight scenes. The robots themselves (most of them anyway), seem to be modeled on 'Transformers'; but Atom, Max's 'bot', rescued from a junkyard, is more a cross between the steely intelligence of a humanoid Robocop and cuddly Spielberg extraterrestrial.Perhaps the best of the fight scenes occur early on. In the opening scene, Kenyon's obsolete robot, 'Ambush', lives up to his name, when he's slaughtered by a real-life bull at a rural fair. Using the money he obtains from giving up custody of Max, Charlie purchases 'Noisy Boy', a secondhand 'World Robot Boxing League' (WRB) Japanese model, who also ends up as a pile of junk, while being roundly destroyed by Midas, the illegal circuit champion.After the discovery of the discarded 'Atom', an obsolete 'second generation' sparring bot, Max and Charlie try their luck in an unsanctioned outdoor meet, featuring a crowd of unsavory boxing enthusiasts who look like extras from a Mad Max movie. The spiked hair trainer with a robot called 'Metro', steals the show, as he attempts to take down Atom with great panache, but ultimately ends up having his own robot destroyed in the process.A montage follows with the media soon promoting Atom as the people's champion. With his growing fame, Max and Charlie obtain a legally WRB sanctioned fight with 'Twin Cities', a double headed robot, who Atom easily knocks out. This gives Max the opportunity to get up in the ring and challenge Farra Lemkkova and Tak Moshido, the Russian mogul owner and Japanese computer genius trainer, of the intimidating world champion, Zeus.SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD: To the writer's credit, the underdog Atom, does not defeat the physically superior Zeus. True to form, the world champion retains his title, winning on points. Still, Max and Charlie can take comfort that Atom is now the 'people's champion', and he was able to stand toe to toe with the champ.In the end, 'Real Steel' proves to be a real mixed bag. You have a great deal of variety in the various fight venues and a clever mix of actors in giant robot suits doing their thing, coupled with some excellent Avatar-like effects. But the overwhelmingly predictable tale of loser father redeemed along with an in-your-face, overenthusiastic pre-teen boxing enthusiast peddling his win-at-any-cost unwholesome wares, tends to turn this somewhat compelling narrative into a less than successful 'B' picture as opposed to a high-level, sci-fi fantasy entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the worst, but not the best film either. This film could have been good. I saw Spielberg's name somewhere in the opening credits ? should have taken it as a warning. I watch films for their entertainment value and not to be hyper-critical; however, some things leap out at you.The story is set in the near future where robo-boxing has replaced human boxing. This concept is novel, but was not developed fully. Thus, it is not clear whether the robots fought independently or were controlled by humans; perhaps this is still a developing technology. As with many Hollywood films, it starts off strong and about mid-way through looses steam and turns into the same old shoot 'em up. The robots have a nice "Robocop" clunky feel to them.There are essentially two parallel stories ? down and out former boxer (loser) has a crack at the title via his son and a Disney type father bonding with unknown son. There is a minor side plot as Hugh Jackman's character has annoyed many people and owes considerable money. Overall, the story is linear and the father/son /robot team do not suffer any major setbacks in their rise to the championship fight.Hugh Jackman's character is rather unpleasant. When his robot is trashed, he makes no attempt at repairing it. Rather he chucks it away as a disposable commodity and proceeds to incur yet more debt and enemies by buying another one. There have been comments on the Max Kenton character. I find that the character oscillates between being likable and being mega irritating. As it is a father-son bonding film, expect many moments of tugging at one's heart strings.I would not rate this film as one-star as some reviewers have done, although I acknowledge their comments as valid; I reckon it's about 5 to 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so poor you couldn't pay me to watch it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awful from beginning to end. The storyline is bland and incredibly predictable. The director has no only followed the path of your basic sporting feel good movie but he has stuck rigidly in the middle, not even straying slightly to the side. The result is not entertaining. The concept of fighting robots is not well thought through and never fully explained as well which leaves you begging the question why watching robots act out exactly what humans have been doing for hundreds of years is such an improvement that it radically changes the sport? The whole underdog principle is that the contender gradually works on themselves throughout the film getting better, stronger, faster or at least observing some weakness in their opponent, not one of these things happen in the film leaving you asking what exactly the champion robot's team spent their money on that they could be beaten by a robot so poor that the junkyard it was found in valued it so little they left in buried and forgotten. The characters also add to the film's badness. Hugh Jackman plays a character who makes unbelievably bad decisions, he acts with the sort of stupidity put in place to move on the plot rather than add faults to a figure to make them relatable. Dakota Goyo's abandoned at birth 11 year old gradually becomes more annoying as the film wears on and displays behaviour so cringy it physically hurts the viewer. Evangeline Lilly does well as the character who's past grievances have something to teach Jackman but she never really gets enough screen time for us to understand the emotional experiences that cause the game changing revelation Hugh has. The whole film is so riddled with plot holes you have to wonder whether the director was on the right set. In his first 'league' match Atom overcomes his two headed opponent (yes you heard me, and no you're not wrong in thinking there's no benefit for a robot to have an additional head) because it has some sort of shoulder related problem. Here lies a problem, robots don't need time to recover from injuries, you simply give them a new part, therefore there is absolutely no reason for them to be in top condition for each fight. Then there's the issue of the disappearing technology. We're told that Atom is a second generation robot, now although we're not told what generation they're actually on we know they're at least one generation up, see the problem? A gap of one generation in Ipods see's a remarkably change in technology and yet we're to believe that an average Joe second generation can beat some of the best fighting robots in the world... We'll skip over some others and go straight to the hole that's staring you in the face, the final fight. So Zeus is giving Atom a right going over and Atom's just taking it, half the time he's not even blocking the punches and this happens for the best part of three rounds. Now Zeus manages to 'knock out' opponents of the current generation when they've take far less punishment even though Atom would lack the same armour and component protecting technology they posses. Then Zeus starts running out of power, I'll repeat that so you realise it's not a typo, he starts running out of power. Atom has not only managed to survive a beating that destroys stronger, tougher robots but also depletes and energy source that would have been designed to allow Zeus to last through a fair fight and so by decree should have been more than sufficient in a fight where he's barely threatened. When Atom then finally fights back Zeus seems to be equally damaged when hit by a weaker robot a fraction of the number of times Zeus has hit Atom. If you haven't seen this film then don't give it time of day, if you have seen it then I can only say that I share your pain. In a year that saw The Fighter and Warrior (two of the best films ever and the two best sporting films ever created) Real Steel is really shown as what it is, CGI based c**p designed to reel in the unwashed and undiscerning masses.I'd appreciate any feedback, good or bad. If you read something you don't agree with, did agree with, or something you think is missing then I'd like to hear from you. E-mail me at anonamous.person3443@hotmail.co.uk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK but not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off kind of slow but stuff starts happening towards the end. The acting isn't the best I've seen but that was expected. The graphics are good but other robot movies have done better. The plot is about a once great boxer Charlie (Hugh Jackman)trying to win money with scrap robot boxers. Then when his ex girlfriend dies hes left with his son Max who he sells for 75 thousand. Charlie uses that money to buy an expensive robot. But they lose. Then at a junk yard they find a training bot called Atom. Atom wins a bunch then they go to the big league robo fighting and win again. Then they challenge Zeus who's the best robo fighter at the time. I wont give any more away. if your a fan of robot movies then this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'OVER THE TOP' with robots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'REAL STEEL': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) In the same year that brought us one of the greatest inspirational fighting films of all time ('WARRIOR') we also get this: the robot variation on 'ROCKY'. Actually it's more like another Sylvester Stallone classic though, 'OVER THE TOP', due to the fact that it's about a father spending the summer with his eleven year old son, he just met for the first time, while trying to make money in underground fighting, robot fighting that is (rather than arm wrestling). Hugh Jackman stars as the father and Dakota Goya (who played young 'Thor' in 'THOR') co-stars as his son. The lovely Evangeline Lilly (looking as adorable as ever) also co-stars as Jackman's ex. The film was written by John Gatins, Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven and directed by Shawn Levy (who's directed a slew of family films including two 'NIGHT OF THE MUSEUM's, 'DATE NIGHT' and the 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN' and 'PINK PANTHER' remakes). The movie is pretty cheesy kids fair but it is well made cheese and enjoyable if you like fight movies and robots.The film is based on the 1956 short story 'Steel' by Richard Matheson and tells the tale of a world (set in 2020) where robots have replaced humans in boxing. Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, an ex-boxer who now enters has-been robots in illegal underground fights to make money. His robots are constantly getting ripped apart though as he falls deeper and deeper into debt. While eluding some thugs he owes money to he finds out his ex-girlfriend has passed away and left their son, Max, to him. After finding out that the boy's rich aunt and uncle (Hope Davis and James Rebhorn) desperately want custody of him Charlie sees an opportunity to make some big cash. He makes a deal with Max's Uncle that he'll take the boy while he and his wife are vacationing for their second honeymoon and then hand him over to them with full custody in exchange for $100,000. Max is not happy to hear his father 'sold' him but once he gets caught up in his dad's obsession with robot boxing the two begin to bond. Especially when Max finds an old abandoned sparring robot named Atom that the two turn into a cherished underdog champ.The movie is pretty bad at times. It's the type of film that will probably be remembered as a corny moneymaker years from now that was never actually very good (like a lot of 80's films). I think being too critical of films like this is a bad thing though; it dampens the creative spirit and youthful imagination. Sure this film is full of clichés and recycled scenes from dozens of other films and can be predicted every step of the way (but not quite; the end has a few surprises) but it's still entertaining. I did also have a problem believing that robot boxing could ever be as popular as the real thing, there's a lot more at stake with real people involving real emotions and real blood shed, but it is just a movie. Of course it fails in comparisons to the great fighting movies like 'ROCKY', 'WARRIOR', 'FIGHTING', 'LIONHEART' and 'ROCKY II, III, IV and VI' (it also pales in comparison to 'OVER THE TOP', of course, as well) but it is a decent genre buddy to movies like 'TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN'. Definitely not a classic or even a very good film by any manner but it is fun and well made for what it is. Movies like this empower the kid in all of us.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISB6jfqAMe0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big robots pounding each other's heads for two hours....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that has no pretences beyond unadulterated action. This film consists of great big towering metal robots, (a little too akin to Transformers if you ask me), fighting (although robot fighting seems to makes it a tad less 'gratuitous' - but not much). Real Steel is yawningly predictable, way too long (over two hours of 'robot-on-robot action??yaaaaaawn), did I mention predictable? After the first 5 minutes you know exactly what's going to happen so unless you like big metal things pounding each other's heads for 2 hours, you may as well turn it off at that point. There was a feeble attempt at a 'plot', Hugh Jackman did a reasonable job of acting (considering he didn't have much to work with), the kid (Dakota Goyo) wasn't too cringe-worthy and Evangeline Lilley, playing Bailey Talet was OK in a 'cookie cutter' kind of way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real steal, indeed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a lifelong Richard Matheson fan, I knew the instant I saw a trailer for it that REAL STEEL was a ripoff of his short story STEEL (one of the greatest SF short stories ever written). By combining the idea of Rock 'em Sock 'em robots with Matheson's notion of a world in which boxing between human beings has been outlawed, the producers of this heaping mound of mindlessness- aided and abetted by cheesy cgi and third-grade level writing- thought they'd cash in. Which they did. (It's interesting that they only approached Matheson about the rights to his story AFTER they'd stolen it). The recent first episode of the teleshow ROBOT COMBAT LEAGUE just goes to show what can happen when people don't really have a clue as to what to do with advanced robotic technology- ROCK 'EM SOCK 'EM- The Series??? Go back to the original ASTRO BOY TV series and you'll see what it SHOULD be all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rusted mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like its hero, Real Steel is all heart. Its glossy, twee, well shot but sadly all too mechanical. Just like Super 8 before it, the film suffers from an odd focus on a saccharine set of characters, who when in the midst of the fantastical dangers of the films plotting still seem all too concerned with their own social dynamics and shattered family histories.I felt no sympathy for Hugh Jackman, who was likable and believable, as the film seems to champion the notion that sometimes we aren't good enough and that we should just give up. There seems to be a natural order at work, that the people with all the money will inevitably get what they want and that this is ultimately right. Case in point, Jackmans offspring ends up with his wealthy aunt or that Jackman's 'everyman' robot eventually loses the title fight, one or the other would have sufficed. OK, with regards to the fight, it is almost a cliché in the sports movie that our hero should take the moral victory rather than to actually win but here it would have been much more fitting given the set up. If Jackman had won the final fight he would have exercised his previous boxing demons and proved to the kid that anything is possible. As it stands, the ending is flat and depressing.The CGI is fine but i still feel disconnected from CGI heavy action. I felt similar disconnection when watching Transformers, i don't want to watch rubbery CG robots throwing each other about, i might as well stay in and watch someone else play their Playstation.Also, the film has an odd and uneven tone. It seems to be a kids movie that rides the ropes of a very adult genre. There are character clichés here that kids wont understand and that subsequently get lost the rich tones of the films thick veneer. The films opening 'bull fight' in retrospect seems flabby and without merit, a truer piece of cinema would have cut this and gone straight for the jugular. A useful reference point in this respect is the original Karate Kid, it follows a very familiar pattern but without all the bloat and needless melodrama. There is a rush and a zip to the Karate Kid that seems to have been lost in modern cinema especially those movies catered toward kids. Children don't need 4 scenes reiterating an emotional beat, 'REAL STEEL' could have been a really enjoyable 95 minute romp instead its limp and fatty. It is a common mistake by the Spielberg endorsed film-making crew, length seems to be a substitute for weight.All that said, i would rather watch a well made piece of tosh than a poorly executed average movie. The cast are all fine, with Jackman continuing to impress as he juggles being handsome, likable and even menacing when needs must, its a shame he has to waste his time on toss like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very very nice robot movie. I enjoyed it more than Transformers 1!Yes, I agree with the critics, its the regular Hollywood fare, the kid was slightly annoying, yes, but wasn't he supposed to be like his dad, genetically annoying? And he has been tossed around and he is angry, so I think what they were showing was correct. Thats why in the end he is sweeter and more like a normal kid.The movie is a lot like rocky, the strength of the underdog. And THE best part of the whole thing is - ITS REALISTIC.The robots are super cool. When I say it like this, I know, if I were to read this, I would just think, Oh, that guy is some robot freak. I myself am surprised! They never overdo it, and they keep showing us different different robots. And I think the best part is, the robots don't talk. A big relief. ;-).........This is also a great KIDS MOVIE. Much better than the many Disney movies that had come out this year. The kid is involved throughout and has as much presence as Hugh Jackman.There is a good morale weaved in. In the beginning we see Jackman having good and powerful robots, but he never has any respect for them, because he has no respect for himself. And like all regular adults he is just money minded, and just can't see the greater beauty. The kid comes and seeing his innocence and positivity, like all normal kids, Jackman starts respecting his life more, and this is so nice to see. :-).............And it was really nice to see Kate from the Lost TV series. She was perfect as the tough strong girl, preserving her father's legacy. She is sort of the robot mechanic.Go see it. I promise at the very least, you won't feel as if you wasted your time. :-)...............Cheers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started off nicely but after after some time plot becomes very predictable and boring. Don't keep your hopes high if you were expecting it to be anything like transformers. Acting was average and that kid was very irritating in the movie and that dance with Robot was appalling. Father-son relationship doesn't touch your heart and merely bores you. Plot was similar to the Rocky but fails miserably and soundtracks were not great either. One of the worst Hugh Jackman movie and one of the worst of the year.I am giving it only 3 stars that too only for the robot fights. Can't believe its being rated so high by IMDb,its definitely a KIDS movie and unless you are a kid don't watch it,its a complete waste of money. I would say give it a miss and if i had known earlier i wouldn't have wasted my time on it IMDb ratings tricked me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is a decent movie with some decent acting, but not a whole lot of new premises or outcomes.The main plot is Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former boxer who now works in the robot boxing game, using bad bot after bad bot. He is really down on his luck until he gets reunited with his son, the means of which are not the most fatherly, and they discover a small sparring bot in the junkyard.The rest of the movie is pretty predictable, and the lines are the same as every other drama to come before it. Two things about this movie I really liked; Number 1, the action of the boxing scenes, which were truly spectacular (coming from a die-hard Rocky fan) with the CGI and the robots just beating the snot out of each other. Number 2 is Hugh Jackman's acting. The only really good acting in the whole film, and his acting really saved the movie for me. Other than those two things, the music at the end is pretty good as well.Would I recommend it to my friends? Yes, but I would advise them to wait and order it on the on demand service instead of spending the extra money at the theater, because this movie might not be for everyone.Overall, decent.</fullReview>

An obvious attempt at a blockbuster, that by the end of the film you will be somewhat glad the disaster of a movie is over. Usually you can expect a somewhat respectable performance out of Hugh Jackman but during this movie he overacted to the point of annoyance. I will say I thought Kevin Durand did a great job and I believe he should be receiving the large paycheck instead of Jackman. Very Bad and I would not recommend it to anyone. -Jeff B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a retired boxer, but he has a new sport of choice: robot boxing. He tours the small circuit looking for fights in an attempt to break into the big time. Charlie isn't the most likable of characters. He's got a drinking problem and a son he's never met named Max (Dakota Goyo). When an opportunity arises to make a buck off being a parent, Charlie has to take Max along for the ride.The effects behind Real Steel are the real showcase. CGI is prevalent during the robot boxing matches. Though not necessary, the effort was clearly made to use some actual robots in close-up. The difference between the two will go unnoticed by most, in big part due to the smooth animation. I actually prefer the robot action in this movie over that of the Transformers series because the confined location of a ring or cage makes the action significantly easier to digest.Real Steel comes from director Shawn Levy, whose entire niche is family friendly fare. As for story, this is a movie about family bonding more so than robotics, the sweet science, or training. It hinges on Hugh and Dakota so that's it's simply not a collection of brawls. The two get along fine, and though Max is written like the father figure many will take relief in his maturity. Real Steel has a plot that's aimed right at the kiddos with easy to distinguish good and bad figures. Of course the ice-cold Russian-Japanese duo behind the reigning champ Zeus don't have relatable family struggles to put them in a gray area.There's some disbelief to suspend. An unsponsored robot fighting among tiny crowds in a bar isn't going to generate enough revenue to break into the black. There must have been a half dozen child endangerment offenses that were eradicated in the near future, around the same time 8-foot fighting robots first come into existence. Of course it didn't take long for the price to drop like a rock as the closest you can get to Atom today is Honda's ASIMO, and it's big feature is that it can balance itself. Real Steel also features an inordinate amount of robotic engineers, and focusing on a boxer turned robot operator is like finding a writer who repairs Kindles.Real Steel has the robot action that will appeal to kids and the ultimate package isn't far from getting the Disney seal as distributor over the Touchstone marquee. It's a movie about bonding and values without the odd comic characters usually seen in a movie intended for children and dare I say less violent than Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Real Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is a science fiction fantasy piece that imagines a world in future where all that is possible, where humans take control of giant robots to do battle on their behalf in the boxing ring. But those looking for robot fight after robot fight might be better off with watching the Transformers trilogy from start to end, since you only get a handful of robot battles, with the bulk being montaged away in the midsection and the final fight even, which leaves behind an aftertaste of being short changed on the entertainment front, since we're like the spectators on screen, ready to see some hard hitting action from the get go.Instead this film takes on a more human dimension, which is rather formulaic if you strip away the robot and machine component. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, an ex-boxer turned robot gladiator who travels from arena to arena with his machine to fight the odd match for money, with little luck since his limited funding means a pile of debt and little else to spruce up his robot with any upgrades. To compound the problem, he gets to hook up with his 11 year old son Max (Dakota Goyo) he never knew, and forms a testy relationship fueled by stubbornness from both parties, which you know will turn for the better with their discovery of Atom, a sparse sparring robot they found in a junkyard.It plays on the human themes of courage and never giving up when in pursuit of something, which of course gets translated via Atom in its many fights in the ring, designed to take plenty of hits, yet always having something extra within itself to stand up and continuing doing what it's meant to do. Through the inanimate object both father and son start to bond - Max being the convenient kid tinkerer of parts fueled by his belief and idealism, and Charlie bringing experience in fighting to the table, both becoming partners as they take on whatever gigs that come their way, until an outburst by Max meant a shot at the world title against the incumbent champion Zeus, funded by what seemed to be Russian money and Japanese expertise, a plot development you'll see coming very expectedly.Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo share a wonderful chemistry together that worked wonders for the film, and especially Dakota for his ability to come off quite naturally without being in awe of his more illustrious co-star. Jackman continues to build his filmography with appealing, alpha-male type characters that never cease to put a wrong foot in, having the honour of being trained by the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard to prepare for his role as a boxer. Evangeline Lily plays Charlie's girlfriend and the daughter of Charlie's trainer in his days of being a boxer, and Anthony Mackie was severely under-utilized as a bout organizer and punter. Subplots involving a custody battle, and gangsters to whom Charlie owed money to were quite unnecessary, if not to pause the film a little to fill in the space between the robot fights.The designs of the robots were definitely the highlight of the film, with names mirroring the ability the robots possess, and the animatronics were top notch naturally, with motion capture employed to detail the bouts. Plenty of thought went into the mechanics of the machines, from wireless control panels to components unique to each robot thanks to cannibalizing of others. Unique to Atom is its shadowing ability, since its built as a sparring bot, heavy set to allow for plenty of punishment, and like a sparring partner can mirror one's exact movements, which presents an angle of argument that machines that have that human touch, is probably blessed with the best of both worlds. I won't be surprised if Atom will get inducted into the annals of great cinematic robots one day for its endearing exploits in Real Steel.Artificial intelligence versus human intelligence, awareness and experience is something that recurs in each of the featured battles, and in the real world, this challenge is something that continues to intrigue researchers to one day play God and create something that can mimic our human mind and decision making close enough. From defeating world champions in chess and Jeopardy participants, no doubt the computer on board can defeat a human opponent, but as far as I'm aware this competitive advantage has not reached a more physical arena, at least not yet to the level as shown in this film, but it will be intriguing if one day we do get there.A glaring plot point I cannot reconcile will involve the super-robot Zeus which was touted to be the best of breed with being autonomous in learning from mistakes and from its opponents in real time. Alas we don't see much of those, if at all, in the film taking effect, which makes it a severe system flaw in failure of execution, or the usual marketing talk in building up hype, which is common in the real world. Which serves to explain that while machines can perform rote functions perfectly, humans will still always have the upperhand with creativity and innovativeness almost always worked into our solutions.But don't let that detract you from this entertaining crowd pleaser coming from director Shawn Levy who knows a thing or two about crafting broad based films that appeal, even if it does follow a repackaged formula - tell me if you don't see similarities with Sylvester Stallone's Over The Top about a father and son, and in the competitive arena of arm wrestling - exploiting the popularity of robots in film in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a talented cast. It certainly has many good moments however, the effects are superb, Hugh Jackman delivers an inspired performance and plays his character in a very realistic manner. The film felt very bloated, it had science fiction, it had boxing, it had drama, it has a difficult father-son relationship, they probably thought they were being clever by featuring all these elements, but it simply made it hard to focus or even truly care about any of them. The relationship with Jackman's character and his son easily could have been a powerful and uplifting part of the story, which it certainly wanted to be, but Max was a very unlikeable character, he was a brat and was ungrateful for everything his dad did to win his affection, I didn't care for this character and thought this movie would have been better without him. Though it certainly has its moments, Real Steel is mostly an over the top and messy film that you would be better off avoiding. A former boxer finds his luck challenged when his estranged son teams up with him to construct a champion robot fighter. Best Performance: Hugh Jackman</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman is too likable to be a failed father, while the son is just simply very annoying. I can hardly bear the son because he is arrogant, rude and have little respect for others. As for the plot, it is predictable to the point that you could tell the whole story accurately after watching it for twenty minutes. I was disappointed by "Real Steel".

Unfortunately, the film tries to be cool and has pretty awful dialogue that distracts the viewer from watching robots fight each other. Sure, the story is basically Rocky with robots, but what person in their right mind Wouldn't want to see that, if only the film is well made.

		<shortDescription>What's not to like about fighting robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-6/10Real Steel is an action movie containing not only boxing robots, Wolverine and good effects, but also a truly thought out plot that may not be too original in fairness but still a nice enough movie in any case. With high octane fights and acting not too bad to say this is made up with lots of CGI, The producers of this film really don't do a bad job in getting it all together and one of them executive producers is none other than Steven Spielberg. The film itself is a good length and although it made me feel slightly sleepy at times, it still conjures up good things. Hugh Jackman is OK as the main character Charlie and his son played by Dakota Goyo is actually well cast, as Goyo seems to fit well with the story and he could be a young actor to look out for in the future. Evangeline Lilly is charming as ever and although not at her full potential as an actor here, she still brings a certain air of calm headed coolness and seems a refreshingly different pace in the film.Shawn Levy directs this and his eye is not immediately on point it can seem and parts can be a little, say dodgy with too much action in certain parts but then none at all for a good length of time. I felt the heavy metal score placed down on this film was not one that drew me into the fighting, it only caused me to want the fight to end but I can see for some that they would find it more exhilarating than me. It is written well and the two guys who do the screenplay(Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven) don't hurt the movie but don't provide any assistance to the already seen type of plot.The effects are one thing that stand out in this movie and on reflection they are very nice and it's no wonder it got an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. It may seem or feel that the effects could over shadow the true feeling in the film but I felt any emotion the characters show is shown well enough through all the big budget stuff. It's not over dramatic storytelling(although the ending without spoiling is well, cheesy cheesy and more cheese), you'll notice if you see how the movie starts slow but really picks up a pace and although not rushing into it's ending, seems to want to finish without a bang.My review may seem as if I did not enjoy this, or maybe even like I liked this much more than I did but in truth I found it kind of OK and although not quite Good, still acceptable in the vast CGI action movie catalogue, that seems to get bigger every year. I gave it an OK-ish feeling review and that may seem harsh and I know for sure that some people will read this and completely disagree with what I have been saying but you have to like action to like this, not just Sci-Fi story telling, you have to like straight all out fighting. The film has true heart there is no doubt, one last thing I want to say about this is that you can feel for those involved and Hugh Jackman although maybe not at his absolute best, still draws you in. Give it a go even if you don't enjoy all out action because it may just surprise you how much you actually liked it, not easy to like but possible and it is wrong to say only a certain demographic would enjoy this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie Until The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From beginning to mostly end this movie has a subtle way of getting to the punch and then it delivers time and time again with the fight scenes. Real Steel delivers in the same way/formula as any Rocky movie, any underdog movie, and it's exciting to watch. It leaves you smiling as you root for the father and son underdogs. But then the ending comes and the word of the day becomes C for Cheese. Real Steel does not deliver the goods with the ending. It becomes too forced/contrived and cheesy as heck. This movie was about a 9 for me until the ending. However, overall, it's a pretty good movie and worth the watch. Also, you can never go wrong watching the beautiful and stunning Evangeline Lilly either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feel good yarn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think I'd like Real Steel. In fact when I popped it on, I was sure I'd be witching it off after 15 minutes. But in the end I was rooting for the little underdog robot fighter, despite there's not one original bone in the movie.What it boils down is, that Real Steel is a feel good movie. It knows everything in it has been done before in sports movies and father/son bonding stories. But at the same time the movie manages to do those all so familiar plot twists and turns pretty well and with ease many other movies, that aren't about robot boxing and sons looking to bond with their estranged fathers, simply aren't able to do.So, after doubtful start, I was, in the end, in a pretty good mood. Every plot element I had guessed before hand, but despite the ending that is riffing Rocky and pretty much every underdog sports movie, the movie had made a big smile on my face. It isn't a masterpiece, but it is a fun little movie, that aims to make you feel good, because in the end everyone learns a lesson and a sun peeks from behind the clouds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice action for the family viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is another fatherhood thing, a common theme for family oriented movies. And the story gets more in common with the more recent family movie where the father figure is told as a reluctant, if not in denial, at first as a daddy. The developed story goes on as the common fatherhood movies, where the father and the kid finds the one thing they like in common and build relationship and bond more on it, despite it being a long shot, and eventually wins out the long shot. What's good about this one is that, unlike most other fatherhood movies where it's only the father that gets to do the struggle while the kid only shouts from behind to lift his spirit up, this movie presents that actually the kid can do something too. Jackman, as always, played this one nicely. It's good to see Dakota Goyo can balance the aura of Hugh Jackman. Also it's nice too Evangeline Lily's earlier works here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is robot boxing with a mixture of Rocky and another Stallone vehicle, Over the Top which was about arm wrestling and Stallone bonding with his son.Hugh Jackman plays a loser of a robot boxing hustler who ends up looking after his son that he once abandoned, not before selling him to the boy's aunt's husband at first. However before handing him over he gets to spend a few weeks with him and they come across an old robot which his son finds and fixes up and they start to win some fights.The film is cheesy as hell. Dakota Goyo is decent enough but the script makes him an irritating twerp, its not the actor's fault that the script is lame. This is a kid whose mum has just died yet he seems to be high as a hill of beans!The CGI and robot fight action is very good, I even find the kid dancing with the robot charming but it steals too much from Rocky. The climax even steals from the Ali v Foreman, Rumble in the Jungle.The film starts off very badly, Jackman's character is also charmless at the beginning and of course father and son do eventually bond. However it does feel too much like a big budget kids film more appropriate for the Disney channel.</fullReview>

Even the well done CGI and Hugh Jackman couldn't save this for me; sappy, clichéd, and overacted in a very Disney sort of way.It's a father-son story about a former boxer turned fight promoter (Jackman) who trains robots after humans are replaced by them in the ring. Jackman also tries to establish a relationship with his estranged son Max while they assemble and train the next robotic champion of the world. As an FYI this is listed as a "sci-fi sports drama" which is a movie genre I can't say I've ever heard of before.11.13</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer to 'Real Steel' I have to confess to being more than a little excited. Sadly, I have long since realised that I like 'low-brow' films and the concept of big robots smacking seven shades of sparkplugs out of each other while under the watchful eye of Wolverine, did kind of appeal to me (especially in the light of the disaster that was the Transformers money-spinning bandwagon).Therefore I waited in trepidation for this film to be realised. Then, when it finally came out, critics started using words like 'heart' and 'father/son bonding' when talking about it. That was the point when my expectations severely lowered. I didn't want to watch some sort of coming-of-age drama. I wanted to see droids' pro-wrestling or whatever it should have been.And so I ended up not really caring when or where I finally got round to seeing Real Steel.Amazingly, it contains both. There was plenty of bot on bot smackdown and a healthy dose of human-interest as Wolverine (oh, all right, Hugh Jackman) learns to love and look after his son of eleven years who he's only properly met (due to the boy's mother dying unexpectedly).Okay, so my only gripe is that Real Steel is a little long. Personally, I would have trimmed down the human side and focused on droids stomping on each other from a great height. But, at no time did I want to fast forward the human stars.Stephen Spielberg is among the behind-the-scenes people. I just wonder why he never bothered to make Transformers like this? Don't expect wall-to-wall action. Don't expect wall-to-wall sentiment. It actually splits the two quite well. Hopefully they'll make a sequel where Wolverine gives his droid some claws. Now that'll be worth the price of a cinema ticket any day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would watch almost anything starring Hugh Jackman, I saw almost because I wouldn't bother suffering myself through anything he doesn't have a leading or substantial role in. That said, I embarked on this journey without so much as a synopsis for this tale of futuristic boxing robots but was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained. Not as big or as flashy as 'Transformers' or as futuristic as'Tron' but at least the robots looked real enough to be believed and Jackman is a strong enough leading man with the acting chops to carry a film of this magnitude on his shoulders. Its sub-plot reminded me so much of a typical Spielberg-esque formulaic father-son relationship saga which is one of the many elements this film borrows from the many with similar story lines that have come before it but that's okay I guess, most Hollywood films borrow elements from other films as well. Evangeline Lily co-stars and is there to provide eye-candy in yet another typical stereotypical role (don't get me wrong she's a decent actress but you wouldn't miss her if she wasn't in the film) as the believe-it-if-you- will-tough-talking daughter of Jackman's boxing coach.</fullReview>

It was really a paint by number script writing process.Jackman is okay in the film, and on the Child Actor Annoying scale, (Jake Lloyd of the Phantom Menace being a 10) the kid in this movie rates about a four.Oh, I do love the whole "Rocky" like ending that sets us up for a sequel if they decide to do one.

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the beginning of the movie but it quickly became cheesy and strangely familiar. Basically it's just Over the Top with robots! What annoyed me the most was the way the kid behaved. He just lost his mom but never shows any sadness about it and he acts like a spoiled brat behaving way beyond his 11 years.I also would have liked to see more depth when it comes to the robots. In some scenes it's suggested that they have a soul and that they're aware of themselves and the people around them but it never goes further than that which I think is a missed chance. It would have been very interesting if they would have, for instance, done something with free will or lack thereof when it comes to being sent off to fight and often "die" just to entertain humans. Another thing that bothered me was that apparently the only things that we as human beings seem to have accomplished in the future is the creation of fighting robots, an extra window in trucks and see through screens on phones and computers. I guess this is really a movie aimed for kids and I think they will probably enjoy it. But for me, as an adult, it really lacked and the only thing I liked was the way the robots looked. It could have been so much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we look at the cast first: Hugh Jackman was brilliant as ever and was also a major reason why I watched this movie. Kevin Durand is awesome as well, you hate him, yet you find him appealing. Evangeline Lilly doesn't really play a big part in the movie, but she does it well.Dakota Goyo. Now he played his role perfectly, he was convincing, there were emotions, but... he is the star of the show. And we all know what that means. Yup, its a kid film. Directors really need to understand that a 12 year old isn't as mature as a 30 year old and doesn't act in the same way. And writing a script, where a child has the same capacity and reactions as an adult... it just isn't natural. It looks like a child, but it isn't really. This really ruined the movie for me, not just this one, any movie that wants to have a child main star (see A Dolphins Tale, The Super 8, etc). The movie itself delivers great atmosphere - you will cheer, you skin will shiver, you will be excited, so emotions will be present, especially at the end. But when you see it through, you will get this feeling you've seen this move 6 times already. It really resembles any Rocky film made so far, just that there are now robots involved.Final conclusion: not bad, but not great. There are worse and there are better titles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bluray has been sitting in it's red Netflix mailer for nearly three weeks and I needed to deal with it. Glad I finally did.Setting aside a couple of quibbles (a contrived setup, circa 2011 automobiles everywhere ... except for that weird truck, and a few other annoyances) this was a fun and very decent film, er Movie.Jackman, who gets the masthead, does a decent job with his character; but Dakota Goyo, playing his estranged son, steals the show. The movie wouldn't have played nearly as well with a poor performance from "the kid" and Goyo - whoever he is - deserves props for a heartfelt and way cool performance.Evangeline Lilly also did a nice job in the girlfriend role and the romance stuff is peppered in just enough to not get too annoying. One wonders though, what the hell does she actually do - there's never a soul in her fathers old gym. Anyway - she fit well.I thought the CGI was wicked good; roger rabbit good. It folded in seamlessly, looked great, and there were only a couple of issues with the actors trying to play to the green screen (is it me or was Jackman way too close to Atom in sparring).Jackman was pretty, er, jacked for the film. Must have worked out like two months straight before the film. Helped the plot realism anyway.That dude James Rebhorn (Mr. Trask from Scent of a Woman) was in the film as well and he was actually decent, but he's like way too old to be the kid's step dad. Hope Davis must have married someone like way older than herself. Anyway, just a thought.Nods to Rocky, E.T., and Wall-e are not unevident, and there was an awful lot of product placement crap, but I guess you have to hedge your bets somewhat when you spend $110 large. They probably should have released this in the summer instead of October since it plays well to kids and adults alike. Atom - the robot - could have been a touch more bad-ass but I guess I'm glad he slid to the rear a touch in the grand scheme of things. The actors stood out more.Anyway, it was a good movie and I'm rating it a 7.</fullReview>

I seriously think the only reason they put robots in the movie at all was to lure people who enjoy sci-fi. Bad acting (sorry Hugh, we're cool, it wasn't your fault), bad script, and overall bad.....everything) In fact even the way the robots fight is ridiculous (they use remote controls).

		<fullReview>I am a big Hugh Jackman fan, hes not the best actor, but is the MOST likable personality in Hollywood, without a doubt. Such a grounded, perfect gentleman, an ideal format for a mans character, can t say enough positive things about him, hey, he DESERVES it, a true role model. I applaud his involvement to make something for the kids, however, this movie is definitely not for the kid in all of us. While trying not to be too critical, oh what the heck, lets just say this movie was a big LETDOWN. So much potential lost. For one thing, the robots sucked, all they did was batter each other with fists. It got boring, boring boring. Smash smash smash. The future was completely uninteresting. The relationship between him and the boy was less then emotional. I tried , tried tried to care care care. But what would have made this movie even more awesome was if it was set in a future that was actually more of a FUTURE. Like maybe setting this in the 23rd century, and having far more intricate robots that could do far more devastating things then just batter with fists. Kinda like that show on TV with the dueling robots that people make, only 200 years from now. THAT alone would have been far more interesting then a future set a few years from now. It wasn't even worthy of Disney. I so love Hugh, and I soooooooo wanted to like like like this movie. It could have been far more emotional, and I guess I expect expect expect a lot more as an avid moviegoer. Perhaps I am just too jaded jaded jaded, or perhaps this movie just sucked sucked sucked. What a waste of time time time. Then why am I writing this review? Its what you call a paradox paradox paradox. I guess I wanted to see the movie I saw in my head when I first heard about it. Save yourself the trouble. But I still love Hugh, no matter what. The worlds most perfect gentleman. Too bad, this movie could have been right up there with Star Wars, if they would have had a much more interesting future. Crap. Crap. Crap. Sigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has little to do with the concept of giant fighting robots. It's a trap of corniness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real steel is based heavily on the anime Plawress Sanshiro (aka Jumaru). The movie comes out very strong, (grity, flawed, cynical) in the middle stumbles(talk, talk, talk) and at the end crumbles miserably(Deus ex machina, corny, implausible end).I have three major gripes with this movie.One. At the beginning the kids mother dies and she is only mentioned again towards the end of the movie for one minute, nobody never shows any emotion regarding that mater or acts as he should(especially the kid).Two. Fahter and son bondage has no place eating so much time and eventually overtaking the theme of a movie like this. It was never done correctly in film because its not done in real life either. If things get like that they don't get fixed in real life, people just live with it, but I digress.Three. The fighting mechanics of human shaped, non AI robots wile they were explored in depth with Plawress Sanshiro and other anime in this movie are absolutely ridiculous. What are the standards? The rules to enter the ring? Nothing is ever said about the actual sport. How could an old training robot controlled by a kid defeat professional state of the art world champion robots? If you pout it in perspective it would be like a kid with his grandfathers old toy car would win the F1 championship of the world. It would be cool if there was a hidden power inside the robots (ala Xenogears) but its not. The control modes are also inverted in their usefulness. wile the Joypad is clearly the most superior control device, voice interface is presented as a better one, and ghosting (robot observing real human movements) being even less practical is presented as the ultimate control scheme(witch no one uses except the protagonists as a last resort of course). One star for a strong beginning, one for the robot dance and one for a few good fight scenes. Actually the only reason I wrote a review was the opportunity to mention Plawress Sanshiro, so that's it.

Jackman and Goyo interacted well together and their relationship anchors the film. It is only Evangeline Lilly who doesn't hold her own, but to her defense she isn't given much to do except where unflattering tee shirts and complain a lot about Charlie in the old days. I wish they had given her more to do; showed her technical expertise in helping Max with ATOM. I have to admit that I am not a boxing fan and thought that the fight scenes were not great. They should have channeled Gladiator more and Cinderella Man less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : REAL STEELMINI-REVIEW : It's Rock-em Sock-em Robots meets RockyRATING : See it in theaters (Rating System: "See it in theaters", "Wait for the instant download", "Don't waste your time")In the not-to-distant future, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is an ex- boxer who has turned to fighting remote-control robots. But these aren't robots like your Roomba or "Bot Wars" little bots. These are 1- ton, 8-foot tall behemoths. In this future, boxing has been outlawed and now only robots can fight in the big ring. Charlie is down on his luck and scrapes together spare robot parts and works his robots in small-town carnivals and flea markets.Charlie has an 11-year-old son, Max (Dakota Goyo) whom he has never seen. Max's mother has died and his aunt wants custody. This is fine with Charlie who makes a deal with the rich uncle : Charlie will take the boy for the summer so aunt and uncle can vacation in Italy in peace. In return, Charlie receives a large chunk of change that he can use to pay off his seedy loan sharks.Charlie and Max take up residence with Bailey Tallot (Evangelene Lilly) who is the daughter of Charlie's old trainer. She runs a training ring for new bots. On a trip to the robot junk yard, Max finds an old sparring bot (Atom) that still has some life in it. It turns out the robot can "shadow box" and can learn Charlie's ex-fighting skills. Max wants to enter Atom into the fights and convinces Charlie to take him on the circuit and win some fights. And we're off?"Real Steel" is a very formulaic, predictable, and immensely fun sports story. And like any good sports story, it's not just about the sport, but about the relationships surrounding it. In a season with films like "The Fighter," and "Warrior," "Real Steal" (with its PG-13 rating) is clearly aimed at younger audiences. Still as an adult, I still found the movie very entertaining with its fine performances and fast pace.Hugh Jackman plays the role of Charlie as an every-man, down on his luck and trying hard to make good. But he is impetuous. Max is played by Dakota Goyo and is intelligent and adorable. He walks the line between smart-alecky brat and wise-beyond-his-years. And he comes out very warm and endearing. Evangeline Lilly is little more than the dispenser of exposition and eye-candy. Which she does quite well.If you've seen any of the movies I've mentioned or "Rocky" you'll recognize the formula. But it is played out with exceptional special effects and warm characters. You'll be rooting for the underdog and booing the bad guys and smiling all the way through the final scene. For good acting, great special effects, a story we all have seen before and can't seem to get enough of, I recommend you "See it in theaters."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock'em Sock'em Robots Meets Rocky 1, 3 and 4, and Over the Top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall the movie was pretty decent. They played it very safe, and did not bite off more than it could chew. I think it will do well, simply because it didn't try to do too much. The writer should have some nice residuals coming.Outside of that, the movie seemed to have used a lot of Stallone movie references. In the final scenes, it almost copied Rocky 1, 3 and 4 to a "T". The way Atom was being beaten, then began his comeback from a single explosive hit; that was the Ivan Drago scene almost directly. The way Zeus began to tire after punching too much, was Clubber Lange in Rocky 3, and the whole idea of giving a nobody a chance to fight the champ,then losing by decision, is Rocky 1.The whole father son custody battle relationship thing and the mother dies, is almost like another Stallone movie called "Over the Top".The likely sequel almost seems predictable, just go watch Rocky 2, or perhaps we will get to see a new bot introduced and end up destroying Zeus similar to how Apollo was killed. Maybe Atom will become self-activating, maybe Atoms original maker will make an appearance presenting a much evolved version of Atom's model. It can go in a lot of directions all of them good, but I see much more ripping of the classics in the future additions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in a not-so-distant future where human fisticuffs are now passé and the new craze is all robot-boxing, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a washed-up ex-pugilist who struggles to make a living from getting his low-end robots into underground fights. Brash and shortsighted, Charlie pits his mechanical fighters against rivals that are impossible to defeat; no wonder he's buried in debt, and each of his robots badly destroyed. Just when things can't possibly get any worse, he's burdened with the responsibility of his estranged 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo), a stubborn kid who insists that Charlie rebuild an outdated scrap-yard robot named Atom, and train him for the fight circuit.Directed by Night at the Museum's Shawn Levy and produced by Steven Spielberg, Real Steel is equal parts noisy action movie, and father-son bonding drama. The boxing scenes are thrillingly filmed, including a classic David vs Goliath climax; it's the film's emotional journey that feels like pure cheese. Borrowing its blueprint from the classic sports film The Champ, father and son resolve their differences, the kid becomes a partner, his dad grows up, and everyone turns into a better person.A less charismatic actor might have collapsed under the weight of such formulaic writing, but Hugh Jackman holds on to his dignity till the very end, where he feeds every move to Atom by shadow boxing. Dakota Goyo has some endearing moments as the precocious Max, especially those bits where he teaches Atom some nifty dance steps. But if Real Steel works, it's purely and singularly on the strength of its hulking metal warriors that pack a solid, determined punch.I'm going with two-and-a-half out of five for Real Steel. The thunderous action alone makes up for the strictly standard storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate movies of such genre. I hate "Transformers", "X-Men" and almost all modern fantastic movies, but this film very touched me and i don't know exactly why. Maybe because it reminded me Stallone's old movies "Over the Top" and "Rocky", whose i had re-watching in my childhood many times. Maybe because it really very quality and closely the thought over project, that will can please every viewer and even very experienced. In "Real Steel" are excellent mixed sports drama, action, touching family story, special effects and kindness of old family movies, whose sometimes was filming Steven Spielberg long time ago. I very liked this movie and I with great pleasure will be re-watching its with my little daughter. I heard what will be going filming of sequel, and I'm frustrated because usually recently these ideas are complete disappointment for viewers but big money for producers. Although we will be hoping for the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, is it just me or this folks in Hollywood are trying hard to make all their movies most annoying these days? This movie was clearly a combination of Rocky and "Over the top", which both have been successful "feel good" movies. However, when you put in it the most annoying kid on the planet, play most annoying rap music all the time, use a lot of foul language and have grown people act like idiotic children, than I am not sure who's gonna fall for it. Cause I ain't, folks. I've seen too much of this stuff coming out of Hollywood lately. Are they trying to make us give up watching movies? Because after watching real steel, I am ready to give it all up. The whole institution. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, not necessarily badly made, however everything is played in such an annoying manner, that I am really wondering if they actually wanted to annoy the audience instead of pleasing it. Parts of the movie were emotional in a good way, however the annoying parts were so bad that I really felt overwhelmed by it. Not recommending, save your time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Robo-Boxing Family Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take Rocky (1976) and a plucky boy who appears to have more maturity or is more suited (as the script calls for) being the father of the typical movie father who abandoned his son, lost his custody of his son and who apparently never grew up (for most of the movie anyway).The son's character is a bit grating at times and takes the dominate role while his father almost appears to be witless and can't avoid being child (no wonder his wife divorced him). Unlike strong children, seemingly all girl leads such as in Where the Lilies Bloom (1971), Winter's Bones (2010), Fly Away Home (1996), The Secret of Roan Inish (1995), Little Miss Sunshine (2006) or for a strong boy role Hugo (2011) or Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close (2011), Dakota Goyo comes off cocky and full of himself from the movie script. One strong child male protagonist with a more balanced adult-child relationship can be found in The Cidar House Rules (1999). While such a character might delight to young kids, such enterprising in your face kids seem more like a daunting force for humiliation and embarrassment for adults, not of a parenting role model for parents to experience entertainment. Another young brash and sometimes uppity child character was found in the remake of True Grit (2010) though many found the movie among the best of the year and Winter Bones (2010) both young female leads.The best movies that seem to have children who are able to survive and prosper because they need to are reflected in such movies as The Secret Garden (1993), the animated Coraline (2009), or when children get to just explore and interact among themselves in both a childlike or adult way as in Stand By Me (1986), Holes (2003), or The Chronicles of Naria: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (2005), and more recently Super 8 (2011). Perhaps among the closest child-relational parallel movie to Real Steel may be the sci-fi children drama A Wrinkle In Time (2002) that has an nice balance of creativity, child-adult thinking mix and humor and drama and some of the best of young adult movies Whale Rider (2002) or The Lovely Bones (2009), The Tree of Life (2011), even the animated Incredibles (2004) or Spirited Away (2001).Another underdeveloped theme of this movie was the wasted potential the robotic-human interface dynamic which could have been used to an incredible affect with an almost A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) mystic that was overlooked. Even today, the animated standard of motion capture has already established that the technology exists even today to replicate what is being presented as come futurist sports game (which if the audience interest and investors were willing could become reality today). To its credit, Real Steel avoids the overly dramatic stereotypical divorced wife hysteria though more could have been developed to even make these scenes more potent. Too little was shown in the way of Atom's rise through the ranks and then the sudden the title fight ultimatum and its resolution seemed overly simple and the antagonist too unnecessarily two-dimensional.The net result is another interesting but not particularly innovative nor creative movie that uses by the numbers' plot points and a boy character and using a robotic theme that could have generated a new level of experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the not too distant future, where humans no longer step in the ring, the fighting is left to robots, where there controlled outside the ring. Charlie(Hugh Jackman) who once had a promising career as a boxer, now takes a robot to certain gigs, in hopes to make extra cash. But his prize robot is destroyed in a match, to add to his troubles, he temporally gains custody of his son named Max(Dakoda Goyo), Max persuades Charlie to take him along, Charlie agrees. They both go to a junk yard, in hopes to put together a fighting robot. Max finds a rusty old robot, they both bring it back, clean it off, and give it name ATOM. Max wants to get him a fight, but Charlie tells him that it's not a fighting robot, it's just sparring partner. But Charlie and Max train it anyway, will this underdog triumph? An entertaining film, Hugh Jackman gives a pretty descent performance, not Oscar worthy, but good. So does Dakoda Goyo, he and Jackman play off each other perfectly. The robot Atom becomes an interesting character to watch also. All the other robots are also cool too. The robot fight scenes are also memorable. This is a cool film to watch, if you are into this kind of thing, then check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More "Cinderella Man" than "Transformer"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene of this movie is entirely unexpected ? laid-back country as background music to a truck cruising along a country road in near pitch dark, until light from a distant town appears. This is as contemporary as you can get although some critics indicate that the time frame is set in about a decade in the future. Hardly matters.As suggested in my summary line, this is a pugilistic movie that just happens to have robots in the ring, as proxies for human beings. This works at two levels. For the plot, it means that human boxing is outlawed and hence robots become substitute. For the real story, the protagonist is just as much in the ring even when he physically is not.Once you get through to accept the main premise (which is not difficult as the movie makers wisely did not make a fuzz at all about robot boxing but simply introduced it in a matter-of-fact manner), this is really a very familiar movie: reconciliation of a strayed father to a heavenly 11-year-old son, the boy's relationship with his pet robot which may very well have been a faithful dog, the David-Goliath confrontation of the underdog, a fallen man's redemption and realization of an unfulfilled dream?..you can probably find a few more.All these human stories are woven through four robot fights.We start with Charlie (Hugh Jackman, an uncustomary yet well performed role) bringing his impressive robot "Ambush" to a country fair to fight against a bull which was supposed to be 800 pounds but turns out to be 3,000. While Ambush became scrap metal and Charlie ran from his debts, news came that his abandoned girlfriend had died, leaving 11-year-old Max (Dakota Goyo, young "Thor", an actor now for whom the sky is the limit), whose custody he eventually "sold" to his sister Debra (Hope Davis, shamefully underused but still good to see) and her well-meaning husband for money to replace his robot. But he had to keep Max for a couple of months first, until the couple returned from a European trip.The second fight features a world-class boxing robot "Noisy Kid" that he bought back after its extensive world tour, looking very Japanese, and actually responding only to Japanese vocal instructions until reprogrammed by Bailey (Evangeline Lilly, radiating heart-melting warmth whenever she is on the screen), his old sweetheart and daughter of his late mentor. Through the preparation of Noisy Kid, animosity between estranged father and son started to evolve into bonding. But as a result of the adult's hasty decisions against the kid's mature cautioning, Noisy Kid got demolished by Midas, despite a good start. Another pile of scrap metal.The story really begins when Charlie saved Max from a near-fatal accident which was also instrumental to the kid's discovery of a G2 (i.e. second generation, near-obsolete) robot Adam that was designed only as practice partners (i.e. punching bag) of real fighter robots. Upon Max's insistence, Bailey and Charlie turned Adam into a respectable fighter with a winning streak in small circuits, culminating in a big league victory over the formidable "Twin City"' The ensuing development is predictable and does not require elaboration. The climatic fight was against the unbeatable mighty "Zeus", with a predictable uplifting finale, predictable yet marvellously exhilarating. Manipulative? Yes. Melodramatic? You bet. Nonetheless, this is an absolutely first class feel-good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Shawn Levy brought us the "Night at the Museum Movies" and I guess that's about the same audience he is after with this one. You probably won't get this comparison anywhere else, but "Dreamer" with Kurt Russell and Dakota Fanning is the film that this one most reminds me of - A spunky kid trying to prove everyone wrong in an against all odds competition. But I would not put this one at the level of Dreamer, which had better performances and a much better script.Hugh Jackman is a pompous, bombastic, self-centered hustler who tries to stay one step ahead of the collectors chasing him. He is always looking for a big score in the robot boxing game. What? You aren't familiar with this sport? Well the film is set in not too distant future, but the only thing I could tell had evolved was the technology of robots and video games. Jackman's world gets jacked up when his 11 year old son (Dakota Goyo) is thrust into his life after the mother dies. Yes, he has been an absentee father and the kid is ridiculously smart and cute.The two of them set off to make noise in the robot fight world with a dilapidated old model that they rescue from the junk yard. There are very few surprises along the way, but father and son develop a bond thanks to the success of their robot.Supporting work is provided by Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, Kevin Durand, Hope Davis and James Rebhorn. These are all competent actors who deliver fine work, but there is nothing special to the script. The one thing that makes this one a little different and will certainly appeal to 10-12 year old boys, is the fighting robots. The fights are action-packed and enjoyable to watch. They actually look like boxing matches ... only with metal creatures, who for some reason are built to mimic human movement.There have been countless other robot movies: Transformers, Bicentennial Man (Robin Williams), I Robot (Will Smith) and, of course, Lost in Space! Don't expect much more from this than those.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they keep ripping off the classics?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the theater with low expectations (so low, in fact, I was expecting, based on the trailers, that the movie wouldn't even start until they found Atom. This happened at 45 minutes after the stated movie start time with 15 minutes of trailers.) Now, I'm a fan of bad movies with good action. I've watched some incredibly skank films on the whiff of a rumor that there might be a halfway decent fight scene in it or it features an unknown (to the West) martial arts choreographer whose names rhymes with "Bang." I am also a connoisseur of giant robots. From MechCommander to Cyberball, I just can't get enough of them. Frankly, I would have been extremely happy if it was just a crappily animated CGI version of Rock'em, Sock'em Robots.But no. Not only was it crappily animated, it crappily animated other classic movie and real life boxing matches. Rocky I's ending? Check. Rocky III's ending? Check. Rocky IV's villain? Check. Ali's Rumble in the Jungle strategy? Check. To top it off, the overriding story (father vs estranged son) is straight out of Rocky V.As a fan of both martial arts (including boxing) and giant robots, I felt there was no way I could be disappointed in this film. What I wasn't counting on, however, was the sheer lack of imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts very well. It's funny and you will immediately catch one of it's core concepts: boxing robots.The action scenes throughout the movie are exciting. They're fun, intense and somewhat over the top, and yet they retain a good deal of gritty contest. It's a competent blend.The plot, however, won't impress. It's been done a million times and it has no effort of novelty. If you're familiar with underdog movies (Rocky), or if you watched cartoons and teenage movies as you grew up, you'll recognize each worn out scene, and each cartoonish villain showing contempt for the pair of heroes.The acting is good, but the lines and character development didn't help one bit. Although the characters are frequently relatable, they're also filled with cheap lines and riddling behavior, often too simplistic or contradictory, a few times baffling. I think what for a lot of disappointment was the few storyline gems it threw along, but they turned almost immediately abandoned or under-hatched, and it frequently feels undelivered.Watch this movie expecting to be carried away as the crowd roars around an amazing match. It's a fun CGI movie, with lots of cool fighting and cheering scenes.The companies' intention at selling toys is understandable, but it comes off somewhat disdainful, because you step into the theater expecting a movie (movies have stories), and you walk out feeling like you attended a Vegas' prizefighting night - be this good or ill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spielbergian movie with a lot of heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the time, if a film director hits the big time, it's usually that one of his films, early on in his career, has made a huge smash and given him status and power. This is the case for people like Spielberg, Lucas, Coppola, Shyamalan, Cameron, etc... However, if there's one director that has been steadily moving up the ranks of the Hollywood over the past ten years or so, starting out small and tackling on bigger, more ambitious and more prestigious projects as he goes on, it's definitely Canadian filmmaker Shawn Levy.The man started out directing episodes of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel shows such as Animorphs or The Famous Jett Jackson in the late nineties, moved on to directing kids from those types of shows in their big screen efforts, such as Big Fat Liar and Cheaper By The Dozen and used the success of these films to bag ever more prestigious comedies, from The Pink Panther remake to Night At The Museum to Date Night. And while critics have mocked him and dismissed him, calling him an untalented hack, he has now graduated to a big, science-fiction blockbuster produced by Steven Spielberg himself, Real Steel.Like a couple of other recent sci-fi releases, I Am Legend and The Box, Real Steel is based on a story by celebrated genre writer Richard Matheson. Well it is actually loosely based, or as the credits put it "partly based" on it. Indeed, Real Steel basically only retains the fact that robot boxers have replaced human boxers in the future from Matheson's story, which is probably a good thing as its twist ending is now so widely known.Real Steel takes place in the very near future, barely ten years from now. Not much is different other than the fact that robot boxing is one of the most popular sports in the world and the phones, computers &amp; co are much more advanced. Charlie Kenton, played by Hugh Jackman, is a former boxer turned small-time "robot trainer". Constantly in debt, he tours the US in his truck, looking for fairs where he can have his robot fight for cash. Things get complicated for him when the son he never cared about enters his life, finds an old robot in a scrap-heap and decides to have him fight.Earlier this year, media outlets all over made a big fuss about the fact that Steven Spielberg had produced Super 8, which in their mind made Super 8 as much a Spielberg film as a JJ Abrams film. For some reason no such fuss has been made about the three other films Spielberg personally produced this year, be it Transformers 3, Cowboys &amp; Aliens or Real Steel. Interestingly though, Real Steel is just as Spielbergian as Super 8, if not more. At the world premiere of the film in Paris, Hugh Jackman told us how the film was about a son and his father, and how the young Dakota Goyo is the heart of this film. I initially scoffed at this but when the film ended a couple of hours later I knew he was speaking the truth. The science-fiction robot ass-kicking element of the film is just a sheen under which the real subject shines through: the relationship between a father and his son.Real Steel is actually a sports movie. The fact that it is about boxing robots is essentially irrelevant and simply serves to give it an identity and a cool factor. It could have been about human boxing, football, baseball, car racing, whatever, and the story wouldn't have changed, which is in my mind one of the film's big strengths. The story of Real Steel isn't particularly original, but it is instead a classic story, that speaks to our primal emotions as human beings. It is a David vs Goliath story that had the packed theater cheering, clapping and reacting like I've seldom seen a movie audience react.The film is beautiful to look at, the fights are cool and the acting is of high caliber. Danny Elfman's music is effective but not particularly original and will remind you partly of his "emotion theme" for The Kingdom and partly of every sports movie music ever made. The rest of the music is mostly comprised of Eminem songs, apparently the most popular singer in the future. Contrarily to what another reviewer here said, I found the ending to be realistic and hugely satisfying.The big difference between Super 8 and Real Steel is that while Super 8 is perhaps more enjoyable "in the moment" due to it being more high concept and having more stuff going on all the time, like everything JJ Abrams does it seems to lack in something and is somewhat forgettable. Real Steel, despite featuring many cold, metal robots, as a warm, beating heart at its core and for that I say: well done, Shawn Levy, well done.</fullReview>

Now working as a small-time promoter, Charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters, barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next. After hitting rock bottom, Charlie reluctantly teams with his estranged son, Max (Dakota Goyo), to build and train a championship robot for a last shot at redemption.and now rocky review.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), a small-time boxer from working- class Philadelphia, is arbitrarily chosen to take on the reigning world heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), when the undefeated fighter's scheduled opponent is injured.

		<fullReview>I kept on waiting for a "ghost in the shell" plot that never materialized. I don't have a problem with the father/son story, but remote controlled robots as a big time event is too silly for me. Perhaps if they had gone a little closer to reality and featured a father/son robot story based on what has already been done in robot fighting, i.e. Battle Bots, and kept it small time I would have accepted it. But I really needed the kid's bot to turn out to be another Sonny, from I, Robot; or B1-66ER of The Matrix; or Andrew of Bicentennial Man; and to give that line of the story a lot of face time. At the end it seems clear that Atom, the robot, was indeed working autonomously but it comes too little too late. (Also, it's not super clear weather or not this is a robot with a human soul, or 'Ghost', or simply a learning computer AI being slightly evolved...).Also, "Who, Boy, let's fight a bull!" not being a tragedy but a hokey way to introduce the father's losing streak? Not cool. You want to feature CG animal abuse, fine, but you don't treat it like fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I put off seeing this movie a couple of years because if you've seen the trailer you almost have seen the film. The story is one big fat lump of predictability. It just goes straight to the end without any twist, turn or unexpected event. Jackman plays his stereotypical roll well and the Visual Effects (the reason I did see the film) are done excellently well. The CG robots are almost indistinguishable from the animatronic ones. But besides that they just rehashed one of the blueprint scripts from the vault and added nothing to the genre, cinema or the art of filmmaking in general. This movie might have some value to families with kids or kids themselves (I guess they are the target audience) who aren't already jaded by the output of the clone factory named Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising (in a good way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a year or so ago, and I had low expectations for it. I didn't think such an abstract and unrealistic plot could have been made into such a great film.I began watching this and soon became rather bored with the whole bull versus robot scene and the whole boring, unneeded bits. But then WHAM! I was soon engrossed when that little boy rescued that robot from the scrapyard. It went from being n average, run-of-the-mill movie into one of my favourite movies at that time.When it finished, I had become so attached to the characters and so hateful towards the guy who beat up the father and son (when he was taken off screen and beaten up, I was almost as happy as when Dolores Umbridge was captured by the centaurs(Harry Potter)!) that I had a lump forming in my throat(joy, not sorrow) when the film ended!Overall, a great film to watch with the older members of your family/ friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky-Sock 'em Robots! OK, that's been used before, but so has the plot. It still works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of total disclosure, I see that someone had the same idea watching this film: Rocky-Sock 'Em Robots. On the surface, this looks like someone just decided to take the old Rock-'Em Sock-'Em Robots and graft it to every boxing movie cliché out there. And they did! Danged if it doesn't hook you, though! Despite the clichés, despite the "been there, done that" feel, it still has heart, thanks to a fine cast.Sports movies are all about the clichés: the underdogs who challenge the champs and earn some respect (Rocky, Bad news Bears, etc...), reaching down to find that spark inside (all or them), and following a dream. The reason those elements are in those films is that they are all part of the human drama. They ring true in almost everyone's life. That's the secret here. We recognize that these are the same old clichés, but we care enough about the characters to buy into the clichés. That is the essence of drama, whether it is stage, screen, the playing field, or the ring. It's why people watch pro wrestling, even knowing that the outcome is predetermined. It's why people watch boxing, even though the promoters manipulate who gets a shot at the title. It's why people watch movies, even though they know it's just a bunch of actors and special effects. Good actors/performers make you forget all of that and care about the characters and this movie has that in spades.Make no mistake, this wasn't likely to win any Oscars; but, so what? The purpose of drama is to entertain and illustrate ideas. No one said it had to be deadly serious. The film delights in its absurdity. It has fun with it, adding some spectacle to a straightforward story, just like a bit of showmanship to increase the gate of a fight. Showmanship alone, however, isn't enough if the skills aren't there and the cast has them in spades. What you see are some nice character performances, not star-roles. Hugh Jackman has leading man looks, but a character actor's sensibilities. He inhabits the character of Charlie. You know he is going to bond with the kid; but watching Jackman work makes it a treat. Dakota Goyo is the kid who wants to see his hero fight; but the hero isn't his robot, it's his dad. Yeah, it's an old story, whether it's Jackie Cooper or Ricky Schroeder. The common factor is that those kids were good and so is Goyo. The rest of the cast fill their roles well; whether friend, enemy, love interest, comic relief, or exposition.This is a good, solid film. Nothing new here; just good, old fashioned crowd-pleasing entertainment. I'll take that over mindless CGI spectacles, ponderously serious "drama," vulgar comedies with sophomoric humor, or cloying sentimentality. In the old days, this would be a B-movie; but the world could use some solid B-movies. Lord knows, the A-movies of today rarely deliver this much honest humanity and entertainment.</fullReview>

It has took me a long time to understand that but this movie help. you can learn a lot from watch movie like Real Steel. Many life lessons. Know that you have to be willing to take your bumps and lumps and keep going. These movie tell the story of the ultimate underdog. No one believe that he can make it. The Hero get the chance to prove the world wrong. This is about a man his son that he has never met before and a robot name Adam. They find these old robot and little do they know it would change there future and life forever. They take this training bot. He keep takes on the best in the w2orld and keep getting better. When they get really good have a chance to win it all. These movie is really good. I thought it was going to be lame. Then I show it and like to watch it ever time it come on TV. It is very good if you don't have to like robots to watch the movie. This is a movie that will speak to people that are look at as under Dogs. Because we have a will of steel.</fullReview>

The lines across the film are spot on. Sure, the secondary plot is very lightweight, but who cares? For the type of movie this wants to be... its atom! It hits the spot every time. I thought the acting added value and the whole father/son, albeit via a robot game evolved through the movie. It went from a very distant and 'so what' to warm, sentimental scenes. Very good acting. On the dialogue, some of the 'You sold me', '100 miles for a kiss - Was worth it', they are just peppered lightly to life and amuse. Brilliant.</fullReview>

The plot progression is predictable and the performances are okay. However, a few magic moments and the novelty of the "arena" adds to the uniqueness of this film. While not a must-watch, Real Steel is a pleasant watch nonetheless, which gets one rooting for the underdog (yet again) at some stage ? sooner or later!</fullReview>

I really liked the part where Aunt Deborah comes to get Max and Charlie tells Max that Max forgot who Charlie was. When in reality Charlie grew up some and become almost a whole other person. Though I have to say the ending was my favorite part where Charlie tries to tell Max how he feels and Max says the secret is safe with him. I enjoyed the action of the robot boxing, but liked the human side of it better. I'm not much of a boxing fan. It was well shot, edited and directed, and all the actors were great. If you haven't seen this film yet, I suggest you go rent it. It's totally worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transformers With A Heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is actually a pretty good movie, better than what I was led to believe. I thought it would be all brawn, but no brain. Surprisingly, this testosterone-filled film really does have a big heart amongst all the fighting robots. This movie plays big on family relationship themes as our protagonist struggles to maintain a relationship with his son.Shawn Levy's film is set in the future, where robot boxing has replaced human boxing. Charlie Kenton is a former boxer who found a beaten-up robot he figures he can use to get him back in the game. But to his dismay, he has a son he has to deal with. Despite their early struggles, they must rely on each other if they want to win.Hugh Jackman is good as always even if he is a bit grumpy. For whatever reason, I felt he would suddenly morph into Wolverine. Dakota Goyo was okay but I felt he was very annoying by the way he kept on screaming. The supporting cast is pretty good but I especially liked Kevin Durand who can certainly play evil as he did with his promoter role.Overall, this is a fun film to watch. Of course with sports elements being incorporated in the film, there are some clichéd moments. But this film is more about the father-son relationship and how it strengthens over the course of the film. The visual effects are great and I liked the robot designs and the way they combated each other. Believe it or not, this movie will try to play with your human emotions so tissues may be needed. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the not too distant future, 'Real Steel' tells the story of an ex-boxer turned struggling robot boxer promoter (in a world where robot boxing is a popular sport) and his estranged son who recently lost his mother. As his son takes an interest in robots, Charlie sees hope at a second chance in resurrecting his life. I was excited about the robot boxing theme and even though it did sound like another 'Transformers' type action flick (I was hoping it wouldn't be that bad), I wanted to see it.As a result, 'Real Steel' turned out to be a pleasant surprise. There's plenty of action, emotion and humour. The robots are awesome. They look great and the action sequences are brlliantly choreographed. The visuals are impressive. Even the beauty of the cross-country landscape is excellently captured. The development of the characters and the relationship between them is very displayed.Hugh Jackman's chemistry with Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo is outstanding. This is among his better performances. Dakota Goyo too shines in his role as he delivers a balanced performance. Evangeline Lilly makes the best of her limited screen time and she is superb.To sum it up, 'Real Steel' is fine entertainment. It's always nice when a movie turns out to be a pleasant surprise. One of the better action films from recent Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic prize fighting, using really rugged robots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the whole movie was a bit cheezy, but my wife liked it a lot, which surprised me some. Still, I was entertained and give the movie a favorable rating for the characters.Set in the near future (one old discarded robot was said to be from 2014) Hugh Jackman is Charlie Kenton, former prize fighter who now owns a fighting robot. He is always trying to win a few bucks with his robot, but he has a short attention span. While fighting and getting the best of a bull at a rodeo of sorts, a pretty face in the crowd distracts him just long enough that the bull destroys his robot.Things change dramatically for him when he finds out his former wife just died and now he has a 10-yr-old son to attend to, Canadian actor Dakota Goyo as Max Kenton. Max's aunt and uncle want him, but ask Charlie to care for him while they take a long-planned trip to Italy. During this period Charlie and Max have an opportunity to bond, sort of.The third key character is Canadian actress Evangeline Lilly as Bailey Tallet. She now runs the gym that her deceased dad had founded, and she is sweet on Charlie. Hope Davis and James Rebhorn play the aunt and uncle.So, what's the movie about? It is really about Charlie actually growing up, becoming more responsible, with his son Max as a catalyst. They do this by their journey together to whip this discarded robot, old technology, into fighting shape by actually teaching it how to box like an accomplished prize fighter.The DVD extra has an interesting 5-minute feature on the robots. While there is some CG used much of what we see are real robots operated by puppeteers which Spielberg insisted on to bring reality not only to the finished product, but to help the actors who then were acting with a robot instead of just blank space to be filled in later.</fullReview>

I love that woman, but could the role be played by anyone else? Actually it could have been played by literally anyone.But this shouldn't really break the movie for you.

		<fullReview>I am going to be brief- one of the best movies in 2011!Hugh J's performance in this movie is flawless. Playing the role of the father and an unsuccessful robot boxer, he meets his son, Max (played by Dakota G). Soon, their relationship blossoms together with their new sparing robot, Atom- how i wish i have Atom as a friend, that lead them into the world championship.The movie begins with plenty of development and foreshadow, making the movie very predictable. But the excitement and the journey from where they were to where they are at the end was spectacular. A movie with numerous layers, Real Steel surely did succeed at all levels. The fight scenes were well executed- i was at the edge of my seat, clenching my fist and cheering all the while.It touched straight to the core- that i teared up in the end. It accomplished bittersweet moments effortlessly; and while some other movies fail to make the hero loses and wins at the same time, Real Steel did it in style.I highly recommend Real Steel because really, it's as good as any metal out there!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie. Fun for all ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is easy for films like Real Steel to give in to sloth and rely on CGI robot fights and Hugh Jackman's presence for an easy buck. To my delight, Real Steel doesn't opt for the lazy approach to blockbuster films and pulls off the whole production with a great script, brilliant acting, amazing directing and the best CGI robots I can recall seeing.Considering the premise for the film sounds more like an feature-length ad for a line of action figures and video games and that it is taking a big risk by selling itself to both an adult male market and a children's market, it really is impressive that the result is such a passionate and endearing story about a father and son.Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo feel perfect side by side and the latter is living proof that child actors aren't always obnoxious distractions from an otherwise good action flick.I also have to commend the film for going for a slightly different and original dynamic regarding boxing films. Hugh Jackman plays a washed up, past his prime, jaded boxer who has lost all his aspirations due to the shift in fandom from humans to robots. Dakota Goyo plays Hugh's estranged son who has good reasons for hating his father. Naturally, Goyo shows a spark of talent in the field of robo-boxing and the two join forces for a shot at the title of world champions. The twist is that everything revolves around Jackman and his journey of rediscovery, coming to terms with his misfortunes and mistakes while mending his relationship with Goyo; it is a much braver and refreshing storyline than the typical Rocky formula: old guy teaches new guy his old tricks.If you are looking for a film to watch with the family, this is probably it. The subject matter is approached with all the respect and seriousness you could ask for while the larger narrative is fast-paced and simplistic assuring it can captivate the majority of audiences.</fullReview>

It could have added a fight with a lady Bot with Amazon style, which could have spiced it up.I just got a small conceptual error (may be considered as a tincy vincy glitch)....In the last scene,when ATOM won the boxing match, Charlie and ATOM were in shadow mode, Charlie keeps his son on one shoulder and holding him with him right arm, while he raises his left arm in air....What I fail to understand is how ATOM raised both its ARMS, when Charlie raised only one, when both of them are in shadow mode ????</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be junked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Essentially, REAL STEEL is a sci-fi spin on the whole ROCKY-era boxing movie, with robot fighters replacing human participants. And it's as juvenile and uninteresting as it sounds; this kind of premise could only work well in a quirky B-movie (I'm thinking of stuff like ROBOT JOX or the various Japanese flicks) as it feels staid and bland in a Hollywood context.Australian star Hugh Jackman works hard playing the main character, a boxing coach now fallen on hard times (gee, where have we heard that one before?). All goes well until he ends up saddled with one of those bratty kid characters, the type that American housewives seem to love while the rest of the world hates. From this point in it all gets very predictable, with good guys and bad painted in broad strokes and a singular lack of originality throughout.The highlights of the film should, of course, be the fight sequences, but I found them all very predictable. The CGI effects are excellent but it doesn't matter when the subject matter is so derivative and clichéd. You know exactly what's going to happen right at the outset and at no point does the film surprise you in any way. The really good boxing movies, like THE CHAMP or the early ROCKY films, are winners because they expose the heart of the fighters giving it their all. These robots have no character, thus the experience is a soulless one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was it cheesy and cliché? At times. Were there plot holes everywhere? Yes. Is it totally unrealistic and does it disregard basically everything physics has established? Check and check. But despite it's many shortcomings, I love this movie. First off, it's got great action. The blend of animatronics, motion capture, and CGI comes off really well and the fight scenes coupled with a good boxing soundtrack get your heart pumping and man do I feel inspired every time I see this movie. Jackman, Goyo, and Lilly all do very well with the roles they are given and manage to make the clichéd roles not only bearable, but enjoyable. All the side characters were well done too, without anyone coming off as to over the top. Also, it's great to have a (mostly) clean movie. A few swear words, one human fight scene that might be a bit intense for younger kids, and a couple kisses, but overall this movie is appropriate for everyone, something which is increasingly rare these days. But I think the real reason I've watched this movie again and again is that it has heart. You cheer for Charlie and Max and Atom not because they are cast as the good guys or even the underdogs, but because you love them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We should watch this from another side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a movie, I am sorry to say that "Real Steel" is not a brilliant one. No matter from the plots or the process of the story, it is a stereotype. However, as a movie, at the same time, as well as a communication tool between the director and the audience, it is a successful master piece.The same as other boxing films, have come into the screen times by times, the only difference this time is the robots. A lovely boy who has his dream even the dream is so naive and a father who seems like a asshole make a fantastic win. They, of course, begin from small people, through training and matches, they turn to stronger and stronger with their robot. There is no doubt they will beat the boss regarded as invincible at the beginning. And no surprise for me that we can only watch three games by Atom though the film as same as every 'hero cultivation' film. I even can know what will happen next every time just not only because I have seen many films, but the plot is too easy to predict. Finally, the film shows the political point by laughing at Russia. Do not deny as the evidence is obvious in the film.However, as I said, when I spot it from another side, this film is a good one for inspiriting. A broken father desires money so much that he even uses his son to change money, but when Max is one foot stepping into death, you can see that Charlie is a real father, he can be a great father and at the end of the film, it proves he made it. By which I mean that it does not matter how worse you are a father, once you are, you can do what a father can do. A charming girl who supports the gym by herself and did every effort she can to love the guy she dreams. How huge this love is, she never gives up to love, even the guy has no sense of responsibility and also has the potential of a gambler, to some extent, he absolutely is a gambler. Fortunately the guy changed by his lovely son. Although the one next is also a stereotype, but it worth to be told again and again, it is facing the tough rather than flee away, it is getting a dream and fighting for it, and it is being confident just say "yes, we can" like Americans did.I have to admit that this film nearly burst me into tears by several scenes, so I give it an eight!</fullReview>

His son's an A**hole to his father, but Charlie finds out his son loves robot boxing. So the find a robot named atom and they train him to fight. The things i love about this movie, one is the music by Danny Elfman, definitely one of his best sound jobs. I find myself listening to some tracks every so often.

		<fullReview>When I first watched the first Rocky movie, I found myself yelling and beating up the couch, I was over the top, I was awed and totally sided with the little underdog guy to win the Apollo Creed fight. It was awesome. This movie gave me so many different emotions and I'm not even a boxing fan. I was totally emerged on the human factor about a little guy who takes the shots life gives him, stands up for the punches and keeps moving forward, no matter how hard life beats him.With this movie, Real Steel, all those emotions emerged once again. The urge, the nerves of steel, all the stamina and passion to move on with his life and takes the shots, all of it came together again.Of course this movie is a homage to a real classic. Of course that the underdog will be beaten up to hell's gate, and of course, he won't win the fight. But also as in Rocky, he'll deliver the punches, he'll stand up and fight no matter what. And he'll win somehow.This movie just made me emotional like the classic Rocky movies did once. The same way, I caught myself yelling, beating up the couch, going crazy for the characters, crying, laughing, and loving every single minute of it.Now I've just watched this movie again after a long time and I still can't help but feeling amazed, feeling like a real fighter. I feel I can get out on the streets right now and face every challenge, bring it on.Thanks to the Rocky movies I've always felt this way. And now, thanks to Real Steel, I can feel this once again with a fighter, a boy and his robot.I seriously recommend this movie to everyone who has a soul that won't give up.Yes, there's CG in this movie, loads of it, specially in the robot's brawls. But in this, it helps the characters, never overshadowing them. It works to help telling the story, it's not just visual masturbation like Transformers. Trust me, it's about characters.Watch it! Be in love with it! Check this out! Because the human factor still counts! This new take on the Rocky story will get you really impressed. I promise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another feel-good movie with doing your best, even if you don't win, is a perfect example of 2011's "Real Steel."Robotic boxing? Come on. Yes, I know it provides for the theme of this film.It's the story of a man (Hugh Jackman) who abandoned his wife and son many years before and while doing his robotic boxing, this former boxer himself learns that his wife has died and that his sister and brother-in-law want to adopt the child. Doesn't this sound familiar already. Of course, the summer is coming in and the wealthy couple plan a trip to Italy, where there is apparently no place for the boy. Therefore, he winds up spending the summer and finding out about his father. Along the way, he finds a robot after Jackman pulls him off a dangerous cliff.The robot does well; Jackman owes money to mobsters and gets beaten up, the summer ends and uncle and auntie are back to claim the young charge. Then, of course, there's the big fight with the champion robotic-boxer. The crowd screams and in losing, our pair are heroes.It's fun to watch but this theme has been stated so many times in various ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long by 36 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's weird how you almost instantly love the nerd kid. But it's sort of hard to dislike Hugh Jackman. Though his character's written as an utter asshole. Dakota Goyo was breathtaking. Fantastic discovery! He'll remain an actor to watch if he hones his talent. Anyway, the script was too slow-paces. The film failed to draw me in within the first hour. Emotionless remote-controlled robots are just not very appealing. Then again, if you give a robot a personality and emotions, sending him to a fight like a dog or bull or cock is just inhuman and cruel. The film picks up visibly in the second half. The kid takes the lead, educating his father. That is quite nice to watch. But there are still some spots where the pace is lagging. Then again, the last fight was intense and refreshingly ambivalent. I found it a bit disappointing that they left the ending open concerning Max' and Charlie's fate. Be that as it may, this film would definitely have done better with only 90 minutes. Visually, it was more than okay. I watched it in crap quality but I really never stopped to think about how the robots were all just computer-generated. They looked real enough. Good job by the CGI-department here! The soundtrack was well-chosen, too. Normally I'm not one for rap music but it fitted. And Danny Elfman wrote a moving score for the parts in between. So, maybe not the most thrilling film I've ever seen (I was immensely bored a lot of the time because the story just didn't move on) it's an okay way to spend the evening. It did have it's moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT This movie is just the right movie, with a combo of perfect robo fight scenes and some decent characterization. Charlie(Hugh Jackman) is a big a** who doesn't know what he's doing, and the little kid is a better business man then him, even though challenging Zeus after one Pro fight is a little extreme. The story is a little predictable and some parts that are just a little dumb, like the classic stand on a cliff-fall down-find something valuable scene. Also you might notice some cracks on Atom's face, which looks vaguely like a mouth and nose, which might be some discreet attempt at adding more heart to the movie? Overall this movie is pretty decent to watch, with amazing CGI and a rank of 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Within steel, lies real heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg and co brings us Real Steel, a well-acted and written film. True it's filled with some underdog cliché's, but it works really well and never to the detriment of the story and characters. But strip away the robots and technological jargon, and at it's heart, lies a father and son with a loving bond. A bond that can never be broken by fame, fortune, or personal glory. Themes that resonate through us all, if we can keep it and with the two main characters in very good performances, that sentence alone is clear enough.I've known Industrial Light and Magic can make stunning and dazzling special effects as they have done so with the Transformers movies, but in this film, it's actually kept to a satisfying amount without going overboard; letting the audience focus on the story. And it's great to watch the inner and outer struggles of the main characters. But at it's core is a story of a man and child trying to bond and make up for lost time. As for the robots themselves, they are really well designed and for once actually make out what IS happening on screen. Movie directors please take note.So for all intents and purposes, Real Steel is the real deal. Well written script, likable characters, easy to follow robot action, and more. But it's the heart of the story that makes it stand out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance this may appear to be another Transformers-esque robot-athon, and there is lots of hugely entertaining and flawlessly rendered machine-on-machine fighting, however there's much more to Real Steel than meets the eye. With an underdog story ? the similarities with the Rocky series are abundant ? and a father-son dynamic at its core, this semi-futuristic tale about arrogant ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman ? reliable as always) being given another chance at redemption thanks to the new relationship he forms with precocious son Max (Dakota Goya ? slightly annoying) offers exhilarating metal bashing in equal portion to human drama. Sure, the screenplay is littered with eye-rolling clichés and cringe-worthy Disney moments, but if you can roll with those punches you will be in for a satisfyingly uplifting picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director of "Big Fat Liar", and "Just Married" takes on "Real Steel"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shawn Levy is a director, who despite making some really bad films, has nevertheless managed to entertain me. Now, in the midst of fall, when the Oscar films are dropping, he takes on Real Steel. Real Steel is about a sleaze ball named Charlie (Hugh Jackman) who trains fighting robots. One day, his son, Max (Dakota Goyo) decides to travel with him through a series of tournaments involving the fighting robots. Now, I must say, Shawn Levy has had his first real big disappointment with this film. I feel like I might be in the minority here, but I felt it was a long slog for nothing. That's not to say that Real Steel doesn't have its fair share of really cool, and even touching moments. That's just to say that Real Steel goes on for over 2 hours and it doesn't ever really feel like anything was worth sitting through over 2 hours for. I might have been more pleased with the film had it been ninety minutes or so. That way, it wouldn't have felt so long, and therefore wouldn't have been such a long haul. Also, at ninety minutes, a lot of the unnecessary stuff could have been cut out. With all this being said, Real Steel is good enough movie, it just could have been so much better, and so much less of a chore to sit through some of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robot Rocky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really channeled a lot of inner Rocky. The underdog fighter getting a chance to fight the champ. The movie also channels some of Rocky 4, since the bad guy is a technological marvel and "Whatever he sees, he destroys." Alright, in Real Steel the line is "he kills"... Kind of sad that they didn't just take the quote directly.Overall, this is the story of a down-on-his-luck robot boxer, he controls the robot via remote control, who gets his son dumped in his lap. A son who he never talked to, and he doesn't even know how old he is. Hugh Jackman's character reluctantly drags the kid around as he tries to get his career back on track. In the end the kid teaches his father to believe in himself.Yes, it is a pretty sappy movie in a lot of ways. It's loaded with clichés and terribly trite one liners. But I have to say the audience ate it up and was cheering during the boxing matches, and laughing at the jokes. While it's not a great movie, it's fun, especially if you go in with the right frame of mind.</fullReview>

Full credit to Atom's designer. Bringing humility yet determination to a bot's looks ? That's real tough.Cons: 1.Borrows heavily from Rocky's fighting style down to the left handed hooks. Sly Stallone pops up time and again in the mind's eye. 2.Could have been a tad tighter in the editing department with more focus on an extended final fight rather than extended drama at some points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time were a lot of fans enjoy the brutality of the Ufc or boxing, even with the popular more staged wrestling . Weather its the blood, or the exciting adrenaline rush that mimics a present day gladiatorial combat. We then are transported into the future where maybe we have gotten tired of the blood and human violence or for another reason robots have replaced people. Hugh plays a down and out boxing screw up who boxes with robots with a controlling device. With his failures and amounting debt and dim future. One day he finds out that he has a recently orphaned son from a past girlfriend. While at the custody hearing the kids aunt and her husband want custody instead. They both know he isn't fit to be a father and doesn't want to, so while they choose to take the summer away they bribe him to take care of him for the summer. The child gets into robot boxing and talks Hugh into having him come along. With his bad luck his robot gets destroyed, his future doesn't look good. They decide to sneak into a junk yard to find parts to build a new one. They end up finding a sparring robot and decide to fix it up and box with that. The more time they spend with each other the closer they get and the more Hugh changes his ways. While this is a movie with a typical outcome it still makes you feel sentimental and draws you in and makes you care about the characters. In the end Hugh comes around and figures out whats more important than money and it was family. Great movie, very entertaining father son movie. This should be a must see for anyone.</fullReview>

I think they could have developed the story with Charlie's son a little more but from what I understand they are planning a sequel and maybe they will build on it more then. I think they could have ended the movie with them deciding to stay together or something along those lines instead of stopping abruptly after the final fight. I still give the movie a solid 8 out of 10.

		<fullReview>In the not so distant future, human boxing has been overtaken by a new sport. A sport where the contenders can be smashed, decapitated and executed at the crowds will.Robot boxing is big business with a huge following, neither phrase could ever be applied to Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman). Charlie is a struggling washed up ex-boxer, always believing he is just one win away from making good.Following one fight too many, he is sans robot, not a good space to be in, when fighting is your game. Fortunately Charlie has a long suffering back stop, on/off girlfriend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly), who in real life would be backstop for nobody.Charlie needs to score some serious cash soon. Fortunately he can sell his 11 year old son, by gifting his custody rights to a well meaning sister in-law. Motherless, poor old Max (Dakota Goya) has been living in miserable luxury but his Aunt wants to make it all official.Soon the pair are on the road, following a convenient hiatus as the rich folk go to Tuscany, Charlie is not happy, he just wanted the money, not a moppet in tow.Maybe Charlie has gone too many rounds, as his business sense leaves something to be desired. Max who rather fortunately, is a massive Robot boxing fan, has his head screwed on better than Charlie's robots.Alighting on a old Sparring bot "Adam", the pair start their journey from the bottom, Max with stars in his eyes and Charlie with his eye on the main chance and one last shot at glory.Charlie is an unlikeable character and Jackman literally pulls no punches in his ambivalence towards Max, involving him in scrapes and situations, no responsible parent ever should.The effects are seamless, CGI robots interact with the live actors and environments, the audience believing immediately they are real. Goya is no cute movie moppet, giving as good as he gets and clearly having the time of his young life. Jackman is solid and believable and as mentioned, does not take the easy acting route.Ultimately this is robots fighting in a ring, which is hard to dislike. However, if you imagine what you think this movie will be like, add about another half as much again, for the real emotion and drama the film manages to evoke.When watching the simulated Robot boxing sport, it's not so much a question of will this ever exist in reality, it's just a question of when.Finishing with a rousing and well staged ending, the Director is clearly confident enough to pause the action for a worthwhile and poignant slow motion sequence, leaving you with a smile on your face.Summary If you are expecting a standard formulaic father son bonding flick with added robots, this covers those bases, but adds depth and much more.Good crowd pleasing stuff, recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacklustre schmaltz with Senior Spielbergo's obvious influence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a clear case of trying to pander to too many demographics at the same time, or shooting for too many targets. A robot film for the guys, a weepy modern remake of The Champ for the girls. But no. It doesn't work like that because the tears, feelings and relationship subtexts will alienate the guys and the endless violence will bore the ladies.Chick flicks and macho action films are not cojoined twins, no matter how much we wish they were, and while the modern world loves a politically correct idea like girls who love fighting and men who love ponies, in reality each sex invariably falls back on their comfortable clichés. Clichés for a reason. It might not make the post-modernists happy but men and women tick in different places and at different paces. Which makes Real Steel one whole heap of a confusing mess.First there's Hugh Jackman as the lady's favourite (see Australia) and the man's hero (see Wolverine). Perfect for the androgynous role of pathetic macho ex-boxer wild card romantic roboteer. Then there's the muscular chick from Lost as the owner of a boxing gym. Frankly I'm surprised they didn't plaster her in jailhouse tats and shave her head, but then again the ladies like a bit of glamour with their love interest. We learned a lot from GI Jane didn't we Hollywood.The robots are part Anime part Iron Giant and, bar the prevailing champion bot 'Zeus', seem ill-conceived and boring. We've seen better and with more imagination in recent years for these guys to make so much as a dent in the panel of memorable robotic CGI. D- definitely must try harder.On top of the confusion, there's the usual repulsive Spielbergian formula. Orphan kid, doe-eyed love interest, themes of redemption, family love, decisions of the heart and so on and so forth. It's all rather wearisome at this point in the second decade of the 21st century and frankly I'll be glad when the old school moguls retire their typewriters and we can see something new.</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo act really well together, the robots are stunningly animated and the sets are also good. There are a few minor problems in my mind: Some of the fight scenes were a bit dodgy, the music isn't original and some parts of the film were slightly overacted.These problems don't affect the story at all, they only lower the standard of the film by a small amount. The props are good, it looks like it is set in the future, but at the same time the props don't look ridiculously futuristic.An inspiring film that will entertain Si-Fi and boxing fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected - which seems to be the consensus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can just imagine somebody, somewhere, pitching thus, "Imagine - Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots. Live action!" A common comparison I know but that's what it is, in effect.The plot is simple, and yet leaks in some various complexities that I definitely appreciate.A washed-up boxer owes debts to several people because he is, essentially, losing every robot boxing match he's entering. He's cocky and arrogant and loses the first first we see him in because he's too busy wiggling his eyebrows to a couple ladies in the bleachers.Now, I liked Hugh Jackman immediately. He's best known for being Wolverine these days but it's definitely a testament to acting ability when I saw absolutely no Wolverine-esque personality leak in. (As opposed to Johnny Depp, whom I'm still seeing Jack Sparrow in every role he's in, even if it's for a couple of lines).He loses the fight and is fleeing the scene because the arrogant dumbass opted for a 20,000 dollar bet rather than taking the lower, free few- thousand he would have gotten just for arriving because the Bullfighting arena was just itching for a robot (Since the big "League" robot fights are expensive to attend). He punches one of his chasers and it turns out, his wife is dead and he's the next of kin to take up the son. But he sells him to the uncle because he values paying debts and buying robots more than a son he never knew, or learned to take care of. But he has a week (or so?) with the kid because the potential future parents have a vacation to go to. Why they didn't just bring the kid? I forgot. And if I forgot, it must have been a silly, contrived reason that wasn't worth remembering.Still, the guy 'selling' the kid actually made sense to me. Maybe I am a cynic? After all, more than decade of not knowing a kid and him suddenly being dropped in on me - I'd probably make a similar decision. It's not every day a rich family will pay me $100,000 to take a kid I know nothing about. Besides, he was thousands of dollars in VARIOUS debts so he clearly was not fit to take care of him.Anyway, he buys a famous bot that gets killed the first fight (Again, because he's an arrogant idiot). He takes the kid to a scrap yard (With a hilariously stealth-based scene of dodging searchlights that reminded me of some games I play) to search for spare parts to build his own, effectively for free.Another interjection into the plot description (This is actually my first review I've outlined the plot like this, I usually assume people watch the movie and THEN come read).I really liked the Junkyard scene. It leaked in some backstory and exposition of the setting that we're in, while making the conversation feel natural and realistic. After all, the boy was eleven years old (Or something), of COURSE he wouldn't know why some of these parts look different from the rest. He asks, his father answers, and the audience gets more context for the setting. Bravo, film. Well done, and thank you for doing that properly.Anyway, boy locates a fairly intact sparring bot, which was designed to take a beating but doesn't do a lot of damage on its own. The father, really not expecting anything to come of it. At this point, he's just along for the ride so he doesn't mind escorting his kid around to get his bot killed. Again, this whole dynamic felt organic and natural - the father had a reason to go along. Either the bot lost and got destroyed, to which he'd just resume what he was doing in the first place. Or it would win, and he'd continue to escort his kid to win some more. While his thought process may not have been that complex, it still makes a lot of sense. Once again, good work to the filmmakers.I'm gonna skip through the plot to the end, now. I had reached the word limit so I had to remove a couple parts. Seriously, go see the movie if you want to know the rest. It's worth it.Predictably, the underdog challenges "Zeus" a super-bot built by an intelligent (and of course, Japanese) mind that has never lost. Indeed, no robot has ever survived a single round! Atom does (of course), mostly due to its design, for the ability to take a lot of punishment. It survives several rounds, in fact. Frankly, I saw the end result coming, which stung the enjoyment a little but because I was hoping the filmmakers would know this and give a tiny little twist. Basically, I knew Atom would lose but it would be in such a way that they would celebrate anyway.Sure enough, Atom survives the last round and offscreen judges score the performances and the champ-bot still wins, complete with the boos of the crowd.I was hoping for either or, frankly. This is a family movie and while predictability may be the name of the game, I was hoping for a complete win or a complete loss. If Atom was destroyed, the boy and father would still have enjoyed themselves and rekindled their family bond. If they won, all the better. It wouldn't have effected the overall plot anyway.It was a good movie, I felt myself cheering for the characters, laughing at the villains when they got what was coming to them, and enjoyed everything in between.Go watch it.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed two hours of enthusiasm, thrilling and light focus on details "which makes other movies boring". The movie's sequence of events is fast, organized and logical, and emotional parts are not heavy, which makes your heart pumping as long as possible. I really enjoyed the clearance of the relationship between both the father and the son when they met for the first time in the movie, and the personal similarity makes it not ugly as it may looks with normal father-son relationship. And an extra point for the good quality of movie, as you don't see sexual shots, which makes it suitable movie for all ages, especially that it doesn't have a violent shots "Unless of course you have a heart problems or under 7 years old". So, If you have not watched this movie yet, I recommend it for you. Enjoy watching.</fullReview>

Nothing new at all. The kid was rather annoying, and unbelievable as well. I was simply unable to accept the fact that he had such a large part. This should have been Hugh Jackman's movie, but it felt more like it was the kids movie. Seriously, haven't we seen this kind of story too many times already? Kid reunites with his dad, but hates him at first. Kid gets obsessed with his fathers interests, kid challenges the world, kid tries to get his father back on track, who pretty much acts like an adult baby throughout the film. They argue, they win, they shed some tears, and so on and so forth. And then add robots. Even though Hugh Jackman was mildly amusing at times, the story in whole was rather bland. The whole robot part was great though, I just wanted more of it. Way more. That's what I wanted from a movie called "Real Steel" anyway. Real Steel should just have sticked to what it was best at: a robot film, while keeping the standard Hollywood fare to a minimum. Real Steel could have been great if it had dared to go beyond Hollywood, but it didn't.Moose finds this film worthy of an 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing! The CGI is excellent!! The casting of Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo and Evangeline Lily is just match made in heaven. Boxing fight never get any exciting than this. I normally don't like boxing because of all the bloody and sweat so I don't watch Rocky movies. But robot boxing is totally cool with all those metals busting around. Atom the junkyard robot is the CGI star in this show. Both Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo play their role very well. Plenty of emotions and sometimes annoying but they will grow on you. And the music score is really good!!! Those metal punches sounds real good. And the music really brings out the emotion out. Combined with the actors emotions showed, it is a total win. Real steel packs 2011 up!!! This is real entertainment!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Hollywood flick with the "Spielberg" flavor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to describe the movie with only one word I guess I'd use 'experienced'. The people of Hollywood have clearly mastered their trade, and if an opportunity like "Real Steel" comes along they won't hesitate to use a lot of money and their best crew for the job. That is exactly what they have done here. The story is nicely paced, avoids clichés as much as it can. The father and son relationship tries to be honest and more realistic than what we're used to. The effects are top notch. The actors are perfectly fitted for their role, and if you let it, the movie will stir up some emotions and leave you with exactly what you were looking for - a break from reality.I don't understand the people who accuse the movie for being cheesy and cliché... What did you expect from a movie that is about the father and son relationship and a robot?! Wasn't decades of Hollywood cinema enough to see were that will be going? The question isn't weather it's "cliché" but weather it's a "good cliché". There are tons of movies coming out every year that try to have the same effect as "Real Steel" but fail miserably ('I am number four' as one example)... And of course the ending will be all mushy and fuzzy! You can see that 10 minutes into the movie. Besides, all Spielberg movies are like that, and some of them are regarded as classics, where, in fact, all that separates them from this one is chance, I guess. I'm not saying "Spielberg" movies are bad, I'm saying this one's also good. I know he didn't direct the movie, but I have a strong hunch he had a big role in it.If you are looking to get entertained all you need to do is lower your criteria a bit, get Tarkovski and Kubrick out of your head, and this movie will do the job. You can also have a kid with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story line in "Real Steel" is quite simple: A quitter guy, Charlie ,tries to make it as a robot fighter. Loaning his way through life to the next fight. Ready to flee, when two suited guys shows up, not to get money, but to inform him that he's now legally in charge of his 11 year old son, that he abandon when he was born, because of the mothers death. And so it goes from there. The movie is entertaining yes, but from the moment Charlie gets his kid, I felt like I was watching an updated version of Stallone's "Over the top". And I guess that I think that that's the best thing about this movie: Being reminded of that time I saw "Over the top" in my, almost, teen years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steel" (2011) is a considerably above average example of what I call the "CGI laser light show" movie genre, much better than most (insert "Sucker Punch" here). Think "The Champ" (1931) with elements from "Transformers" (2004), "Rocky" (the 1976 original), and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991).At its core it is another redemption tale as aging boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) gets a chance to be a father to the now eleven year-old son he abandoned at birth (Max Kenton - nicely played by Dakota Goyo). Charlie is informed that his ex-wife has died and he leaps at the chance to cut a deal with his wealthy sister-in-law to give her custody of the boy. But through a series of somewhat contrived events the jaded Charlie ends up with Max for the first summer.The secret to this type of fairy tale lies in how well they connect with viewers; if the movie can get viewers to strongly identify with the character (in this case Max) as he gets a huge rush from suddenly becoming part of the robot-fighting world, the viewer will get hooked. Then the challenge is to keep them hooked for as long as possible. "Real Steel" hooks you and provides this vicarious rush well past the midway point, in large part because of the twist of having Max bond with the robot as a surrogate father, much in the spirit of "Terminator 2" but also nicely integrated with the ongoing dynamic of the old robot being Charlie's twin or at least the piece that completes him . But eventually the wheels fall off, or in this case get knocked off by a "Rocky" scripted overreach. The illusion bursts and most viewers crash back to reality because it takes too much mental energy to suspend disbelief when the team breaks into the glitzy celebrity world. From that point on it is just overwrought melodrama, with the inspirational "redemption on steroids" theme aggressively shoved down each viewer's throat.Of course this surfeit of cliché might have been palatable but for Kevin Durand's overplayed heavy. Like a series of cardiac arrests the heart of the movie first begins beating irregularly during his debt collection sequence, is then severely damaged by his lame homeboys routine, and finally succumbs from his sequence at the conclusion of the first round of the climatic fight. These would make great deleted scenes for the DVD release but should have been mercifully trimmed from the already too-long film.The one positive of the glitzy sequences was Olga Fonda's "Farra Lemkova" character, an amped up to super-hotness play on WWE's Stephanie McMahon. She provided the film's most interesting images, a kind of an embodiment of slick temptation. Can't say the same for Karl Yune's Asian robot designer who essentially was tasked with the Apollo Creed role. Part of Rocky's success lay in Creed's newly acknowledged respect for Rocky at the conclusion of the film, this allowed the ending to transcend its cliché elements because it nicely blunted the obvious good vs evil dynamic. Yune was not allowed to play his character this way and "Real Steel" loses considerable depth, dimension, and IQ points because of it.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and I could not even get through the first 10 minutes of this horrible, depraved, misguided film! I don't know if this is a spoiler or not since we couldn't get past the first 10 minutes, but having a robot beat the tar out of an animal is sadistic, cruel and very intellectually retarded--which is why the vast majority of viewers loved it, I suppose. It sickens me that humans find torturing animals to be amusing. It doesn't matter whether the bull was CGI or not. Sub in a Spaniard with a penchant for animal torture and bam! you've got the great sport of bull fighting. I wish people could be more compassionate, think about what is right and what is wrong and apply that to how they live, what they bring into their home, how they eat, what they wear, etc. We would all be in so much a better world if people ever stopped thinking about themselves and their base instincts for a moment and pondered the suffering of others, maybe even stopped to do something about it. This is a message to Hollywood: Stop using morbid footage of dead animals, using live animals (hello, Peter Jackson) and stop trying to capitalize on the sick nature of humans to make your millions. I for one, will stand for something a little more noble to the human spirit than what kind of contraption can I imagine to show how destructive and cruel I can be with it. Children are desensitized by cruelty and I would be horrified if my son saw this movie. RS Lovers: What would y'all think if the Robot beat a dog to death? Not so funny, now, huh?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic Feel-good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to overrate movies I enjoyed thoroughly, since the measure of any experience is how much I enjoyed it at the time. An ice-cold Coke on a hot day could get a 10 one day, then caviar could get a 10 on another day. I never limit my voting by some 30,000 foot perspective, placing my reward in relation to all that I've seen and against my expectations for future work in the genre.So when I give Real Steel a nine, I mean I had just about as much fun as you can have watching a sci-fi action heart-of-gold estranged-down-on- his-luck dad wins the love of his son back movie. The robots are so real I couldn't treat them as CGI. They were believable in their variety. Much of the audaciousness reflected how things are done in wrestling. The grimy parts of the movie added a flavor that is missing in some films, such as Demolition Man, where the under-city lacked any believability. Hugh Jackman has a natural likability, and I didn't sense any tension between him and the kid. My wife assures me that he's a good person in real life, which doesn't hurt. Watching a jerk actor try to convince me that he's a lovable character strains the suspended disbelief more than the natural weight of the fictionalization.Some reviewers said Jackman's negative character made it hard to forgive him, but for me, with my own issues with self-loathing make it easy to forgive just about anything - and what does he really do that's so bad? He's cynical, money-grubbing, greedy, selfish - basic American qualities, especially in men. I think some people don't like movies that portray realistic characters come out as redeemed.The different strata of the future society are a side story that most people probably miss. There's a sense of dystopic unrest, as if we're being treated to a hidden view of the future, an underbelly that's coincidental to the main story, but it was very nice. I also enjoyed seeing great effects and technology being used as simply a tool instead of the focus. Consider the failures of Lucas, and then say that the understatement in this film isn't a breath of fresh air. Lucas tried to get his audience to go for the kid, with opposite results. It was so saccharine and obviously manipulative that we despised Anakin. Plus there was no connection between Ben Kenobi and the kid, horrid to watch. Here we have a plausible connection - Who would dis that? It seems a shame to be angry (as many reviewers are) that the story tellers didn't go for some Asmovian robot-becoming-sentient or violating "The Three Laws" by harming a human, or expressing shame at its treatment as a mere machine. It is a machine! Thank you, filmmakers, for not getting sappy about machines! Liberals. Everything's about human rights - even when they're not human! Let it go, Greenies! Oh, and too bad there's no commentary on how hot it is in the future because of global warming, tsk tsk. The director should have his red card revoked.The human heart is a simple thing, and humans love stories that are simple. Aliens would look at this film and say, "What's the point?" This is a humans-only event. Spock types won't get it. I'm thinky a lot of the time, but ah, the luxury of moving between the sublime and the brutish. If you want deep, then: "Life is nasty, brutish, and short." That's what robot boxing is about! But without the brain damage, which is nice.The love story, if you can call it that, is so underplayed that anyone worn out on sap must appreciate. The kid is just annoying enough to be believable as a kid.The music is a lot of fun, too. Very hip-hop, which I often don't like. Watching the kid dance with the robot is, I'm sure, one thing many elite reviewers puked at. For me, enjoying a film is all about looking for ways to enjoy it, by altering my perceptions and expectations. Is this scene well-timed, well-executed, well-shot, well-lit, timely in the story, effective in building character alignment and strength, is it believable within the context so far? Yes to all of these. Jackman even has a great line: "It's all entertainment, that's what they come to see. They love the kid thing." Normally that tongue-in-cheek meta-commentary in a film is dangerous, unless it works. I'd bet most people didn't even notice the relevance to their own perspective while watching the film. People love the kid thing, and it's all entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Looks Stupid, But It Was Actually Pretty Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What certainly surprised me about this film was how this story had this heart-felt story involving a father and son that blended well with a story about robot boxing. You may have seen this type of story before, but trust me when I say that this father and son story works very well in this film. The storyline had enough heart that can lead to audiences to care about these characters and wanting to see the bond between the father and son grow. Just seeing their bond grow as they find Atom and booking matches with this robot adds strength to the storyline, making you want to see that happy ending. It was a very good storyline that focused very well on the characters, never going offtrack and focused only what was important.I really liked the idea behind the film presenting a futuristic world where robots replaced humans in the boxing world. Although the film is set in the future, I liked the fact that the director made the time period no different from how it is today. This film does not present a CGI world with Jetson planes or people using crazy technologies; the only thing that was futuristic was the robots and this allowed the whole story to feel realistic and allowing audiences to be well attached to the environment. The CGI that was used was pretty nice, especially toward the movements with the robot action.The robots were pretty cool with all of their awesome designs and the creativity behind them. When it comes to the action, I will be lying if I said that the boxing sucks. Being a fan of watching these types of sports, it was pretty exciting and fun to watch these matches; especially toward the final matches. Watching Atom fight off against the ultimate Zeus was absolutely electrifying. These matches captured the excitement that you will have if you went to watch an actual boxing match. Exciting, fun, and entertaining.The acting was pretty good. Hugh Jackman as the down luck father, Charlie, Dakota Goya as his son, Max, and Evangeline Lilly as the long time friend of Charlie. You will care about these characters since the film did a very good job of focusing on these characters, portraying the growing bond between father and son, and to show character depth that was surely unexpected. I was surprised about Dakota Goya's acting since kid actors are usually a hit and miss. Goya was never annoying, as you see in many films with kids, and acted well enough that didn't ruin anything that occurred in the film. Everyone else was pretty good as their roles. However, I found Kevin Durand's role as Ricky to be out of place near the end. He was good from the time you see him, but had no place at the end of the film.Just like other movies of this year, I was surprised of how this film turned out to be. I liked this film more than expected, really liked this heart-felt story that the film had, and I am not embarrassed to say that I became teary eyed near the end. Good acting, fun and exciting boxing matches, and a good storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Dad/pre-teen Son flick but I wanted child eating robots!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm too old, childless and cynical to enjoy a film like this anymore.If you are a Dad with a pre-teen son, then this is for you. If you feel like your father son relationship is a little dysfunctional, all the better. Take the journey with Jackman and Goyo. Re-bond.Show me a guy who doesn't like robots. The robots and fighting scenes are excellent. The whole production values equation is excellent as you would expect for a $110M Dreamworks movie.My main beef was the boring predictable, *yawn*, zzzZZZZZzz, did I say boring and predictable script? I'm so glad the baddies behind the baddest robot were Asians.Anything with Spielberg involved will have those essential manufactured emotional moments, between human and non-human, like when Goyo and Atom's eyes meet for a moment. Oh Steven, please do something different with your life or maybe take LSD.I would have given this movie a 9/10 if only Atom had eaten Goyo at that first Spielberg puke moment.9/10 for Dads and young sons 7/10 for those who like to reminisce, fantasize or dream 4/10 for serious movie buffs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment full of stereotypes and highly predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first. If you are looking for solid entertainment that is technically brilliant with very good boxing action - then look no further than this. You will have a very good time in the cinema seat enjoying some popcorn and a cool drink to go with it.Don't think about what you see too much, though. Because then you may find out that many characters in the movie are stereotypes you have seen before many times. There's the father who is not keen on his son at first. But this changes over time, of course. A boxer beyond the best of his days. An evil thug from the past messing around. And most of all a little wunderkind with a cool attitude and language way beyond his years. He is e.g. capable of helping to repair robots.Another problem is predictability. Even though the fight scenes are very well executed, I was able to figure out the outcome of every single one of them well before their end. Even the final fight is a straight rip-off of one of the greatest boxing movies ever made: ... Ehem, I did promise no spoilers... But you will know what I mean once you see the grand finale.So, bottom line: Rock solid entertainment with great visuals. You can be thoroughly entertained if you forgive this movie its stereotypes and predictability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you take it as a kids movie, it's really pretty good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It probably was aiming for a wider audience but the movie in essence really is a movie that will probably be enjoyed the most by young kids. You could say that this is the "Rocky" for really young kids, about an underdog, taking a shot at the boxing title. It only doesn't involve human boxing this time but robot boxing instead.The premise is really awesome of course but I must say it probably works best for the first part of the movie and at the end. In the middle the movie starts to take a more dramatic approach. Nothing wrong with that of course but it doesn't ever feel like anything gets developed properly and involving enough.The movie is really filled with missed opportunities. For instance at points they decided to give the boxing robot, named Atom, some almost human like emotions and characteristics but the movie does far too little with this. It could had created a real special and heartfelt bond between the little boy and the robot but instead the movie is only really sporadicly doing this, so it just never becomes anything truly effective.Also the story itself is far from anything believable of course. And no, I'm not just talking about the fact that it involves robot boxing but more so about it that it features a story in which an 11 year old boy builds his own fighting robot, pretty much from scratch and not only that but he kicks some robot butt with it as well and even after just a handful of fights gets to take a shot at the world title, against a robot that obviously cost millions of dollars to build, train and maintain and had years of experience at the top. But oh well, this is of course a story lots of young boys want to see and get excited about. So again, as a kids movie it definitely is serving its purpose but also as an adult it also all remains perfectly watchable, since there still is plenty to enjoy for them as well, also story-wise.Luckily the movie has plenty of great elements in it to make up for its weaknesses. Because all in all, I still did really liked this movie and was even loving it at times.First of all, it's a great and spectacular looking movie. It uses some great cinematography and the special effects are really topnotch. It truly does feel and look like the human characters are interacting with the robot ones and the use of real shot stuff and CGI blends in perfectly and seamlessly with each other. Also the music by Danny Elfman and its sound design truly adds to the movie!Also the fights themselves, and lets face it, that's what the movie is all about, are truly spectacular and thrilling to watch. They are well put together and puts you right into the action, which really makes you want to root for Atom. Seriously, to me it was almost just as thrilling and exciting as any of the fights, from any of the Rocky movies. One thing that does still puzzle me is why boxing is something that always works so great and spectacular on film, while in real life it really isn't every anything half as exciting or spectacular to watch.Hugh Jackman really needed a movie like this again. There once was a time, not too long ago, he was asked to be in basically everything but now days, after a couple of not so big successes behind his name, he most likely didn't had lots of big movie offers being thrown his way. But with this movie he shows he's still in good form, also psychically. He really gave away one fine performance, even though his character maybe isn't exactly the best written. The young Dakota Goyo also did a more than great job. Little kids in movies can so often get incredibly annoying when they have to act in all sorts of situations with all different type of emotions but Dakota Goyo really manages to pull it all off really well and convincingly.The movie is further more being filled by some other great and also likable characters. Now, some of them indeed feel a bit comic-book like at times but in my opinion this actually suited the movie its overall atmosphere and way of storytelling very well.So a movie with hits and misses but luckily still mostly hits. And sometimes when the movie hits, it hits really well!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Non animated Disney Movies where in a class of its own, but this movie reaches beyond those borders of awfulness. Who in their right mind can find a single positive thing to say about those 90 min plus something of clichés and stereotypes. I honestly believe the scriptwriter teamed up with the director and blackmailed a bunch of people into that. if anything else made this movie happen I really have to doubt reason and accountability of a lot of people including me, as I unfortunately managed to watch the first 30 min of that masterpiece. This isn't even good enough to watch it witch one eye half open, while lying in bed trying to cope with your hangover. Are people getting dumber by the second, or is there another reason why Hollywood manages to put out one decent movie every two years. I honestly don't get it, but somehow feel insulted. How is a rating of 7.4 possible, how is it possible that according to IMDb this movie made more than 200mil?There are watchdogs who prevent people from watching explicit adult material or gore and violence - why isn't there anybody who serves the public by placing a stupidity or intellectually-insulting rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going to this movie i was hoping it would maximize on robot fighting and minimize on cliché plot, like what transformers should have been, instead it was a feel good story about a father/son relationship with minimal robo-boxing. the acting was pretty good but really the movie let me down in all other ways, i mean they montage-ed out most of the fight scenes!*spoilers follow*the movie starts off well enough, robots beating up bulls, robots beating up robots, jackman beating up cowboys, that sort of thing. what i paid to see. then the movie throws a curve ball by explaining he has a 11yo son. long story short he and the kid hate each other but end up bonding in the end. cliché. what really bugs me though is that this kid is like Anakin Skywalker! he even sort of looks like him. hes some sort of engineering prodigy; he can pilot the robot, fix and repair the robot, and can speak Japanese, all because he "plays a lot of video games". the characters make some really stupid decisions in this too. at one point loan sharks come looking for the indebted jackman. but they jump him outside the trailer housing the ton weighing, medal winning, fighting robot. but that's not the stupid part, no, jackman runs. yeah you heard me, he runs away from the BOXING ROBOT and promptly gets his a** kicked as a result. i could handle all that, i didn't expect a lot from the plot of this one like i said, but the fight scene montages were unacceptable. after the real plot of the movie starts to unravel, and they get the actual bot the movie bases around, all except the first and second to last fights are montages. his entire rise to the big leagues: montage. his final fight!: montage. Why? why would they do that? to make room for the stupid, cliché, ripoff Big Daddy, sub-plot? in a movie about robot boxing they skimped on robot boxing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dakota Goyo saves the film, but this could never work as a one-man show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(But only for the gullible)The latest lightweight, high-tech, big-budget, single-star-headed action flick to come out of the Hollywood production line aims with considerable precision at the male teenage and precocious late primary- school-aged market. Its glossy gimmicks and imagery of a futuristic robot-based boxing industry will definitely to conjure up exclamations of "Cool!" and "Awesome!" from the younger half of its target audience, just as with its unofficial pint-sized protagonist, and is likely to attract the attention of many conformist connoisseurs of easygoing blockbusters from the older crowd. Fun-loving director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther) has hit his target audience spot-on, and fortunately it's a highly profitable one, because he only dubiously scrapes along the other demographics in moments of ill-conceived pathos that leaves its otherwise engrossed audience sitting there awkwardly in anticipation of the next great piece of eye-candy or knowing wisecrack. However, countless similarly clunky creations have stepped into the wrong with the same flaws and shortcomings and have been endowed with huge box office success, so it is unlikely that anyone else will notice the many holes in Real Steel. Hugh Jackman once again strolls out confidently with a well-trained American accent, suppressing his roots as usual because of his film choices, and plays a haughty yet down-to-earth would-be hero who as the film opens is struggling to pay his accumulating monetary debts, both legal and not, and the recklessness with which he goes about his role in the robot boxing business certainly doesn't help him. Too many times he'll enter cockily into a "winner takes all" fight, just as he did in the good old days of human boxing, with a poorly-handled robot, and loses everything. He is a bland combination of two overworked clichés. Most aggravating are his brushes with his obnoxious arch-nemesis Ricky (Kevin Durand) who, being a Texan cowboy, is also bland combination of two overworked clichés. He lives in an apartment owned by his childhood friend, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) who likes him very much, but, without his overdue rent, is being dragged down with him into the abyss of financial ruin. She also stands to lose the beloved gym of her close late father, who was also a boxer and the mentor of Charlie, Jackman's character, making Bailey another bland combination of two overworked clichés.Unexpectedly, the solution to their troubles ends up being Charlie's abandoned, bastard 11-year-old son Max (a terrific first-time lead performance from Dakota Goyo) who Charlie must look after because his mother has recently died and his legal guardians, Aunt Debra (Hope Davis) and Uncle Marvin (James Rebhorn) are going on a trip to Italy. Max's character, as far as the characterisations from John Gatins' largely pedestrian script goes, is unfortunately just another bland combination of two overworked clichés ? a very transparent reincarnation of Jordan Fry's Mike Teavee in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) ? but the young actor impressively upstages his more experienced adult co-stars by making him a lovable, truthful, spunky and endearing character who is, even more embarrassingly, the best part of the movie, despite being the least expensive. He cunningly blackmails his father into taking him along to the robot fights, and uncovers and nurtures the small but tenacious robot Adam ? a cute little thing, who, despite being being himself a reincarnation of the adorable Wall-E, is also genuinely endearing ? that gives the top 'bots in the league a run for their money. At the forefront of these antagonists is the seemingly invincible Zeus, designed and controlled by sleek, sexy foreign designers who are so much the very quintessence a bland combination of two overworked clichés that their whole subplot is not even worth describing.Real Steel is certainly watchable, but unbearably squirmy at the same time, and best enjoyed in small doses. Writing about for this long is starting to drive me crazy. There are simply so many holes in this picture that it is impossible for me to cover them all in one review without going drastically over the word limit, just as it is impossible for the still very young and delicate Dakota Goyo to single-handedly cover all the holes in this huge tank. Still, he saves as much water as he can, preventing this from being a complete failure. What would all of these hapless grown-ups, both in the film and in real life, do without him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another title that makes me long for the Zero vote at IMDb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Got this one because I am a fan of Hugh Jackman. I was not expecting much given the premise of the movie, and even with that I was disappointed. It makes no difference what level of dispencement of reality you are willing to afford this epic rubbish, you will lose interest about 12 minutes into the carnage of intellect this thing is.HJ must have been desperate for a payday. This POS flick would be a career killer if he had but a little less merit in his history. Honestly, the fact that I had to suffer through watching this made me want to punch the entire cast and crew in the face.At the end of the day, I cannot in good faith find a single reason to recommend this time-waster. It is completely worthless, and makes me cringe for a number of reasons outnumbering the number of running minutes of the "movie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Real Steel" Succeeds as a Touching and Inspirating Drama with Stunning Yet Not Overdone Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I do grow a bit weary of the robots-saving-the-world kind of movies. Surely they are action-packed and fun, but once in a while I want to look for something different. "Real Steel" brings the fresh idea of "boxing robots" and it was a very great experience for me and I will remember this movie for long in the days to come.While this movie introduces us something new, it has maintained its balance well and further manages to do well in a lot of aspects. The elements of action and drama are nicely balanced, unlike the "Transformers" movies which really focus too much on being a showcase of visual effects and conveniently neglecting the plot. "Real Steel" is nothing like that. It is overall fast-paced with no boring parts. The scenes are appropriately cut. The plot itself is hardly predictable, with a little twists and turns here and there. There are also occasional moments of comedy and some touching scenes.The acting is one of the best strengths of this movie. It is excellent. Extra credits should be given to Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo. Their performances are incredible, which make the film much more heart-warming. They take up major parts of the movie and we get to see a mending and building father-and-son relationship. The other actors are good too, though they do not really have much screen time to show it. Anyhow, the overall performance is just fascinating.And how can we miss the visual effects and sound effects? They are superbly done throughout the movie. The robot designs are good and sharp. The movements of them are realistic and cool. The action is simply visually stunning. The sound effects are great achievements as well. The ambient sound is nicely done and it makes the fights between the bots a lot more appealing than it already is.My slight suggestion is a longer ending. It will probably make the movie more complete. I would want more father-son interaction."Real Steel" is more than a box-office winner. It has a good story, good acting and good effects. It pretty much has all that is needed to make an excellent movie. Despite strong contenders this year like "Deathly Hallows P2" and "Dark of the Moon" and "Super 8" and perhaps "Rise of the Planet of Apes", I really hope this will at least get an Oscar nomination for visual effects. And I am demanding a sequel. Let's hope it will be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that is a movie that stays with you long after its over.. with the right blend of emotions and action it surely will give you your money's worth. Hugh Jackman is terrific as always.Even the discarded dancing Robot ATOM is so adorable and you feel connected with the cast almost instantly.But the real find of the movie is the kiddo Dakota.Sometimes you wonder what is the age of that kid, given the expressions and emotions coming out of that cute face. The storyline and the screenplay keep you engrossed throughout and prepare you for the final showdown. And what a climax you have(i feel it was better than 'The Fighter')..!! In a movie's war/fight you always know who is gonna win..but the real talent lies in the way you WIN it. But it manages to WIN your hearts more importantly. I would recommend this movie for all age groups, a sure-shot entertainer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great! but disappointing ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see a preview of this film on 23rd August 2011 and loved it, however at this moment in time there were a few things missing...Despite it starting off reasonably slowly with me wondering where the story was going to go, I actually really enjoyed the whole concept which contained some clever ideas to do with the concept of fighting robots. Hugh Jackman (Charlie)plays the broke ex pro boxer, now robot fighter and has a great acting role in this film. He has to take on his long lost son (Max)for two months who is fanatic about robot boxing and takes an interest in his fathers profession...an number of things happen before Max has his life saved by a mere sparring bot who has some unique features (look out for the classic dancing scene involving the shadow bot and Max)... The core of the story is the rise of this underdog robot to taking on the big boss champion in what you could call a sort of karate kid/rocky sci-fi (???). It makes for a feel good journey that is great for all ages/genders and includes certain twists in relationships mainly between Max and Charlie... I loved it up to the ending which left me slightly empty and lost the film a round of applause when there should have been one in a cleverly left pause before the credits....It is nothing major but it had a good ending when it could have easily had an epic ending, but hey it was just a preview and they may well change it (we took a survey)and it could be easily re-edited!I loved the film and it would appeal to everyone. It had a great original storyline that has your heart tingling and is a passionate film...You should definitely go and see it in the cinema and it will be worth your money!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Real Steel" is the Real Deal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steel" is awesome. I did not expect this going in. It is more than just "Transformers" meets "Rocky" doing "rock-um sock-um robots". I saw Hugh Jackman on Jimmy Fallon talk about what made him enroll in the project. "Real Steel" beyond the visually astounding CGI glitz and spectacle is the touching story of father and son defining love and respect. Again, not all that surprising given Steven Spielberg is Executive Producer. I'm a fan of Jackman. "Real Steel" may be his crossover hit that leverages his amazing gifts, playing a real guy, and not a superhero. He is awesome, as well. As Jackman describes "Real Steel" is about second chances, and redemption. Sure the story's climax pits underdog undersized fighting robot Atom against the ferocious indestructible Zeus. For me, "Real Steel" resonates in its human voice. Hugh Jackman as Charlie confesses to his son Max (scene stealing Dakota Goyo), "You deserve better? than me." Charlie asks Max, what he wants from him. Max answers, "I want you to fight for me!" Yes, "Real Steel" is fighting for love with everything you have. "Real Steel" is the real deal.Set in the near future, 2020, human boxing is now obsolete. Robot boxing is the reigning form of entertainment that gives audiences the brutal carnage without damage to human life. Jackman is Charlie Kenton, former boxer now manager of second rate robot boxers. As "Real Steel" opens we witness his robot Ambush being demolished at amusement event at a county rodeo. The promoter Ricky (arrogant and sleazy Kevin Durand) knows Charlie from his boxing days. It turns out that Charlie owes some bad people a lot of money. Charlie returns home to his love Bailey (beautiful and radiant Evangeline Lilly) with Ambush in tow. Bailey confirms that Ambush is a complete loss and reminds Charlie that he has no money. Bailey owns her father's boxing gym in the city, and her father managed and trained Charlie when he was a contender. Bailey can't support Charlie and keep the gym afloat.Charlie gets word that his old girlfriend died, and he now has custody of their son Max (Goyo). Irresponsible Charlie pretty much abandoned Max and his Mom when he was born. Max is 11 years old. Max's Aunt Debra (unforgiving and taut Hope Davis) wants full custody of Max. At a court hearing in Texas, loutish Charlie expresses no interest in being a father. Instead he brokers a deal with Debra's wealthy husband Marvin (decent James Rebhorn) to sign custody away for $100,000. Charlie needs the money to buy state of the art champion robot, Noisy Boy. The catch: Debra and Marvin are vacationing in Italy for 2 months. So Charlie gets to forge a relationship with Max, or not. Really for Charlie this means having Bailey look after Max. Goyo is natural as the smart cool gamer kid, who is a fan of robot boxing and street dancing. Seems he also inherits his Dad's stubbornness. He also insists on calling Jackman, "Charlie". Max knows he is being played at least initially.Evangeline Lilly is beautifully understated and generative as Bailey. Too bad she isn't given more to do, as well. She immediately is drawn to care for Max, because he is like Charlie, but void of his painful disappointments. In a wonderful scene she tells Max about the man Charlie was as a boxer. Although, he was 25 and 19, unfortunately all by knockout, he battled toe-to-toe with the number 2 contender in the world. Her Bailey loves Charlie so much, and is waiting for him to step into the great man he can be. Jackman shades Charlie as a powerful man, who lives life fully, leaving nothing behind. Of course the glaring paradox is his relationship with Max. Screen and story writers John Gatins, Dan Gilroy, and Jeremy Leven strike the right tone with their "Real Steel", they know it's the people that inspire, not the stunning special effects. Director Levy touchingly focuses his narrative as well.Charlie's "Noisy Boy" is torn to shreds in an underground cage match. While searching for repair parts in the junkyard, Max uncovers another robot, Atom. Atom is a second generation sparring bot, as Charlie points out to Max. So Atom is built to take punishment, not inflict it. Unfazed Max is determined to fight Atom in matches. Using his hacker skills Max merges Noisy Boy's voice command feature with Atom's Shadow Function?Atom can flawlessly imitate every movement he sees. Charlie trains Atom giving the robot the punching combinations and instincts of a human boxer. Charlie and Max leverage this advantage over other fighting bots, and soon find themselves fighting in the WRB, World Robot Boxing. The reigning WRB Champion is Zeus, technological marvel designed by creator Tak Mashido (elegantly arrogant Karl Yune). Zeus is programmed with artificial intelligence that learns from his opponents and evolves. Zeus's owner is the gorgeous and canny Farra Lemkova, well played by Olga Fonda. Human instinct and courage is matched against calculated advanced technology. This is Charlie's last shot at greatness, and his chance to come to terms with his past.In "Real Steel" Sugar Ray Leonard trained Hugh Jackman to box, and was the technical adviser for robot boxing in the ring. Jackman looks quick, strong, and lean. Too bad none of his boxer action sequences made it into the final cut. All this gives "Real Steel" a visceral authenticity. The real deal is Jackman and Goyo's heartfelt chemistry. Yes, that they become father and son is predictable. It's supposed to. Jackman is powerful and compassionate as he believably transforms into the hero. Goyo is wonderful as the innocent kid, who just wants to believe in something. In a poignant scene with both as Charlie fails to protect Max, he whispers, "I'm sorry?" "Real Steel" at times is shamelessly hokey, and I loved it. In the end it is about love, and all that you fight for. "Real Steel" gets it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film and thought it looked like a good bit of fun, robots boxing and plenty of special effects to create that format, and a pretty good leading actor, so I got the opportunity and watched it, from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen, Night at the Museum, Date Night). Basically in the near future, the year 2020, boxing and similar sports have become uninteresting for people to watch, so a new sport has been created, Robot boxing, where robots controlled by someone battle against each other in a boxing ring, this also allows for much more savage hits and destruction. Former boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) has been trying to make it in the new sport, he is not only not doing it well he is financially troubled, and he has to figure out what to do with his son Max (Dakota Goyo) following the death of his mother. Max has the first say in who looks after him, and he chooses to stay with his father rather than his Aunt Debra (Hope Davis) and Uncle Marvin (James Rebhorn), but Charlie is not all keen on the idea of having to look after the boy and struggling to pay the $20,000 debt he owes. He agrees to take his son for the summer, and one night after losing a fight they go to the scrap yard to repair the robot they have, and Max finds an old generation robot, his father sees it as a piece of junk and more like a service robot than a fighter, but his son insists on fixing it. The robot is cleaned and seemingly ready to fight, they name it Atom, and the boy insists going out to get it in a fight, Charlie is sure that if it was to fight it won't survive past the first round, but it is put into a fight and surprisingly learns quickly how to defend itself and fight hard. Following this a promoter makes sure to get them more fights, Atom slowly goes up in the world of the sport and becoming big news, and with them making money, achieving success and becoming famous the father and son become closer with their relationship as well, Charlie's childhood friend Bailey Tallet (Lost's Evangeline Lilly) becomes a fan as well. Max dismisses an offer to sell his robot for $10,000, and he makes sure while on the news though that he challenges seemingly undefeatable robot Zeus to a fight, as that could bring the biggest fame and fortune for them, but he is upset when his father says he should be back with his aunt and uncle to care for him better. Charlie realises his mistake though, asks for forgiveness from Max, and says that he has confirmed that Zeus and his controllers have accepted the fight challenge, so this goes ahead, Atom takes some very aggressive hits and gets to the point where it cannot function alone, but Charlie uses his skills to control him manually and they win the fight in the end, and Charlie and his son are happy as father and son. Also starring Anthony Mackie as Finn, Kevin Durand as Ricky, Karl Yune as Tak Mashido and Olga Fonda as Farra Lemkova. Jackman is a good choice as the man unsure but trying to adapt to fatherhood and his young co-star Goyo is alright as the determined boy, I think the father-son bonding works well with the robots boxing plot, it reminded me of one of the Rocky films, with the ups and downs of the champion, in this case a robot, and the special effects for the fights are terrific, I don't know why the critics give it a low rating, it is a fun and likable science-fiction action drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robots fighting, humans reconciling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it takes a little while to get drawn into a world where something like watching robots box is taken as a legitimate sport instead of the pastime of little boys everywhere, Real Steal is a pretty entertaining flick.&nbsp;The story is a combination of two familiar types that have seen countless variations, the underdog athlete and the reuniting and bonding of an estranged father and son. Mixing the formulas together over the backdrop of a near-future where robot fighting has replaced human boxing as the violent sport of spectacle results in a movie that's often sappy and tugs at your heart-strings with obvious intent. Still, it's also occasionally thrilling. I'd honestly be surprised if the majority of viewers didn't have a smile on their face and a positive mood by the end of the movie, as it does manage to strike some genuine notes, especially near the end.&nbsp;Hugh Jackman plays such a convincingly selfish man that it actually means something when his character has his inevitable change of heart. Dakota Goyo does a decent job as Jackman's young son, though the dancing and over-the-top cuteness of the character did seem a little much at times. Evangeline Lilly has a rather small part that will nevertheless appeal to those who are following her post-Lost career.&nbsp;Nothing about Real Steel is outstanding (aside from what I feel is a very good performance by Jackman), but I liked it. The robot fight scenes are well-done for the most part and the acting is good, but what makes this movie worth watching is that despite how many similar movies I've seen, this kind of story still brings an emotional connection.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg's Transformers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a Japanese anime series, it must have been back in the early 90's, that was about schoolkids programming miniature-sized robots to fight. I forget the name. The kids controlled from ring-side and every episode pretty much culminated with a fight. A lot of the dramatic tension came from the kids - and us - developing affection for our robot as it suffered some punishment that looked beyond repair. The fights themselves had some wuxia finesse.You have to keep in mind this was a time before console gaming was the norm it is now, so we got our vicarious thrills by watching someone else play. Now this being the Hollywood version, it has been pumped up with blockbuster hormones: robots are bigger and badder, fights are louder and more senseless, modeled after the extremely abrasive metallic havoc of the Transformers films.The Japanese angle is given a nod to, insofar as what we're led to believe will be our robot to root for is Japanese and styled like a samurai warrior. But he gets totally destroyed in his first fight, by what looks like a robot programmed to fight in a 'dirty/street' MMA style. No, our main robot is - what else - going to be another Rocky underdog, dealing in good old-fashioned American boxing.Now by itself, this only prefigures that it's going to be one more obnoxiously loud action flick. We trust we'll be able to accommodate it as we do WWE and spinoffs: a dumb, brutish show about the staging of a dumb, brutish show. A matter of simply bad taste, that we choose to indulge or don't. A no-brainer.You will notice however that Spielberg is involved here as producer. If you didn't, you will know by the end. And you can tell that nothing ended up in the film without personally stamped as okay, that or it's the work of a sycophant. So Hugh Jackman plays another sloppy, careless dad - ex-boxer of some talent dontcha know - who will have to be taught about good parenting. Naturally there is an estranged son, who we know will steer his father into responsibility. There's a woman involved, from a completely vanilla position. A shrill step mother. And naturally, a cute play-thing for the kid to bond with in place of actual family.This might have been salvageable from Spielberg's junkyard of spare parts, if for this little tweak: ordinary dramatic situations between father and son transferred to the bots they control, and visually exemplified for a change using battle dynamics. Emotional growth mapped to actual mechanics. In turn quoting the boorish nature of the show we have come to watch.No such thing here. On top of wham-bang steel destruction, we get vulgar wishy-washiness: the dad doesn't keep the kid like we thought he would, the underdog doesn't win the big fight like it would be ordinary, but the film celebrates both like they did and with a bathetic paroxysm. Small guy triumphs in the hearts of the people.So I presume this was going to be Spielberg's genre film for the year and he decided to pass on it at the last minute, either because he has another robot film lined up for next year, or because he wanted to concentrate on the loftier Horse. What happens? The naive worldview is Spielberg's, a man who understands very little about the world but a lot about how to fabricate that into massive art, and the actual fabrication is relegated to unambitious technicians, whereas Spielberg may have provided something of interest. We lose on both counts and are stuck with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailer I felt great interest to see the movie, as I'm fond of sci-fi, and that trailer appeared quite like one of my favorites "Transformers"... big robots, crazy fight, man with them; I was eager to get a DVD of it. Surprizing me, my friend at home bought it for the weekend. Relaxing on the couch with drinks and snacks we started playing it in our PS3... and next few hours I didn't speak a word but watching the movie, enjoying its every bit, the fights, and most - the characters. To my opinion, it is not just an action movie. Besides the bot-fight tensions comes up the tension of father-son relationship. I think at this point, this movie becomes a meritorious one. I just loved the characterization, the presentation of story (though the story wasn't an epic one) and the two main characters' acting was superb; especially the kid -- his acting was so naturally flowing and spontaneous, really blown my mind! Jackman's talent faded to that little boy's performance, if we compare them considering the age and experience of acting. A great movie for all.</fullReview>

Some of the robots that fight in the movie are Midas, Twin Cities, Noisy Boy, and the world-famous Zeus. The robots all have their own uniqueness and a lot of color and well-made action shots, making the movie very entertaining for many ages. Not only was there plenty of action, a robot that almost takes on a human-likeness, but there are also heart-felt and touching moments that make the movie worth-while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An FFG (fun and feel good) movie for the family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched 'Super 8', a Dreamworks studios production, I loved it for about the first three quarters of it, then it fizzled due to lame monster effects (too much déj?-vu); I was hoping 'Real Steel' would not do the same. It didn't; it worked all the way through. From the early confrontation between a raging bull and an almost worn out robot (great special effects) to the closing fight between the undefeated super boxing robot Zeus and the underdog 'Atom'. The first robot to ever have been credited with having soul, R2D2, to the cute robot Wall-E, who had oodles of it, here Dreamworks made Atom have a little soul. That's very Hollywood, but the Hollywood we can still like.As story lines go, the IMDb one pretty much captures the essential plot. It's a family movie, within certain limits; it may depend on the age of your child (children), because there is violence in boxing.A father redeeming himself with his son who he abandoned ten or more years earlier can make for a fair feel good movie; the bad guys are not that bad nor despicable because it's not that kind of movie. The fun parts are fun enough and the special effects are all well done. The cast did its job well; Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo worked their characters to the limit and that's most of the movie. The ratings do it justice.. well audience ratings anyway. I enjoyed it and hope you do too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky's son - a robot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this film is like a mash up of two Sylvester Stallone movies: Rocky (of course), the story of the indomitable boxer who, most of all, had so much willpower (and hard shell) that he just wouldn't stay down and Over the Top, where he is a tough truck driver playing at scanderberg while reconnecting with his son. The robots are fun, but inconsequential to the story itself.You see, in a world where boxing matches are done with robots, an old generation bot is tough and relies more on its handler's commands than on its programming. In the end the father and son team battle the robot of a rich Russian woman and her pet Japanese programmer. Yeah, they used a tiny bit of Rambo as well, apparently.The film was a nice feel good movie. The technical aspects were ludicrous, but again, not relevant, the actors played well and the story, as predictable as it can be, was nice nevertheless. A thumbs down for using women as walking clichés. A thumb up for using Kevin Durand, who is among my favorite bad ass actors. Bottom line: everything I expected and a little more, thanks to Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo, who carried the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is a great movie. This is movie is directed by Steven Spielberg. It is almost the same with Transformers, but in Real Steel the robots are a kind of boxer robots those are controlled by humans.It is about a collaboration between a father and his son. The father teaches the robot many kinds of tricks in boxing. There are uppercut, and the others. The good side of this movie is that it doesn't imitate the other movies about robot, because most of all movies with the same theme feature similar robots with Transformers. The lack of this movie is that the storyline is almost the same with the other movies' , first the good people are lost,but at the end they always win.By:Alien</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman is a deadbeat dad who is saddled with his 11 year old son when the boy's mom dies unexpectedly. Jackman and the kid hit the road to make some money with their fighting robot. Every cliché and expected plot twist is covered as the estranged duo bond on their way to The Big Fight. Anyone in the audience who has seen Rocky and/or Over the Top will experience a strong sense of deja vu as they watch the movie.Seriously, I can see the pitch meeting for this: "It's got the fight scenario draw of the Rocky films along with the sentimental impact of Over the Top, but with robots! Great big robots that fight like the Rock'em Sock'em Robots you loved as kids! Look how popular the Transformers are now! And we'll get Hugh Jackman to play Sylvester Stallone and Evangeline Lilly to be Talia Shire. It's a sure fire hit!"Luckily the film has some things going for it: The CGI is good; the fight scenes are pretty exciting (considering it's robots); the actor playing Jackman's son is not overly cute or annoying, he actually comes across as charming sometimes; and Jackman seems to be having a good time as the lead. Lilly is completely wasted in a pointless supporting role.Such a shame that the script didn't have a single original thought given to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real SteelThe worst thing about robot boxers is their inability to grasp the concept of "taking a dive" without self-destructing. Fortunately, the pubescent manager of the steel-plated pugilist in this sci-fi movie has got too much integrity for bribes.Following his mother's death Max (Dakota Goyo) becomes the ward of his affluent aunt (Hope Davis).But with a vacation on the horizon, she must bribe his father, an ex-boxer (Hugh Jackman), to safeguard him until her return.Under his supervision, Max recuperates a robot, which he and his dad enter into bouts. On the eve of their title shot, however, Max is removed from the event after his dad's creditors come looking for their cut.In spite of its cheesy lines and flamboyant bouts, Real Steel has real heart underneath its steely exterior. And while watching boxing with your absentee father can be healing, beating him up would be more rewarding. (Green Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Replace people with robots and you can have yourself a very feel good family film. In Real Steel we are introduced to Hugh Jackman as Charlie, one of life's losers. He never pays a debt, has people chasing him over the country, and when he finds out he has a son he just wants to sell him to his aunt. He isn't exactly a nice guy. Due to the boy's aunt and uncle going on vacation for a couple of months, Charlie must look after his son, Max. He ends up taking him to the robot boxing matches, and they soon have their own bot together. As they train and fight the robots, Charlie and Max bond. Yes, there is certainly more emphasis on the father son relationship than on the robots, giving it at least some heart. At points it is hard to really connect with the two as they are so stubborn. They also change personality rather quickly to take on the role of the adult and the child. This doesn't entirely work as they play it straight instead of for laughs. The fight scenes were very impressive, and you can see all the detail that went into these moves. The robots themselves look fantastic and perfectly blend in with the world around them. The biggest problem with the film is that their are a number of places in which it just seems confused. Durand is underused as an old rival of Charlie's. He turns up at the end, suddenly starts acting a bit racist, and we are supposed to be happy about his comeuppance. It's just such a needless entry into the film. Same with the hints at the robots possible sentience. We have two moments where we are left wondering if the robot can feel and think, but this is left incredibly vague. It seemed like a wasted opportunity, or a plot point that should have been removed altogether. The same with Max's handling of his mother's death. He never once seems upset. The only reason for the mother's death is to give him to Jackman. Basically, there's too much fat to trim around the edges. The film is very enjoyable when it focuses on its key ingredients, though it does play a bit too much into Rocky homage territory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For every valid reason 'Real Steel' (6/10 Stars) shouldn't work ? and believe me, there are plenty ? it actually did rise above its shortcomings. To get a few of those out of the way: Too long, too much for the 11-year-old crowds leaving little for adults, too predictable ("Real A-B-C Steal" would've been an appropriate title), and too many cardboard characters. This movie was absolutely saved by a fantastic acting of just 2? people: Evangeline Lilly as Bailey ? the believing girlfriend, Dakota Goyo as Max ? the Jake.2 Lloyd of this generation, though with much more talent and Hugh Jackman as Charlie ? a fantastic and believable performance. (Just so you know, the ? person belongs to Evangeline as she was barely good, and yet hundreds of times better than the sometimes ? unintentionally ? laugh-out-loud and clichéd nemesis's sprinkled about.) Incidentally, the special effects were believable and the movie did a helluva job at making sure we believed this Roboxing sport of the future truly existed. The movie's Rocky-Rip-Off finale somehow worked as well. I was emotionally invested in the climax. And again, it's due to Jackman and the fantastic chemistry established with both son and Atom. Unbelievably, recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boxing Movies touches heart, boxing robots too...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated boxing. When I first heard about LOTR, I thought it was a boxing movie. And I go not watching that movie for year, unless I came to know original plot from a friend. pathetic but true!!!But luckily I watched Cinderella man, and then that movie got me into boxing movies. Then I watched The Fighter. Those movies touch my heart. When I heard about Real Steel where Robots fight Boxing. I had no high hopes about it, but felt interested because the movie got The Wolverine. Now, I liked it and I like it much, seeing how realistic a science fiction movie can be. Seeing how a unknown son can change a father, how a son can rebuild a father's heart, I love the movie. FYI, this is the movie which will freshen your mind better than lots of comedy. No hard scene, but you may attempt to cry watching happy moments.A movie to watch with family. I rated it 8, and hope you will find my review helping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers made me wonder if I wanted to see a movie based on Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots. My biggest fear was that it was going to be another CGI eye candy extravaganza. Well, I am pleased to say it was not. There is a lot more story than just the robots fighting. The effects were a compliment to the story and not the main reason for the movie. In the near future boxing is taken over by robots. People who once boxed are moved out for people who can use the robots to do the same kind of combat. With the robots doing battle the fights can become a fight to the death only without the death. The story is about a washed up old boxer who is struggling to make a living and also reconnect with his son. This is a green light film.For more on this review please go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent package even with a slightly 'done to death' story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plus side to being a sci-fi freak is that you never fail to catch every possibly sci-fi movie out there, hoping to uncover a gem among the cliché-ridden big budget snooze-fests. After the surprisingly good Super 8, Real Steel sucker punched us with an excellent package even with a slightly 'done to death' story.Set in the year 2020, 'Robot Boxing' has replaced human boxing as the ultimate form of entertainment. Ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), a struggling promoter is trying to make a quick buck with second rate robots and a cocky attitude. A damaged robot (called Ambush) later, Charlie returns home to Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) with a son from his ex-girlfriend (deceased), 11 year old Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo) in tow. Having handed custody to protective Aunt Debra (Hope Davis), Charlie has to keep Max for the summer after brokering a deal with her wealthy husband Marvin (James Rehborn). A shattered confidence and another destroyed robot (called Noisy Boy) later, Charlie and Max find themselves in the junkyard where Max unearths a second generation sparring bot called Atom. Through Max's stubbornness and Charlie's boxing skills, Atom manages to find itself in the ring with Zeus, reigning WRB (World Robot Boxing) Champion. And that isn't what this is film is about.When Charlie confesses to Max "You deserve better... than me"; you are sold. After seeing Hugh Jackman as the superhero so many times that it was refreshing to see him in a more human and extremely flawed character. His transition from rogue conman to a responsible father was skilfully muscled together. At the same time, it was impressive to see him take a step back and let the spotlight shine on the heart of this film; Dakota Goyo. A screaming "I want you to fight for me!" Dakota has you in an emotional dump right after you've cheered him on with pump fisting enthusiasm. He mirrors Charlie's traits like a shadow with ease that you're completely enrolled into the father-son relationship. And this is what the film is about.Evangeline Lilly as Charlie's childhood comfort corner has a decent role with the highlight being her reminiscing the time when Charlie was a great boxer. Her eyes say a million words. Supporting cast in the form of Anthony Mackie (as Finn), Hope Davis, James Rebhorn, Kevin Durrand (as Ricky), Karl Yune (as Tak Mashido) and Olga Fonda (as Farra Lemkova) play their parts well in their limited screen time.Sugar Ray Leonard was brought on to the project to train Hugh Jackman. He was also required to give each robot its own style of boxing. Having him behind the scenes gives the fights that extra edge while with Hugh Jackman, more than the punches it's the eyes that make you believe in his character.Atom's shadow function enables him to flawlessly imitate every movement he sees. Dancing with Max, training with Charlie or handing out punches in the ring. You connect, you adore and hurt along with him. Unfortunately the lack of any kind of moral responsibility towards the much-loved robots like Atom from Max or Charlie was rather disappointing. Also when Atom stares into the mirror, you feel the possibility of a new sub plot. Although you wonder if he is a sentient, no reference is made to it again. Both omissions were a trick missed by the writers to steer away from a clichéd story. Loosely based on the short story 'Steel' by Richard Matheson, writers Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven don't bring anything new to the table that we haven't already seen a million times before. It's the screenplay by John Gatins that lifts the story above its mediocre base and some good editing by Dean Zimmerman gives it the perfect pace to keep you entertained even with a slightly long running time of 127minutes.The visuals thrown at you were pleasing with excellent amount of camera angles giving an absorbing view of Robot Boxing. The CGI was impressive as expected, though the background score by Danny Elfman was quite hackneyed. The sheer amount of annoying product placements throughout the film was astonishing.You'll love it thanks to a good chemistry between the lead actors while your brain is numbed by the modus operandi of the storyline. It still manages to hit the right cords and works in the bigger picture just by a margin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a pretty decent movie which had its moments. The climax of the film was brilliantly shot, and makes up for most of the flaws in the movie. Plus points are Hugh Grant, Dakota Goyo and the shadow cinematography. But on the downside, I could see similarities to a number of hit flicks. I actually felt like I was watching a Bollywood film because of the drag and sentimental scenes.Its Rocky Balboa, but instead of Sylvester Stallone, you have Atom fighting the fights.For the complete review, please visit http://sasikanth.blogspot.com/2011/11/movie-review-real-steel.html</fullReview>

Good movie, watch out for the last fight scene, made well, the suspense builds quite well and ends realistically. I really didn't expect anything much when I started watching the movie but found it amazing how a movie about a fight between two steel robots can move you to tears, this is real entertaining steel indeed. In the end you actually fall in love with Atom the robot :) Go watch it, satisfaction guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable and feel good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent example of a feel good film, it has underdogs, father son bonding and a big heart. It risks being sentimental but avoids this with some credible acting, a powerful soundtrack and awesome fighting robots.Anyone going to watch this film expecting tons of nonstop robot fighting action may be slightly disappointed. The film centres more on the growing relationship between Charlie and his son Max. It is also a film about redemption, Charlies redemption as both a boxer and a person. At the start Charlie is a classic down and out, low on money, drinking beer for breakfast and arranging underground robot fights. His redemption comes in the form of his estranged son Max, their robot Atom and Bailley his only true friend.The robot boxing is a clever idea and brings and element of science fiction to the film. Set in the not too distant future, audience demand for more brutal no holds barred fighting entertainment has led to the removal of humans from the sport. The robots in the film look great, like something out of a Japanese anime. All the CGI is very smooth and the robot battles are visually impressive.Despite the fact that there are a few clichés it succeeds in avoiding some others. For example it does have a Rocky style montage in which Atom is beating opponents here there and everywhere, but the film would not work without it. But it avoids the whole situation of Charlie keeping a secret from Max as he admits to selling Max for money right at the beginning.Also I think it is important that it remains ambiguous whether or not Atom has a soul. It is never made explicit whether Atom actually possesses some form of emotions for himself or whether its just what Max instill in him but it adds an element of mystery and helps you root for the battling bot.All in all a great feel good film I only marked it down slightly because it contains some cringing moments and sometimes Max borders on obnoxious. Other than that it is a thoroughly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Awesome Treat For All Robot Fans!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie due to its excellent screenplay, graphics and also story. As we all know, Hollywood films make our imaginations run in their movies through their brilliant graphics. As for this movie, not much graphics are used compared to the other sci-fi films like Transformers and Terminator. This movie just focuses on two characters, a father and his son. The story also isn't very dragging and heavy, but brings a deep message about the bond between a father and son. The first half of this movie is a bit boring, but this is all covered up in the second half. Despite his age, Hugh Jackman puts his full effort in his boxing moves. Overall, a great movie and should be watched by all audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the flaws, Real Steel is a fun ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman is one likable guy. It's a gift. Jackman, despite all odds, has retained his ability to somehow give a memorable performance in a movie that is far, far better that it should be.Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots Real Steel is a family flick with impressive visuals, real characters, and fun to spare. Yes, it's horribly cliché, filled with sometimes groan-worthy dialog, and includes side stories that are little more than afterthoughts, but it doesn't matter. Real Steel is going to entertain everyone between the ages of 10 - 15, and it keeps enough redeeming qualities that anyone over that age can sit through it entertained and surprisingly involved.Real Steel follows Charlie Kenton (Jackman), a former boxer known for his never-say-die spirit, dealing with life after his professional career in the ring is over. Charlie is hopping from town to town trying to make ends meet fighting robots. Charlie lucks into a situation with his son, whom he left a decade ago, enabling him to get some quick cash and get back in the ring.With his son Max along for the ride, the two slowly share a bond together, born out of Atom, a scrap yard robot whom the pair has decided to put in the ring for one last shot at the big time. As Max dances and showboats pre-fight, Charlie slowly teaches the robot some fighting moves. Atom becomes a minor sensation, and eventually leads the pair into the professional ring, all of which leads up to a showdown with the undefeated champion of the the robot boxing world, Zeus.There's no spoilers here, everyone heading into Real Steel knows exactly where the narrative is headed. The slightly flat love story between Charlie and Bailey, played by Kate Evangeline LIlly (the daughter of the boxing gym owner who gave Charlie his big break), is devoid of chemistry, but there's plenty of likability and smiles. There's no tension to the backdrop of Max's situation in regards to his mother's untimely death which thrust him into Charlie's life, nor is there anything palpable to the thrown together characters Charlie comes into contact with on his way to betting his robot in the ring.But none of that matters...The shortcomings of Real Steel don't matter in the end, because director Shawn Levy has managed to craft highly immersive robot fighting sequences that are amazingly destructive and brutal. The machines look fantastic on the big screen, and the attention to detail in the fighting sequences keeps the audience wanting more and more.The only reason the action works, the most surprising aspect of the entire production, is that Charlie and Max are well rounded characters with an interesting dynamic. It's hard to imagine this from the trailers and previews, but they absolutely work on-screen in capturing a growing bond filled with moments of strain and light-hearted joking.Real Steel is the case of a director with nothing to say (Levy also directed Night at the Museum), telling a story that doesn't have much to say which hasn't been beaten into the ground before, and doing it in a way that is so fun and enjoyable its sickening. Real Steel simply works, despite all its flaws and corny moments, Real Steel contends until the final bell.OverallNo matter how amazingly terrible Real Steel could have been, it's given life because of Jackman and the impressive visuals. Real Steel simply wouldn't have made it without a stellar looking robot fighting sequence or two, and Jackman is able to somehow take every line of corny dialog and add... something. One time it's a smirk, another time its the vague hint of a tear, and then it's that Jackman smile that lights up the entire theater. Jackman is the MVP of Real Steel, even if he is on an 8 - 8 team come playoff time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the near future and boxing has been outlawed, to be replaced by giant robots fighting instead. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman), once a boxer of promise, is a small-time proprietor of fighting robots. He owes money all over the place, and is essentially a self-centred loser. Even his on-off girlfriend Baily (Evangeline Lilly), his childhood friend daughter of his late trainer, sees no hope for him. Into his life comes Max (Dakota Goyo), his long-forgotten 11 year old son by a recently deceased ex-girlfriend. Her sister Debra (Hope Davis) wants to adopt him although, as a matter of law, Charlie has custody. On learning that Debra's husband Marvin (James Rebhorn) is worth a bob or two, Charlie sees and opportunity to sell his rights to Max and solve all his problems. Marvin is amenable, except that they don't want Max for a couple of months because it would interrupt their holiday plans. So Charlie is stuck with Max. For now.This film, as many have pointed out, is a curious mixture of Transformers and Rocky, as Charlie and Max pursue robot fighting success through a series of bouts. It is also, as far fewer people have pointed out, derivative of Rain Man in that Charlie Kenton, like Tom Cruise's Charlie Babbitt, is a self-centred loser who finds his way to personal redemption through the medium of a road trip with an unwanted relative. I wonder if the choice of Charlie as the main character's name is deliberate? From the trailers, this film struck me as amiable but daft. But it turns out to be more than that. Even though the story never really goes anywhere unexpected, it still takes place in a different world and, as such, offers us something new (and, by the way, the special effects are extraordinary - it is absolutely impossible to tell when animatronics stop and CGI takes over). It is blessed with performances which are wonderfully human.But, most of all, it has a huge amount of heart. I spent a great deal of the movie beaming broadly, and I thoroughly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a story by Richard Matheson, Real Steel is the story of a former boxer (Hugh Jackman) now training fighter robots who is saddled with a young son (Dakota Goyo) after the kid's mother dies. Despite the initial hostilities, they eventually bond after this kid finds a particular robot named Atom who he thinks can go places. I'll stop there and just say how exciting and touching the whole thing is bringing a vibe that recalls the original Rocky down to the kind of climax that results. Also good in her supporting role is Evangeline Lily as the owner of her late father's gym as she tries to keep it going and she still has a torch for Jackman. Don't want to reveal anything else so on that note, I highly recommend Real Steel.</fullReview>

Looks like he built up a bit more muscle mass. The kid Dakota was a tornado of energy and he plays his part really well, maybe even better than Hugh Jackman.The only downside is that the movie has just 3 robot fights (4 if you count the first fight with Noisy boy). I just wished there were a bit more because the fights rocked! The bots were awesome and so were their moves. The fights were also packed with action and emotion.All in all a good movie.

		<fullReview>Fans of Hugh Jackman's will be disappointed in his tepid 'I'm just here to collect a paycheck' acting in this movie. I get the impression that Hugh just kind of drifted through the scenes, totally uninvolved. His personal interactions all seemed somehow forced; as if he was somewhere else in his mind when he should have been focusing on his costars (who deserved better from him).The robot showed more genuine emotion. Child performer Dakota Goyo is a delight to watch. I laughed at just about every punchline he delivered (most at the expense of Jackman's character). Thankfully the film did not degenerate into a sappy love fest with happy ever after ending. The action was superb and the CGI was the best I have seen. The transformers movie franchise needs to take notice. The robots looked very real and the interactions with humans and other bots were just about flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real Deal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Real Steel's trailer first came out, we know that it is one of the must-see movies, a movie about robot fighting and with Hugh Jackman as the lead. I think it is a rather good concept (at least far better than the Cowboy Alien movie), as it caters to a variety of audiences being an action movie with science fiction and a little bit of father and son family drama.All we hope for is a movie like this does not disappoint... And it didn't. Although the plot of the movie is nothing too bizarre or unexpected, but it met the requirements to be an enjoyable film. Typical but relatable, and definitely does not bore.Hugh Jackman was brilliant, and still possessed his charm in the movie. I do not recall if he had ever portray a father figure in a film. But after this one, you know that he could, although he was not really much of a father in the movie. Their relationship was more like friends. The kid or his son in the movie was quite good too, annoying at times, but he had done well with what his character needed to be.Director Shawn Levy's previous movies are certainly not unfamiliar to everyone (Date Night, Night at the Museum, etc.), but most of them were comedic. I believe this is his first attempt on serious action movie, and he has certainly done a good job. The actions were intense enough to keep us in our seats and at the same time he had successfully captured the emotional moments in the movie. No doubt he could deliver as his previous comedies were good too.If I were to critique I would hope that the dialogues in the end could be more touchy, or it could have extended a bit more, as Hugh Jackman never really commended his son as his son from the beginning towards the end. But overall, it is a great movie which lives up to its expectation.</fullReview>

It's not quite Oscar fodder, but the script is well written, the acting is pretty good all around, and it's got robots beating the snot out of each other. And who doesn't like seeing robot violence?A special mention needs to be made of Hugh Jackman, who turns in yet another wonderful performance here. Hopefully this film will bring him to new audiences, but I still feel that he's such a great actor and that he's almost criminally underused. Kevin Durand also has a good outing as a delightfully sketchy fight promoter, he's the closest thing that this film really has to a villain and he manages to absolutely make your skin crawl within seconds of appearing - a real "love to hate" sort of performance.</fullReview>

This film grabs you, and pulls you into its world that when you see atom beat the snot out of another robot, your gonna be jumping up and down from your seat shouting "YEAH" Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo do an awesome job playing in the whole father and son relationship role. This is perfect sci-fi film for any family, and any father would have their eyes watery in this film, because this film is very realistic in the father and son story, its not just based on action, its also based on family, and friendship, its a very emotional movie. Now, the robot boxing is an awesome idea for this film, most of them are huge, menacing, and they stop at nothing to tear other robots head off, but there is one little robot in the movie that is called atom, and he is the smallest robot in the film, but don't underestimate him, cause this little robot can kick ass. It is amazing how one little robot can own and pummel a huge robot down. Atom may be small, but he's the heart of a warrior, and that heart helps him kick robot-ass, remember that Atom may be smallest one, but that makes him the deadliest, and for the big robots, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. I don't know what else to say about this film, its just amazing. Go see Real Steel, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's ROCKY-Sock 'Em Robots, but a hell of a lot of fun, too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is "ROCKY-sock 'em robots." Based (VERY loosely) on a Richard Matheson short story (Steel, that was first adapted as an episode of "Twilight Zone" back in the '60s), the movie is thoroughly predictable and not terribly original, but surprisingly, I found myself enjoying it very much all the same.The gist of the story; Hugh Jackman plays a down-on-his-luck, amoral (at first) ex- boxer/con man who now trains, commands robot boxers for small venue fighting (carnivals, rodeos, and back alley no-holds-barred robo-fighting). He discovers he has a son from a former (now deceased) lover. His kid (Max, played by Dakota Goyo) is a shamelessly cute, cynical moppet who carefully rides the fine line between brat and victim. The central story is really about the estranged pair reconciling over their mutual love of robot boxing and a particular robot; a washed up, rusted out, Rocky-esque junker named "Atom" (who is their surrogate family counselor at times; even though it doesn't speak). There is a love interest for Jackman, a lovely (but oh-so-spunky) female mechanic (played by LOST's Evangeline Lily) who is always in Jackman's corner... kind of a thankless 'cheerleader' for the boys. But nicely played, anyway. The acting (especially for this kind of movie) is pretty solid and keeps the audience emotionally invested despite the 'seen it all before' structure of the story.I'm at the age now (the bitter, middle-aged/old fart years) where I more or less watch movies like this with either my critical brain, or my emotional brain. They do get together sometimes (Mad Men, the newer version of Battlestar Galactica, Dexter, etc). But more often these days, I have to consciously CHOOSE to watch something with one or the other. The critical half of my brain had ALL kinds of issues with "Real Steel"; it's almost ridiculously predictable. If you've ever seen "Rocky"? Just add a estranged kid and a robot and stir. But anyway, let's get down to details. For starters, the music (a very disappointing Danny Elfman score) is almost a note-for-note ripoff of Bill Conti's "Rocky" music. Outside, in the lobby as we were leaving, it almost sounded like a Rocky movie's end credit music was playing behind us. This may, in fact, be the first really lousy, and genuinely mediocre Danny Elfman score I've ever heard (or remember hearing, at least). But the music wasn't the only thing that was predictable. The films' structure is so by- the-numbers at times; estranged parent-kid meet, have a rough time at first, get to bond, form a strong attachment, are torn asunder, and of course, get one last BIG chance at the end to 'make it all right' again. They even grafted the first "Rocky" fight (with Apollo Creed) almost punch-for-punch onto the robot action for the big climax. Anyone going to this movie looking for surprises will find none. At times I wondered if the "Steel" in the title shouldn't have had an A in the middle, replacing the second E. Critically speaking, the movie was on the ropes; it couldn't even get it's arms up to block my critical brain's jabs and upper-cuts. But then, a curious thing happened on the emotional brain side ..... I found myself enjoying it anyway. Now, my 'emotional-brain' will attempt to explain why; well for one, "RS" it's well acted (Hugh Jackman's got a lot to do with that; following the old fashioned, 'rogue-to-nice-guy' route very expertly), it's got lots of robots beating the crap out of each other (robots fighting is nothing new these days, but unlike Transformers, these are robots who actually require human controllers and are not racial/ethnic stereotypes either), it has boxing and pit/cage style fighting (a big yay for action/sports fans) and it has a lot of the same heart and on-the- sleeve emotion almost of the best of the ROCKY movies. Now, make no mistake; I (and millions of other guys) like the Rocky movies. So, what happens when you combine these elements? Well, for a average guy this formula is like catnip. I almost literally felt my inner ten year old shadow punching right alongside the robots in the movie, and also wanting to cheer over fight scenes that were totally unsurprising (but well-made and enjoyable all the same). Hugh Jackman really makes it work; he falls right into the role of a broken ex- boxer/manager like an old pair of Everlast gloves. He's Rocky AND Mickey kind of rolled into one. Lily is his "Adrian"; a capacity she is later replaced in by Max (Goyo, to his credit does a great job; again, treading that fine line between 'go play in the freeway' and 'please, oh please hit a home run for me, Mr. Ruth...' As I've said; it's seriously clichéd, but it's also a lot of fun and it wears it's heart unapologetically on it's sleeve. Maybe clichés are clichés because by and large they still work. I'm not sure, but I think this is what they used to call 'good family entertainment' once upon a time.... If one has kids (particularly 10 yr old boys)? You could do a hell of a lot worse than having a great father/son bonding day over this one! Robots beating each other into crap, nicely humanized (if clichéd) characters, and good ol' fashioned emotional investment. If I were ten? I wouldn't be here writing this; I'd be queuing up in line to see this one again... So, in a stunning upset, the emotional side of my brain wins this match in a surprising, last- round knockout!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman and Fighting Robots, what's not to like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is a film in the robotic mould of a Rocky movie, but outside this metallic framework is that of a tale of father and son reconciliation. Levy uses the robots to symbolically and figuratively represent Jackman's character, a failed boxer who would sooner sell his son for cash than face his responsibilities. Life has left him on the garbage heap. It is that same garbage heap that his son, played with likable enthusiasm by Goyo, revives an abandoned robot and in turn his relationship with his father.The robot, Atom, is in every way the underdog, but despite his size he can take a beating. Jackman is the robot in every sense. As the father and son connect over the success of their fighting robot so too does Jackman's confidence grow. His skills become the robots skills as their robot possesses a unique ability to shadow and learn from Jackman's boxing expertise. As the film progresses, Jackman and his son reveal their robot's innate value and in parallel Jackman's own value as a fighter and a father is uncovered . He fights back against the odds and at the crunch point realises the real fight is to fight for his son.As is expected the father son tale is played against the typical boxing scenario as seen in Rocky. The underdog rises to fight the colossal champion. The fights, which are choreographed by Sugar Ray Leonard, have a genuine sense of the sport behind the robots. The part CGI / part animatronic robots have the right sense of realism to make it credible to watch.Real Steel is an enjoyable watch and as expected from Spielberg as Exec Producer the film as the production value and emotional resonance to make you want to invest in Jackman. Jackman is, as always, immensely watchable and turns a character, who under another actor's control could be obnoxious to the point of audience disconnection, into a likable rogue. Lilly is a pleasure to see acting again in the supporting role and gives a genuine barometer for the type of man Jackman is portraying. She aids in the sense that here is a man on the garbage heap and only a person who can see beyond would attempt to salvage him, just as she and his son do.The boxer and his mechanical shadow overcome the odds and his own failings and its fun to go along on the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel is the Real Deal (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of robots duking it out in a boxing arena doesn't sound like a very promising concept and yet for some reason real steel makes it very interesting, and very entertaining. The story is in the year 2020 instead of humans fighting in the ring we let robots do all the bashing for us. The plot follows Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) a former boxer himself, he uses robots to fight in the ring, as a means to pay his debt to loan sharks. His robot ambush is destroyed by a bull named Black Thunder. Charlie discovers that his ex-girlfriend has died, and he is forced to attend a meeting that will decide who will have custody of his son Max, him or Max's Aunt Debra (Hope Davis, an actresses I haven't seen in a wide releases in a long time) and Uncle Marvin. Aunt Debra and Uncle Marvin decide they want to have complete custody of Max, and Charlie agrees to give them custody, only if Marvin agrees to give him 100,000 (half of it in advance) and Charlie agrees to take care of Max for three months while Marvin and Debra are away in Italy on their second honeymoon. Charlie uses his money to buy a robot from his friend Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly) who runs a boxing gym once held by her father (who happens to be Charlie's old coach). Charlie receives a secondhand WRB league robot named Noisy Boy, and arranged for it fight the illegal circus champion Midas, which is run by a friend of his Finn (Anthony Mackie). Charlie loses the battle (and Noisy Boy) because of unfamiliarity and ignorance. After the fight, Charlie and Max break into a junkyard with hopes of stealing some scraps. By accident Max falls over a ledge, but is saved by a buried robot arm. Charlie manages to pull him back, and Max takes the robot and discovers his name is Atom. Max and Charlie take him back to Bailey's gym, and discover he is a generation 2 (meaning he is obsolete). Max insists that they use him as a force for fighting, but Charlie doesn't agree with him. It isn't until after a outdoor duel with a robot named Metro that Charlie really starts to see the potential with Atom. Winning several more matches results in Max and Charlie being invited by the World Robot Boxing League to face off against a professional robot named Twin Cities, and winning. After the fight Max arrogantly challenges the WRB champion Zeus (a robot that has never suffered a single blow in it's entire fighting career) to a fight. Eventually Max and Charlie fight Zeus resulting in a final battle, that you have to see to believe.Real Steel is a very well done film, the directing by Shaun Levy (If you looked at his previous credits you'd be surprised that someone like him directed this film) is really well done. The script is spot on, keeping you both engaged and informed at the same time. The acting is great (although I admit that Hugh Jackman's accent was a little bit distracting at times, given his previous work). Jackman delivers a great performance as a jackass loner-type who is also arrogant. Dakota Goyo shows promises an up and coming actor (he was also in Thor earlier this year playing a younger version of the god of thunder), and does a good job at playing a boy who's clearly embarrassed by the man who happens to be his father, but later comes to appreciate him. Evangeline Lilly doesn't seem to be too much more than Eye-Candy in her role as an old friend of Charlie (although admittedly she isn't given much to do), and Hope Davis is great as a spineless rich aunt (but she isn't in the film very much). Karl Yune also has a great role as the villain of the story Tak Mashido (a real dick-head if you ask me). You clearly tell by his performance that he's having a great time playing a guy who will not admit defeat. Another plus is how cool the robots look.Real Steel also does a great job at working as a father/son movie, touching on the aspects of a son and the father he never knew - type relationship. Charlie knows that he can't give his son Max a great life, and Max barely even knows who his father is. As the story progresses however, the relationship between the characters grows with both of them coming to understanding about the other.Overall Real Steel was a real winner for me. It was very engaging and often entertaining. I haven't been this entertained in the movies in a long time. Go see it, I'm sure you'll have a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mindblowing Experience with Depth and Heart ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so well crafted that I felt compelled to write a review even though I NEVER write reviews ...First off, let me tip my cap to the screenwriters of this movie. YES -- the idea is not original and has been kicked around a few times in the past century. But, let me tell you this .. NEVER have I seen an action/sci-fi movie with this much heart and emotional depth to it. As a hardened male ... even I had to hold back tears at times during the film. The screenwriters developed the relationships between the characters so well that as a viewer you will deeply care about all of the main characters ... and that INCLUDES the robot.With an 80 million dollar budget, you can expect top notch visual effects and expert direction. The movie easily succeeds on those levels, but it doesn't try to bog you down with excessive special effects and action. The robot boxing is simply the backdrop to an underdog story and the relationship between Jackman and his estranged son. That is where the story really grabs your emotions ... especially if you can relate to the sorrow of a dysfunctional family .. especially if you can relate to always being considered less then great by those around you ... if you've always been overshadowed by someone greater or have never lived up to your full potential ... as an individual in a world filled with 6 billion++ .. the reality is that most of us ARE underdogs wishing for one day to be great .... that's why this film hits hard on an emotional level despite being an action/sci-fi. I wanted Jackman and his son to succeed so desperately bad that I almost forgot it was a movie and that it was all fiction. When art imitates life to the point where it can bring you to tears .. that's when you know the art is great.Overall, the acting, direction, story, and visuals were all expertly crafted ... making 'Real Steel' one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time. YET ---- of all those who worked on this project ... I must say that I give the most praise to the screenwriters (who never get enough credit in Hollywood). They put on a screen writing CLINIC throughout the course of this film. Anyone who has ever studied fiction would agree with me and be able to realize why the writing is so great.In a word, this movie is pure GOLD and it will be nominated for more then one Oscar. 100% guaranteed.</fullReview>

I couldn't close my eyes although I didn't sleep the day before. and I bet you that by the end you will be so tense you'll start air boxing inside the movie theater without even knowing it.It's a great family movie that deeply explores father and son relationships in an indirect way and really brings out the kid in you, also for boxing fans this is a must see ! it's kind of an old school struggle story but with a high class acting and amazing graphics.</fullReview>

He tours the small circuit looking for fights in an attempt to break into the big time. Charlie isn't the most likable of characters. He's got a drinking problem and a son he's never met named Max (Dakota Goyo). When an opportunity arises to make a buck off being a parent, Charlie has to take Max along for the ride.The effects behind Real Steel are the real showcase. CGI is prevalent during the robot boxing matches. Though not necessary, the effort was clearly made to use some actual robots in close-up. The difference between the two will go unnoticed by most, in big part due to the smooth animation. I actually prefer the robot action in this movie over that of the Transformers series because the confined location of a ring or cage makes the action significantly easier to digest.Watch the full movie for free at : n m o v dot com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a futuristic version of Rocky meets Rock Em' Sock Em' Robots and you have Real Steel. It won't win points for creativity or originality and many of the plot elements feel vastly familiar, but for those willing to accept that: it can be considered good mindless entertainment.Aussie-hunk Hugh Jackman delivers an appealing and lighthearted performance as Charlie: a bankrupted ex-boxer who lies, cheats and steals in order to avoid inconveniences. He devotes most of his time to robot boxing, even after owing everyone money and rarely cares about the people he endangers or hurts. When he's asked to take custody of his eleven year old son: Max (played with genuine affection by newcomer Dakota Goyo), Charlie is torn between having to abandon his selfish acts or loose the only real thing that's ever mattered to him.Skillfully directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum), this is an uplifting tale of a man who finds redemption after discovering the importance of family, hope and forgiveness. It's also a unique character study that demonstrates how someone with a cold and cruel personality can have a change of heart after a good natured event has the ability turn their lives around.The fight sequences are exceedingly well choreographed and feel realistic and it was even rumored that real life boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard was brought in to portray the robots using motion capture technology. Jackman and Goyo are perfectly matched and you can believe the father and son chemistry that exists between them, but even more extraordinary is the touching connection Max has with Atom (the previously generated robot which Charlie and Max discovers and trains.)Even though this is one of those films where you can figure everything out before you watch it; the special effects are spectacular, the action is exhilarating and Jackman reminds us of how he became a genuinely charismatic movie star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's commendable how much of an asshole a Hollywood star like Jackman is willing to play here. OK, so there are no points for guessing if Jackman's down on his luck robot boxing promoter Charlie is going to change his ways by the end of the movie. But for a good forty minutes of the film, you'll probably find yourself wondering how the hell the director, screenwriter and star are going to make a single audience member give an ounce of sympathy for this most unsympathetic of schmucks.But in good old Rocky style, you will undoubtedly be cheering on the underdog when it comes to the David vs Goliath robot boxing match that is the climax of the film.The central relationship between Charlie and his estranged son Max is believable as is the setting of the not-too distant or unfamiliar future. Kids still have daddy issues (especially kids who have dads like Charlie) and all that seems to have changed is that robot boxing is the sport of the future.The robots are a brilliantly seamless blend of puppetry and CG effects and when Max discovers a battered boxing droid discarded (as he once was by his own jackass dad), the plot kicks into motion.It's an enjoyable but predictable ride with Dakota Goyo impressive as the justifiably antsy kid. Jackman carries the film with his detestable Dad and a surprisingly convincing character arc. Lost's 'Freckles' (Evangeline Lilly) is wasted in a very similar way to her recent cameo in The Hurt Locker. She needs to find a new agent that won't leave her cheering on the action from the side lines.The robot fights are realistically rendered but it's the father-son relationship that makes this film the real deal. Great for families. It's out 14th October.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The preteen young male missing a father figure and bonding with a robot story has already been done and I liked the Ah-nold Terminator II version much better, since he wasn't remote controlled. There are also some other distinct differences in the two films, Atom was not sent back from the future to terminate Max (Dakota Goyo), he was just a tin man with no brain, oh wait that resembles another story, and Max's father Charlie (Hugh Jackman) is very much alive, but possibly the most selfish person on the planet. We know from the trailer that the fight game has changed, that Charlie was once a pretty decent boxer, but lost his place in history to robot boxing, which is now the sport of the future. Max finds Atom who is a sparring bot in the robot graveyard and tries to get a foothold in the robot boxing circuit, for the most part so that he can spend time with his father. This film tried really hard to be a something for everybody story starting with the emotional connection from a father and son bonding, it gave us a road trip, special effects with some hard hitting robot boxing following the Rocky (every single one of them) roadmap of rooting for the underdog, even a dash of romance, and still it just seemed like something was missing. Maybe if Charlie had been a less flawed character, or if anybody in the entire film was likable on any scale of likability aside from Max. Ricky (Kevin Durand) was awful but I guess that made for a pretty good villain, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) was a sad case and could have done so much better, and for my taste there was just not enough on screen time for Finn (Anthony Mackey). OK, so I liked two characters out of the whole bunch, Max and Finn. I just wanted something or anything from this film that delivered a tab bit more than expected. After having seen the trailer and then the movie it was of no surprise to me that there was pretty much nothing left to be desired at the screening. Because of my generous nature and because I thought that the robot special effects were reasonable, although if they had contacted the NFL and found out who designed their robot's movements, the bots would have moved a lot less clunky, I give it an amber light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel; An Unintentional Love Letter To Sly Stallone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose the moral to this story is that you get what you pay for. If you watch the television commercial, check out the trailer or have gone to the movies in the past twenty years, you could have predicted what this movie was about. I figured, how bad could it be? With Hugh Jackman starring, It's got to be a fun cross between "Transformers" and "Rocky." Well, the answer is that it's not terrible. But it's not just a gentle homage to the two incredibly successful movie franchises, but a blatant ripoff. The "Bots" look exactly like they were stolen from Michael Bay's private collection. And the screenwriter, John Gatins, seems to be obsessed with Sylvester Stallone. You can almost pick out the scenes that were plucked from the pages of Rocky, Rocky IV &amp; Rocky V. But in reality, "Real Steel" has its roots firmly entrenched in a far less glamorous Sylvester Stallone vehicle called "Over The Top," a far-fetched yarn about a long-haul trucker who has to earn the respect of his oh-so-wise and precocious son (that he abandoned years ago) by entering a championship arm wrestling championship in a gaudy Las Vegas showdown. Oh, i forgot to mention that this arm wrestling trucker, named Lincoln Hawk (Stallone) tries to fight for custody for his son with the boys millionaire grandfather. Well, there you go, I just gave away the plot to "Real Steel." But lest I forget the most obvious "Rocky" ripoffs, a very beautiful Evangeline Lily plays "Adrienne," Her deceased boxing-trainer father plays the "Mickey" role, young Dakota Goyo, plays the "Robert," Rocky's son in 'Rocky V," and of course who can forgot the bad-guy champion robot is a dead-ringer for the evil Russian giant "Ivan Drago" in "Rocky IV" Just in case you were curious, he wears the same exact Ray-Bans that Stallone wore throughout the unfortunate movie "Cobra." Getting back to "Real Steel", for what it's worth, Hugh Jackman is one of the very few actors who can "open" a movie, but unfortunately, he has to fire his speech coach. Unfortunately this time around, his American accent is as transparent as Anne Hathaway's English (Scottish) accent in "One Day." I couldn't tell if his character, Charlie Kenton was supposed to hail from South Philly, like Rocky Balboa, or Brooklyn. And he was working at it so hard, that he forgot to act. He is very handsome and charismatic, and seriously has the whitest teeth I've ever seen, but I don't think he'll be playing Richard III any time soon.He's also built like a professional body-builder. I've been a boxing fan for most of my life and boxers (with the one exception of Ken Norton 40 years ago) don't look like that. Just Google any fighter from Rocky Marciano to George Foreman. Boxers, especially heavyweights, don't have have "six-pack abs" or bulging veins on their bulging biceps. Even check out Rocky, or as it's now known as "Rocky I." Stallone was a big hulking guy who looked like a real boxer, which is one of the prime elements for it's iconic success. It's only when Stallone hired a personal trainer to try to replicate the musculature of Michelangelo's "David" did he set a new absurd standards in what men should look like with their shirts off. Forget boxers, human beings just don't look like "Rambo." But at least Stallone has made a career of looking like that. When did a long-haul trucker whose days are spent looking for robot parts in junk yards have time or money to hire the same personal trainer. It seems as if every man who takes his shirt off has to look like an underwear model. Jackman was supposed to be playing a washed-up ex-boxer whose claim to fame is that he got knocked out by the number one ranked contender to the champion. They even talk about his extremely unimpressive fight record. And since his retirement some fifteen years before, he's been trying, unsuccessfully, to make a living at Bot-boxing, in which giant metal robots take the blows. Does he stop at a Gold's gym in every city that he passes? To add insult to injury, Hope Davis is frighteningly miscast as the sister of his son's mother who is trying to adopt Max. Anthony Mackie,who practically stole the movie from Matt Damon in "The Adjustment Bureau," is electric as Finn, a small time fight promoter, and Evangeline Lily does as much as she can in the few scenes she's in. Most of the movie is the relationship between father and son, which is so predictable that it's a little scary.What I do find seriously disheartening is that Steven Spielberg's name is splashed proudly across the screen as the "Executive Producer." I think that the man who has directed some of the best movies ever made should be more choosy about where he lends his well-deserved stamp of approval to. The Spielberg name is a brand. If the man is known to be involved in a movie, one has to assume a certain measure of brilliance. Without chipping away at his bearded visage on the cinematic Mt. Rushmore, the best director in the past fifty years has lent his name as Executive Producer to at least a dozen movies, not the least among them being "Men In Black II," all three "Transformers" movies, and "Cowboys and Aliens."

		<fullReview>A little syrupy and somewhat predictable. Reminds me of the original Rocky though. I love the effects and cheered for the ending. A movie I would not be ashamed to take the kids to. I remember when my kids were younger watching the robots battle on TV (remember Vlad the Impaler?) My kids were so impressed that they went out and bought Battle Bots for their Christmas money. I can say this movie made me feel like those times again. On the downside, Jackman's character was cast as just too predictable. You could just predict his character's actions throughout. The writers could have written his character as a more believable hard luck story. Overall, the movie was very enjoyable as compared to some of the ones this year. I would not recommend for for kids younger than 6 or 7. But OK for anyone else. No murder, no bullets, no swearing, and no sexual scenes. About as racy as it gets is some cuddling by Jackman's character seeking comfort and understanding. A lot better than the Transformer style of movie fighting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie with fighting robots that doesn't transform...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, a family movie with fighting robots? Sure, why not...Actually the story in "Real Steel", despite it being so predictable that it is bordering on being sappy, was entertaining enough. You know the outcome of the movie right away, but still it works out well enough. Why? Well, because this family movie is good entertainment, has some nice CGI effects, and actually does have a deeper meaning to the storyline and not just robot fighting.The story in "Real Steel" is about former boxer Charlie Kenton (played by Hugh Jackman) who is now doing fights with robots, but he is barely making ends meet. When he is left with his estranged son, Max Kenton (played by Dakota Goyo), Charlie has to step up and take responsibility and grow both as a person and as a father.Yep, sappy family storyline right there. But it is actually fun to watch. And the robot fights does actually make it worthwhile to watch. There is a lot of adrenaline and hard punches. And truth be told, then it was nice to see robots like this and not as in those God-awful "Transformers" movies.The people they have cast for the movie were doing good jobs with their given characters."Real Steel" is entertaining for the entire family, as it has action, family value, some morale ethics and a good wholesome feel to it. So if you have a 127 minutes to spare, then put on "Real Steel", lean back and put your feet up, because you will be in for some serious punching with these robots. This is a true underdog story in all its meaning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't a KO but I would say that this movie is still a winner.The storyline and acting are decent. The premise was definitely original.Why does every movie have to have a romantic interest? The romantic subplot added nothing to the story and actually messed up the pacing of the movie. Some interesting stuff happens and then boom, you are stuck watching another dull scene between Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly. The movie is too busy as Jackman tries to get along with his son AND win the girl AND win the robo-boxing championship all in one movie.Still the movie is entertaining. There are some exciting moments and a few laughs as well.So if you like boxing, robots, slightly annoying children, and boring romance, then this movie is perfect for you. If you don't like any of these things then steer clear of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Entertainment with Pure Emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love action/sci-fi movies, and I do not know why I waited for so long to watch this movie. I expected to be just about fighting robots, but NO! It's more than just that!! There are emotions, there is passion. And that's what I love. The movie is so good it actually grabs you and makes you a part of the movie. Watching the robot matches was like watching a live boxing event or a football match on TV! It's so good! It makes you go Whoaa, Oohh and Ahhh!! The emotional scenes were spot on! It actually made me cry! The acting was really good especially the little boy (Dakota) and Hugh Jackman. They were amazing and I love their father-son relationship. Evangeline Lily also did a pretty good job. And since I'm a music freak as well, I'd like to add that the soundtrack was pretty good.I wouldn't mind watching this movie again, because once you start watching it you can't stop till the credits roll. It was that entertaining!!! It was a perfect mixture ofentertainment and emotions. Well worth a watch !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertainment Guaranteed !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first impression was that this is going to be a "sci-fi hi-tech action" kind of a movie which would not give me any food for thought, but this is much more - story of a boxer past his prime (who's a bad bet), a relationship which builds between a son and his father nicely told), a kid who was looking for a father figure, finding it first in a robot and then his real dad. A real plot, continuity and interesting twists (though on expected lines). The underdog formula always works if the director builds it up till the end - Shawn Levy did it pretty well.The high point for me in this movie was the screenplay. This movie could have so easily ended up being another sci-fi flick, but the screenplay actually gave it so much more depth - made it more human. Each character was well researched and portrayed - jackman's portrayal of boxer past his prime had to be burly but not muscular (knowing how jackman can really tone up his body), the portrayal of Tak Mashido's character was flawless - geometrical face-cut and doesn't speak much (had to be an egoistic geek). Mark of an effective screenplay is how it builds up to the finale. Real Steel had this quality. And finally, not to miss, the graphics were believable too. Robots looked &amp; moved in a believable fashion. Overall, 7 out of 10 for me. Entertainment guaranteed !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sort of like transformers with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The robots in this movie definitely reminded me of the Transformers, which is a good thing. In this, Hugh Jackman plays, Charlie, a dead beat dad, whom fights robots. The mother of his son, Max, dies and Charlie is left with custody. He doesn't really care, but Maxes Aunt wants to raise him. The Aunt's hubby offers Charlie some money if he will watch Max over the summer until they get back from Europe. So of course, Max loves the robots and is into the boxing. Max finds an old robot, fixes him up, and the robot becomes the people's champ.Of course Charlie changes over the course of the film.FINAL VERDICT: Good special effects, the robots were neat. If you like transformers, you should like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable yet entertaining movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was going to be just another dumb action movie that is entirely pointless, but I was totally wrong. This movie, although it is extremely predictable, definitely has some heart and makes you really care for the characters, even the robots. Speaking of the robots, they are incredibly well-done and one of the better parts of the movie. I can see why it was nominated for an Oscar for visual effects--they are highly realistic and seems to have their own personalities.The acting, too, was actually pretty good--definitely better than in most action movies like this. Hugh Jackman was quite good in his role, and you could definitely see the determination in his face. Evangeline Lilly was good too, although she could've used a little more screen time. However, the standout performance for me was by Dakota Goyo, who was a surprisingly good actor (and a pretty decent dancer, too...). He acted just as a kid should act--he wasn't overly mature, he was at times overemotional, and he pretty much just wanted to have fun. Some of the interactions and dialogue between him and his father was very well-written and realistic, although each character throughout the movie definitely has their share of cheesy lines.The movie overall, though, is pretty entertaining--it's impossible not to get attached to the characters, and thus entertained. The fight scenes are very exciting, although the ending was an interesting choice. I didn't necessarily see it coming, and at first didn't understand why someone would choose that ending, but then it dawned on me: it doesn't matter what the ending is like, it just matters how you got there, and I think that's what the characters realized too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived, formulaic storyline with annoying brat thrown in for good measure, yet it works!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By all accounts, this movie should be a total crock. As someone who cannot stand the Transformer franchise, as I watched Real Steel I kept shaking my head at the sheer cheesiness of the movie. I mean, what's not to hate about it? The inept father who does good in the end, the failed sportsman who is finally vindicated, the underdog who performs against all expectations, an annoying know-it-all kid who gets attached to a _________(pet/toy/robot), the disappointed girlfriend who is finally won over, the storyline is basically all the family movie clichés you can think of, thrown into a blender and then force fed to you.Yet, I cannot deny the fact that I actually ended up enjoying Real Steel. Not only that, since initially watching Real Steel as an in flight movie, I've watched it twice more since then on Blu Ray and the crispness of the visuals and sound was stunning and just added to what was an already enjoyable feel-good movie.Visuals and audio aside though, what really sells Real Steel is Hugh Jackmans performance and the direction. Ultimately, this is a very well told story with an actor who seems to be having fun with the part and who yet at the same time makes his character believable.So, all in all a cheese fest storyline with superb acting by Hugh Jackman and excellent special affects. Real Steel is the kind of movie that you're either going to love or hate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well made with some excellent effects; the robot fight scenes are quite amazing! Some well chosen tunes intersperse the action, which works well, although some of the music wasn't to my taste. The performances were all very good, particularly Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, he really had me believing Charlie was a complete idiot at the beginning of the film (always a good sign). Dakota Goyo also did a decent job as Max, a little annoying at times, but eleven-year-old boys are like that in real life, but still a decent performance nonetheless. Finally there's Evangeline Lilly as Charlie's former trainer's daughter, Bailey Tallet. Quite a straightforward role that she played very well.A film with very much a feel-good factor, but not one that makes me want to jump in the shower to wash the saccharine off. I've heard it described as 'Rocky with robots' and I can see how that comparison could be made. There's plenty of action and in between, more than a little drama as Charlie and Max try to figure out their relationship. For me, it didn't let me down on the entertainment front despite its shortcomings (little character depth and a slightly predictable plot) but it still gets the SteelMonster Seal of Approval!...

		<fullReview>First time when I read about the new movie of Hugh Jackman I told myself "Oh, no! Not another action movie!" And to be utterly honest, I wanted to see it for the actor, being almost sure I'll get somehow disappointed by the subject. I couldn't have been more wrong.It says the story of a man who changes, learning to be a father, learning what responsibility means, learning to love, learning. It is the story of a little boy whose determination, huge heart and good nature wins and changes people around him. It is the story of a robot who melts our hearts.Real Steel is a very good drama which brings everything on the table: emotions, smiles and some ... darn good fighting scenes. And Hugh Jackman above all. Definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a lot going for it. It has a good feel about it, I was really glad I watched it and highly recommend it. The overall plot you already know, what I liked was the child character in the movie is not annoying. This is a classic underdog wins the day movie, but it feels fresh and crisp. Was also a nice surprise to see Kate from lost, although you don't see her enough. I'm not a massive fan of Robot wars, but this movie might have converted me. The CGI affects are top notch and blend in naturally with the rest of the movie. I won't give you any spoilers but I enjoyed the start too. It is just a good blend of action, drama some romance and I think most people will identify with at least one of the characters. It is also girlfriend safe which is a double bonus. She might not sit through a mindless action with you, but she'll sit through this one - trust me. Love it -- 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is clear that this film was targeting a younger demographic. The plot is very simple and the characters are straight forward and cliché. You will not be thinking throughout much of this movie, and perhaps that's exactly what makes it fun to watch. Rock'em Sock'em Robots reenacting "Rocky." The graphics are pretty neat and the film has a good pace to it. Its the type of movie you would enjoy watching with your kids. If you're looking for moving plots and unique storytelling, this is not your movie; bu if you're just looking to sit back and unwind for a bit with family and friends it's right up your alley.

		<shortDescription>Empty Cast Iron Exhibition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast: Jackman in the role of an absentee father, leading an irresponsible life and taking unnecessary and miscalculated risks as a robotrainer. Dakota Goyo in the role of a bratty loudmouth kid who keeps making demands with the most obnoxious of tones in an attempt to redefine coolness. CGI in the role of Atom and a number of more Transformers transformed into Roboboxers. E Lilly in the role of decent but distant gym-owner hottie.The story: Basically the kid just lost his mother, doesn't ever seem to shed a tear, instead gets all offended that the father he had never met agrees to take care of him for money. The father seems to find it heroically macho to persistently place large bets on random fights with money he doesn't have. Their hopes for money/victory/unison are finally pinned on a more human-like (therefore obviously spiritually and physically superior) retro robofighter reminiscent of a mute Sonny from I Robot.After a predictable tirade of winning-at-first-and-then-facing-hardships, in which the CGI successfully impresses and helps distract from the unbelievably poor sci-fi backstory attempt and the cheesy-line acting, Bubmblebee faces Iron Dolph Lundgren in the final match.Random thoughts: In a world so obsessed with political correctness, it evades my comprehension how the stereotype of a dysfunctional kid with despicable behaviour apparently correlated with being raised by a single parent has become so casually acceptable. I know plenty of kids with only one or no parents who are confident yet polite, and who can communicate using reason while maintaining their childhood enthusiasm.Also, how do the robots get infused with willpower? I assume they do, otherwise I don't see why the Rocky-wannabe countdown drama is there. Either it's broken or not. Perhaps it's via the metal door conveniently located at the lower back of the robot through which the one critical wire cut by all the pummelling can be accessed for re-circuiting.I wish I could be more sympathetic about the movie, but the characters make it so hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really worth a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Real Steel' was a film that not many people expected much from. Hollywood's running out of ideas fast and this is the first major film to be adapted from a game (not a video game). Luckily for Hollywood's sake it has worked. It's not the smartest film in the world, it can be a bit predictable but it does have some interesting aspects which really carry it as a whole. Unlike many typical films, not many of the characters are likable; Hugh Jackman plays a drunk, debt-riddled, nearly unemployed man who abandons his child at a young age and forgets about him almost instantly. As intended, he does begin to grow on you and Jackman plays this part very well, he convinces you easily in the beginning that he is not a nice man. Dakota Goyo is a breath of fresh air, his character is unique in the sense that he does not play your average cute little boy who says something insightful every half hour, he's sarcastic, cracks jokes, is confident and really does bring the film to life. The only main acting flaw I could see was Kevin Durand who's character was supposed to be the antagonist but really didn't have much on-screen presence.The script is okay, it's predictable but it's certainly not bad. The dialogue is quite realistic and is often really funny, particularly between Jackman and Goyo. The plot is a bit interesting but the whole 'getting stuck with the kid' idea can become tiresome in films, luckily they managed to make it more interesting with the boy actually having a personality. The CGI is mostly great but there are some parts where it is lacking something. The soundtrack works really well with this film and carries a lot of major scenes. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film, especially if you have children they will love this. Adults can enjoy it too, it's funny, has a lot of action and keeps you interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good film, not a great film but very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the reason I decided to do my own movie reviews. After hearing a review for this film from BBC Radio 1's movie reviewer, I decided to start my own review page. She reviewed this film seeing nothing more than the robots. She totally missed out on the whole plot of the movie, and then her comment "the climax takes a long time to come and it happens right at the end" made me want to climb into the radio and tape her mouth shut. I know where I expect the climax of a film to be, and I know it is nowhere but at the end of the film. Yes this film has big giant robots in it, but the plot is way more than that, it is a story about redemption and doing the right thing no matter how hard the journey. I got that much from just seeing the trailer, she saw the whole thing and missed the whole point.OK rant over.This is a good film, not a great film but very good. Hugh Jackman is good in this but to be fair he is good in most things. He gets to show off a bigger range of his acting skills than he has in the X-Men films. He plays Charlie Kenton, a former boxer now heavily in debt due to pushing his fighting robots too hard and expecting more than they can give, like fighting a 300lb bull! This also stars Evangeline Lilly in I believe her first role since the series Lost ended. She is also very good in this. However, the star of the film is Dakota Goya as Max Kenton. He shines as the child thrown together with the father he doesn't know. He enters the world of robot fighting with his father and manages to rescue a robot from a scrap pile. He then convinces his father to enter the robot in the fights. You really get to experience the wonder of the Robots through him. The other star is the robot he rescues, Atom. Although not sentient, the director manages to bring him to life with good camera angles and subtle sounds. You really start to feel for the robot and you manage to forget the fights aren't real. The other very clever part of the film is the setting. It is set in the near future, but the only really futuristic thing is the robots. There are no fancy cars or clothes and this enables you to connect with the film easier.The climax of the film (at the end!), is a big showdown with the undefeated champion. Instead of just two robots bashing each other, you get Atom, the underdog, controlled by Max, and helped by his father. You see and feel each blow the robot takes and through the acting skills of Dakota Goya, you forget it's a machine and you can't help but cheer him on.This could have been an average film, but the fine performances by the cast and the skill of the director in bringing Atom to life with just the use of camera shots and clever subtle sounds turns this film in to a joy to watch as you take the journey with father, son and giant robot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way better than a movie about boxing robots has any right to be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a few of Shawn Levy's previous works, i went into Real Steel a little hesitant. What a surprise i got. A genuinely beautiful story about a father and his estranged son brought together by their shared love of robot boxing. Hugh Jackman plays his character exactly how you'd expect, gambling addict and washed up pro boxer himself, he seems to make wrong decision after wrong decision. That is until the death of an old girlfriend introduces his son Max into his life. Smart, reserved at first, it isn't long before we see the real Max. Immensely confidant, something he obviously gets from his father, Max finds an old sparring bot during an outing with his father, the reason for this is to steal parts to build a new bot, after Hugh has his robot destroyed in an illegally organized "underground" bot battle. "ATOM" is a generation 1 sparring robot, "designed to take a lot of damage, but never really deal any", Max sees something no one else does in this discarded robot and the story really picks up from this point onward. Throughout the 2nd act we are introduced to all manner of characters, including undefeated champion robot boxer Zeus, Hugh's characters trainers daughter and love of his life, the creator of Zeus and female owner of the company invested in the Zeus team. Every actors performance is spot on, especially Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly. All roads lead to a beautiful ending in which ol' Jacko has to metaphorically speaking, don the gloves one last time for a showdown with the undisputed boxing champion of the world. Well written, very well directed, powerful performances all round make REAL STEEL an absolute winner. Cant wait for the sequel, could easily be the "new" Transformers type franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child of the 80's AND a huge action movie lover, I got the best of both worlds while watching this movie. As I mentioned in the title of my review, Over The Top is the first movie I thought of as the credits rolled by. This movie was so much like my fav. Stallion movie from the 80's that I had to revisit the story line a few times to make sure they just did not substitute a "arm wrestling" with a "robot". In the end, it seems that since this movie is based on a short story that was written in the 60's, it could not just be a remake of the classic 80's movie so just MAYBE Over the Top used snippets of this short story to create the Stallon movie...who knows. All I DO know is that this movie has it all...action, drama, humor and sci-fi all wrapped up into a enjoyable movie that the whole family should enjoy. I did not want to look away..the action followed well, the drama was not too intense and the story line was believable enough that Im starting to wondering WHEN exactly we will see ROBOT boxing in our future.. They often say inventions are based on movies and TV right? Well, when Robert boxing starts...i will be there for sure thanks to this movie! Loved it and its well worth the money you spend on it. Its a keeper..kinda like an Ironman or a Spiderman movie. Get this one! Cant wait to #2 comes out in 2014.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Shawn Levy to direct a Transformers reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Real Steel I scoff at it, thinking it looked like a big budget, cliché ridden film and that Hugh Jackman needed a better agent. It had been jokily been called the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots the movie, but it turns out that Real Steel is an entertaining film for the whole family.In the near future robot boxing has replaced human boxing because people wanted the carnage without the bloodshed. Charlie Kenton (Jackman) was a boxer who was forced to turn to a robot operator. He is constantly in debt, always on the road to fight underground, avoiding debt collectors and has to make deals to find new robots. At a rodeo in Texas he is told his ex-girlfriend has died and he is the next-of-kin to his son Max (Dakota Goyo). Charlie is willing to get Max's aunt (Hope Davis) care for him, for $100,000, but only if he takes care of the child when they she is on her second honeymoon with her husband (James Rebhorn). The aunt is not aware of this deal. Over the summer Max finds a old sparing robot Atom, and over the course of the film improve it. Atom some raises up the underground scene to the point he can challenge the best robots in the professional league.Real Steel is a sports film, a sci-fi story and most importantly a father-son story. Charlie starts as a real jackass, avoiding his creditors and willing to sell his son for a quick buck. Of course Max is not thrilled finding this out but slowly they bound and as characters they grow. They story is the main element of this film and Jackman and Goyo were good performers together. The boxing was also really well handled: Shawn Levy was able to mix animatronics and CGI seemingly as knocking seven bells out of each other. There is excellent camera work, editing, special effects and a soughing score by Danny Elfman. Levy was able to make the human drama compelling and deliver on the robot action, making all the robots look different and have different styles and moves. He would be a much better choice to direct a real Transformers reboot.The acting was solid throughout. No one was Oscar worthy but they did good job particularly Jackman as his character does change and grow. Some people have said that Goyo was annoying but I thought he did a good job and shows a lot of promise. I think that it is more the writing behind the character and I think there are some just reasons behind that, he just lost his mother and dumped with a father he does not know or cared about him. Even though this is a paycheque film for most of the actors they did at least put effort in their performances and for someone like Evangeline Lilly hopefully Real Steel can be a stepping stone from her role on Lost to a promising film career.As a sport film it can be a little clichéd but as a whole it is still very well done, still exciting and action packed. Some elements could have trimmed but it is a decent little package.As a film it is good family entertainment. It is a drama, but not dark nor really light and there are some comic moments. Tonally it is just about right to show for children over the age of nine to adults.7.5/10</fullReview>

The acting of Dakoto Goyo was great, and you really did feel like he had a connection with his robot, they gave that robot the certain humanity you can relate to. Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly did a great job themselves. And the story was almost epic, if not epic. Great concept.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wont for a minute pretend that "Real Steel" is anything more than a weekend popcorn movie, but it delivers what it should- a fantastic ride.Its an adrenaline pumping, emotionally tangling fun fest coupled with decent acting and very engaging characters. From Charlie and Max to even the CGI bots the characters are so engaging that even the corny moments feel very tolerable.The story follows a self-centered bot fighter named Charlie and his reconciliation with his son Max, through a robot named Atom. I know, nothing new right? But its the execution of it that matters. Besides its robots- boxing! how can anybody not like that? I will leave you with this, if you're in the mood for an action movie with a good story and some bot fights, look no further...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As i started watching the movie i could easily predict the following scenes but as the movie proceeds i got into the movie.The most i liked is the boy (Max)attitude apart from all that the Director had brought some acting skills from all those who acted in the Movie. And also the portrayal of the Atom is seems good. A very good Graphics on portraying the Robots as it looks more realistic. As i could say u again don't miss Max Kenton on screen. And also don't look for any Logic in the Movie,its movie u can just enjoy with just some REALISTIC graphics. Its a movie of Fantasy+Action+Scifi+Sport+Sentiments... Hope u guys enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*spoilers* awesome and energetic but needs more flavor at some parts .. the whole concept is very good .. few fights and less details.. you know like 5 rounds, no TKO's and short time between rounds which you would need a hell of a maintenance/repairing team not.. but anyway it get you straight to the point which is .. um , dad son relation "of course not as pursuit for happiness" .. and the most important thing which is "fight smart, be patient and pray" .. i kinda expected the final fight result and that's why i called it Rocky IIV .. if you put all the Rocky movie series into a time machine, you will get this.. as a matter of fact i think if the movie was made as Rocky VII with Jackman as Robert Balboa Jr. and Atom nicknamed/tribute Rocky Balboa it would have been been "Real kicka$$" (7.5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman is really good as ex-boxer/estranged father who thinks he knows all about boxing robot business yet we sensed that he's such a looser all along. With the arrival of his estranged son (great Dakota Goyo) and ATOM a robot that really captures what human really is, he finally learns something more about his life and his purpose.And Evangeline Lilly, what can I say? She infused vulnerability, humility, and beauty at every scene she's in. I think in the future she will be one of A-List star, if not already happening.And did I tell you it is possible to cry during ROBOT movie? With Real Steel I can assure you that it is much much possible. It's beautifully written and executed. Every moment counts - something that Michael Bay should learn :) - and I can't wait for its sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's like Rocky with robots. And i loved Rocky filmography. The story of Real Steel takes place sometime in the future (on earth) where robots have taken the place of human boxers. A fighting promoter is trying to succeed in the sport, placing his bets on an old robot with the help of his 11 year-old son who suddenly appeared in his life. I liked the whole use of technology concept. Still controlled by humans with no AI embedded yet, or at all.And i'm talking about actors and robots working on filming on the same set! You got to thank Concept Overdrive for this great movie (the same company that developed the real time motion systems used on 'Avatar'). Overdive uses the "Simul-cam" process which combines computer graphics robots with real world actors and sets. So that gave the director of this film, Shawn Levy, the experience of shooting the whole scene live. The film's real-world hydraulic robots were created by Legacy Effects, who utilized an Overdrive system to perform animatronic robots. The result was simply amazing.Hugh Jackman is a great actor and he proves it once again. Strong, convincing, sensitive performance. The key character here though is 12 year-old Dakota Goyo. Some of you might remember him from his recent small part in 'Thor', where he played young Thor. Very talented. Also, Evangeline Lilly is gorgeous in her supporting role.Now, who's responsible for the music? Danny Elfman of course, amongst other artists. Hip-hop is the main sound and it delivers the sport's atmosphere quite right. The scenes are mostly indoors and industrial but the exterior ones carry some really nice photography.I really enjoyed it. It was live, intense and sweet. It's worth the watch if you're an action/ sci-fi -or even sports- fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with my son and my wife. Let me start off by saying this is now one of my all time favorite films... Now let me explain.Have you ever watched a movie that had you thinking about it for weeks on end? A movie so powerful that you wish it was real? A movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you find your self yelling at the screen cheering on the main character? This movie does exactly that. Yes this movie may stem from the same old motif that most films are using nowadays, but personally I don't care! The bottom line with this film is that it was nothing like those other films in which the "motif" is based...The common motif is guy is a a** hole, guy meets someone who turns his life around and it takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and then guy gets a heart and in the end they win... With this movie it is so much more... First off they don't win the match in the end like most of these flicks but they win something much greater... Respect! Yes there is the Emotional roller-coaster most movies of this type have but that is to be expected...The combination of good acting, special effects, and a brilliant story line also set this film apart and put it in its own league! I can honestly say I have not seen a movie this good since Fraility... (yes i like Fraility) I would recommend this film to everyone and I hope to see it win an award at the Oscars...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've got kids in tween, teen bracket then really this is great viewing. The more films I review the more I try to avoid films that are just noise, that take the money and run, or just don't deliver - and we all see a bunch of those.Real Steel just doesn't hit and run - it's got heart, and it's a fun watch. The idea of fighting robots is well-developed and the CGI is flawless - simply the best effects of its kind, and it's currently one of the twelve films nominated for an Oscar for special effects with good reason - the robots really look and feel as real as its possible to imagine. But more than that the human story is good enough to make this work. Sure, it's a little clichéd and schmaltzy, but, and it's a big but, Dakota Goyo, who plays Max - the boy who finds his father and a robot, is a legitimate star - and one this reviewer believes will make it huge as he keeps going forward. His emotional range is exceptional, and he clearly upstages Hugh Jackman in several scenes.This is Rocky for robots, it is thrilling, and though there is a strong element of violence running through this, honestly GI Joe was worse and more gratuitous.Above all it's a blue collar film - it's about having fun at the movies and the sequel is sure to be a hit too. I was surprised at how much I simply wanted to cheer along while watching this - it's a knockout!</fullReview>

The sparring robot even with simple and rugged design, makes you fond of him. Really amazing. A movie that actually shows almost all human feelings despite being robots. Love, adrenaline, and steel. Excellent. The interpretation of Jackman doing selfless parent is formed and then as his love for his son and all that that entails, or to fight for is awesome. actually, I was thrilled with this movie. to see family and especially with children</fullReview>

I blame this on the screen play. at times you feel the "eargh! ewe!" cheesy moments from the dialogue, and Disney like moments.all in all, the action scenes are cool, it still maintains that block buster feel, but at the expense of LOADS of product placement and advertising (seriously, it's too much that it's annoying) but it's still a good watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of Real Steel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies about ring fighters have always been popular ? just remember titles of multi Oscar winning movies like Rocky, the Wrestler, the Fighter, Million Dollar Baby etc. Shawn Levy, director probably best known for Night at the Museum, also decided to make one, this time about...robots. Yup, in close future (2020) robot boxing is a new incredibly fascinating hype. Our protagonist Charlie Kenton (played by Hugh Jackman, known from movies like...oh come on, everyone knows Jackman from somewhere, whether it is X-men or Australia) is a boxer forced to retire because of growing popularity of roboboboxing. Charlie could not keep away from boxing, so he joined new wave, though, he is experiencing not the best stage of his life: sleeping in his truck together with old pieces of junk he uses for various meaningless fights, falling into debts and, what is worst, losing robots in battles. At this stage, out of the blue, Charlie's abandoned son comes into his life, surprising Charlie himself. Of course, raffish ex-boxer is far from being a good father, but this is where father and son relationship begins to emerge, and they emerge by doing the same robo-boxing together. Hugh Jackman is one of the most popular guys in modern Hollywood, men think he is cool thanks to roles like Wolverine and Van Helsing, women love his charisma and appearance. What is best, he fits in this hot-headed, careless, but deep down inside kind hearted guy's role perfectly. Seems like he was born to do roles like Charlie Kenton. However, Jackman is not the only guy who shines in Real Steel. Dakota Goyo, playing Charlie's son Max, gives really impressive show, being only 12 years old, he outperforms most of the actors two or three times older and more experienced than him. Chemistry between Goyo and Jackman works here well; their problematical father and son relationship looks believable and true. This kid might have hell of a career if he continues working on his talent and skills. Also, Evangelina Lilly finally escaped from mysterious lost island and joined the crew. Though, she had not much space in the plot to expose herself, there were a few scenes to show her potential; she was a nice touch to this movie overall. Probably the most important stuff to mention in a robot movie is special effects and visuals. Real Steel shines here too, robot animations have never looked so realistic; add huge variety of totally different robot designs, most of the time reflecting their master's personality, and you'll get really great looking portion of action. Camera work is also worth applauds, beautiful landscapes combined with superb lighting makes Real Steel true eye candy. Sound of the movies is pretty rarely discussed as a separate part, but Reel Steel's sound work deserves a paragraph. Fight sounds do not not leave you any chance to doubt that this is how bashing other robot's head sounds like. Soundtrack, a powerful combination of hip hop/rap music (songs by Eminem, Timbaland and other famous names) and rock (Foo Fighters, Tom Morello) can easily make you blood boil on every fight you see on the screen.It might sound almost idyllic so far, but not everything is so perfect. The weakest point of Real Steel is its plot; it can be predicted from very first 15 minutes, as soon as you understand what this movie is all about. Careless father's and son's reconnection theme has been touched numerous times before, fighting and climbing to the top is also not a new thing, too. Struggle between human's mind and artificial intellect is one of the most unique aspects, but I, Robot did it almost a decade ago. So, Real Steel is basically a mix of stories seen or heard before, dressed in new clothes, damn attractive clothes well put together. Real Steel is far more than just a mix of Rocky and Transformers; it is very atmospheric boys action movie, which surely leaves you entertained for whole 130 minutes and it passes like half an hour. It probably will not get an Academy Award or make a change in film history, but it surely is one of best movies this fall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real heart, real characters, real emotion. Oh, and robot fights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steel". The title itself calls to mind loud, frenetic, bot-on-bot battles the likes of Michael Bay's "Transformers". Promotional material and trailers featuring quick cuts, bad ass one liners and humanoid machines beating the nuts out of each other only heightened that expectation for a souless, action heavy, gear grinding testosterone charged movie.Surprisingly, Real Steel has real heart. It is less like Transformers and more like Rocky or Karate Kid. Simply put, it is an emotional tale about a down and out loser reconnecting with his estranged son over their passion for "robot boxing". You see, in the future, "Bot bouts" have replaced traditional fighting sports like boxing as a way to up the excitement factor. Robots can, after all, take a bigger pounding, and dish out more damage than any human can. Sadly for poor ex-boxer Charlie Kenton that means he's out of the job. Without a purpose He desperately tries to get into the Robot fights circles to relive his glory days but his bot is trashed, leaving him in debt and with shattered dreams. Charlie's stubborn dedication to a lost cause is broken when he is given custody of a son name Max whom he never knew he fathered. Things go from bad to worse but through a stroke of luck, Max discovers an old training Robot in a junk yard. Christening the robot "Atom" Max convinces his dad to retry for the robot fights.This is where the movie throws its first surprise left hook: the robot fights are only secondary to the human story. The terrific chemistry of the cast, especially between Charlie (Hugh Jackman) and his son Max (Dakota Goyo), is full of old school charm. Jackman's Charlie is superbly developed; he starts off as a self centered and stubborn man who learns responsibility, patience and the value of family. In a way, he represents the common workaholic who aims too high and has lost sight of the little joys in life. Newcomer Dakota Goyo plays Max as the perfect foil to Charlie's thick headed immaturity; an endearing kid, full of spunk and energy which rubs off on his dad and gives him a new purpose to keep fighting for. They are a lovable pair, slowly opening up to one another.But fear not fanboys, it is not all drama. There are the promised robot fights. And when they come, they come like glorious uppercut in slow motion. Shawn Levy's directing style is clear and even, yet energetic with none of the whiplash cuts and shaky cam; a welcome surprise seeing as how this is Levy's first time directing a sci/fi movie. Perhaps the most astounding aspect of the film is its special effects. The robots are a combination of computer generated images (CGI) and physical animatronics which give them a heightened sense of realism in both their look and the way they move. Furthermore, the fights were overseen by former boxing hall-of-famer "Sugar Ray" Leonard.Real Steel is the tried and true underdog story set against a science fiction backdrop. Sure, it might seem unoriginal, but the writers weave in some clever themes to set it apart. Under the mechanical mayhem lies a clever jab at the commercialization of modern sports. How the big money holders will constantly try to squash "the little guy" from reaching their dreams. It also advocates the old saying about how it is not the destination that matters but the journey. And lastly, it advocates a pro-family theme about how good old fashioned joy of sports bring people together.This is a true family movie for everyone. Accompanied by Danny Elfman's rousing soundtrack, the atmosphere is so contagious, you just cannot help but cheer our lovable protagonists on. Action is exciting and the fights are intense with the outcome never clear. For fans of Japanese anime, Real Steel incorporates some familiar stereotypes such as the immature adult/mature kid pairing and the designs of some of the robots. Plus, the whole gimmick of shouting out attacks for the robot to perform will remind any kid of something like Pokemon. Yes it is slightly unreal, it is wish fulfillment at its very best. What child would not want his very own fighting robot? Like its protagonists' and their robot "Atom", Real Steel is "the little guy" when stacked against the year's big hitters like Transformers 3, Harry Potter 8 and Pirates of the Caribbean 4. It only has a fraction of their budget and no franchise power to flaunt. Yet Real Steel comes through with incredible action sequences that are only secondary to what matters most: characters who are easy to relate to, a heartfelt emotional narrative and compelling themes.</fullReview>

Then again, Hugh Jackman hardly ever puts a foot wrong in terms of movie selections. Here, Jackman is at his best in this father-son drama disguised in a robotic "Rocky" boxing plot line. It is a movie that is filled with clichés and more clichés. If you seen Rocky and numerous underdog boxing movies, Red Steel is exactly that. Saying true and simple and with an extreme focus on the father-son relationship, Real Steel is ultimately touching, moving, teary and fun to watch. It is one of those movies that lifts you, inspire you despite its obvious flaws. On an end note ? "let's keep this as a secret"? Neo rates it 8/10.- www.thehkneo.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watch the two of the TRANSFORMERS trilogy and barely revels in the first installment, so much so that I am no fan of robots righting, that's the reason I strongly doubted whether this mini-version of would be my cup of taste, I hadn't been motivated after seeing its theatrical trailer either. Who knows when fate (disguised as the timetable of the Paradise Cinema here) decided I have to watch it, I just go with it! How does my zero-expectation journey turn out? It is definitely not a spin-off of Michael Bay's idiotic metal collisions, REAL STEEL has provided its audience some bona fide fun and a roller- coaster emotional voyage. Literally the film centers on the recuperation of the long--distant father-son relationship, the re-ignition of a former boxer's combative zeal for life, sounds corny? yes! But the maneuver is smart (a premature cute young boy versus his robustly rookie father, which the conflicts and warmth within are always gratifyingly welcome among family audiences). I feel much solace that the robot gambit did not steer the film to an A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE mode of humanizing the steel machine as director Shawn Levy (whose previous work includes DATE NIGHT 2010 and NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM 1&amp;2) is neither Spielberg nor Kubrick, the sole exception is the scene before the final battle, when Robot Atom is looking at the mirror inside the waiting room, as if Atom has the edification of transforming into a real flesh, which is the most heartrending moment for me and it hits my soft spot.The CGI robots' verisimilitude is astonishingly precise to detail, which is absolutely adrenaline- driven but at the same time doesn't hurt the plot too much. A great revelation here is the birth of another teen-star, Dakota Goyo, who is unequivocally stealing everyone else's glamor and delivers his debut unbelievably compelling in a major Hollywood film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a harmless, easy-going picture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shawn Levy has made a name for himself as a director who likes to converge upon and exploit the family-friendly cinema market for everything it is worth. His recent outings include the two successful 'Night at the Museum' films and the Steve Carrell driven 'Date Night,' and with his latest effort 'Real Steel' he carries on this trend of bringing a large-scale, blockbusting picture to the big-screen that appeals to both children and parents alike. As expected with a film involving fighting robotic androids, it's an over-the-top, CGI-laden action-fest that never attempts to be anything else which somewhat works in its clichéd favour.It's the year 2020 and human boxing no longer exists due to human beings insatiable taste for increasingly violent blood sports reaching new, unbridled heights. When society wouldn't sanction anything more violent and deadly, the World Robot Boxing league was created to satisfy man's urge for destruction. Here huge, metallic robots battle each other in front of hundreds and thousands of spectators to determine which man, woman or child has created the ultimate, well, killing machine. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former pro-Boxer and full-time loser, his arrogance and stubbornness is a constant contributing factor towards his failure in life to provide for himself and his friend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly). But when his ex-girlfriend dies and he is left with custody of his eleven year old son Max (Dakota Goyo), he must not only juggle his job as a poor man's robotic boxing coach, but also a young, animated child who understands that the man before him is only his father by blood and nothing more.Cheesy dialogue, energetic action sequences and exaggerated emotions prosper in 'Real Steel,' because Shawn Levy has decided that this film does not need to be taken seriously by any members of the paying audience watching in a nearby theatre or home cinema. Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo play overstated characters whose emotions are literal thrown at the viewer. When they're feeling a bout of sadness, arms flail, voices rise and tears flow. In no way do the characters react to the subtle nuances that govern everyday life, but instead, they perform to an overstated level, because everything in this film is placed into entertainment overdrive. The robots are huge, meandering objects of destruction, and the underground arenas are stereotypically on the 'bad part of town' (except for a Zoo, of all places). While the script perfectly encapsulates the desperate, stereotypical situation this father-son duo find themselves in both financially and emotionally, as their relationship slowly develops throughout the course of the film. Essentially all three elements combine in their own tawdry way to create something which can easily be described as; harmless, brainless fun.This film is a case of; if you drop your cinematic guard and allow yourself to be sucker punched, you'll probably come away happy. If an audience member goes into 'Real Steel' with high expectations, he or she should come away feeling mildly disappointed, however if the audience member in question goes into the theatre with low expectations, there is no doubt that they would come away feeling somewhat satisfied. This doesn't necessarily mean that every scene contains engaging entertainment, but the majority do, including the final act, in which even the terribly tacky product-placement can't ruin a predictable, yet enjoyable conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love boxing movies. Especially when they are good. So I had to see this one in the cinema. The film is about a man, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) who is in this robot fighting. He is not good at it. He gets a eleven years old son suddenly, because the kid's mother had died. So Charlie is not eager to be with his son, but the brother in law of his ex-girlfriend who died gives him money to baby-sit this boy for only a few weeks. Charlie can use this money.Great story, so far. The big problem I have with many movies in which children play, is that these children cannot act. Let me set an example: Edward Furlong in T2, good actor. Austin O'Brien bad actor. MacCauley Culkin, good actor. Jake Lloyd bad actor. So I thought, Oh no, this kid, Dakota Goyo, what's he going to do? And he really amazed me. This kid really can act. Nice done, nice acting in every way. It was a surprise.The computer generated robots were awesome. Hugh Jackman was, like in all of his movies, great. The robot boxes in the shadow of Jackman. Everyone looks at the robot, how fast the robot was and so on. But give Jackman some credits too! It was him who was the fast one.The story, and even the script was very predictable. The end of the last boxing game was like the end of Rocky Balboa. So it wasn't that original. But even that did not matter. The movie was great. Great action, it was fun, emotional. It was like a Disney movie, but then without Disney.</fullReview>

His acting was a bit over the top at some points and he looked like what Hitler wanted every human to look like, but overall he was enjoyable. Jackman is very good in this and Evangeline Lilly is excellent. There was nothing to complain about with writing and the setting is a nice add-on to the film as well. Those parts of the film are good but of course, with a film about fighting robots, there will be a couple problems. There were a couple of scenes that were over the top, the whole premise of the film is stupid and it ran on a bit too long, and it had a couple of problems but it kept me awake. 5 or 6 out of 10 would be fair, but I'm gonna give it a 7 because of how good the CGI was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have a great many boxing movies done over the years: Rocky, my personal all-time favorite sports movie, Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter, just to name a few. All of these movies were guided by well written characters and strong story lines. In Real Steel the special effects are abundant; however, the wonderfully developed characters and the storyline are what make the film more than just Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots.Director Shawn Levy has put together a quality resume of family films, including Cheaper by the Dozen starring Steve Martin and both of the Ben Stiller Night at the Museum films. In each of these films, the central character is the father; in Levy's Real Steel, things are no different. In the film, Hugh Jackman plays former professional boxer turned "trainer", Charlie Kenton. Jackman's portrayal of the "unlucky" Charlie feels real; he's an everyday man, who's made mistakes in his life and learns from them. Having starred in three X-Men movies and a solo film as the now iconic Wolverine, Jackman's good looks and action hero status have been front and center. However, it should be noted that Jackman is also a very talented actor. Dakota Goyo, who plays Charlie's estranged son Max, gives a very fine performance of his own. Max's stubbornness and determination, both traits inherited from Charlie, help in bringing the two together for a common goal. Evangeline Lilly, best known as Kate from the TV show Lost, plays gym owner Bailey. Although given a back story and history with Charlie, the character as a whole is underutilized. The interactions between Jackman and Goyo are at times funny, serious, and engaging, which make for great father and son cinema.Having seen the film in IMAX, the movie was visually impressive. The action sequences stood out prominently on screen and during the boxing sequences, each landed punch was enhanced by the powerful theater surround sound. The robots in the film are "pretty cool", as my son put it a number of times. They are intimidating by their massive size, but incredible to watch in action. If technology ever advanced to the point that something like the WRB (World Robot Boxing) organization existed, society today would not be able to contain their excitement. Real Steel borrows quite a bit from Rocky; however it does so in a fashion that doesn't leave you feeling cheated or unsatisfied. Make no mistake, Real Steel stands on its own as a very enjoyable film. I anticipate we'll be seeing more of Atom and the WRB in the future?.whether on screen or in real life.Grade: B+ visit our site at www.twodudereview.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is the Real Deal for the whole family.I first taught it won't make it. A prejudice of mine. I was wrong. It is a well-balanced story between Drama (father son relation) and Action (robot fights). The fine thing about it, it is even suitable for the whole family as the violence only happens between machines.Sometimes the drama passages get a little bit too long for a true action fan, but it pays out. Thank god it is not something like Transformers, which is a full crap that belongs in the dump bucket.On the other side it doesn't bring up something really new. Each idea already was seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie. Those robot fights are stellar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've still got two months in the year left, but I'm about ready to crown Real Steel as the most fun I've had with any 2011 movie.The year is 2020. The world has outgrown traditional human boxing, and has moved on to fights between robots controlled by their human owners. Former boxing pro, Charlie (Played by Hugh Jackman), has suffered a string of losses and broken bots. He gets a wake up call when he meets his son, Max, whom he hasn't seen since he was born. Hoping to make a change in the robot arenas, Max finds a robot named ATOM, a robot "designed to take a lot of punches, but never dish out any real punishment". But Charlie begins training ATOM, and the bot becomes a rising name in true underdog fashion, helping Charlie to fix up his life, and even learn to be a better person.Real Steel works best as a warm homage to the underdog films of the '70s and '80's, specifically Rocky. Once you get past the silly premise, what follows is an unexpected triumph for Shawn Levy. Finally, he makes a movie driven more by genuine heart and honest characterization rather than the barrage of fast paced slapstick humor and eccentricity that plagued Cheaper by the Dozen and the Pink Panther remakes.Some may argue that the screenplay has faults. At just about every turn, you can pretty much predict what will happen next. But you know what? Predictability has only been a problem for me if the story isn't any good. There's times where the movie gets obnoxious, and when it seems to slow down, but those are my only major gripes about the film. Yes, there's schmaltz, but Real Steel does schmaltz right. It's also a long movie, but I was so into it that it just flew right by......part of that may be due to the robot fights, which I can only describe with two words: FREAKING AWESOME! They're slickly edited, incredibly exciting, and the visuals and sound design are rendered and mixed with surprising finesse. They collectively form more fun than I've had with any of this year's summer blockbusters I've seen combined. Finally, I'll close off by commending composer Danny Elfman. With any luck and any justice in the world, he'll be on his way to the Oscars with a nomination for Best Original Score.I give Real Steel *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, but fun to watch feel-good movie that upholds family values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a dilemma.On one hand, "Real Steel" is a predictable, derivative, somewhat cheesy movie with average acting, screenplay, and directing. Moreover, the movie almost constantly bombards its unsuspecting viewers with the widest variety of an obtrusive product placement, from HP computers to Cadillac cars, from Dr. Pepper sodas to ESPN channel. Because of that, "Real Steel" has even managed to earn a rarely awarded negative distinction from Netflix ? "red flag" for consumerism.On the other hand, despite the futuristic entourage and the sci-fi elements, the movie is about normal people and their normal relationships. Nowadays, most of the filmmakers for some reason prefer to focus on anything but normal, preferably on something dark, twisted, sinister, or quirky, or something unbelievably silly and shallow, something that most of the people would never experience in their lives. The movie makers all over the world happily explore the intricate and charming relationships between drug dealers and drug addicts, prostitutes and criminals of all kinds, and prisoners of all sorts. They cheerfully portray mysterious sadistic serial killers and dangerous insane maniacs.For movies with big budgets, they ecstatically create whole universes where poor humanity miserably suffers under the tyranny of all kinds of powerful and scary supernatural beings: mighty mutants and alien monsters, aristocratic bloodthirsty vampires and beast-like wild werewolves, wizards, witches, living corpses, and mysterious ghosts of all kinds. For movies with a smaller budget, anything goes, as long as it is strange or out of the ordinary: from freaks and weirdos, to unstable neurotics, to special agents and shady gangsters, to eccentric millionaires and crazy scientists. That is why it is so rare and refreshing to go to a theatre and see a movie where the characters act as normal people under normal circumstances of life. It is so rare and refreshing to see a movie about regular folks rebuilding father-son relationship, regaining personal integrity, taking responsibility, overcoming cowardice and greed, making tough choices, being faithful no matter what. It is so rare and refreshing to find a feel-good, inspiring movie that upholds simple and basic values that lie in the foundation of healthy and strong families all over the world.If you throw the outstanding visual effects and the exciting robot fights into the mix, it becomes even easier to explain why, with all its flaws, "Real Steel" is still a good movie to watch.Again, here is the dilemma, men.Is "Real Steel" just a convenient escape from your demanding or boring life into the adrenalin-filled colorful fantasy world of the robot fights? It can offer you that, no problem... It can offer so much more though, if you are ready to accept it.Are you ready to confront your demons and ask yourself tough questions, that same tough questions the main character asks himself in the movie: Am I a good husband? Am I a good father? Am I taking a responsibility for my life choices and for my family? Do I act as I value my "big boy" toys and my convenient habits more than the well-being of my loved ones?"Real Steel" offers you a real deal, but it is up to you whether to accept the offer.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

It's too bad that the editors at IMDb can't take a lesson from this economical script writer and realize that the best narrative is short and pregnant, not necessarily "10 sentences" long.This is what I go to the movie theater for instead of downloading or buying a DVD TO WATCH AT HOME.It's a winner.

		<fullReview>Okay, I actually laughed at the trailer and thought..."Really, Hugh??" And then read he made this for his son and that at least made sense. I was going to wait for the DVD, but got the chance to see a free screening tonight, so I thought "Why not..." I should say off the bat, this film is much more engaging than I originally expected. It IS predictable in every way, however, it is (actually!) an enjoyable film. I think that Dakota Goyo (Hugh's son in the movie) was excellent. He truly stood out. Hugh, of course, was charismatic as a deadbeat dad, and former (pre robot boxing) boxer, that had a title shot but never made it. The visual effects were excellent, as expected. The sound effects were amazing (at least in the theater I saw it in) and added to the Robot fight sequences (especially) and the overall film. This is a great family movie, and a surprisingly engaging film, even though it is predictable. It has fun characters, cool robot fights, and the classic story of the underdog rising to the top. If you have kids it is a family friendly film, that everyone (like adults!) can enjoy. If not, its basically Rocky but with Robots and a big budget, so if you want to re-watch something you have seen before but with a big budget robot twist...this is for you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an old Black and White movie entitled 'The Harder They Fall' staring Humphrey Bogart, he suggested the United States should do away with the brutal sport of Boxing. In this updated story written by Dan Gilroy and ably directed by Shawn Levy, the suggestion has taken hold. The year is set around 2027 and boxing between humans has been replaced by gigantic Robots and spun into a metallic yarn called " Real Steel. " The movie centers around a former boxer, turned fight promoter and near-do-well called Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) who discovers he has a growing list of failures and a loving son called Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo). The boy finds a discarded and very primitive Fighter Robot called Atom, who has an ability to mimic human actions. During their growing companionship, Max discovers he needs the help of his reluctant father, who finally agrees to help train Atom and school him to challenge monster robots much larger than himself. Along the way, both father and son learn from each other and their Robot that in order to achieve success, one must never give up. The movie is filled with much robotic excitement, electronic drama and human pathos. One cannot but suggest that the film, the actors and it's never say die attitude has indeed earned a place in the annals of the Classics. Excellent offering. ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>¨I wanted you to fight for me.¨ Real Steel is a fantastic and fun film that is so much more than simply a robot boxing movie. I have to admit that when I first saw the trailer I thought this was going to be another Transformer like fiasco, but I was pleasantly surprised with how well the movie was presented. The robots were simply secondary characters and the true heart of the film relied on the human characters and their relationship. It mixes sci-fi with the classic David against Goliath underdog story and some heartfelt drama focusing on the relationship between a father and his son. The special effects and the boxing robot scenes are great, but I am so glad that wasn't the actual focus of the film; there was so much more to it. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and he really delivers a lot of heart in his performance, but the actual star in this film is the young Dakota Goyo who really shines in each scene he's in; he has so much charisma on screen; I am sure he has a great future ahead of him. The relationship between his character and his father (Hugh Jackman) is the true focus of the film and what made Real Steel stand out above the rest of the summer blockbusters. Shawn Levy (Date Night and Night at the Museum) directed this film which is loosely based on the short story ¨Steel, ¨ and the screenplay was adapted by John Gatins. I found some parts of the screenplay similar to the original Rocky movie, so in a way Real Steel could be called the futuristic remake of Rocky.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) used to be a professional boxer before the sport was banned and displaced by robot boxing. He was an average boxer who could take a lot of hits, and stood his own against the then champion of the world. Now he barely survives as a boxing promoter, taking his robot across the state to small rodeos and promoting small fights. He is not very good at winning and owes a lot of people a lot of money. He lives with his former coach's daughter, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) who also loves boxing and works as sort of the robot engineer as she tries to fix the different parts and pieces of the damaged robots Charlie brings back. She admires Charlie, but also knows that his life is leading nowhere. Charlie's life changes when he spends a summer with his eleven year old son, Max (Dakota Goyo), whom he had never met before. Max's mother passes away so legally Charlie is in charge, but the boy's aunt Debra (Hope Davis) wants to take full custody of the kid along with her wealthy husband Marvin (James Rebhorn). Charlie sees the opportunity of making some money off his son and offers to give them full custody of the kid as long as they pay him 100,000 dollars. Marvin makes a deal with him as long as he keeps Max during the summer while he travels with his wife to Europe. Max and Charlie don't get a long at first, but their passion for robot boxing brings them closer together. Charlie can find a chance at redemption when Max finds an old and abandoned robot named Atom which was used for training, but with some few adjustments they might have found a winner.Real Steel was probably one of the most fun films I've seen this year. Yes, it has some flaws, it's not perfect, but it was really entertaining. The film has some corny dialogue, it can be predictable, but it is a winner thanks to the great cast. I'm also a sucker for underdog stories and this is probably one of the best sport movies I've seen this year. It has its emotional moments and I really loved the performances from Jackman and Goyo. The kid is just fantastic on screen and his charisma is unbelievable. You can't help but route for this kid. I also enjoyed Evangeline Lilly being the Lost fan that I am and it was great to see her in a decent role. The scene where she talks to Max about how Charlie used to be a great boxer was great; you can tell how much her character cared for Charlie by the way her eyes light up when she talked about it. I wish she would accept more roles in the future; I loved seeing her on screen. The robot boxing scenes were also great; I can remember two or three fights that were absolutely engaging, and the final fight is just a great homage to the original Rocky movie. Real Steel is real fun and real entertainment. I absolutely recommend this film and it will surely be among my favorite films of 2011.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning!!! If you're expecting Hugh Jackman to play a rough and somewhat edgy character in this movie, similar to his Wolverine character in the recent X-Men movies, this movie is not for you.In this movie, Hugh Jackman is Charlie Kenton, who is a retired fighter that now fights robot fighters and is also a "bad bet," as stated in a scene in the movie. Rather than explain the plot and the dynamics of this movie, I would rather focus on the facts that I feel make this movie worth going to see.Yes, the movie is predictable. Let's be honest, a lot of movies today are but that being said it is a "feel good" movie and it did follow a common evolution that we have seen in many other good movies. Where I feel that Real Steel differed is that it was a fresh take on a very common storyline that did add a new twist of action and entertainment. I found the movie very positive and enjoyable and was actually disappointed that I wasn't able to share the initial viewing with my two son's, who I believe would have enjoyed the movie also.I would recommend this movie as an excellent family movie that is well worth the new movie ticker price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We were fortunate to see an early premiere. I'm the Merchant Ivory, art house, history buff in the house and I want a good script and actors who know what to do with one when they get it. My son is the "long week at work Adventure and comedy don't make me think" aficionado, and my grandson is fine as long as it is loud, has crashes and someone speaks in Japanese. We ALL loved Real Steel. Look for your cynical film buff button and press "OFF!". Gather up everyone in the house whatever their age or gender and cart them all to the theater. Real Steel is your family feel good about being together, movie of the year. Hugh Jackman gets to act up a storm in a movie that for once he doesn't have to haul up by its boot straps to make better just because he is in it. Shawn Levy has given him a vehicle he can ride all the way to the end showing what the actor you knew was there can do with a decent script and cast. Dakota Goyo is that young talent you keep hoping sticks around for the long haul who is now at the beginning of his career, and the supporting cast (special nod to Anthony Mackie) does what it is supposed to do: Provide the tension and get out of the way. Real Steel may not be a movie for the ages, but in an era of too much over the top noise, empty characters saddled with poor writing, worse acting, and explosions instead of emotions, it is definitely the one movie you want to see this year, the one you will want to add to video collection, and the one that will make you stop for a few pleasurable moments to remember when flicking through the channels in years to come.(slight spoiler sentence follows)The rogue learns to be a good guy. The dejected but sharp kid gets a dad. The right robot comes out on top and while all of that is happening, you get to cheer, punch the air, and whoop or well up tears in all the appropriate places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic sports drama, entertaining enough to watch in spite of its obvious storyline.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a handful of Rocky, mix well with The Iron Giant, then add a sprinkling of Over The Top. Garnish with a generous helping of Short Circuit. What do you get? The answer can be found in Real Steel. The basic concept of the movie is intriguing enough. In the near future, boxing as we know it has been replaced with a new high tech sport known as robot boxing. The guiding principle of the game is that humans no longer need to get in the ring to beat the crap out of each other. Instead, the humans are in control of robots which attempt to pulverise their opponent for the entertainment of the baying crowds. Underground bouts take place all the time, but the top players get to pit their robots against the best in a big money league known as "Real Steel". Ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a down-on-his-luck robot boxing competitor stuck in a losing streak. His debts are spiralling out of control and his reputation is in tatters as he drifts from one disastrous underground contest to another. Charlie's problems go from bad to worse when he learns that his ex-girlfriend has recently died, meaning that he is the lawful custodian of an eleven year old son named Max (Dakota Goyo) that he has neglected since birth. Initially, Charlie wants nothing to do with the kid and the kid wants nothing to do with Charlie. Forced into each other's company, a bond gradually develops between the pair of them. Max begins to take a keen interest in the world of robot boxing while Charlie slowly grows a sense of fatherly responsibility. When Max accidentally discovers a wrecked robot in a scrapyard, he sets about restoring it and he and Charlie suddenly find themselves sharing a mutual goal in life. The revived robot ? known as Atom ? provides them with an upturn in fortunes, winning enough fights and admiration to get a shot at the Real Steel league? and eventually a bout against the greatest robot of them all, the invincible demolition machine Zeus.The movie sticks to standard conventions throughout. Anyone who has seen any David vs Goliath sports movie will be able to predict where this one is going from the very early stages. Nevertheless director Shawn Levy manages to inject the film with the same likability that he brought to Night At The Museum, embellishing the obvious storyline with warm heartedness, fast pacing and rather exciting fight sequences. A few factors hold the film back somewhat. Take the character of Max, for example? acted ably enough by Goyo, but scripted as such a cocky, arrogant brat that viewers might find a small part of them secretly desiring to see him eating humble pie. He's not a kid that an audience can easily root for. Then there's the rise of Atom from discarded junkyard wreck to title contender, all dealt with in far too cursory a manner which makes the second half of the film oddly uninvolving. Overall, though, Real Steel just about deserves a thumbs up. Its flaws are plain and clear for all to see, but the general handling is slick enough and the whole package sufficiently enjoyable to make it worth a look.</fullReview>

This could have easily become a leave-your-brain-at-home dud, but it's actually a warm-hearted Rocky-like tail, sprinkled with The Champ-elements.This has all the same ingredients as Transformers, but does everything better. The characters are understandable and likable, the humor is actually funny and the boy-robot relation is touching. Jackman and Lily have good chemistry and the special effects are well done.Not that there aren't flaws: the origin of Atom is not mentioned at all and the robot-fighting is off course against all laws of psychics.But after all is said and done, you watch the end credits feeling good and the tears shed at the end (everyone cries at the end, sigh) are tears of joy, not of pain or despair like after watching one of Bay's Transformers.I give it 7 outta 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REAL STEEL is a clever movie in that it takes a video game concept (though the idea is from a short story by Richard Matheson interpreted by Jeremy Leven, Dan Gilroy and written for the screen by John Gatins), keeps intact the video game lovers' approach to fantasy and action, and introduces some adult versions of acting out that make for a solid message.At first the movie seems trite - a grown man, ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman, buff, surly and in fine acting condition) buys and sells and enters robots who perform in a circus style boxing arena where years earlier real men boxed. We soon discover that this is future- set story where robot boxing is a popular sport and centered on a struggling promoter (Jackman) who thinks he's found a champion in a discarded robot. During his hopeful rise to the top, he also discovers he has an 11-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo), in the midst of a custody battle with Charlie's deceased wife's sister and husband (Hope Lange and James Rebhorn). Charlie, ever on the outlook to pay off his debts and find financing for buying new robots to train for boxing matches, makes a deal with the couple, and agrees to care for Max for a summer while the couple visit Europe. Max wants to know his father but on his terms. The two males are aided by the owner of Charlie's training gym - Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) - and it is her intervention that helps the two males join forces and become involved with a discarded robot, Atom, they make a champion by working together.The tenderness of the film takes a while to settle in, but in the end it is not easy to deny that the story of a reluctant father and a self sufficient son finding that arm platform of relationship, able to endure disappointments as well as triumphs. Jackman and Goyo are a terrific team and the other cast members, especially Lilly and Anthony Mackie, are solid. Shawn Levy's direction deserves credit for pulling the whole thing together. This is not just another silly CGI flick: there is a core a beauty to the film that makes it not only entertaining but heartwarming, too. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable yet entertaining, despite the family friendly push</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future, boxing involves bouts between two massive robots in an equally massive ring. Charlie (Hugh Jackman), a former human boxer himself, is having a bit of trouble with cash flow despite having no problem getting all of his robots destroyed in the ring. But his struggles continue out of the ring, where he is forced to take care of Max (Dakota Goyo), the son he never wanted. By chance, Max discovers a fully built robot, Atom, discarded in a junkyard. He retrieves it, and convinces Charlie to help train him to fight in the big leagues.What works for and against Real Steel is that there is not much else to the plot after this. Much like the recent travesty Warrior, the set-up and execution is in the synopsis. Knowing what we do about film history and genre tropes, I imagine you can figure out exactly what comes next piece by piece. And as much as I enjoyed watching the film, the predictability hangs over it like a plague. It really is Rocky with robots, and it makes very little attempt to try anything new. It finds a niche very early on, and just keeps hoping it will not break. So while everyone loves an underdog story, it may be a little hard to swallow the film doing everything we have seen way too many times before.What Real Steel does do differently, and what I enjoyed immensely, was how it connected and reimagined human boxing with robot boxing. The sweat and smell of the unsanctioned underground leagues, the spectacle of the pay per view spectacular in a live arena; it seemed silly watching the trailers and thinking of robots taking the place of humans in the ring. But it is so naturally executed here that you wonder why you doubted the film in the first place. Every precaution is taken to reinvent and enhance the sport, to the point where it makes a case for this idea being viable in the future. Much the same goes for the technology in the film, which seems like a natural progression to where we are heading in reality. For such a silly and ridiculous concept, it seems to have its finger on the pulse of a hotbed of real life ideas. Another great element to the film is the special effects that bring the robots to life. Using a nearly seamless mix of animatronics and CGI, we watch as these robots bridge the gap between fantasy and reality. They look, feel and act real, managing to beat the life out of one another in one scene, and then silently emote without the use of any real expressions. While an early scene involving a bull looks awful, every scene afterwards just looks better and better. I had a hard time distinguishing the puppets from the CGI, it is that well conveyed on- screen. And really, when was the last time a big budget film like this went with animatronics over full blown CGI? Thankfully, Jackman is also one of the best things about Real Steel. The trailers suggested he was playing the character very loose and over-the- top, but he is surprisingly rather reserved for the most part. He plays a washed up has-been very well, and manages to really make the audience feel for him ? even when he is being a reprehensible jerk. He brings the charisma and edge to the role that he has perfected as Wolverine, and helps rise above the material he is given. He is given a lot of silly stuff to do no doubt, but he smiles and glides through it with ease. As Max, Goyo brings gentleness and naivety to the role that really sells the idea of robots boxing. Seeing the wonder in his eyes is like watching our own wonder playing out on-screen. He is a more than capable child actor, and I look forward to seeing him light up screens in the future. Evangeline Lilly, as Charlie's love interest Bailey, is good in small doses, but is not afforded the time or development to really be anything other than a plot device. Anthony Mackie is great as the bookie Finn, and even if the role is completely one note and silly, Kevin Durand does pretty good as Charlie's nemesis Ricky.What I found really took away from the film, was the focus on the broken family unit between Charlie and Max. When they are apart and interacting with others or alongside Atom, the film works increasingly well. But when the family struggles start being the focal point of scenes, it just feels pushed and rushed, as if it was an afterthought to add a bit more drama to the film. Jackman does what he can to salvage these scenes, but they just became progressively more irritating and more predictable as the film goes on. I wanted to ignore them and enjoy watching the boxing robots, but even thinking back to these scenes now, they just seem overdone and out of place. Less would have been better, and perhaps would have assisted in a lot less of Danny Elfman's surprisingly atrocious and annoyingly upbeat score.I wanted to enjoy Real Steel a lot more than I actually did. Jackman is great, and the ideas at the core of the film about robot boxing and technology are more astounding than I would like to give the film credit for. But its inherent predictability, not to mention a forced family friendly redemptive storyline, drag the film into a mediocrity it does not deserve. This should have been a really fun movie about a ridiculous idea that turned out surprisingly well. Instead, it is a film that struggles between the idea of what it is and what it wants to be, and is never able to truly balance itself out.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Seel is Real Fun !! - a Good Watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree that the screenplay is quite corny &amp; clichéd, including themes of father-son bonding, champion-vs-underdog fight (the David-vs-goliath aspect), former-champion-now-trainer, etc.It's been long since I've seen a good boxing movie. And this one includes giant robots. And who wouldn't enjoy giant robots fighting each other. The boxing matches, with it great special effects and the acting by the side actors, were quite fun to watch. You would hang by your seat cheering 'Atom' till the end.It's not a great boxing movie, but an enjoyable &amp; entertaining decent attempt.Hugh Jackman gives a pretty descent performance, not Oscar worthy, but good.Shawn Levy might have given half a dozen average comedies earlier, but we might say he's improving. And Since the movie is produced by Spielberg himself, the movie couldn't have been a disaster.Definitely better if you watch it on big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well done movie, and worth the TWILIGHT ZONE fan's time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I'm one of the first people to watch classic TWILIGHT ZONE and the Real Steel episode and I'm a HUGE fan. Of course I was worried about Hollywood screwing it up, but the remake popped up out of nowhere. I hate average expectations for it, and were probably more interested then it than I was in the other Richard Mathenson storys canaballized by those bigwigs. Anyway, Sean Levy had done decent work in the past so the more I heard about Real Steel, the more anxious I became. Then I heard the music for Real Steel and it was an amazing piece of work that just made me all the more interested in how the movie was going to turn out.Oct 13, 2011, I headed up to my local cinema and took and nice comfy seat and prepared myself. What I got was a VERY well done movie that did RIP-OFF someone else's work, but did it with style and did it well. I mean, how bad would it be if they ripped it off and still made it suck? But this movie was very well done. The acting.....oh man...wonderful and absolutely brilliant acting by both the main characters of this movie. Jackman the new Kevin Costner and is the perfect choice for a role like this one and he delivers. The kid may have annoyed a great deal people but he pulls the role off without any hiccups and truly does a great job.I know many people love the original TWILIGHT ZONE so they will despise this movie for ripping it off and changing things (non-happy endings are a BIG no-no in Hollywood), but if you're really a fan of the original TWILIGHT ZONE story, you will probably be intrigued by this movie and I highly recommend that you take some time out to watch it and enjoy it instead of just being critical of it.A great movie, with great acting, amazing music, and great cinematography. Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional roller-coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a perfect blend of comedy, action and values. I was blown away by Dakota Goyo's performance and the chemistry he had with Hugh Jackman (and Atom). The plot keeps you excited about what happens next and there was a perfect balance of action and drama. The fight scenes were very realistic and we are dragged along together with Atom, Charlie &amp; Max throughout the emotional journey that they are undertaking. Hats off to the writers who created a main character (Charlie Kenton) who is an asshole but you cannot stop rooting for him. From the first minute of the film, you start to feel involve with him and this doesn't stop until the last minute. Overall, a very good film and I hope Hollywood won't spoil it by having a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a adult action movie it falls flat, too cheesy and sappy. As a family movie it works and young boys will love it. I say B</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I want you to fight for me. That's all I ever wanted." Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a former boxer who is now involved in the world of robot boxing. After making a bet that his robot can win a match at a rodeo he is once again in the hole to someone. When he is told that his ex has died and he is now in charge of his 11 year old son he finds a way to pay people back. When his son finds a old robot that he fixes up Charlie's outlook changes. This is a movie that is hard to review. On one hand (for me at least) it was pretty sappy and felt like a remake of "Rocky 4". On the other hand this is a great family movie that younger boys will love. The action was very good and the boxing was fun to watch. The dialog and story were pretty cheesy but in terms of a family movie they fit. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are looking for a manly boxing movie with lots of fighting and action then you may be disappointed. If you are looking for a family movie to watch with your son then this is what you want. Overall, a good movie for families. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel (2011) - Finally, A Robot Movie that Actually Makes Sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman stars an ex-boxer, now training robot wrestlers, searching for redemption with the help of his long-forgotten son, and a mechanical piece of robotics. So, this movie is basically about a bunch of mechanic robots fighting each other, controlled with a video game controller. The movie, "Rock-em, Sock-em Robots" (just kidding!), I meant "Real Steel" has a perfect premise to this movie and it delivers more entertainment, more perfection, and more better action than the mighty crap of "Transformers 3". Director Shawn Levy finally improves his career after directing hit comedies like "Cheaper by the Dozen", "The Pink Panther", and "Night at the Museum". He really made an interesting movie that makes sense to everyone, and it's something that everyone could relate to. All the action scenes in this movie worked perfectly, and the special effects are extremely groundbreaking. The music is super inspiring, and the cinematography is so totally super. Hugh Jackman delivers one of the best performances in his career, and he steals the show in every scene he is in. I also really liked Evangeline Lilly in this movie as Jackman's ex who still believes in him. Dakota Goyo makes a total breakthrough performance as Jackman's long-lost son who suddenly is inspired to join the ring with his father. But out of all that, this is a movie that contains a warm spot, a real heart to the story is added. That's the type of robot movie that is perfect to watch, rather than the unexplainable "Transformers 3". "Real Steel" has a perfect script, a brilliant cast, amazing visual effects, awesome fight scenes, and the heart of the story works perfectly, which proves that this movie is one of the better movies of the year. "Real Steel", in my review, "a heartwarming feature, with groundbreaking visuals".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable but Still Pretty Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood sports movie typically follows the triumph of an underdog against all odds. We have seen it in "Rocky," in "Mighty Ducks," in "Cool Runnings," even in "Ice Princess," and so on and so forth. As it was quite evident in its trailer, "Real Steel" will undoubtedly follow this same tried and true formula.Despite being very predictable, and yes, cheesy, "Real Steel" still succeeds to entertain the audience. I believe this is mainly because of the interesting premise of robot boxing replacing conventional boxing in the near future (this movie is set in 2020). The special effects of these robot boxing matches were very exciting and exhilarating. The action in the boxing ring still remains raw, palpable and realistic, even given its mechanical fighters. This is definitely NOT like the messy Transformers.A big factor is also the goodwill and charisma of lead actor Hugh Jackman in the two aspects of his character Charlie. He had earnest performance as the father trying to establish a relationship with an estranged son. He also had a very energetic performance as an ex-boxer now the controller of a Robot Boxer. He is very likable in both aspects, as well as with his chemistry with his co-stars, Dakota Goyo (who played his headstrong son Max) and very pretty Evangeline Lilly (who plays his girlfriend Bailey).Therefore despite already knowing how this film will end, even as early as the trailer several months ago, I would say that it will still be worth one's time to go and watch the awesome action sequences on the big screen. I think these adrenalized action scenes strike a good balance with the rather hokey yet unavoidable (given the father and son theme) melodramatic scenes. There is something for everyone here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is a film that is bit of a change of pace for director Shawn Levy, who is known for comedies like the Night at the Museum movies and Date Night. In Real Steel, he is directing a special effects action-drama with a really good story.Hugh Jackman stars as Charlie, a former professional boxer who now makes a living with fighting robots. Something I noticed here that I have in other Levy films is how the lead character has his life out of order or that something is missing. For Charlie, it is not having a way to make money in his career after his robot is destroyed at a carnival. After this, he finds out that he has to take care of his son temporarily after the mother dies. Now Charlie is stuck with a son he hardly knows, and has to take with him while he goes to his fights. After another robot of Charlie's is destroyed, his son Max find one that he wants, named Atom, who they take around the country to fight other robots.Jackman is great in the lead role and is great at showing anger, frustration, irritation, and be a likable guy. This performance is one of his best. I would say it's right up there with his performances in the X-Men movies, The Fountain, and Australia. Dakota Goyo plays Charlie's son Max. Goyo does a good job of showing that Max is a chip off the old block. Evangeline Lilly plays Bailey Tallet, who owns a gym that Charlie has lived and trained at since his childhood. She is a wonder as the one person who will always be behind Charlie on whatever he does. It was nice to see Anthony Mackie in another film as he plays a bookie and manager who puts fights together. Mackie does a good job, but shows that he has done better. It was also nice to see Kevin Durand in another film with Hugh Jackman as a mean Texan who Charlie owes money too.The special effects and sound effects are all well done, as that was the most important part of this film. Shawn Levy is no stranger to films that call for important visual effects and his crew does an amazing job, especially with all of the robot fights.The idea of a movie about fighting robots sounds crazy, but it works. While fighting robots is Levy's primary focus in Real Steel, that is not the only thing this film is about. It is also about a father spending time with his estranged son, making money, and a man who becomes a better man throughout the film. I respect Mr. Levy for showing that there is a story to be told here. Levy proves here how much he has grown as a filmmaker, and that he can do more than family comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel is the Real Deal!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare, when there is so much smashing of metal against metal, to actually find some humanity and a story to go along with it, and Real Steel does this to great effect.In the near future where humans no longer box against fellow humans, robots do the boxing for them. This leaves the human boxers as washed up robot trainers, like Hugh Jackman's Charlie Kenton. Down on his luck, forgotten his passion for the sport, and an absentee father, Jackman plays the role honest and true, making Charlie the kind of scumbag that doesn't deserve good luck. But when Charlie's ex-girlfriend dies and his son, Max, is thrust back into his life, Charlie's bad luck is turned around.The real charm of Real Steel is how Dakota Goyo's Max uncovers an old sparring bot named Atom in a junk heap. You believe that Dakota Goyo actually thinks that Atom has a soul. As Max fixes Atom and Charlie trains him, the two embark on a journey to the Championship Ring as father-and-son. This just highlights the true charm of director Shawn Levy's work. The story mixes these great human elements with fantastical action. There is genuine drama, drama in the strained relationship between Max and Charlie, drama in the ring as Atom fights, not because we believe that Atom is a magic autonomous being, but because Max does, and he is the one we root for.Real Steel's robots are brilliantly designed, with it unnoticeable when the filmmakers switch from the real, on-set animatronics, to the CG-robots. This coupled with the acting from all involved, from Hugh Jackman selling this sport with conviction and Dakota Goyo having that glint in his eye of Atom's magic, to the brilliant effects work, it suspends the viewer's disbelief and allows one to be wrapped up within these metal slug fests as if they were two humans duking it out in the ring.Ultimately, Real Steel is all about redemption. Charlie Kenton redeems his relationship with his son, his relationship with his oldest love, Bailey (played charmingly by Evangeline Lily), and he redeems himself, finding his passion for boxing once again. Call it hokey, sentimental hogwash, but this is the kind of story that makes me love movies. Time is taken to create emotional investment. The story starts slow, lays it pieces, rather than bombarding the viewer with action, and then when it reaches the action, we are invested. From the watered eyes to the shivers shooting down our spine, we care, because the story took time to develop itself before rushing a pay-off.Simply, Real Steel pulls no punches, leaves nothing in the ring, every blow lands and succeeds in making me feel like a 7-year-old kid again, when there still was wonder left in the world.I give Real Steel a perfect 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing the trailers months ago I wanted to see Real Steel so I was excited to finally see it. I suppose you could say I had solid expectations and Real Steel met every single one of them. The description for this film says "Rocky with Robots" and in many ways that is exactly what this is. It doesn't try to pretend to be anything else. There are dozens of hidden Easter eggs for geeks and fans alike making reference to wrestling entertainment, and the Rocky series...Apollo...Zeus...you can make the connection. But there is the futuristic sci-fi setting, the father and son reconnecting, and the brilliantly shot robots boxing! I mean most people should go into this expecting very very little...it plainly states that is is a film about robots boxing so anyone who complains about it should give their head a shake. The bonus thing about it is that it is about so much more than that. Its about a man's redemption, family, father and son, emotion and love. You'll even feel something for the completely silent and inanimate robot that they drag from the junkyard.You really can't get much more charisma on screen than Hugh Jackman. Its a bonus that he is actually a solid actor as well but he is just a lot of fun in this film and he has this rough around the edges quality that Jackman portrays perfectly. Young Dakota Goyo is fantastic and the smooth talking youngster who is forced to spend the summer with the Dad he doesn't know. Goyo has so much spirit and it shines through in his character. He easily holds his own opposite Jackman and carries the film very well. Evangeline Lilly is decent in her small role. I think she is literally there just as a romantic interest to Jackman and push along the back story of his character. She has very little to do with overall story and she could have done more with her character.The best thing I can say about director Shawn Levy is that he always, consistently tells a fun, simple, heart felt story and sometimes that is all that is needed to make a very entertaining movie. He's had a lot of experience in comedy but this film is not a comedy and its not even really an action movie. I suppose I would rate it as a family adventure but it kind of sits on its own. The world they live in is clearly the future but he doesn't spend a lot of time focusing on that world because this is about the characters. The world is there and you can spot some really significant and fun things in the background but this isn't about the time they live in. That part of it is just a fact. This is about redemption for a man, for a young boy, and even for a piece of junk robot that no one believes in except the little boy. This movie is just insanely fun and easy to watch and will have you off the couch cheering. 9/10</fullReview>

This movie succeeds because the two main actors overlay their emotions and personalities onto the main robot character Atom. You actually forget that it(he) is a machine.Dakoto Goyo already has an impressive amount of work under his belt for a 12 year old. He definitely has the potential to be a big star.It's like Rocky for robots.

		<shortDescription>Rocky meets Over-The-Top ... predictable ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember Sylvester Stallone arm-wrestling the stereotypical impossible-to-beat-big-guy for the love of his son, honor, some money and a truck in the flick Over-the-top?? And Sylvester again battling the world champ Apollo in a boxing bout in Rocky? Well, combine the two and you have the core plot of Real Steel.The Robot-boxing bouts are entertaining... only marred at times by the predictability of the outcome. The end of the movie doesn't seem to come as a 'plot with a difference' - not even a 'twist' really.The key characters fail to impress much. Hugh Jackman is not convincing as a has-been boxing star. His portrayal as a careless irresponsible father is not quite well etched as well. The much talked about child artist, Dakota Goyo, is actually good in certain sequences, though there are certain others where he seems to have overdone it. The sparingly few emotional moments of the film don't quite add up owing to the personalities of the lead characters that you would have come to understand until then.The story is tied very very weakly - the chinks in the plot are easy to find really. For instance, in one sequence shot in the night, Jackman's character leaves the kid at the edge of a ravine (right after saving him from that very steep drop), to dig out a 10-foot steel robot from the edge of the ravine and then drag it up the steep cliff,all by himself, into a trolley onto a highway, right in the morning, to a visibly not-at-all-bothered Jackman?? Really?All in all, Real Steel makes for one 'just-about-decent' popcorn entertainer on a day when you have nothing better to do.Unlikely to have a sequel.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Real Steel' is Hollywood's next attempt (after TRANSFORMORS) to outdo Japan in the live-action 3D animation combo robo-movie flick. It's impressive to see how (North) American cinema has come far in developing the animation. The work in this movie may not have reached the level of Bollywood as well but it's still very good and the best I've seen from the USA. The motion and details were a little limited, the greenscreen filter was dreadful and the colours and toning was too strong but the robos looked lively, what little their was of them. I only found the voice acting to be too loud and the humour was sometimes way overdone, which brings us to the writing. The script is just flat and full of clichés. The pacing is also inconsistent. At times its very slow and the characters' loudness really gets on your nerves but the latter portion is heavily rushed. Malik's music is quite poor and it only slows down the pace. The Hugh Jackman fellow is competent. I have always found him to be weak in comedy but here he manages to make the viewer laugh in a couple of sequences. Sadly, the female actress is wasted even though she dominates the screen with her few scenes. 'Real Steel' shows that Hollywood is improving in its animation department but unfortunately it fails in the entertainment department.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Real Steel because it was filmed here in Michigan and I wanted to see my Michigan extra peeps. When the film finally got to Detroit for this big fighting tournament, I didn't see any of them. Then I find out afterwards that since the incentives never came through, they cut their parts out. Did I think I wasted my time? Well, not really.Real Steel is about Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) owing people he can't pay who now wants to beat every inch of his life, and relies on big robots to fight tournaments for him. He keeps losing. However, a turn of events happen and his ex dies and leaves their son in his care. Well, actually her sister takes custody as Wolverine basically sells him. But then it turns into this father and son story where they work together to win these tournaments.... like what we've seen in the trailers.The problem with Real Steel is that it's very formulaic, by-the-numbers, like we've seen this in a hundred films before. It's a tried and true formula and it can be heart warming, but by the end of the film where characters are supposed to change, it just feels forced. The third act alone just feels forced and rushed, and the robots themselves which should feel like the forefront just seems to be shoved in the background for this father and son story. Maybe they were supposed to be shoved in the background, but I really wanted to explore the kid's robot, Atom, a little more but I never really got that. It never felt like a character to me.The kid (played by Dakota Goyo) steals the show. He is very good and well written. I might even go as far to say that the kid and the writer probably had fun with this character. I also enjoyed Evangeline Lilley's performance as Bailey Tallet. She delivered a strong performance and she was gorgeous to look at. Hugh Jackman (not his fault) just seemed too douchy in this movie. He's just a jerk to this kid and everyone around him throughout the whole movie that when it came time for his redemption, I just didn't buy it. There's also this forced emotion in the ending of the film, and me and my date both agreed it was pretty lame.Real Steel is just an average sci-fi movie that has an interesting concept that seems plausible but the execution of being a film just landed on the Okay Express. It's a shame none of my Michigan buddies made it in the film, but then again, maybe it was for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky with Robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember Rocky IV ? well just imagine if Rocky Balboa and Drago were replaced with by two 8 foot Robots . Then you have Real Steal and what a cracking kids film this turned out to be!It's the story of Max , an 11 year old boy who meets his stay away father , Charlie ( Hue Jackman) after his mother dies. Charlie is an ex boxer who makes his money with his fighting Bots. The trouble is , he is down on his luck , that is until he teams up with his son Max and a second generation robot called Adam.The best gauge of how good this film is is the reaction of my two boys and they absolutely loved this , and I'm not ashamed to say i really enjoyed it too.The special affects with the Robot's are fantastic and the fight scenes are second to none. The story is good with a little sub plot about a father who learns how to be dad and i totally recommend this film to adults and kids alike.My only criticism is that there are a couple of middling swear words in the film so to put the rating up to a 12 so it would appeal to the older kids but they are not to bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie that gets the audience involved in a positive way and leaving cheering is an excellent movie. It is like Rocky on adrenaline and with a whole lot better acting. Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly and Dakota Goyo all have great performances. Dakota who plays the son really makes the movie, but all the actors performances are great. The guy who thought it boring... well, you lack passion and your soul must be dead. Real Steel is the absolutely hands down best movie I have seen in a long time. You will cheer, cry, laugh and be thoroughly entertained. I had to sit and watched the credits at the end just to catch my breath. Great movie.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think Hugh Jackman...I think Wolverine, with adamantium claws ripping through stuff (and occasionally through the bad guys themselves!) and his hair literally wild and feral-looking. But this movie has given Jackman a whole new image...as the deadbeat dad and cocky ex-boxer who participates in gladiatorial robot fights for a living!I won't go too much into the nitty-gritty's of the plot...but all I'd like to say is that this movie is ultimately a story about the triumph of the average down-on-his-luck 'everyman' against overwhelming odds. It's a story we've seen done a million times...but never against so creative and pulse-ponding a backdrop!And while Hugh Jackman does a great job...the real star of the show is undoubtedly his character's son (played by Dakoto Goyo)...the kid comes off as annoying at first but he eventually grows on you!It may not be Oscar material, but this sure is one great movie, and at the end of the day, that's all that matters!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The word flook has suddenly developed a new meaning altogether for me when I accidentally bought tickets to this movie as no other show was available. Barely did I know that I would end up seeing a magnum opus, a perfect cross over movie transcending from modern day fiction to a timeless classic. There are very few movies made which can cater to the likes of each individual movie goer, but then there are the occasional ones like "real steel" that qualify for such prizes. Its a brilliant plot, yet not sketchy and achy as the transformers, not too much into the future to rattle your brains. Its a perfect blend of all sort of emotions while giving the cinema goer the daily dose of excitement. Good acting by the leads, Butler is very impressive, watch out for the kid.. Good narration, excellent script, effects are super and state of the art direction. Need I say moreIn a nut shell .. its a 9/10 !! Watch itI am taking away 1 as it isn't Ben-Hur!</fullReview>

In the end of the movie, the dad fought for his son and his girlfriend outside the area of fight was cry, it seems nothing but inside the lachrymal is a admirable that the girl feels. And his son was cry too.Beside that, we have to see the truth, Zues have been save by the bell, and it's the best thing i feel suck. Zues did not worth for that prize. Atom have done amazing things after 5 rounds. No one could see that at the begin of the fight. The first time i saw the file, i almost cry for Atom. i do not know how everyone feel................................................</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel - 4 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As soon as the first of many electrifying robot battles in "Real Steal" went underway, I found myself instinctively recalling old memories that I didn't know I still had. I remember how I used set aside furniture in the living room to create space for an arena. I would gather my toys in that arena, and our gang would have some fun. I thrashed them all around, pounded them against each other, and flung them against the ruthless ceiling. Things would be cooler if my stuff could do more than just withstand nonstop hammering, but it was a restriction that my imagination couldn't handle."Real Steel" is the giant robot action movie my inner child has been waiting for. It demonstrates deep affection for its robots by investing in aesthetic qualities that similar movies are indifferent to. Each machine is skillfully designed. All the robots enjoy such a specific shape, physique, color and theme that we can identify any of them upon sight. And because professional boxers were motion-captured to generate the mechanical fights we see on screen, the movements between these visually appealing robots are authentic and in harmony. Here is a good example of a special effects movie that doesn't depend on computers to do all the work.The world in "Real Steel" has reached a time where man is no longer permitted to box. The roars of the crowd appear to like the replacement of human fighters: huge, towering robots that are assembled to disassemble their challengers through brute force. Robot boxing has become so popular a sport that we see it being held in vacant alleys, dark warehouses, and luxurious stadiums. This is the kind of sport that I would prefer to watch from afar. You do not want to be in the front row, uninsured, when one of those massive robots gets tossed out of the ring.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/real-steel-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder how it got made and I am glad it did. Silliest of premises with a run-of-the-mill story filled with so many corny moments might actually make you think that it is one of those movies that are so bad they become good to watch. It is actually a well made movie that is good to watch.Set in the near future where it is a rage to see robots box with each other in a gladiatorial setup, Charlie (Jackman) is a small time traveling robot boxing participator who loses everything he has due to over-confidence and stupidity. When his estranged son was given to his custody after the mother dies and joins him in his exploits, they find a bond and a winning combination.Acting is as silly as its premise with Jackman confusing us for who is the robot and Evangeline Lily as his girlfriend who shows exactly the same 3 emotions as she does in the entire Lost series. Relief comes in the form of his son played by Dakota Goyo who is charming, passionate and innocent at the same time. The robots and their fights are choreographed excellently as they look natural (mechanical) instead of the CGI stuffed transformers. They even have a robot vs. bull fight which I guess was the best part of the movie.Rambo vs. Transformers vs. (any father son bonding movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be a guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rocky with robots would have been the pitch for this robot enthusiastic movie, and that is certainly what it is. The film is set in 2020 where boxing has been replaced with robots beating hell out of each which are controlled by humans. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie, who is a former boxer now attempting to find a way to making money in this new robotic sport. Unfortunately for Charlie though he is constantly failing in his goal and his robots are being smashed up by either other robots or rodeo bulls. His other trouble is his arrogance in that he keeps gambling his make believe money on fights he believes he will win but ends up losing, meaning he owes lots of people lots of money. After hearing the news of a former partner's death he learns that he has a son who he must now care for. A son that he instantly sells to a former relative for money towards his next robot, the only catch is he has to look after the boy for the summer as his new parents are off across the World. Charlie continues on with his life despite the interference of his new son, and once again continues to lose his robots, up until his son becomes his lucky charm and finds a robot buried in a scrap yard. This robot was generally used as a training machine but the now Father and Son team begin to train the robot and slowly begin to rise through the ranks to the major leagues of the robot boxing world.As you can tell this is definitely Rocky with robots. The underdog will rise through the ranks, he will get his title shot, he will be the people's champ, and he will connect a bond between other people in his life. This could simply be what Real Steel is and from watching the trailer alone it is showing us a generic story made completely original. This really put me off in the trailer and I was never fussed about watching it but to be honest I am so glad I did.This is definitely one of those films that will be many people's guilty pleasure. It is such fun to watch and really has an emotional core to it that I didn't expect it to have. Everyone loves watching robots beating hell out of each other but what is good about this is it stops that before it has the opportunity of becoming boring and propels us to the other story which is the building bond between Father and son. These are not the only two story threads however as there are others that connect Charlie with a love interest, former relatives, and former enemies without even mentioning their main nemesis in the robot boxing world. For a story that seemed so unoriginal in the trailer it really does have many story threads to keep you gripped. That certainly was a shock for the system.Hugh Jackman is known mainly for playing Wolverine but here he plays something completely different. Granted he won't win any major awards for this performance but at times I forgot who he was and believed he was Charlie. Other than a couple moments of over acting and a few cheesy lines, he pretty much nails this performance. Dakota Goyo is also a strong performer as his son Max, my only quibble about him being that he seems awfully knowledgeable and confident for an eleven year old kid. Everyone else in the film does the job they set out to do.The script is also surprisingly good. It does have many cheesy moments especially in the final act but the dialogue throughout is realistic and there is some obvious and subtle humour put in there. At times there are some great lines, delivered really well, that are so subtle you need to really listen to hear them, and they are great. The direction is also really good, especially the fight scenes which will have you on edge. The CGI for the robots also looks fantastic, and despite the fast cutting to avoid continuity, look very realistic for the world they are in. The robots also look like they are standing alongside humans and not actual effects.The film is definitely a pleasant surprise. It does have a few cheesy moments and the second act does have a slight lull but there is enough in there for everyone to enjoy. It is a film I have seen twice now and I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. This isn't just Rocky with robots, it certainly has something more.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop hating on the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize a lot of people had their minds made up about this movie before they probably even watched it. Problem with that is it colors your entire view of it. Sure there are parts that you could say come on. But what is see these days in people's reviews of movies is that they take themselves way to seriously about movies. What are movies there for? The answer is entertainment. So what if they boy's character doesn't fit your notion of what a child his age would act like. I for one never thought of him as spoiled. A spoiled brat would have jumped at the chance to return to his wealthy aunt. He dreaded it. So lets cut that out right now. I have to say this is one of the most recent movies that i flat out enjoyed. No reason to not watch it again. It made my life a little better and more entertained.For those of you that think it's too typical? Explain the ending. The typical is for the good guy to win and the enemy to lose. Moral victories are considered the win these days. People doesn't seem to want to accept 2nd place even if they did their best. This movie should remind you that if you put your heart into something you aren't always going to win, but you will come out of it for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was first trailered I panned is as being another attempt at taking yet another childhood memory and trying to slap a movie around it to cash in. I couldn't have been more mistaken.Real Steel takes all the finer points of the Rocky films, twists them around a little bit, and adds the new concept of a somewhat futuristic robot boxing league without disintegrating into some cheeky MMA movie with Transformers. The story progresses with a "coulda been a contender" prizefighter, Charlie, who had all the heart of a champion but just not enough at the end getting a second chance when he has to check his priorities and his pride when faced with the realities of the life he's chosen and the son he ran away from, Sam. Granted, parts of the story are quite cliché, but it keeps things moving quickly enough so that it doesn't suffer from it.The viewer has to make a few assumptions at the beginning of the film and take into consideration that 8-9 years into the future is more than enough to bring about some changes both economically and socially in America. Technology has advanced exponentially, as it often does, and so has education as well. Sam, as an 11yo boy, is a master programmer and machinist with the attitude to boot. There's obvious role reversal with Charlie taking a back seat and giving in as the adult to Sam's more aggressive natures. Character development is also awkward early on as Sam's initial logical thought process is quickly replaced by brash confidence and blind determination after he discovers ATOM while Charlie's bravado and senseless "Ready! Fire! Aim!" tactics are likewise replaced by strategic planning and reserved confidence at the same time. Once this happens, the child/adult relationship seems to become more of a typical one.All in all, there is little to complain about with this film as it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end. This is no where near the greatest movie ever, but I feel as though it's the greatest movie I've seen in a while from the standpoint of pure entertainment. At certain points of the film I had to restrain myself from both vocally and physically cheering ATOM on, especially in the last fight sequence against Zeus. Perhaps this is because of my initial lack of expectation with the film, but none the less it was well worth the price of admission and the time spent watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems that a lot of people love to either write negative reviews, or read them one? They must be in high demand or something? My opinion is, if you see a negative review about this movie...just ignore it.It is VERY RARE that you get any type of viable/watchable Sci-Fi in any form these days. Most Sci-Fi is very cheaply made, with poorly written story lines, and second rate actors cast in them. And, little to no descent looking effects.Real Steel: Is not a "Cheap" made movie. The actors cast in the movie are "GOOD", and the story line is very family oriented. It can appeal to both a younger, and older crowd.The CGI effects are good, I like the close up views on the Robots.I would recommend that if you like Sci-Fi, you should give this a view. If you remotely enjoyed any of the vast "Marvel" movies that have been spewing out of Hollywood as of late? I don't see any reason why you would not like this movie. This movie is just as good as any Super Hero movie that has came out...With a sort of "Rocky" touch to it.And, you can let your kids watch it. Which is the least you can say for a lot of movies coming out these days.</fullReview>

And i can now say it was good, the story was a bit obvious and it was move of a children movie but i must admit i enjoyed it very much.The story is like, a guy who was a boxer but now these days he fights with robots instead. But things were starting to fall apart for him, he destroys all of his robots and he is out of cash. He is owing some bad people money and he doesn't know how to get a new robot, so he is deep in the dirt.He have son, that he abandon long time ago. the kid grows up with his mother, but she dies so the father gets custody of the kid, but he sells him for 100 000 dollar to the kids mothers friend. But he have to take care of the kid for 2 month in the summer. So he gets to follow his father on fighting tour.the rest u have to find out watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Real Steel is cheesy. But it hides a little something for everyone, along with some surprisingly deep messages on the way.It's the future! Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) was once a boxer, one of the best. Was, of course, until the sport of robot boxing took over the spotlight as more entertaining. Now, he rides from place to place, trying desperately to get some money. That is until he learns that his ex-girlfriend is dead, leaving him with an eleven-year-old tech-savvy son, Max. The boy's mom will take custody of him, but only at the end of summer. This is how an adventure starts, and when Max finds Atom, an old sparring bot in a junkyard, it only picks up speed. Despite the fact that Atom is not build to fight, Charlie and his son have no other choice left - they will have to make do with a small, weak robot. And with the ex-boxer teaching him to fight, who knows how far they will get?Real Steel makes no sense. Really. In fact, it's quite possible that you'll spend half the movie wondering about how the robot works and why, exactly, is Hugh Jackman using voice control instead of a remote. If you can look past the ridiculous plot, however, you'll see a story about how a boy reunites with his dad and how archaic beats the modern. Kids will enjoy a movie about 1000-pound robots beating up each other while the adults will appreciate it for the story.See it. You'll be surprised at how much you enjoy a movie about boxing robots.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Hugh fan of Hugh Jackman (pun was intended). OK, so this review might be a bit biased because of that. But Real Steel is a great movie because it has a balanced mixture of stories of scifi genre, romantic elements, life of a struggling man (a father and lover at that), and fights.I am getting goosebumps at many of the emotional scenes, and almost drop a tear at the end when Hugh fights. The ability to do that to me, is an indication of how this movie can delve into your inner soul and touch it lightly.I wish there will be a Real Steel 2 with same actors.</fullReview>

It borrows heavily from the Rocky franchise and the story is clichéd and predictable but the concept, execution and cast make this film work.There's nothing here that you haven't seen before. Washed up boxer gets crack at World title. But there are a few deviations from the theme to make it interesting and worthwhile.The CGi is brilliantly done and the fight sequences are excellent. The robots look convincing and you can't help but feel a real affection for the main protagonist at the end. There are no distractions to the main plot. No love stories to complicate matters needlessly. Just straight hardcore action all the way.A perfect Saturday night beer and popcorn movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many movies offer cheesy and cheap emotional scenes while forgetting that every emotion needs foundation. Real Steel DID NOT FAIL in any way! Acting is solid while fighting robots scenes are made realistically with ,at least basic, laws of physics in mind. For the emotional part of the movie I must say it really got to me! As much as fighting robots are unreal (yet), the story is more real than it could be! I do not wish to write spoiler so I'll be as brief as possible by saying that this is mostly father-Son movie you have to see!Reviewers who write that movie is "cheesy" are unaware or to young to know that bond between father and son is something that is real and not movie-makers imagination! Amazing and true emotions type of movie, entertaining, well casted and directed. 8 is my vote!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who knew a movie about robots fighting in a ring can be a tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for this film I was expecting a mediocre but entertaining flick. But what I got was much more, this movie is not only entertaining but it was outstanding. This is not a dumb movie, yeah the story is simple but it's worth investing yourself into it. Dakota Goyo who is a child actor was superb and did a fantastic job bringing out the emotion on screen and even for the audiences. Sometimes it really did feel like he carried the movie. I never cheered in a theater before but I was so very close to doing it, like really wanted to get out of my seat and cheer. Because the character development and the way it carried the emotions was so well done. This is a excellent family film that is a must watch if you enjoy watching movies. Movies like this is why I go to the theaters and it was worth every penny. Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton who is a washed up boxer and starts out as a selfish guy and a bit of a prick but like I said there is a lot of character development in this. And character you think of one way changes after the story progresses. But Charlie was passable even for a prick since it was played by Hugh Jackman, since it's very difficult to hate that guy. To sum it up this movie is about robots bashing the hell out of each other in the ring. But it's amazing how for a movie like this it really does tugs on the heartstrings and will get most audiences emotionally invested in the characters and even the robot itself. Some may say this is a rip off of "Rocky" but I don't care since this movie was great to the point some of it's flaws are forgivable. This is a must watch and will be looking forward to the sequel, hopefully it will be at least as good as this one.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Real Steel" (2011), Rated "PG-13" for Adult Situations, Adult Language and Some Violence. Running Time: 2hr&amp;7mn. - Three Stars (out of Four)Robots sure seem to be in vogue right now. However, the robot love affair has always been a sci-fi staple for many moons, especially since the 1950s. As we progress through the 21st century, real life robots are doing tasks in extreme environments and replacing humans in various fields for both efficiency and human safety. There's even been a reality-based television show about remote-controlled "BattleBots" which pummel each other into submission for our entertainment. It was only a matter time before we got a movie that combined these concepts to give us a fresh spin on a familiar world.From its very start, "Real Steel" is old-fashioned feel-good movie, the kind that you don't see too many of anymore. Sure, this movie has ultra cool robots which battle each other to the death in "underground" and arena settings. And yes, the film was also released in IMAX to showcase its cutting edge CGI special effects which compete in quality with the most recent "Transformers" movie. But this film doesn't focus on the random robotic rambunctiousness which is present in so many other recent metallic mash-up blockbusters. This movie is actually about real people with real problems. And, oh-my-gosh, this film has heart. How the heck did that happen? Where does it get the nerve to offer that in this day and age? The film opens with down and out loner Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) who travels in his big-rig around the rural mid-western farm country to enter his boxing robot in rodeos and underground robotic fighting venues, which for the most part replaced human boxing. Existence for Kenton, who is a former boxer, is hinged on making money from betting pools winner take all style. This rootless existence has left him jaded and socially distant as Charlie lives off the grid like a disgruntled carnie never knowing when the "big win" will be come his way. Even his childhood friend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly, "Lost") has a hard time getting though to him.After Charlie's robot is demolished by a rodeo bull and escapes from paying his debt, Charlie soon learns the mother of his 11 year old son Max (Dakota Goyo) has died. The boy's aunt wants Max to live with her and her wealthy husband, who can better provide for the boy. Charlie, desperate for cash, makes a deal to have Max live with him for three months, after which the youth will go to live with the aunt.As you could expect, the estranged father and son are forced to deal with each other for the first time in their lives. Regarding each other with apprehension, they soon bond through a mutual appreciation of robotic boxing. A late night junkyard find of the early generation sparring robot "Atom" proves to be the winning ticket gold for the duo. The extremely resilient "Atom" leads the Kentons in a series of underworld, robofight victories sparking public interest in them and to those who would have other plans for their continued success.What's pleasant about "Real Steel" is the real feel of rural Americana life (the movie was filmed in Michigan). Though the film takes place in the near future, the subject matter is treated as the gospel truth. The end result is a film that feels sincere and genuine about its people, places and things. Perhaps this shouldn't be too much of a surprise: "Real Steel" is loosely based on the 1956 short story by Richard Matheson ( "The Twilight Zone", "I am Legend") whose writings often focused on ordinary people dealing with ordinary problems in extraordinary situations.The cast does a good job of conveying sorrow, regret and reconciliation. It's nice to see Hugh Jackman play Charlie as a unrelenting boxer who just wants to survive. Newcomer Dakota Goyo is fun as Jackman's estranged son who at times is smarter than Charlie when it comes to patience, understanding and determination. The two actors play off of each other nicely, with Goyo holding his own in all of his scenes. There's no denying Evangeline Lilly successfully conveys Bailey with a heart of gold. Who wouldn't want her on their side? "Real Steel" is co-executive produced by Steven Spielberg who is no stranger to family friendly fare. There are a few nods to Spielberg's own film "E.T." (1982) in the human child-robot dynamic between Max and Atom. Since "Real Steel" has elements of a boxing film, you might also notice a few tips of the hat to the "Rocky" movies as well. All of these factors help make "Real Steel" one of the better family films in recent years. There's a delight in its straightforward simplistic story telling about its real people. And that makes a real difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Real Steel" Has Some Real Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steel" is a film with all the heart of "Rocky" and sheer BALLS of steel. It's about an ex-boxer names Charlie Kenton, who's been down on his luck. His ex-girlfriend has just died, and he has gained custody of his son, Max, who he's never given two cares for. So in order for his ex-girlfriend's sister to get full custody of Max, Charlie blackmails them for 100,000 on the condition that he looks after Max for three months.The film takes place in the year 2020. Boxing has now become real life Rock Em' Sock Em' Robots. When Max finds an old rustic robot in a junkyard that has an unusual ability to take a lot of damage, he convinces Charlie to let him fight, and they begin their journey to the World Championships.Charlie is played by Hugh Jackman. Quite a different performance when he doesn't have Adamantium claws coming out of his hands. He's a sly, smooth-talking, charismatic guy who's able to talk himself in or out of anything. His acting is perfect. It's a totally believable character. The tough guy who pretends not to care because he's ashamed of leaving his son.Max is played by Dakota Goyo, following up his short appearance as a young god of thunder in "Thor". His performance is as solid as can be. He doesn't care who mocks him or puts him down. He is determined to show the world that an old bot can have heart in the ring. He goes to some places that would probably make a kid his age wet his pants, like a place called The Zoo. All the music they needed in that scene was the Scorpions song.The father-son relationship is really touching. You believe it 100% and never doubt it for a second. You swear you're watching a real family in this ridiculous future go through these struggles.The music in this movie is really good and fitting. There's a couple Eminem songs that are, shockingly, highly effective in putting you in the gritty underground boxing scene, or touching scores in the final fight that lift your spirits and connect you to the characters.The action in this film is awesome. There's about five fights, all well done, all awesome, and all make you wanna you shout at the screen in encouragement. I always get like that in boxing movies for some reason, "Rocky", "Real Steel", it doesn't matter. Just give me guys punching the crap out of each other in style and I'm hooked.One little thing I wanna point out. Try counting how many in-film advertisements there are in for non-existent products. You will laugh at some of the things. The XBOX 720, The HP robot controller. Some of the things are so hilariously plausible, you swear you're getting a look at the future.In closing, "Real Steel" is a touching, over-the-top, sheer amazing boxing movie that has all the heart you can ever want. If you wanna see a movie that about robots beating the hell out of each other doesn't have the "Transformers" license, this is the movie for you. Whether you're looking for a drama, an action flick, a sci-fi piece, or just a nice family film, "Real Steel" is the way to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely...awesome!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The minute the movie ended, I turned to my husband (who had already watched it 3 times) and I said "let's go out and get more tickets, I want to watch it again!!". And I wasn't lying! What's best about it, is I can bring my 6 year old boys with me next time. There is nothing scary, gory, bloody or inappropriate for kids in it. There is one scene in which Kenton gets beat up but it is shot in such a way, that honestly, my kids see more gore and fight when they watch Bakugan... so no biggie. That's pretty much the only scene in the film that I would have qualms about.The CGI is excellent, one of the very best I have ever seen. You really do think the robots are right there with the actors. Both Jackman and Dakota Goyo (the little boy) deliver really well. Jackman seems to love fantasy characters (see X-men) so he fits right in, in this movie. He has you convince he is a loser, drunk and filmsy character...I really wish when the movie comes out on DVD, there is some sort of extended version because I would certainly love to see more of it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robots with A Heart? Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to make boxing can be accepted by young children? In thiz case, the answer is "Real Steel". The Director Shawn Levy cleverly turns the rough boxing matches into fun, passionate and enjoyable family adventure by presenting attractive and super cool Robot figures. Levy is previously known for "Cheaper by the Dozen" (2003) and "Night at the Museum" (2006). For me, he seems to know how to roll the dice of excitement. Besides being effective in constructing believable and powerful Robot fights, thiz movie also has a heartwarming story of father and son relationship. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former professional boxer who turns out to be Robot-fight promoter, just met his 11-year-old son he never knew before, Max (Dakota Goyo). Instead of Charlie teaches life lessons to his son, Max. On the contrary, Max has been inspiring his father how to win World Robot Boxing championship, but more than that is about how to win life. There are some encouraging and gratifying scenes. One of them is when Max and his Robot Atom show their dance moves. On the other side, I can almost say thiz is probably the most humane character that ever played by Hugh "Wolverine" Jackman. While the father's character looks troubled and typical anti-hero, but it's relatively effective to gain sympathy. Spoiler Alert! The final scene reminds us of first "Rocky" (1976) where the hero didn't have to win the match, but he certainly won the heart of audience. Max shows his big heart by saying "It sounds pretty good to me". Robots with a heart? Awesome! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer first time couple of weeks ago, I said to myself: I'm not pretty sure, but this might be a good movie to watch, but something was missing out there and i didn't know exactly what was it! I went to the Grand Cinema at Wednesday night and I was little bit sleepy, but after I watched the movie, I wasn't able to sleep for more 2 hours thinking of what happened.The movie is dramatic, family, comedy, has a fair enough robots violence, the same type that you like wen you play a video games, legendary story some how, and you know what? its one of the few movies that you 100% engage with from the beginning till the end, I didn't miss a second, nothing was boring, i believe the director was able to utilize all scene so the audience never got bored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are certain combinations of feelings one experiences at a movie theater, sometimes we feel our throats knotted as we're about to cry whilst watching a truly emotional movie, others we laugh hysterically at the humor most comedy films throw at us, then there are action movies which have us on the edge of our seats as we truly root for our main character to perform the most bizarre exploits, however, this year's Real Steel gives us a little taste of every one of those feelings, and does it in a truly satisfying way, but not without it's shortcomings.Set in a not so distant future, "Real Steel" tells us the story of Charlie Kenton, an ex-boxing star, irresponsible and struggling promoter who seeks triumph in a popular sport that has replaced human boxing and requires a giant robot machine instead, during his journey to the top, he discovers that his ex-girlfriend has passed away and that he must claim custody of his only child, whom he abandoned right after birth. Having learned that the boy was being adopted by a really rich couple, he then decides to give up parental rights in exchange of a large sum of money and a summer spent with his son. But during this summer, and while failing to win a single robot-boxing match, he begins to develop bonds with his son, who later comes across a buried robot that, despite being picked up as garbage, turns out to be quite the boxing champion and helps Charlie and Max climb to the top of the boxing career while joining father and son together.What truly shines in this story is young actor's Dakota Goyo performance as Max Kenton, he's the son everyone would like to have, he is both fearless, full of hope and anxious to spend time with his horrible father who treats him like garbage until he begins to make money for him and finds his way into his father's heart, Hugh Jackman's performance as Charlie Kenton would've been brighter, but he had to portray a really jerk father who becomes unlikable until the point of harming his own son and taking money away from him, he is truly a pathetic character, but is brought to life and reivindicated thanks to Max who teaches him the value of father &amp; son relationships.The CGI giant robots are really well made, and the boxing matches are actually cool to observe, they really imitate real boxing to some degree and at some point you find yourself becoming quite the fan of this sport, but you also get to know the underground and see the other face of it, like in every other sport, not everything is fun and games, and the movie makes it quite clear.In the end "Real Steel" delivers a truly emotional experience that benefits from smart humor being thrown here and there, and Transformers-esque action scenes that actually make sense and provide elements that could've been further developed to the plot, and giving a "happy" ending that isn't far-fecthed but on the contrary, believable.8/10</fullReview>

It was more than a bang up sports movie with sweat and blood. Er, oil... Wonderful chemistry, a solid plot, and cool special effects. Don't think it is going to change your life, but you might just cry a little bit.It had a lot of heart, which I did not expect. The little kid did a really nice job.

		<fullReview>Real Steel provides what is expected - robot boxing - and more.Hugh Jackman is good in the lead role, as a man running away from his past and responsibilities. He is sucked into the robot boxing world but can't catch a break. With Hugh Jackman, I keep expecting him to turn into Wolverine and take out the bad guys.Dakota Goyo steals the movie as his son, who is stuck for a summer with his dad he has never met before. Together, they have some touching, emotional, and funny scenes together.Their characters are brought together by a robot boxer named Atom, who draws out a lot of emotion for a machine who doesn't speak.The movie follows a Rocky-like script, as they battle Atom in robot fights that are very much like Transformer battles. Overall, the movie is very entertaining with great characters and a satisfying story and a cool underdog robot Atom that you'll find yourself cheering on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman: The New Clint Eastwood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler Alert** The night before seeing "Real Steel," my husband forced me to watch "Every Which Way But Loose," which is not one of my favorite genres. Still, it was a classic, and I agreed to watch it to have it as a cultural reference. Imagine our surprise when a reference to the Eastwood film cropped up in the Jackman film. After that, I could not stop comparing Jackman to Eastwood. They even look alike: same build, same aging, Anglo-Saxon good looks. Overall, the film was entertaining, and not a bad way to spend a weekend afternoon. My husband and son loved it. The rock-em-sock-em robots were cool. The CGI boxing matches were flashy and loud. And the underlying romance and story line were acceptable. Evangeline Lilly is gorgeous, and I expect to see her in more roles. The film's ending is touching, without being maudlin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robo-Rocky Revisited!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a lot of buzz around with the response the movie got with rave reviews, but none the less this Robo-boxing movie was one of the pick off movie of the year with another power-packed performance by Hugh Jackman. The movie was filled with apt amount of everything : Drama, Romance, Fights, Father-son Relationship, Comedy etc. The Concept of futuristic Robo-boxing was presented and executed to near perfection with the advanced graphics. Another high point of the movie was its background score which provided the right kind of adrenaline rush that gets amplified on many an occasions. The best part of the movie were the ones wherein the shadowboxing was executed by the Robo- be it in the final round or Robo Dancing on the steps of the Wonder Kid played by Dakota Goyo, which certainly added the charm and innocence to the movie. The best part of the movie was when Hugh Jackman was fighting the last round having Robo shadow box in the ring against all powerful Machine Robo. This movie stands tall based on its strong storyline/plot, heart pounding Background score and Steel Plated power packed performances by the two central characters played by Dakota Goyo and Hugh Jackman. I am giving this movie a 9/10 rating. A good enough watch for all generations and especially to those who wanna see a Robo incarnated Rocky like the great Sylvester Stallone in the ring beating the Hell out of the opponent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kid reminds me of Ricky Schroeder. And therefore of The Boxer, Jon Voight, uphill fights for love, etc. Yup, and there seems to be a rich relative hovering somewhere in the background, too. It's funny how the father seems to be on a self destructive bent. With the boy trying to talk him out of it. Then somewhere along the line, they switch roles with the boy being gung-ho and the father becoming the voice of caution. Hah, truly a father and son near to one's heart. Thoroughly enjoyable movie. Shout as loud as you can, cheer our hero-robot hoarse. Now as to Hugh Jackman getting out of being typecast as Wolverine and the like, well I first saw him in Kate and Leopold where he was so far away from an action actor but very effective nonetheless. Go and watch.</fullReview>

Dakota Goyo who plays his stubborn, eleven-year-old son easily holds his own and, to me, was a surprisingly strong character in the story. You will surely fall in love with this little handsome fella.

		<fullReview>Is it possible to cry during a ROBOT movie? I knew a little about this movie beside this is about robot doing boxing etcetera etcetera, but from first scene I realized that this is not some CGI-vaganza with little to offer. This is something more.Hugh Jackman is really good as ex-boxer/estranged father who thinks he knows all about boxing robot business yet we sensed that he's such a looser all along. With the arrival of his estranged son (great Dakota Goyo) and ATOM a robot that really captures what human really is, he finally learns something more about his life and his purpose.And Evangeline Lilly, what can I say? She infused vulnerability, humility, and beauty at every scene she's in. I think in the future she will be one of A-List star, if not already happening.And did I tell you it is possible to cry during ROBOT movie? With Real Steel I can assure you that it is much much possible. It's beautifully written and executed. Every moment counts - something that Michael Bay should learn :) - and I can't wait for its sequel.BRING IT!!!</fullReview>

My kids loved it and well want a robot so if anyone knows of where I can get one please let me know ha ha. WATCH IT and you will see. Don't watch crappy copies this is worth the Cinema.

		<shortDescription>Much Better than Transformer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You want a movie with a lot of gadget and techno stuff? You want a movie with plot? You want a movie that makes your adrenaline runs?Watch Real Steel then.Whenever people talk about Real Steel, the first thing that comes into their mind is probably Transformer. Some people are amazed by Transformer, though not to me due to its plot, but guess what? Real Steel is definitely much better than that. It has good plot (not very strong one, but good enough for its kind), good fighting scenes, and even some heart-warming moments too. The robots are awesome. The way they fight is just fantastic. Some of us have complained that the fighting in Transformer ends too fast, and the good side can always turns the situation around no matter how bad their situation is. That just looks too fake. But, not in Real Steel. You'll know it when you watch it. It is so much more realistic than Transformer.However, I have to admit, at the beginning of the movie, I thought that this movie is going to disappoint me. The starting is quite boring, honestly. But it picks up later. When the robots fight, you really feel your heart pumping. I even have an urge to stand up like the crowds in the movie, to shout at the fighting robots and cheer for them. If they have a 3D version, I'll definitely watch it. But too bad, there isn't any 3D version in the cinema.The weirdest part in the movie, to me, is probably Max, the son of Charles. Max is only 11 years old, but in the movie, he looks very mature. The way he thinks, the way he talks... Too mature. He looks like a grown-up more. That's just inappropriate.In short, this movie is definitely worth watching. I wanted to rate it as 7 out of 10 due to the character of Max, but it's really not easy to make a film full of techno stuff and good plot nowadays. Therefore, one extra point for it.Lastly, I just want to say, Max is just too lucky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a departure from the clichéd underdog boxer's story, Real Steel exploits the high tech era that is around the corner for our generation. When the sport of boxing turns lethal and uncontrollable, people place their bets on fighting robots that were programmed and designed to take on any heavy weight clanging bot. As silly as its premise may seem, Real Steel does have its heart behind the ambition of the father-son team to make it big in the Robot boxing arena. Hugh Jackman stars as the retired boxer now controlling scrapyard robots in underground matches, Dakota Goyo impresses with a realistic depiction of the nerdy cool kid and as for Evangeline Lilly......it's just sensational to watch her on screen again!Charlie Kenton (Jackman) knows boxing. Although, he's a bad bet when he enters the arena with his robot. Charlie tends to get carried away and enters matches his robot is destined to lose. Bailey (Evangeline Lilly) fixes up robots for Charlie but is quite fed up of his losing streak. That's when a blast from the past, in the form of Max (Dakota Goyo) enters Charlie's life as his son whom he never claimed. With a financial arrangement, Charlie agrees to keep Max for 2 months before handing custody to his ex-girlfriend's sister. Now, Max isn't this quiet masoom kid and he knows all about boxing robots. To the extent that when they lose a match for Noisy Boy and revert to the scrapyard to pick up pieces that would make a robot, he discovers a sparring bot Atom, who has the unique ability of shadow boxing where it mirrors the actions of its trainer. Max is attached to this robot and stays up all night to program it, to train it and engage it for combat. After a few underground fights, Charlie and Max realize the potential of the sparring bot that can take a lot of beating but can ultimately dish out brutal punches when trained and prompted. For Charlie, Atom's crusade to the big league is an opportunity to repay debts, make money and build a bond with his son whom he now gets attached to. For Max, it's like living a dream. His reaction to witnessing Zeus for the first time, spending hours with Atom trying to communicate with him and dancing to the ring with Atom to the tunes of Eminem and Timbaland are the movie's most memorable moments. Evangeline Lilly looks gorgeous even in a non-glamorous role as a scrap robot fixer in her father's gym. Her rage, disappointment and elation are depicted in a natural manner and the sweetness in her eyes says much more than the dialogue writer could ever come up with....Beyond the human elements that make up the heart of the movie, there is a whole lot of adroitly created robot action in the arena as Atom takes punch after punch, only to follow Charlie's direction at the right time and deliver the winning blow. The action sequences, even though CGI created, are just outstanding to behold. While Atom takes numerous blows, Zeus' compelling presence can make you wince under his might. You will be cheering and hooting like you did when you watched 'Rocky' and 'The Fighter', only to realize that you are cheering for artificially created robots on screen. Such is the reality in the creation of Real Steel. Characters are lovable, Robots are overpowering and their action is breath-taking. Director Shawn Levy knows when to bring in a fight and when to limit it. The effective use of an upbeat background score enhances the thrill of the fights. The movie might have concluded on a melodramatic note but it kept you engaged throughout and that's what really matters. With some excellent performances by a superb star-cast and surreal CGI work on the Robotic action, Real Steel triumphs in delivering entertainment with a metallic punch. 8.11 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel actually shows Real Heart. This one is for both the kids and parents!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Real Steal" is based on the 1956 short story called "Steel" by Richard Matheson (a visionary director and writer who wrote other great films like "Somewhere in Time" with Christopher Reeve, "What Dreams May Come" with Robin Williams, and "I Am Legend" with Will Smith) and trust me this film is well worth watching at the BIG screen.IMDb summary: "Set in the near future, where robot boxing is a top sport, a struggling promoter feels he's found a champion in a discarded robot. During his hopeful rise to the top, he discovers he has an 11-year-old son who wants to know his father." My summary: "Welcome to a world where a displaced former boxer must come to grips with his past career and create a new future in the robot boxing arena. Along the way, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) learns what it means to accept responsibility and be a father to his son Max (Dakoto Goyo) by discovering that "Real Steel" is from the heart." Plot/Storyline: The movie picked up the solid and refreshing idea from the short story "Steel" which breathes life into the characters and action sequences. Although, there was nothing mind-boggling like inception, Real Steel did have its humorous and uplifting moments that gave it sparkle and character! 7/10 Cinematography/CGI: Filming is the place which often makes or breaks a film after the storyline is concerned...Real Steel did not disappoint in this arena. The Animatronic robots built for the film and the motion capture technology were state-of-the-art. You started to even "feel" sorry for the robots that were getting pummeled into the ground. 9/10 Acting/Action: Acting and action sequences were another great element to this film. Hugh Jackman and Dakoto Goyo both act a great father and son duo. In addition, I really enjoyed the range of emotions: the tension, anxiety, joy, and even the cocky arrogance...You watch the movie and you will know what I am talking about. 8/10 Overall Shock and Awe: What is the last movie that you heard people clapping not once, not twice, but at least three times? Yes, my showing had an audience of parents, children, grandparents, and teenagers, and all of us were cheering and clapping for Charlie, Max, and Atom many times throughout the movie! 9/10Go ahead and take your family out for this one, its an inspiring film that will stick with you long after the show is over!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel: Humanity's Nature Stripped Like Parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the near future, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlie Kenton, a former world-class boxer in a world where humans have been replaced by robots as participants in the boxing sport. Supported by Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lily), the daughter of his former trainer, he spends his time using these robots to earn a living and to possibly relive his glory days as a fighter, but his efforts go nowhere. His situation gets interesting when his son, eleven year-old Max (Dakota Goyo), reappears in his life and gives him the strength he needs to regain what he had lost.Real Steel reminds viewers of all the boxing films that they have watched. Only this time, there is a twist. The fighters are like skinless Terminators ready to claw anyone that gets in their way. Action scenes are decent enough and camera movement is not shaky and distracting. The clinking of metal is like the cracking of one's jaw. The pain! A funny part of the film is when the robot dances. Yes, it actually does THE robot dance.Cast assembled for Real Steel is pretty impressive. Hugh Jackman really knows how to play the good-looking asshole with the golden heart. He pulls off another Wolverine, except this time, he's a dad. Hollywood has been missing him lately and it is very good news that he is back with a bang. With her dirty work clothes, Evangeline Lily still manages to remain beautiful and elegant. Her character is easy to love, and after watching her in this film, I have decided to get my hands on all 6 seasons of Lost and watch them until my eyes pop out. Dakota is just an adorable kid and I am sure that he will grow up, smile, and break a lot of hearts.In films, we learn a lot about ourselves. What better way of education than to watch something with... robots in it? Yes, you read that right. The presence of these machines actually help flesh out certain things about mankind.1) As Charlie said in the junkyard while he was explaining the evolution of boxing, "people wanted more carnage, more show." It was Roman gladiators back then, it is cockfighting now, and it will be robot battle-to-the-death in the future. Somehow, people enjoy watching violence so much that creative ways are made to sustain this "hobby." Barbarism is unfortunately, still alive and well.2) Man's love for entertainment. Instead of using these robots for something more useful (like planting, or construction), they are used for sports purposes. Now, it can be said that this is a film limitation given that everything about that supposedly future time still seems to be set in the present, but one can also argue that man just does not know how to use his ideas properly.3) There will always be value in human ingenuity and skill. Even though the robots are doing the fighting, it is the people behind them that matter, and that is highlighted especially towards the end of the film.4) Nothing bonds boys better than toys. Essentially, Real Steel is a about a reconnection of a father and son with the robots in the backdrop. We witness through these machines how Charlie and Max put aside their differences and accepted who they are to each other.The only thing that I found confusing about Real Steel is why Atom was so good. Is it only shadow movement, or does he actually understand? He comes close to the IRobot concept a few years back, but the film never really tackles the depth of this robot and explains why he is the way he is.I'm not a fan of boxing, I'm definitely not a fan of robots, and I only had 30 minutes of sleep when I watched this. Still, I loved every second of it. I know I recommend a lot of things but if ever you plan to start listening, you better do it now. Whether you watch movies every week or have not watched anything for a year now, Real Steel is a 2011 film you should not miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock em Sock em Robots the movie, delivered a powerful punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night (7/9/11) I highly doubted I would enjoy this movie at all, but it proved me wrong. Don't get me wrong this certainly isn't the best movie ever, the best movie about boxing ever, it's not even Hugh Jackman's best movie. The story heavily borrowed from other movies such as Rocky, especially down to the ending. The movie had a basic story, but some kind of magical element to it, like the children's movies us in our 20's watched back in the late 80's and early 1990's. I remember seeing the previews for this movie, and couldn't get over the fact that it was going to be terrible, but like the small, under powered robot, ATOM the main emphasis of the movie, it surprised me and delivered. I may not see this movie again, but I will remember it as a solid, well put together fill because of the spirit and work put into it's writing, acting and special effects. There was a lot of visual things to look for, especially product placements of the future, Xbox 720 caught my eye during the final fight against the champion Zeus. References from Rocky I picked up: A down on his luck boxer gets the chance of a lifetime, The Champion is named after a God (Apollo in Rocky and Zeus in Real Steel)It borrowed elements from other stories like the robot was configured and put together again in the film, a comparison and observation I do not think was intended for us to realize, more of a coincidence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rocky of the mid 21st century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Rocky of the mid 21st century, with a small tribute to Muhammad Ali, is a robot named ATOM.Sometime after 2014 (we know this because ATOM was built around that time) boxing (by humans) is a distant memory and the latest sport craze is fighting robots. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is an ex-boxer who is trying to make his way in the world of robotic fighting. His robots are tough, but not tough enough. His troubles not only include losing and his mechanical boxers being totally destroyed, he is in debt to several unsavory characters. To complicate things a little further, his ex-girlfriend passes away leaving Charlie's 11 year old son, Max (Dakota Goyo) needing someone to take care of him.Charlie attempts to get his current girl friend, Baily Tallet (Evangeline Lilly), to keep Max while he goes on the boxing circuit, but Max insists on accompanying Charlie and the will of the 11 year old wins out. During their trip they find a complete sparing robot abandoned in an old junk yard. The robot is unique in that it is equipped with a shadow feature which is very rare among boxing robots. Max takes ATOM (the sparing robot) under his wing and prepares his programing for battle.ATOM has some impressive wins and before long is invited to box the reigning world robot champion, ZEUS, in a spectacle filled event. Rocky is all that is need to be said.Along their journey Charlie and Max find that father/son bond that is important for both of their lives.I found the movie to be a little long but it had enough substance to make it enjoyable. It has a rating of PG-13 but is not so bad that younger viewers would not enjoy the film. As usual I recommend a matinée viewing to get the best ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be bias, but I thought the movie was great, and Dakota(Max) is a star being born..Watching him on set was just as great as seeing him on screen, this is a little boy who came out of no where and steels your heart on screen. The chemistry between him and Hugh Jackman on and off screen was fun to watch. This story is not about a human boxer coming back, but about a boy and his father who did not know each other, getting to know each other and themselves. It pulls on the heart strings a little too.The whole thing about Atom in this story, is that he his just like the Max, a object that was tossed aside because people felt he was not good, but in the end you find that the robot is just as lovable as the little boy. You also find that Charlie (Hugh Jackman) is a man that started out just trying to survive but has learned that there is more to life, and that he is a good father to his boy that he more or less left behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not looking forward to seeing this film because from the trailer, you already knew what the story was going to be and how it would turn out. This film took rock 'em, sock 'em robots to the next level (although I am really telling my age by even mentioning rock 'em, sock 'em robots, but who cares). I would be remiss if I did not mention that this film was way too long for my taste. There were several times that I wanted to yell "stop the fight". Did I mention that I am a huge boxing fan, but I was not a big fan of watching two hunks of metal go at it. I would have loved to have seen Larry Merchant or Max Kellerman doing the commentary. Thankfully there were not a lot of fight scenes which kept the film from being too boring. Director Shawn Levy is used to bringing things to life with his Night at the Museum films and I have to say when he added some human elements to the robots it did improve the films likability somewhat. Hugh Jackman (Charlie Kenton) is probably glad to get away from his Wolverine character for a while and play a role that is more realistic (although I hear that the wolverine will be back). I think the training that he did with Sugar Ray Leonard went a long way in making Hugh into a believable boxer. Dakota Goyo (Max Kenton) was adorable. I like the fact that he acted like a little boy should, but at the same time he was smart well beyond his years (kind of like he was when he played young Thor). I am really sick of the underdog, David and Goliath type of films, although you start to really like Atom, you really wish that he could somehow speak and make the film a little more interesting. I think that little boys will really enjoy this film, but this is one case where the adults will get impatient and start screaming "are we there yet?" The film just took too long to get to where it was trying to go. If you do not have anything better to do then I suggest you bob and weave your way to your local theater and check it out for yourself. As for me, I am going to take a standing eight count and give this film an amber light.</fullReview>

This is about fighting your way back from humiliation, hard times and complete rock bottom. The absolute feel good movie of the decade. Sit back, hold tight and enjoy the ride to have a great movie experience with your family. Great acting by the whole crew, including the "vilians". Don't be scared to get a little sentimental and just let this movie guide you. It's action, it's drama, it's fighting the good fight! Of course it has been done before, but this is the new and improved version. Back to your instincts and a raw action/emotion flow for 2 hours, that any 30-50 year old man would understand. And probably theirs son's with equal excitement.</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman really showed his acting skill. So they really show what they've got. The storyline is exciting. But the most thing that I like of this movie is the idea of using robots, and the relationship between human and robots, is amazing. This is the first time I saw a movie with a brilliant idea like this.There are only few movies like that, for example, Transformers, but it more focused on the robots, not the humans. But I enjoyed this movie more than Transformers. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future when people become uninterested in boxing and similar sports, a new sport is created - Robot boxing wherein robots battle each other while being controlled by someone.Charlie Kenton, a former boxer who's trying to make it in the new sport but not only doesn't do well, he is very deeply in the red.When he learns that his ex, mother of his son Max, dies, he goes to figure out what to do with him. His ex's sister wants to take him in but Charlie has first say in the matter.Charlie asks her husband for money so he can buy a new Robot in exchange for turning Max over to them. He takes Max for the summer,and Max improves his control of his bot.But when the bot is destroyed, they go to a scrap yard to get parts. Max finds an old generation bot named Atom and restores him. Max wants Atom to fight but Charlie tells him he won't last a round but Atom wins.And it isn't long when Atom is getting major bouts. Max gets Charlie to teach Atom how to fight and father and son bond...The fighting Robots sold me from the word go, but what this little treat didn't advertise that much is the beautiful bonding that father and son have throughout the film.the fact that is so good, is down to Jackman. his character his so likable that it comes as a genuine shock when he dismisses his son so abruptly. And of course, the power of the Robots bring them together.There is some silly sub-plot about money owing, and it hinders the pace of the film on occasion, But Levy whose other movies are painfully sweet and borderline offensive, really keeps the saccharine levels to a minimum here.The final third is straight from Rocky IV, and there is even a Bridgette Nielsen alike who speaks for the fighter.It's very strange saying that it's one of the most feel good movies of the year, because there isn't really anything original about it, but the chemistry between the leads and the seamless effects make this movie a 'Knockou' (pun intended).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year we get the usual array of Hollywood offerings on our big screens and they always range between insulting to mediocre to simply OK. This year was no different. I saw a few movies I enjoyed but didn't really love, and a few I actually hated and could not believe they actually did them. The Three Musketeers which I saw today belongs to the latter bunch; a waste of money and pretty faces. Real Steel was the exception for this year, like A Single Man was two years ago for me. It moved me and engaged me like no other movie this year did and upon leaving the cinema I felt like sharing the experience with others. It was by no means perfect, but it was the best effort at storytelling I have encountered in the recent years from Hollywood. Most of them try, but get it wrong; these guys got it right for once. It felt good to watch a movie again and really enjoy it. Loved the acting too; Dakota Goyo was amazing and Jackman very convincing. His best work yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A conditional 10 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked the trailer, then I would definitely recommend you watch it. Often trailers give away too much or completely mislead you, this one does neither. It doesn't raise expectations of being this generation's Rocky but it also isn't a mindless flick. It has heart and great performances and it has the action that makes it a fun movie. Props go to Hugh J. for being utterly dislikable when his character needed to be. Many might think i mean he's kind of like wolverine where he presents a rough exterior but secretly you love him, no i mean there where times I wanted the power to walk into the movie and smack his character, he was that much of a jerk. But the real star was the kid who played Max, Dakota. To be able to go toe to toe with Hugh &amp; also bring life to Atom, well that takes spunk and this kid had it in spades. There is a line in the movie where the character of Charlie says " are you kidding me with those eyes?" I think it describes the relationship that these two actors are able to foster. This movie isn't perfect, to be fair no movie is if you ask too many questions, but it delivers as promised, it's fun, inspirational and frankly pretty cool. I give it a conditional 10/10 as long as Hollywood does NOT make a sequel. There are some movies that do warrant a revisit of the characters but this isn't one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I see this in October instead of June?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not exactly sure why this textbook summer blockbuster wound up in early October. It can't be because the studio thought it sucked, because this thing is practically a masterpiece compared to a lot of the bilge pumped out of Hollywood between March and September. Real Steel is good natured, the robot fights are about as exciting as this sort of FX action ever gets and the story more or less makes sense, at least until they just throw everything on the screen to try and get the happiest ending possible. Now, it is too dependent on the charisma of Hugh Jackman and while these filmmakers knew what emotional beats they wanted their story to hit, they clearly had no idea how to actually hit them. But in a world where somebody, somewhere, somehow decided to make a sequel to Human Centipede, this movie is like a shining light of quality storytelling.In the year 2020 (yes, 9 years from now), human boxers have been replaced by 15 foot tall robots who beat the hydraulic fluid out of each other. A washed up ex-boxer named Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) now drives from town to town, operating his own fighting 'bot and falling further and further into debt as one after the other of his desperate get-rich-quick attempts fall apart before his eyes. Then Charlie's informed an old girlfriend has died and he gets one more avaricious idea. He sells his parental rights to his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) in order to get the money to buy another robot.When Charlie's self-destructive ego gets that machine trashed, he's left with nothing?until Max finds an old robot in the junkyard. He fixes it up despite Charlie's discouragement and the old 'bot, named Atom, becomes the vehicle through which father and son bond and Charlie finally gets his shot at the big time.A PG-13 rating is no longer a sign of family friendly entertainment, if it ever was. A lot of them tend to be R rated material that's been cut down to barely make it under the standard. Real Steel is a PG rated film that had a few needless S-words thrown in to get the 13 added on. Several decades ago, this would have almost been considered G rated entertainment. Unless you don't want your kid to be exposed to computer generated carnage inflicted on computer generated constructs, this movie should be acceptable to most parents.Though the pacing is a bit slack, Real Steel manages to start at Point A and proceed in a relatively logical fashion through Points B, C and D before concluding at Point E. The emotional subtext to those plot mechanics, however, is all screwed up. I mean, it's like these filmmakers had never heard of what a character arc was or how to construct one. For instance, Charlie Kenton starts out as an unlikable jerk. He's arrogant, reckless and thinks nothing of making a bet and then running out on it when he loses. But except for one scene where he acts like he just came from having a breakthrough at his therapist's office, Charlie is pretty much the same arrogant, reckless jerk through the whole movie. He is never forced to confront his flaws and then overcome them. Put somebody less charming than Jackman in the role and most of the audience would wind up rooting for Charlie to fail.Real Steel's big climax is also a rip off of Rocky where the overmatched challenger takes the superior champion to a draw and wins a moral victory. But unlike the Oscar-winning motion picture that went to great pains to convince the audience that Rocky couldn't possible beat Apollo Creed and going the distance is the only win he could ever get, this film has Atom beat a series of superior robots in the lead up to his championship battle. Every time Atom is shown defeating another 'bot, it destroys the premise that he can't win the big one. Rocky was given his title shot out of the blue as a stunt. If he had earned it with a string of knockout victories, why wouldn't viewers expect him to beat Creed?The two previous paragraphs are the sort of thing that happen over and over in this film. The story consistently gets to these moments of drama only for them to fizzle because nothing was done to properly or effectively build up to them. It's weird because the plot works well enough and the emotional beats are mostly correct for when they happen, but instead of the plot working toward those beats, it works against them. I'm not sure I've ever seen a script so proficient in one thing and deficient in another.And for those interested, Evangeline Lilly playing another ex-lover of Charlie's is as sexy and appealing as you ever get in PG-13 cinema. I was never a big fan of Lost so I didn't pay that much attention to Lilly, but whoa! She needs to play this same sort of role in an R-rated flick as soon as possible.Even with its flaws, Real Steel is an enjoyable way to get out of the house for a couple of hours and sometimes that's all a movie has to be.</fullReview>

Dunno if i should say more Robot fights would have been shown but it would have had affected the movie time to increase which could have been bad as the movie had to show a lot, the robots,fight,father-son relation, etc. Anyways its an awesome movie really after so long got a movie i don't wanna stop watching it over n over again just like other great movies like 300, 007 bond, robocop, etc. A must watch for everyone.

		<shortDescription>Great fun, exciting, feel good metal-crunching action flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It has an original feel to it. I mean, how many movies feature awesome looking robots fighting it out!? I'd take this movie over Transformers any day of the week that ends in Y. Go take your kids to see this movie, they'll love it. Good to see Hugh Jackman, great performance all around. The kid was really great too. I know I'm being vague here but I'm telling y'all, its worth seeing.I thought the graphics and visuals of the robots were just great. Really inspired me for an art project or two. I loved the redemption theme running throughout, it made for a fun ending where the big guy loses and the small guy wins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, in my opinion, was the best movie I have ever seen. Which is pretty good as I have seen tons of movies. This movie is happy, sad, funny, and most of all entertaining. This movie has a great story and has good acting. I thought it was going to be just an average movie about fighting robots and what not, but it was about family, love, and fighting robots. If I had to pick one movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would probably be this. It was just that good. Hands down greatest movie I've seen in a long time. The actors in this are Hugh Jackman (Charlie) and Dakota Goyo (Max), their performance is amazing! If it were any other two actors playing Max and Charlies roll. It would still have been a good movie, just not AS good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i had heard little of this film until i went and watched it for which i am glad as it came as one of those really pleasant surprises.With the awesome effects of transformers but with a great and believable story line that i feel those movies lack, The creators took a great script, added great actors and got top effects guys and produced a great film. It may be that being a single dad who's made mistakes that i can connect so well with the characters, but connect i did and that to me is the sign of a good movie, i got drawn in by the story and loved the action scenes, Hugh jackman gave a fantastic performance, his best to date for me! Being of an age where i can compare it definitely has the feel good factor of the first 'Rocky; films, But instead of cheering on 'Stallone' a guy, this time i was cheering and throwing punches with a Robot and i totally bought it, Awesome loved it, Will definitely watch it again.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd have to be a snob not to love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are at least two main areas of excellence here, the performances of the two male leads and the depiction of believable robots. Hugh Jackman is a wonderful choice for the unsuspecting father. His performance is a joy to see. He plays an ex-fighter too wrapped up in pursuing his second career to care much about his now motherless son. His second career is also boxing but now with second rate robots in the near future.His son is Dakota Goyo who made me think of Jake Lloyd the young Anakin in Star Wars I though this role at age 11 is far more convincing and enjoyable. Dakota matches Jackman beautifully and the movie would have fizzled without it.But the real cornerstone of this very well crafted film is the robots themselves. They move exactly as you wish the real thing would and never once did I get the feeling they weren't actually there on the set.Is the story itself fairly routine? Maybe if you discount the magic of their having created a believable world from whole cloth in the first go. This film practically screams megahit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but predictable!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an interesting tale of a father and son, trying to find and revive a lost relationship. Set in the midst of a sport-of-the-future, Robot- Boxing; where instead of people, remote controlled robotic-machines fight the battle. The story brings up the trying-hard-loser, Charlie Kenton's (Hugh Jackman) survival saga (or so to say), who once was a professional boxer and now fights in the robot-boxing arenas; has been trying to make it through a troubled relationship with Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly), who happens to be his mechanic and his trainer's daughter. During the early stages of the story Charlie finds out that his ex has passed away, leaving his son, Max (Dakota Goyo) behind who he himself had abandoned as a child. And from there on starts a story, which is very similar something you would've seen in couple of the Stallone movies (namely Over the top and Rocky), with only a slight comic-angle, per se. Though the performances and screenplay turn out as extremely entertaining, especially the fight-sequences. One specific is an outlawed arena where Charlie and Max fight their newly found Robot from a junkyard, against an oaf robot within an outlawed arena. The second-half grips pretty well, but is extremely predictable when portraying the typical David-Goliath battle with an almost-rudimentary twist. Overall, a good watch!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time back in October when it came out. At that time I thought it was a good movie and I hoped it succeeded. Recently I went and saw the movie again at a local Dollar Theater. This time around, when Atom floored Twin Cities, the audience cheered and applauded. It had taken us out of the seats in the little theater and into the ring with them. This is an element that is so lacking in many films today. For the connection this movie makes with it's viewers, I give it a ten. Real Steel is a triumph in every aspect. It is a rare breed of film that can be thoroughly enjoyed by all ages. Without a doubt a must see.</fullReview>

And I laugh to myself, what best action could you get from robots boxing till the death?! I also read where is the Martial arts? As the whole plot explained, it was a ROBOTS BOXING MOVIE, I don't recall Rocky Balboa pulling out a high kick in the rink... The story is good and its not much of a cliché as you could initially think. Come on guys, don't be haters because the world is full of them... I recommend this movie for all of you that want to watch a good movie and feel good after it. For those who are thinking about watching it, don't think, just watch and you can thank me later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed. I thought this kind of entertainment was lost forever, because there are a lot of high budget crap out there. Real Steel has a heart. You can even call it cheesy, but I think it's really not. Yes, it's escapist, pretty much everything is idealized, but it sure helps to turn your switch off for 2 hours and you'll never regret it. The formula this film used is proved not just in Hollywood, but all over the world in folk tales, where the smallest boy succeeds against all odds. The father-son conflict is also gives us something we can identify with (not the selling thing, but the dynamic of the relationship). The robot fighting is the visual treat, which was very well done and gives a film rewatch value. So what's not to like? I think the moral is very important as well, even if you have seen and heard it several times before. It will leave good feelings. I highly recommend Real Steel for all age groups. Stuck up film aesthetes avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel (2011) is a recent creation from director Shaun Levy who has brought us such titles as Big Fat Liar, The Night At The Museum films and more recently Date Night. Levy's 'recent robot release' is a first attempt at a far higher budget film with a far more serious, emotional and complex story line and I honestly was not disappointed as I sat in my cinema seat scribbling on my trusty notepad.Real Steal' story line is based around an intriguing not too distant future of 2020 where human boxing has been rendered obsolete and replaced with lean mean fighting machines that wont be able to stop reminding you of one of Michael Bay's 'Transformer battles' every time they throw down. Robots that could hit harder and take more beatings were the logical next step for a sport slowly corrupted by profits, designed ultimately to give the crowd exactly what they want, "TOTAL VIOLENCE!" I must admit, this is quite a cool concept as such a futuristic sport provides a far more realistic basis for audiences to fantasize about one day watching giant robots duke it out for real, well...at least more real than a giant alien robot disguising itself as a Mack Truck.Charlie Kenton, played by Hugh Jackman is a once semi-professional boxer now washed up low life, hopelessly in debt struggling to keep his head above water amongst a seemingly endless list of debt sharks and people who he owes money.The opening to the film portrays Charlie as a hopeless has-been desperate to make a buck, fighting a remote controlled robot to pay off his debts or be "...beaten within an inch of his life." After he is granted surprise custody of his estranged 11 year old son Max (Dakota Goyo) following the death of Charlie's ex- girlfriend (Max's mother), the crude and careless nature of Jackman's character becomes clearly evident as he begins scheming to exploit money out of his own son. An obvious product placement occurs in the film which runs off this idea as Charlie seems to care not, that his 11 year old son continuously stays up, pulling all night benders on Dr. Pepper. May as well 'plug em' here too right Shaun? *sips can of Dr. Pepper* "Ahhhhhhh Delicious..."I was most impressed with Dakota Goyo's acting in this film having never really recognized him on the silver screen before as he dished out a confident, fresh, authentic and in many places humorous performance for a 12 year old actor working along side celebrity A-lister Hugh Jackman, who's own performance was solid but somewhat predictable in parts. The relationship between Charlie and Max throughout the plot is a familiar father-meets-son structure as the pair's rapport slowly begins to build along the way as metal begins to fly. Evangeline Lilly better known as 'Kate' from Lost plays the supporting female role of Bailey, long time friend and daughter of Charlie's former trainer. Initially, there appeared to be some rough and playful on camera sexual chemistry between Jackman and Lilly. Levy subtly juxtaposes in awkward humor which fits well with this pair's on screen relationship. Sadly this chemistry seemed to fizzle out as the plot continues and the two characters are meant to be falling back in love. I simply wasn't buying it. Rather than a hot and steamy first kiss during an emotional scene on Bailey's balcony, we are presented with a seemingly unintended but extremely awkward performance as the two embrace. I enjoyed seeing Lilly in this film however i feel she deserved a stronger role in the plot.Levy managed to keep me engaged throughout this somewhat familiar story line due to the awesome and well constructed robot fight scenes spotted throughout the film. The addition of the boxing ring, the crowd, commentary and trainers controlling these impressive CGI creations all created a fresh approach to the robot sci-fi blockbuster genre. There are some extremely awesome fight sequences throughout the film so that even a Transformers-hater will be gripping his Malteeser bag too tightly as the carnage ensues. Levy does well in these scenes to humanize the fighting robots to encourage an emotional response during their fights, which seemed to work on me and suspend the feel i was just viewing a movie about Rock Em Sock Em Robots. Whats a boxing movie without a montage? I loved Levy's homage to Avildson's Rocky films and Stallone's training and fight sequences from the 1970s as i enjoyed listening to a catchy rock anthem humming "...Life in the fast lane!" but was it a cliché or a classic at work? I'll leave it to you to decide.My only concern with the robot fights was the endless repetition of the 'bad ass rock' music that instinctively began playing every time one jumped on screen which i found almost as predictable as Charlie begging every next character he meets to hand out a loan. There are also a few noticeably weak points in the script which I must admit, Jackman does very well to cover up with his experience rich and skillful acting. The ending was satisfactory as the plot's conclusion draws attractive parallels to Charlie's boxing past as he gets his 'one last chance at redemption,' however there were many unanswered questions such as the fate of Charlie's son and where he will live that Levy did not address in concluding his film.In Summary, Real Steel was an impressive new addition to kick ass robot films currently out there and offers a thrilling, family friendly October Blockbuster with multiple layers to the themes and plot of the story so few will be disappointed. I give Real Steel 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring despite its solid special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people is comparing the film Real Steel with the classic toy "Rock'em Sock'em Robots", but the truth is that the popular culture has a long history of robot fights, from the entertaining films Robot Jox and Crash and Burn, to the memorable episode from The Twilight Zone titled Steel (mmh...curious), without forgetting the chapters of Futurama which rounded on Bender and its incursions on wrestling. Real Steel surpasses all its predecessors regarding the quality of the special effects...but for the rest, it has such a simple, pre-fabricated and corny screenplay that it was impossible for me to get interested in it.The conflict between father and son looks like director Shawn Levy's favorite formula, because it had already been employed in the tedious Night at the Museum and its atrocious sequel. In that aspect, Real Steel does not offer anything new; the dialogs are painfully weak ("You have been working with robots for such a long time that you ended up becoming into one of them"), the emotions from the human characters are more artificial than the ones from the mechanical boxers, and the moments of the biggest melodrama produce unintentional laughs instead of a lump in the throat. Besides, it was impossible for me to swallow the premise that in 20 or 30 years from now, the robotic technology will advance enough in order to create the fighting machines portrayed in the movie. That looks like a concept taken from the '50s, which ignores the contemporary technology in order to jump to an "alternative" future, more consistent with the TV series The Jetsons than with the digital environment we are living in now. Besides, I never understood whether the robots had a conscience or if they were mere puppets from their "trainers". I guess that screenwriter John Gatins wanted to create a similar friendship between a boy and a robot to the one portrayed in The Iron Giant, but unfortunately without getting himself into science fiction subjects, like the definition of the conscience and the rights of the robots.Hugh Jackman showed talent for bringing realism to characters in a fantastic environment in the films The Fountain, The Prestige, the X-Men trilogy and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. However, his character in Real Steel is so poorly written that he cannot do too much with it. Evangeline Lilly is only used for being a pretty face, and the kid Dakota Gayo brings an adequate performance. However, the main stars of the film are the robots, which were well created by the studio Digital Domain. They might not reach the level of detail portrayed in Transformers, but that does not avoid them from being solid special effects on their own merit.However, the good special effects did not avoid me to find Real Steel pretty boring, mainly because of its weak screenplay and the fact that I did not find the action scenes exciting at all. In conclusion, I do not recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real good movie. Unique and Brimming with Ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is a quirky movie, the trailers make it out to be a science fiction/action movie; the first half an hour of the movie runs like a redemption drama and then again it morphs into a family drama about a boy and his pet robot before ending in a boxing/fighting movie. But, what makes it cohesive and entertaining is that it does it's main attraction of robot boxing superbly where it's brimming with ideas that elevates all it's themes beyond the hum-drum.Although often compared to Transformers, the robots give off a different feel of movement; it's the feel of hydraulics with heavy machine parts that makes robot punches have impact. This makes the robot fighting engaging and full of tension and not a blur of colors and movement with robots doing incredulous things. The movie takes the old boxing ring structure and expertly enact robots as boxers and make everything look fresh and exciting. Max in the movie says, "people want to see something they've never seen before", and if this is true then this movie has that in spades. The shadow feature, that's shown in the trailers, where the robots match the human movements is one great show by itself in the movie.It is one of those movies where the audience will be cheering in the theaters as if they were by the ringside. I highly recommend the movie not just to sci-fi fans but to boxing/sports fans, parents looking for a family drama for their early-teens and people who like dramas. But, most of all I recommend this to people who want to see something they've never seen before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transformers.......eat your heart out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmm.......the last time Spielberg produced a movie involving robots, was 'Transformers'. And by god, do i hate 'Transformers'. The last thing i need is another Michael Bay wanna-be action flick. Hopefully this is anything but.The summer of 2011 was missing a lot of fun with their action. Only on maybe 2 occasions did i walk away from a movie feeling like i had a great ass time. I only wish this came out during the summer time, because it would certainly have made up for the giant gap of fun.Words cannot begin to explain how much fun i had watching this film. It was one of those action movies that made you WANT to be a kid again. Some might call it predictable or cliché'. But it's acting and it's story and it's action tie in so well together that you don't even care. You cannot help but just sit back and enjoy this ride.The story does start off somewhat slow......well, that's what i gathered at least from the people around me. But for me, i saw nothing but character development. A washed up boxer who doesn't have the ability to make a right decision. I mean hell, the guy abandoned his only child, and when the kid finally comes back, he STILL doesn't want anything to do with him. You never see that in a big budget Hollywood flick......especially one with Spielberg's name attached to it.Now here's where a bit of the cliché's fall into place. They find a robot in a pile of garbage, pretty much symbolizing Hugh Jackman's character. He's beat up, and nobody wants anything to do with him. Obviously you know where the story is going to go from here........but like i said before........i didn't care ONE BIT.They did a great job of establishing a certain amount of depth within each of the central characters, sure they did it a cliché' sense. But the acting and direction combined with another amazing score by Danny Elfman really made it shine. I kid you not, i almost cried at the end.........really.......a movie about fighting robots ALMOST made me cry. So to pretty much sum it up......it's a cliché' done right.However, the majority of this movie REALLY had to rely on the fighting. I mean, if it wasn't intense, then all that character depth is just wasted. But rest assured, you easily get your money's worth with the fights. A lot of the elements they used are somewhat stolen from the 'Rocky' series. But then again, so is Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, and i don't see anyone complaining about that game. If you're a big 'Rocky' fan, you'll easily see some of the similarities. But watching robots act them out......it's hard NOT to like. It's intense, it's fun, and it's easily AND obviously the best part of the movie. And trust me, you get TONS of it too.Bottom Line........Like i said before, it's one of those action movies that makes you feel like a kid again. You see, this is what 'Transformers' should've been. Well put together, action packed, heart felt, and just plain fun. This is easily one of THE best movies i've seen all year. It's not artistic with it's action like 'Drive'. It's doesn't have the intelligent depth like 'Planet of the Apes'. It's just plain fun. I only wish it came out during the summer time, because it would've fit in perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Real Steel' is Real Fun with Rocky Robots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BIG DEAL in this Disney movie set in the 2020s is robot-boxing. The idea is adapted from Richard Matheson's 1956 short story "Steel" previously shown on TV as an episode of "The Twilight Zone." Just think of "Rocky" being played by a robot and you are as close to what Real Steel is about as you can get. Besides the novelty of Robot Rocky, there is only the usual estranged dad-and-son storyline with a little uncanny romance thrown in. Considering that this is a Disney film, you can expect to have your heartstrings tugged - and other predictable stuff.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a has-been boxer who now travels the country promoting his tin-can fighter robot. He owes a lot of people money and he finds a way out of his predicament when he gets news that his ex-wife has died in an accident, and he must attend the custody hearing of his son Max (Dakota Goyo, who was last seen in "Thor"). Charlie practically "sells" his son off to his ex-wife's sister (Hope Davis) and her filthy-rich hubby (James Rebhorn) for adoption.For the time being, however, Charlie is stuck with Max who also happens to be a fan of video games and robot boxing. Together, and with the help of Charlie's girlfriend Bailey (Evangeline Lilly), they patch up used robots for tournaments. When they come across an obsolete sparing 'bot named Atom, Max sees potential in it as an underdog droid capable of taking on the top robots in the Real Steel matches."Real Steel" holds thrills for boxing fans because the action is as gruelling and crunching as the human matches. Top that up with realistic-looking effects, we even feel for those boxing machines - just as we have felt for droids like R2D2 and C3PO in the "Star Wars" sagas. Among the human cast, Jackman is in top form as the debt-ridden hustler of a dad who finds a match in his own flesh-and-blood. Indeed, Goyo steals the show as the Dr Pepper-guzzling kid who is highly confident in himself and his abilities. Together, Jackman and Goyo exude fantastic screen chemistry.Lilly (of TV's "Lost") provides the requisite feminine presence as Charlie's long-suffering girlfriend but the relationship poses some disturbing questions for viewers: like, what is a pretty girl like her doing, waiting for a loser like Charlie when she can have any guy she wants? And as can be expected, another winning performance comes from Atom the cute 'junkyard dog' that dances like a butterfly and takes heavy beatings without flinching. Another entertaining family treat from Disney. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Robot that learns to box?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, we've had robots who learn to think (Terminator, I,Robot, Bicentennial Man), a plane that learned to think (EDI) and computer systems who have learned to think (Colossus, SkyNet), so why not a robot who learns to box? At least this one doesn't do the thinking for himself, although since there will be a sequel in 2014, who knows. For now, let's concentrate on the plot: the age old story of a father reuniting with his son. Sure, its been done, but when the acting is good and the story is given a new twist, it will keep you entertained, if not enthralled. Jackman brings his talents to the forefront in this role, a departure from the grizzled Wolverine and the computer hacker in Swordfish, and his performance creates the air of reality in the film. Evangeline Lilly is easy to look at and plays the part of the tomboyish woman brought up around athletes, savvy businesswoman, and neglected love interest well. Dakota Goyo fits the role well, and you feel the emotion when he speaks and looks at Jackman. "What's with those eyes?" While his role is small, using James Rebhorn as the husband of the sister in law who wants custody of Max was an excellent move. I have long admired the ability of this character actor to pull you into the scene. And speaking of character actors, Kevin Durand is quickly becoming one of the more versatile players, doing good guys and bad guys with equal skill. Real Steal is a treat for the family, a film that will entertain and surprise you with its ability to bring you in. Too early to tell if it's a collectible, but you never know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel is the best fight movie since The Original Rocky.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is a heart felt movie that feels like the original Rocky. Note I said Feels like. The premise is simple . Charlie Kenton is a former contender for the Heavyweight Championship his one moment of glory is when he almost took down the number 2 contender for the Title. Boxing loses popularity even UFC and MMA style events lose popularity and becomes outlawed leaving former fighters promoters and managers to invest in fighting robots. Charlie invests in one bad robot after another and gets involved in one bad fight after another. He's in debt and he's barely hanging on. Then his Ex Wife dies and a son he barely remembers comes back in his life. Charlie hands custody over to the boy's only other living relatives his aunt and uncle who ask Charlie to look after the boy for the summer while they go on a trip. Charlie and Max barely get along as Charlie introduces Max to the world of robot boxing. Charlie loses his last robot and as he scavenges for parts in a robot graveyard they discover ATOM a generation 2 sparring robot who Max and Charlie convert to a fighting robot. The rest of the movie does become cliché. ATOM is the little robot who can and he does take them right up to the Heavyweight Championship. Father and son bond. Then something comes along that threatens that Bond and they have one last fight that makes that bond stronger. Hugh Jackman gives one of the best performances he ever has. He comes across as unlikeable charming and he's a conman who's willing to sell his son to his uncle for 50 thousand dollars. He's so selfish and willing to wheel and deal that you wonder if he has a heart of steel. eventually you find that Charlie has a heart and after a lifetime of being hurt and beaten down he's built a shell of steel around himself.It's a shame Jackman was not nominated for any awards because he creates a character so different from any other role he's played. Don't pass this movie by take a chance watch it and be surprised because the movie actually is just as good as Rocky it's got that same vibe and it's got some great action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The exuberant Hugh Jackson robotic slug-fest "Real Steel" punches all the right buttons. Synthesize two classic boxing epics like "Rocky" (1976) and "The Champ" (1931), and you'll have a fair idea what to expect from this feel-good, formulaic, PG-13 rated, fodder about an estranged father and son who rescue a robot from the scrap heap. "Real Steel" takes place in the near future when crowds prefer to watch colossal, cybernetic palookas pummel each other into spare parts. The concept that man can no longer participate in simulated violence via sports is a tantalizing prospect, but "Night at the Museum" director Shawn Levy doesn't preoccupy himself with such lofty ideas. Instead, he focuses primarily on a troubled father and son relationship. Meantime, Levy reminds us that a better human always stands behind every good 20-foot metal behemoth in the ring. Inspired partially by the Marx Toy Company game 'Rock'em Sock'em Robots' marketed in 1964, "Coach Carter" scribe John Gatins also drew on "I Am Legend" sci-fi author Richard Matheson's 1956 short story "Steel." Mind you, this isn't the first time Matheson's tale has been adapted. Lee Marvin played the boxing robot's owner in an episode of Rod Serling's landmark television series "The Twilight Zone." In Matheson's tale as well as the "Twilight Zone" episode, the robot's manager had no son, and he masqueraded as the robot after it malfunctioned before the match. Consequently, Levy and his scenarists have implemented some major changes. Nevertheless, the charisma of the "Real Steel" cast stokes this tearjerker with so much sentiment that you'll shadow box with our hero and tear up as father and son bond. What makes this dramatic is the change that sweeps over our repellent hero makes him sympathetic.Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman of "Swordfish") is a washed-up pugilist who is his own worst enemy. He owes gambling debts to more people than he can remember. Charlie makes bets that he cannot cover with his robot named 'Ambush' because he believes "Ambush" will triumph. Naturally, Charlie has to dodge obnoxious louts, especially Ricky (Kevin Durand of "Legion"), a shady promoter, who lures our hero to a rural country fair. Charlie pits 'Ambush' against Ricky's prize bull Black Thunder. Imagine Charlie's incredulity when Black Thunder pulverizes 'Ambush.' Not only is Charlie out of a bot, but also he owes Ricky $20-thousand that he doesn't have. If things weren't appalling enough for him, Charlie must contend with another problem in the person of his 11-year old son Max (Dakota Goyo of "Thor"), who he walked out on when he split from his wife. Max lives to play video games and chug Dr. Pepper. Yes, "Real Steel" features some of the most blatant product placement in a long time. Irresponsible as Charlie is, the former heavyweight is prepared to sign away custody of Max to the latter's Aunt Debra (Hope Davis of "Arlington Road") and Uncle Marvin (James Rebhorn of "Independence Day"), but only for a price. Charlie negotiates with Marvin for $100-thousand, with half of the loot up front. The catch is Charlie must take care of Max for three months, while Marvin and Debra enjoy a second honeymoon. Initially, neither Charlie nor Max has much use for each other. Charlie squanders Marvin's cash on a second-hand World Robot Boxing league automaton, 'Noisy Boy,' who predictably gets the robotics beaten out of him by another bot called 'Midas.' Charlie tucks his tail between his legs along with 'Noisy Boy's' remains, and Max and he slink away. Later, they sneak into a robot junkyard which Charlie plans to plunder for anything worthwhile. During their search, Max literally stumbles upon a Generation 2 robot named Atom that saves his life when the youth staggers off a ledge. Reluctantly, Charlie helps Max unearth what is nothing more than a sparring robot. Actually, this bot bears an amazing resemblance to "Star Wars" bots on planet Tatooine. Our protagonists cannibalize 'Noisy Boy' and convert the scrap-heap android into a contender. Actually, Atom emerges as a "Rocky" type because it can absorb as much punishment as a sadomasochistic maniac. After Atom wins several bouts that nobody thought it would survive, Max challenges the WRB's undefeated champ Zeus. This sinister black android is the property of a wealthy Russian babe, Farra Lemkova (Olga Fonda of "Little Fockers"), and an arrogant Japanese designer, Tak Mashido (Karl Yune of "Freezerburn"), who abhor having terms dictated to them. Initially, they ignore Max's challenge, but pressure forces them to cave. During the big fight, Atom is battered so badly that our heroes cannot communicate with him, so they have to fall back on visual communication. Literally, Charlie must show the underdog bot when and where to land his blows.The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Dakota Goyo is so genuine that you believe they are father and son. Not since Mickey Rourke played a similar role in "The Wrestler" has a hero risen from the depths of degeneracy. Basically, Charlie deserves everything rotten that wrecks his life until he meets Max. Indeed, the last thing our hard-bitten hero learns is that he is a sucker for his long lost son. Of course, anybody who has seen this kind of melodramatic nonsense knows that it is strictly formula from fade-in to fade-out: father finds son, father loses son, father wins son back. Atom brings these two together for a common cause, and they respect each other as equals while they struggle to make their bot the best. Surprisingly, the Generation 2 robot that they rebuild as they rebuild their own relationship never acquires sentience. In one scene, Atom seems to recognize itself as it gazes into a mirror, but Levy does nothing with this subplot. Meantime, he gives the romance between Evangeline Lilly and Jackman the short shrift because "Real Steel" concentrates on Charlie, Max, and Atom. Kevin Durand stands out as the villainous Rick. "Real Steel" will keep you rooting throughout its exhilarating 127 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie Kenton(Hugh Jackman)is a former boxer who went pro for a second and then retired and started fighting robots to make money, it seems like he owes everyone money and his latest fight didn't pan out as hit bot got crushed into little pieces. Right around this time an attorney comes to see him and tells him that his son is up for grabs as his mother died and he has to come to his court date to decide custody, he comes reluctantly and tries to sign over his son as soon as possible only to then realize that the family he is going it is wealthy and makes a back room deal with the father to take the son for the summer for $50,000 and receive the another $50,000 when they get back. As the story goes on they find fights and more bots and bond over the experience and I wont spoil the rest but its pretty good.This movie has all the key elements to making a good movie, good acting, a great story line, some personal touches, and a decent amount of CGI. I have to bring this up because the second I got done watching, something felt very familiar, and then it dawned on me, this movie was a combination of 2 other movies. Granted it was put together brilliantly but still if any of you have ever seen "rocky" and "over the top" you can appreciate that this movie was a perfect combination of the 2. So I have to say the director might have been watching a Stallone marathon one day and it hit him if he combines those 2 and throws in a robot it would make the perfect movie. Yes it did work the movie is a great success not to take anything away from it but the plots are very much like those 2 movies. 9/10 almost perfect except for the virtually unoriginal storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes You Can! Quite a positive statement that is being thrashed around within the service industry and the self-help books of today. Inspiration is the mother of all success in my personal experience. There is nothing stronger than the heart of a fighter. Commandeering the box office at an estimated $ 27.3 million in its opening week and knocking out ROCKY IV from the top spot at opening weekends in boxing movie history REAL STEEL changes the game of boxing as we know it. 127 minutes of REAL STEEL clashing at its hardest against the X MEN main man Wolverine without the adamantium. A movie that is true to its teaser campaigns, a movie that will move you and inspire you and even draw a tear. It certainly did make me cry and I am moved by the emotional plot that I forced to avoid purely to protect my manhood; yet I succumbed.Charlie Kenton a boxer by background is into robot boxing however is unable to catch a break. Loss seem to be following him where ever he goes and all his robot fighters end up being sold as scrap metal after being torn to shreds buy his opponents. Charlie who is irresponsible and callous in nature sees an opportunity in the death of his ex-wife to make some money by making a deal over the custody of his own son Max just so that he can find enough money to buy a new robot fighter. This does not give us quite the good image of Charlie being a responsible father does it? Much like Wolverine, stubborn at the core Charlie meets his match in his own son Max who ends up with him during the summer as a result of $ 50,000 business deal made over the custody. Father and Son reunited after 11 years as a result of the death of the mother and also as a partial business deal is not something that young Max does take lightly, after all Max is like his father ; Stubborn to the core. Losing all his money over one night in a fight, Charlie and Max rummage an old scrap yard stumbling upon a G2 robot that is built to take a hit but not to deliver one. Max who takes ownership for the robot cleans him up and asks Charlie to set him up with a fight. Hugh Jackmans' most successful role out of the X MEN franchise and VAN HELSING, it's quite appealing to see him fit into the role of Charlie and not carry any of Wolverine along with him. Most actors of Hollywood find it hard to shed off roles that are imprinted with their names. Daniel Craig, Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are few people who will always be linked as Bond, Torreto and Connor. I am still awaiting the fate of young actor Daniel Radcliffe who will find it a challenge to shed of the Harry Potter that will hang on him for a long time. Why do you think Prime Time actors/actresses find it hard to make it to the big screens once they have done like 5 seasons on prime time. My point is that Hugh Jackman pulls this off and I didn't see him one bit as a Wolverine despite his characters stubborn arrogant nature which is required to the plot. The heartbreaker indeed is 12 year old Canadian Dakota Goyo. Indeed with a little bit Justin Beiber hanging in his hair this young guy brings the REAL into REAL STEEL. The chemistry between the father and son and bonding makes this movie different; it does take time to grow on you, yet it certainly will. Evangeline Lily who plays Bailey; Charlie's girl friend is indeed a vital character although her presence may be overshadowed with all the action of metal clashing on metal. Without Bailey I feel Charlie will never connect with Max and the beautiful Evangeline Lily delivers this gracefully yet with a touch of Kate from the Prime Time show LOST. Yet another example of how roles are imprinted into the celebrities. (If you have not watched LOST; it is high time you did).Once segmented by me as a director of comedy; I would like to retract my statement about the man behind the camera; Shawn Levy. With some great comedies to his name today he proves that he can also make you cry and he also knows how to put up a fight. Micheal Bay and Ridley Scott have been my favorites as of a decade and today Shawn Levy makes the cut.Title: Real Steel Directed by: Shawn Levy Starring: Hugh Jackman, Dakota Goyo &amp; Evangeline Lilly Rated: PG13 Rating: 08/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rocky has always been my ultimate en-lifting movie, while I always relate Shawshank Redemption to hope, Rocky is a perfect underdog movie and the ending, simply another higher note that winning is not everything...Well, why I am discussing Rocky here, the reason:I walked into the theater thinking what websites and previews made us think, that this will be a simple ROBOT Boxing movie with non-stop action, well but when the story started rolling, it was much more than that, the movie is reminiscent of Rocky as per themes of courage, and finding subtlety in love, I will list similarities to prove my point:The Character of Hugh Jackman is shown to have a total knockout record as Rocky had..The Charlie Kenton character is as failure in life as Rocky was, while Rocky found patience and conviction in Talia Shire, Charlie finds it in his son..The whole theme of boxing giant facing a minnow as a publicity stunt..The most relating point is the ending, if Stallone didn't do that ending in 1974, this wouldn't have done now, the result when the main hero loses but shows courage just flash-backed Rocky in my mind as credits rolled..Still despite the facts, this movie is not a copycat, it has a soul of its own, the direction and action are mingled perfectly, CGI is top notch and not over done like GREEN LANTERN did..Hugh Jackman pulls of a powerful performance and his chemistry with Dakota Goyo is top notch..Evangeline Lilly had to look cute, and she really does..The theater was dead silent in the final fight and there was great applause as the movie ended, Shawn Levy didn't over-stuff us with a senseless robotic plot, instead sometimes a director knows his work and what audience need, the picture struck the right bells...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can actually predict the film's ending right off the bat: lead character is down in the dumps:alcohol abuse and gets a chance to redeem himself before hitting rock bottom. Finds out he has a kid and remembers his own qualities that had gotten him to the top back when people used to fight people. They learn and grow together as father and son while overcoming obstacles together. Insert Rocky IV ending.The movie does pay tribute to Rock em sock em robots and the music appeals to the younger crowd featuring Eminem.What stands out in the movie are the "moments" which the actors portrayed quite well. The acting in this movie was very convincing and drew in the audience to keep the movie flowing. The only part of the movie that another poster had brought out was that there was less technical input from Haley. She plays the stereotypical supportive female role that Hollywood seems to perpetuate rather than empower. I think that if there was more character development on her end: maybe have her include some refinishing touches to Atom before the final fight then I would have been satisfied with all of the characters fitting in with the movie.all in all: 6/10 but the acting gave it an extra point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action Packed, intense - CGI Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's what our 13-year-old, Daniel Menegaz has to say about this movie: "Real Steel" is the action packed, intense movie about Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) a robot boxer that could use some money at the current moment, who spends the summer with his 11-year-old kid Max Kenton (Dakota Doyo). When the two have no luck with a fantastic robot, they go to the junkyard looking for parts, and Max finds an old sparring bot that turns out to be a force to be reckoned with. I though the movie was very entertaining. The CGI really made the robots and the sets come to life. I also thought that the acting was good. The disbanded relationship between Charlie and Max was not only well acted, but provides some well-placed comic relief from the fight sequences. Although a great movie, it does have some violence. Even though the robot fights aren't gory, the fighting is some replicable behavior that little kids could bring home. I recommend "Real Steel" for kids 13 and up, and it deserves a 4 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Daniel Menengaz age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

		<fullReview>I remember reading a review of the Movie "Speed Racer" but the reviewer acted like he was expecting to see "Citizen Cane". Get real people, this movie is boxing robots. If you go expecting boxing robots, you'll have a great time. If you go expecting "Citizen Cane", then you are in idiot.Some critic implied that it was too predictable, but aren't all movies pretty predictable? I mean, did you go to "Rocky" expecting Rocky to lose? Did you go to "Titanic" and not know the boat was going down? Did you see "Harry Potter" and not realize that Voldemort would get his butt handed to him on a stick? This was a very engaging and emotionally compelling movie, one that I thoroughly enjoyed even for the considerable theater ticket price. Well acted, funny, and touching, and when the climactic scene finally comes, I was as emotionally invested in the outcome as I was when Rocky stepped into the ring.If you want a good time at the movies, then this movie is well worth seeing, just don't go expecting a remake of "Citizen Cane". Though I can't imagine who would be foolish enough to remake that movie.Steve B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hey, we got any fans of Robot-boxing in the house" When Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen hit theaters, many people started talking trash about. Aside from trashing one of the greatest action movies ever made, they accused Hollywood of resorting to using giant, fighting robots to draw crowds in. In the case of Real Steal, you could also say that. I just came back from this movie and it was much better than I expected.I was very weary going into this film. I was expecting more of a drama about self-courage and a reclaiming the top type of story. I wasn't expecting a whole lot of actual fighting; HOWEVER, it delivers. The movie does start of kinda of slow but picks up when they discover Atom. I also must say that the Max character steals the show; and for anybody unsure of this film, you get a little bit of everything. You get drama, you get comedy, you get action, you get a little bit of romance. And best of all: you get to see four solid fights. Of all the things that I enjoyed about this film; it does have two solid drawbacks. First: the sport revolves around boxing and I'm not a fan of boxing. It's a pretty talentless sport. Second: the ending is more than disappointing, it's straight crap. Withough giving anything away, all I'm going to say about the ending is that it's really not what you'd expect which is what makes it crap Overall, it's a great action movie for the whole family</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman is Charlie a former boxer controlling robots to win money. however he has lost most fights, in debt to other people and his ex girlfriend that had Charlie's son has died. Charlie doesn't want any part of his own son but the aunt and uncle are rich and going on a trip for three months. the uncle asks Charlie if he will take his son for three months. Charlie wants 100,000 dollars. the uncle accepts and Charlie takes his son. they soon grow a relationship together and start to have feelings for one another like father and son should have. this is all by discovering a robot that saves Charlie's sons life. his name is atom and the kid insists that he needs a fight. Charlie reluctantly agrees and atom is a huge hit and can take hits and dish them out. this is an emotional story about love, friendship and success. Hugh Jackman brings in a solid performance as Charlie given that his roles since 2000 have mostly been in the xmen franchise, he trying to bring change to his roles and try to put himself out there as a versatile actor. he is a great actor. in fact everyone brings in a great performance and this movie is full of great acting and emotion. now i know why they are making real steel 2, because they knew everyone would love this one. see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel is nice fun. It has charm, heart, and is very care-free. It has a nice story and is just a nice movie. There really isn't anything to complain about really. Just a fun flick. What's more to say? The robots are great and the characters are neat too. Its a nice father-son story. Real Steel ain't a masterpiece but why complain? Maybe some things may bother you. Like, I noticed a bit of product placement, but that just makes the movie feel a bit more real and there isn't anything wrong with that, even if there are 12 foot robots. Real Steel is a nice, fun movie and the cast do a great job too. I say, go check it out. Bring some friends for some extra fun.On an A to F scale I give Real Steel, a B.Or for the sake of IMDb, an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real Steel.It doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is. Purely a guilty pleasure. I felt like decades ago when I was a kid watching undemanding celluloid. No deep thought required. &nbsp;No complex plots to follow. &nbsp;No intricate twists. &nbsp;Just a fun, feel good movie. More human relationship stuff than Transformers. A lot more cool special effects than The Champ. The robots were hyper realistic and surprisingly varied. Very creative. The soundtrack, which in any other situation I would have found distracting, worked so well with the on screen action that a found myself tapping/stomping my feet through most fight scenes.I really like Hugh Jackman in this. Very real. Very human. And very funny (at times). Obviously folks will talk about the kid with the big blue eyes. And he did a fantastic job at playing an 11 year old with a 40 year old's heart. Witty, tough, yet still vulnerable. I think a good role model for kids who see this. But Jackman belies the "never work with children or animals" saw. He's strong and affecting and definitely holds his own against the young heart throb.Certainly the robot boxing is too violent and painful for really young children. But the surprisingly low quantity of foul language and total lack of sex makes this a rare action movie these days that I think can be seen by preteens.It's certainly not going to be anyone's movie of the year. But sometimes it's okay to just be entertained.A simple joy. I smiled the whole way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>!!Spoilers Ahead!!You have GOT to go see this movie!! That's the bottom line. Other reviewers have covered the details well. But if you only think of the movie as Rocky meets The Champ meets Transformers then you're missing the point. The point is it's a fun-warm-feel-good-ride. It will remind you why you love going to movies.I'll admit that the story which is set in the 'not so distant future' is so-so and predictable but Hugh Jackman delivers some great stuff and the kid, Dakoto Goyo, is so adorable and a good little actor. Kevin Durand once again proves he is to 'go to' guy for the requisite dirt bag and turns in quite the credible Texas accent. The robots...y'all the robots are where this movie soars! The CGI is great and the animatronics blend seamlessly with it. Sure, there are a few plot holes and it does stretch the bonds of plausibility several times...but the movie works despite all that. You will cheer for the underdog. You will shed a tear(come on you know you will) at the big smackdown at the end. The movie satisfies on several levels. I am sooooo rooting for this to produce a sequel!! I want to know what happens next with Atom. So....why are you still sitting there reading this review?? Go see the movie.

		<shortDescription>After lasting several rounds with clichés, most judges will declare 'Real Steel' the winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never underestimate robot boxing. Despite reaching for nearly every cliché in the family- oriented sports underdog drama handbook short of titling the film "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots," DreamWorks delivers a undeniable crowd-pleaser with "Real Steel."Just as Hugh Jackman's Charlie tells his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) as they train a rusted-up sparring robot to be a champion boxer, it's all about putting on a show for the people and that's exactly what "Real Steel" does. For better or worse, robot boxing is cool, cool enough that should it ever cross into the non-fictional world, people will pay to see it, just as they will to see this movie.In championing old-school sports movie values with a contemporary video-game-like twist, "Real Steel" is a 9-to-12-year-old boy's fantasy and one that dads won't mind taking their kids to see. Other than a script that tosses around the word "ass" like it's the new way of saying "cool" (or as if the MPAA finally gave PG-13 movies permission to use it), there's a good heart and moral to the story.In the not-too-distant future, former boxer Charlie Kenton trains ton-sized robots to fight in the ring for a living, only he's constantly running up a sizable tab as his bets don't usually pay off or up. When he learns his ex has died and custody of their 11-year-old son has defaulted to him, Charlie strikes a deal with the boy's rich uncle to sign custody over to his family for enough money to buy a new bot, but it also entails Max staying with his "dad" for the summer. As it turns out, Max is a bit of a robot boxing fan with twice the stubborn charisma of his father. Together they uncover an old bot in a junkyard named Atom who helps them put aside their ill will and get back in the gameYes, "Real Steel" is 100 percent cookie cutter ? an old blind hound could sniff out what's coming next ? but when sports montage comes to uplifting Danny Elfman score, a cookie cutter still makes cookies. In this case we're talking giant-sized robot cookies, and it's that shape that makes all the difference.The likable qualities of "Real Steel" all come down to presentation, from the unique premise of robot boxing (ok, unique enough) to the charm of the lead actors to director Shawn Levy's sound and instinctive storytelling style. Jackman and former "Lost" star Evangeline Lilly try to create a chemistry from a subplot that's barely accounted for (her dad trained him, they've always been sort of on-again-off-again), but they make it work, mostly because they're beautiful people with a decent measure of likability and talent.Levy makes the whole mold come together with an eye for what casual moviegoers like most and the presence of mind to know just when to say stop so that the script's pouring of sap doesn't make the whole thing soggy.The robots though, they steal the show. (I initially typed "steel," which I thought was worth mentioning.) If I had at least 15 fewer years I'd already be out buying my Atom and Zeus action figures ? maybe Noisy Boy too. The bots are well-conceived and expertly branded with unique names and appearances.Speaking of branding, product placement runs rampant in this film. Max downs three Dr. Peppers before teaching Atom some dance moves, the robots are controlled by HP hologram computers and ads in the boxing arena rep XBox 720. If that kind of excess turns you off in a film, well, it's not like you could call it surprising.The heart comes from the father-son relationship, which evolves over time after starting out maddeningly immature. Charlie treats Max as a mere pawn at first and Max oversteps his boundaries as an 11-year-old. The script puts them on equal footing: Son seems to know just as much as father and youthful optimism seems a force as powerful as logic. Of course the optimism wins; we're at the movies after all. Hope could definitely last five rounds in the ring against even the fiercest robot."Real Steel" can be counted among the rare films that offer an argument for the perpetuation of the Hollywood machine, but if all formulaic movies could handle the characters this well it wouldn't matter. Truth is, it's as easy to despise the movie in principle as it is to just enjoy it at face value ? provided you dig giant fighting robots.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is nothing special. Jackman is a deadbeat dad, Goyo dislikes his father for abandoning him and then selling him to his uncle, they find robot, train robot, underdog wins a lot, then they get separated when the aunt and uncle come back. At the end, the kid and Jackman get to fight the robot boxing champion, Zeus, in a championship match (the Real Steel). They lose, but only by technicality from the judges. The people see their robot as the winner, and the match actually ended tied to begin with anyway. Nothing at all special. Don't get me wrong though, they tell it competently and rather well. Overall, the plot on it's own (even with some bits I didn't mention to not give away the whole movie) gets a 6/10. The reason I give a 9, is because the actions scenes are beyond amazing. I'm not one for boxing or wrestling, I much prefer martial arts like Karate or Judo or sword fighting like Kendo, but the boxing scenes are really the best part of the movie. Honeslty, I got really into these scenes. If you go and see this, remember to turn off you brain and enjoy robots beating each other up. The joke about this being "Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots" does not do this movie justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie expecting nothing, and it was well worth the money I spent!Like so many great movies (Battle for Los Angeles comes to mind) this movie is underrated by many critics with no imagination , this movie was great, the story revolves around a dead beat dad who through the bot fights, learns to fight for what is important, his son. Although I am not a smarmy critic, everyone (self included) in the theater was cheering during the entire movie. For a movie to cause that must mean they are doing something right. Now while some think the formula is overplayed, it is well performed, and unique enough to really get you going. This movie is a real sleeper hit. While it may not appeal to all, it definitely is a movie with some heart to it. Which I in all my non- elitist glory recommend to us normal folk who just downright enjoy something entertaining and heart warming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A nice effort from sh-awn levy.. A worthy movie to watch in theatre.. The end was a good one since it shows something realistic.. While coming to characters Dakota Goyo outperformed Hugh Jackman..lol Real Steel comes from director Shawn Levy, whose entire niche is family friendly fare. As for story, this is a movie about family bonding more so than robotics, the sweet science, or training. It hinges on Hugh and Dakota so that's it's simply not a collection of brawls. The two get along fine, and though Max is written like the father figure many will take relief in his maturity. Real Steel has a plot that's aimed right at the kiddos with easy to distinguish good and bad figures. Of course the ice-cold Russian-Japanese duo behind the reigning champ Zeus don't have relatable family struggles to put them in a gray area.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome! This movie far exceeded my expectations! A must see movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed an advanced IMAX screening of this movie tonight with my wife and 2 kids (10 &amp; 7). I went into this movie with the expectation of seeing maybe a 7 and ended up seeing a 10. I was absolutely amazed at how great this movie was put together. This was truly a great movie. The characters, acting, and plot were all done very well. The ways the characters interact with one another seemed very genuine and they somehow even find a way to give the main robot Atom a personality you'll love. This movie has drama, humor, a lot of action and maybe even a little suspense. There are a few words that some parents may feel are unacceptable for younger children but overall I felt comfortable letting my 7 year old see it. There was nothing too over the top language-wise in my opinion. Also, this is the first movie I've ever been to where a good amount of people in the theater applauded with excitement during 2-3 scenes and also when the movie ended. You can always tell a really good movie by the smiles on peoples' faces and by listening to people discuss their favorite parts as they exit and there was definitely a lot of that afterward. All of the robot animation and fight scenes were very realistic and not cheesy looking at all. This is a great movie for a family night out, a date, group of friends or just about anything else I can think of. It also has some great life lessons and self reflection aspects as well. I cannot honestly say for certain if I would have seen this movie in theaters had I not received free tickets but after seeing it, I know it would have been well worth paying the money to see it, especially in IMAX!! Really the only opportunity I think this movie had to be better would have been to have filmed it in IMAX 3D. That would have been awesome. I highly recommend if you are thinking about seeing this movie or are not 100% sure, GO SEE IT!!! You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Honest Evaluation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is an USA production with starpower--Jackman "hugh" Wolverine and others--and very fine animation for the cartoon characters who co-inhabit the screen with the live stars. While not up to the standards of a movie like "SPACE JAM," Shawn Levy's production does have some nice touches, such as Dan Gilroy, the creator of Master Battlebots, interacting with the characters he created. The movie even shows Mr. Gilroy drawing a cartoon using both his right and left hands, almost at the same time. As for the story, it could be better. Still, the animation is fine and former model Natalie Maines looks great with that new nose job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real steel was a real pleasure to watch....On a candid note, am no lover of fights ,action or adventure films but this flick caught my attention the main reason being " Hugh Jackman" and that was only till i walked into the theatre. . Its a very simple story of a father son bonding over their common love for robots .Jackman as Charlie was under utilised but he put up a decent show and thats good news for his fans like me. The kid Dakota Goyo as Max is definitely shown at his best. "Atom",the robot is the soul of the film and he definitely steals the show.I would love to watch this flick again especially for him. No hotties like megan fox or rather destructive action sequences like transformers series but defined fighting in a ring between robots through advanced technology is worth watching here. No one can imagine robots could be so much fun,especially when they dance and i found it really cute. . Its an old wine in a new bottle to be precise but i was pleasantly surprised by so many elements in it.Go watch it if you are an ardent admirer of Hugh Jackman and love Robots....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm quite a fan of Hugh Jackman (The Fountain main) and I was looking forward to seeing this movie since. The movie was amazing.Story was pretty decent, acting was phenomenal, special effects were OUTSTANDING and everything just clicked in. It wasn't lacking anything; action was there, drama was there, comedy was there, romance was there ... from minute one to 127 it kept me glued to the screen, holding my breath at robot fights and laughing even at the smallest of jokes. What I liked the most was a chemistry between all characters; Charlie, Max and Bailey and each and every other character in the movie. They all brought the core of their characters to screen and blew our minds with their performances. I must say that I didn't expect this movie to be this good. My expectations were high for special effects and Hugh's acting, but what this movie brought was more than just that.Recommended for watching : it should be first on your non-watched movies of 2011 because it stands out by it's greatness and pure mind-blowing performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michigan Gov. Snyder plans new site for REAL STEEL 3</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nice to be able to write about a wonderful family movie for once. Perhaps the best dance movie since DANCES WITH WOLVES, this flick easily could be subtitled A BOY AND HIS ROBOT to perhaps better reflect the dance-inspired bond between Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo) and his bot, Adam. More believable than the original ROCKY (particularly because Adam is more expressive than Sylvester Stallone ever was), REAL STEEL offers the added bonus of featuring loads of authentically gritty Michigan locations. (Though most of the action is set in Texas, that state was considered too Disneyland to accurately reflect the darker elements of the REAL STEEL story.) As refreshing as it is to not see Toronto suburbs once again posing a pale imitation of America, Michigan's newbie Gov. Snyder and his legislative cohorts have an even BETTER location planned for REAL STEEL 3 (most likely a 2017 release, depending upon when X-MEN 13 is shot). Snyder has eliminated 75% of Michigan's mine inspectors, while encouraging a ten-fold expansion in mining. The tentative REAL STEEL 3 site will be near Big Bay in the state's Upper Peninsula. Snyder feels Eagle Mine--America's first-ever large-scale nickel mine--will far outdo the treeless nickel-mining region around Sudbury, ON as the perfect place for shooting the distopian and apocalyptic films of the future. Tunneling just under the famous Salmon Trout River near the shores of Lake Superior, Eagle Mine will have the potential to easily outdo Love Canal and Three Mile Island in becoming synonymous with large-scale environmental disaster. By 2016 the ghost forests, abandoned tourist towns, decaying hunting lodges, and thick pall of never-sunlit smelter smoke will save the producers of REAL STEEL 3 95% of the CGI budget for their 2011 offering. If AVATAR 3 takes its expected dark turn, or if they make another Mad Max sequel, Michigan Gov. Snyder has insured that Hollywood will have no need whatsoever for costly digital matte painters to portray Armageddon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Machines Don't Have A Soul... That's Why Their Box Is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could be even better with a sequel. Just a few movies deserve it, but ?this year? I've found out that Real Steel 2 is the only sequel I strongly wish it turns to be a franchise.I wasn't this intrigued by any other movie, and I don't think anyone else in the theatre had. Of course, that's what happens when big strong colorful metallic boxers come all together in an unrealistic arena in a not so far future.This is the kind of productions Spielberg needs to support ?was it a sound editing nod over there? ?. Impressive rounds of fighting robots, a funny dancing guy, and a plot--- A faulty boxer-promoter is paid to take care of his own obsessive, idealistic and videogames-expert son for a couple of weeks, while he tries so desperately to attend his dying career as a box-promoter to save himself and the familiar busyness he helped to destroy. And while he ruins it one again and was trying to fix it, he almost lost his own son? almost, 'cause, odd enough, his son is saved by an entire short, old aged robot named "Atom", who was discarded and thrown away to a landfill. Full of gratitude, the kid recovers the machine and takes it with him, restores it and intends to introduce it to the boxing world. He soon would find out that his new friend as a big potential, but the only way it would make it to the top is if his father accedes to train it and promote it, forcing him out of the retirement as a ?human?boxer and as a looser as well, giving him some hope as a promoter, as a father and a human being.It is not so hard, you see? And, if the plot doesn't work (it did for me), the action, the visuals, the editing and sound will. And, you know what? It leaves room for a sequel.There is some kind of Pokemón air in all that stuff of giving orders to a fighter, but it changes drastically at the very glorious ending, when the orders are not an option anymore.I had to force a friend to take me to this movie, and now I'm the one who's forcing him to stop hitting me with the piston combination. That is what I was talking about when I said "excitement". I thought many felt it when Rocky was defeating Apollo. That's what happens when you care about a character, the way you care about the main robot of this story, Atom.With any luck, this would become a franchise, and lucky enough, a good franchise. At least, there goes a good start for any trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rock 'em Sock 'em Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>REAL STEEL is rock 'em sock 'em awesome! It empowers, entertains, and excites you. One of the best crowd-pleasing, feel-good movies of the year. Watch out for Dakota Goyo, this kid is going' places! What a bag of talents for such a young age. Hugh Jackman delivers his most powerful performance yet. Director Shawn Levy got himself a winner in REAL STEEL because this movie's got energy to spare for the next century with its relatable underdog story complimented with father-son relationship that goes straight for the heart. Not to mention the robots look absolutely fascinating, the fight sequences are pulse pounding and incredible. If you ever wondered what the classy movie Rocky would be like if it were about a bunch of boxing robots, I highly recommend watching REAL STEEL..I wanna talk about the robots first. Man, even the word 'awesome' doesn't fairly describe how cool Noisy Boy, Atom, Midas, Zeus and the whole gang look, my goodness! And I'm glad the production didn't go entirely CG with those bots, they hired the creative shop owned by the legendary FX master John Rosengrant (who worked with the late great Stan Winston for years) to come up with a few great animatronics and it's a brilliant move because the interactions that Goyo's character Max has with Atom are real, you can sense their connection in Goyo's eyes because he didn't have to imagine it or simply look at mark X or anything of the kind. So the combo of those bots and the mo-capture CG handled by some of the best people in the business, result in sequences that will turn you into a believer. When I'm rich someday, I'm gonna see if I could acquire Noisy Boy for my collection in my mansion, perhaps he could act as a greeter whenever a guest enters the front door.The fights in this movie are intense and exciting, there's never a dull moment. Whether it be the underground boxing where the rules don't apply or at the WRB arena where the rules can be bent, the boxing sequences are well choreographed, they don't insult certain audiences who may know boxing techniques by heart. I hope there'd be a sequel. I'm aware that storytelling quality tends to diminish in sequels generally, but I'd rather have director Shawn Levy do this instead of the dreadful Night At The Museum franchise. Whatever keeps him from going back to that damn museum. I think Levy's and screenwriter John Gatin's approach and tone for REAL STEEL are spot on. The father-son story doesn't overpower the boxing scenes and vice versa, it's a nice mix of entertainment and a family drama that's not too dark and not too light eitherJackman is one of those good guys actors, you can't help but like him, he's a likable dude, even when his character is a d*ck, which is why he's perfect for the role of Charlie Kenton. He's somewhat of a loser but part of you wants to see him win. I find it interesting that Charlie's kid Max (Goyo) seems more mature minded than his dad. Charlie is like a kid in an adult body, he's so focused on big toys as long as they make money but when things start to go south, he freaks out instead of continuing to fight. Max never really has his dad even when his dad stands right next to him because Charlie's often got his mind on something else so there's a pivotal moment nearing the final scene where Max sees his dad comes to life for the first time ever and that is the pretty much the whole essential point of REAL STEEL.I'd like to think that exec producer Steven Spielberg may have some contribution to the emphasis of Goyo and the robot Atom because that relationship kinda reminds me of Elliot and E.T. or the kids and Bracchiosaurus in Jurassic Park, at least that's the impression I get. Which is why J.J. Abrams had that scene of the kid standing face to face with the alien in Super 8 because that was something that's so Spielberg-esque. There's a sense of awe that comes with curiosity. Max badly wants Atom, or anybody, to understand him, because his dad certainly doesn't. So the audiences get to wonder if Atom is more than just a robot. It's a nice notion that adds to the story's emotion. Last but not least, I think this movie would not have worked if they'd cast the wrong kid and I'm glad Goyo played Max because Goyo is simply electrifying, his performance is effortless and beyond impressive. That kid needs to continue acting, he needs to make this his career because he's seriously good at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Steel is built to last and solid entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Real Steel is set in the near future, when robot boxing is very popular. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a promoter who has discovered that his long forgotten son is limbo due to the death of his mother. Charlie is not the father type and is more concerned with scoring the next fight rather than being a good dad. The story is very common so far. Introduce the element of robot boxing and the story can be entertaining or verge off into absurdity. Is Real Steel like The Champ with robots or a robot movie with Hugh Jackman? In an odd way, it's neither, but is one of more entertaining and enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. Kenton used to be a great professional fighter, but just never made it to the big leagues. When he's not trolling for fights he's building robots at the boxing gym, owned by Bailey Tallet (Evangeline Lilly), who is also Kenton's sometimes girlfriend. When Kenton agrees to take temporary custody of his 11 year old son Max (Dakota Gayo) the movie takes off. Quite often when a movie introduces the youth character, the child actor will drag down the action and speed of the plot. Real Steel accelerates in action and enjoyment when Max is brought in. That's all the more surprising because Max isn't used in the typical ways that action movies use child characters.Child characters are usually weak and used in a situation where they sneak in or are the cause of problems. If that's not the case then they're bratty, unrealistic or annoying. Rare is the child character that adds to the action movie, without taking away from its enjoyment. Max and Kenton fight some robots, do some father/son bonding, travel the country and end up with a contender that can take them to the robot boxing championship. There are also two minor sub plots about the Kenton/Tallet relationship and who will ultimately take care of Max.Real Steel is an entertaining action/sci-fi movie because it never takes itself too seriously. Robot boxing takes place in the year 2020, so the future isn't too unrealistic with flying cars, just modern enough to be different and believable. There was some CGI in the movie but it was used sparingly. Nineteen 8- foot tall audio-animatronic robots were built so that the human actors had something to act with instead of pure CGI. The fight scenes used motion capture with professional boxers so that the fights would look as real as possible.At one point I was crying and wondering to myself, "Am I really crying during a robot boxing movie?" I attributed the crying to my wife being pregnant and her erratic hormones rubbing off on me. For a movie about robot boxing Real Steel is all heart and makes you care about the characters. It also helps that the characters in the movie don't always win. The movie does end a little cold and abrupt, but has built up so much good will until that point that you're willing to let it slide. Real Steal is a great movie for kids 10 and over, but some of the language is a bit salty. The violence in Real Steel is mostly robot on robot, but there are a couple scenes of human violence. You'll watch Real Steel for your children, but you'll end up enjoying it just as much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember when films that were supposed to entertain did what they set out to do- entertain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No? Me neither.I ask the question, because more often than not, blockbusters, or cheesy b movie or fun concepts seem to be falling under that trap nowadays that I assume was set by the otherwise stellar film Inception, where they tried to be too deep and took themselves seriously. Alright, I'll admit, I'm somewhat lying by answering "no" to the question. We did have the 90s, where film's weren't overly pretentious, where they knew what they weren't anything deep, and just went with it and was fun as a result. The Mummy was one I can name. And now, the first movie in a while to just focus kn being entertaining has come out: Real Steel.I was lucky to catch the film at an advance screening tonight, and even despite being a free screening, I felt like I put my money to good use.The film takes place in 2027 and centers around Charlie Kenton, a burnt out boxer who owes over thousands of dollars in unpaid lost robot fights- robot fights having replaced human boxing. After a fiasco that is the result of losing A match against a bull, he discovers an ex girlfriend who had his son has died, and his rather bratty son is being taken not custody by adoptive parents. The parents are given $100 ,000 for custody and Charlie looks after his bratty son, Max, while the adoptive parents are in Italy.After he loses yet ANOTHER fight, which is surprising considering this robot, Noisyboy, is a world renowned robot, he and Max take to the wrecked robot yard to find pieces to create a new robot, when a fall down a cliff results in finding Atom, a G20 sparring bot. They take the bot home and, despite being a sparring bot, Max believes Atom has true potential. After winning a match at a zoo, they realize Atom's true potential, and climb their way up the ladder, in a series of fights leading to the ultimate fight- a fight against a champion robot named Zeus.Real Steel is pure, unadulterated fun. Not once did I feel bored, or beaten over the head with pretentious "symbolism". I went in with no expectations but just a fun rock em sock em robot movie, and came out feeling good about myself and impressed. The reason I enjoyed this so much is for the fact that It knew it wasn't anything deep. I mean, when you have a movie about fighting robots, you want just that, and it gives you that. This wasn't like Transformers 2 or 3 (though 3 was enjoyable) where they took themselves too seriously, and focused more on humans running around trying to figure out supposed conspiracies than the robot fighting. Sure this has some family drama, which is essential to the plot, so no worries there... But even there, the film doesn't take itself too seriously.The film is a tad predictable, which does kind of detract (but only slightly), as you know how the fights are going to end. That said, the predictability does not prevent the fights from being fun and suspenseful. On the topic of the fights themselves, they are ridiculously well done and shot. Apparently they were done with real boxers wearing motion capture suits, and it shows, the fighting is realistic, fluid and human like. The Twin City fight was probably my favourite in the movie! And the final fight is intense, sure to have many on the edge oft heir seats.In short, Real Steel is proof that movies are able to be enjoyable despite being not overly deep, and furthermore are more enjoyable for not trying to be too deep. It's fun, it's funny, it's heartfelt, and is sure to be a real hit this year, as well as I can see a well deserved cult following in this film's future! Don't miss out on it.OVERALL: 9/10PROS: Real Steel is safe, clean fun with lots of exciting robot action, laughs, thrills and heart and doesn't take itself too seriously or try to be too deep. Oh, and you will wish robot boxing existed, so you can buy tickets every weekend!CONS: Predictability, you can tell how it will end from pretty early on.</fullReview>

I really enjoyed Hugh Jackman, but in the movie as well as a showman, it was all Max, his son. It's definitely clichéd, and a lot of time, you know what's coming, but Star Wars was clichéd too, and it was still a great movie.The violence is not as bad as the rating makes it seem because most of the violence is the robots. There are a couple scenes of Hugh Jackman getting beat up, but that's about it. Take the kids and have a blast. The movie is well-worth your time.

		<fullReview>I went to this movie with apprehension and at first wondered if I had come into the wrong show until I saw Hugh Jackman at the wheel of his truck. I was expecting it to be far into the future but soon found it was in a time similar to ours, the not to distant future. It's a world you can relate to with characters not much different to us. Real Steel was a pleasant surprise and had a Disney feel about it, it's really worth seeing. It has a great story line, interesting characters and great robot fighting scenes. They were well-done and the Robots look so real and you would hardly tell that it was all done by computer simulation. This movie is a heart felt father son story between and ex boxer Hugh Jackman and his son Dakota Goyo. I wouldn't be surprised is there is a sequel and I'd definitely go alone and see it.</fullReview>

He said it was an underdog story and was like Rocky, he was right. It really is like a cross between Rocky and Transformers. It's your typical Disney underdog story, but the special effects were nice and the kid (also played young Thor in Thor) was pretty funny. I really enjoyed it, even though it was predicable, but no one says that just because a movie is predictable doesn't mean it can't be good. It has some cursing, but nothing you wouldn't hear on network TV. It's a good family movie and I have already told all of my friends to check it out.</fullReview>

Straight forward plot which is easy to understand and it is as much about Charlie and Max trying to get to know each other as it is Boxing Robots..The robots are amazing,so good you are not sure when it is them or special Effects I left the Film with tears in my Eyes, its a feel good movie for all the family.Please go and see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with my expectations low. I couldn't believe that anyone would bother to make a Rocky movie about the old Rock'em Sock'em Robots toy. But if you have never seen any of the Rocky movies, or Over the Top, and are prepared to suspend your intellect for two hours, this film can actually be a fairly enjoyable experience. The plot is predictable and most of the characters are little more than archetypes. Two semi-notable exceptions are Dakota Goyo who did a great job for such a young age, and Kevin Durand who is so damn big and goofy that, despite being a "bad guy" in the film he actually lends a lot of levity to an otherwise burdensome plot. There was one aspect of the film that I feel should have been explored in much greater depth that could've lent more originality to the film. Both Charlie (Jackman) and Max (his son) each have a scene where they are face to face with their junkyard fighting-bot "Atom", and they question whether there might be some spark of sentience in there somewhere. I felt that this issue was simply glossed over in the film. If they had explored this in a little greater depth then they could've lent this film some of the futuristic moral-dilemma angst of "I,Robot". But, in the end, what we're left with is a re-hashed movie with a likable-enough cast designed to entertain young boys, men who still remember their younger days, and people recovering from head injuries. I admit that I fall into at least one of those categories, so I left my disbelief at the door and just enjoyed the robot fighting scenes and a handful of laughs. Not bad. Not great, but not bad. An action movie you can bring your kids to.</fullReview>
