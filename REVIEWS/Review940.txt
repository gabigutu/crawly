		<shortDescription>Powerful and moving modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "Three burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a multi-layered story of death, retribution, loneliness, and remembrance. Although it takes place in modern day Texas, its main character Pete Perkins, superbly played by Tommy Lee Jones, seems to be living resolutely in the past. He is determined to seek justice for his best friend's death and forces the guy responsible for to a journey across the borders in Mexico to locate the village of the deceased for a proper burial. This journey will bring forward the stark contrast between the values of two ways of life and the landscape transversed is both geographical and emotional.Modern civilization throughout the film is mainly represented by 4WD cars, sniper rifles, dinners, shopping malls, trailers, and TV-sets incessantly showing soap operas, while the characters revelling into those manifestations are invariably emotionally numb, disaffected people, trapped to a perfunctory life from which they seem unable or unwilling to escape. Concomitantly the values of the old west, based on friendship, loyalty and commitment have ebbed, though they are still existent as embodied by the relationship of Pete with his best friend. Pete is forced to pursue his own sense of justice after being repeatedly scorned by the contemptuous behavior of the authorities towards him and his demand for rightful punishment of the culprit, a cool, violence prone and emotionally detached border-guard.The story is masterly told in a sturdy manner that perfectly serves the complexity of the excellent screenplay by an apposite use of flashbacks and wonderfully shot sequences. All the performances are top notch in their expressive minimalism, greatly contributing to the lasting emotional impact of this outstanding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad and sometimes quirky journey about friendship, loss and regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had the pleasure of seeing this wholly original modern-day American western. Just when you think you have this film's plot pigeon holed it takes you in a different direction. THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA is in part a revenge story, but it's also much more than that. There are no one dimensional characters. As much as you want to hate Barry Pepper's numbed border patrol officer, you can't help but feel sorry for him. And Tommy Lee Jones' Pete will break your heart. He and Pepper have never been better and Jones' direction is natural and subtle. My only problem with the film was sometimes it got a little too quirky for its own good. But for the most part I believed every moment and really cared for these lost characters. It's one of those films that really leaves you thinking about a lot of stuff, from mortality and loss to the very real problems of racism and inhumanity. It's never preachy or self aware and isn't out to impress, it's just telling a story. I highly recommend this movie. It's by far one of the best films I've seen recently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ay, carramba! A diablo of a marketing challenge: a bilingual movie, with an impossible-to-remember title, a story of white trash, Mexican wetbacks (that's the film's language), cruel Border Patrol "cowboys," and Tommy Lee Jones as the director and the uniquely memorable lead character... and a film that's one of the year's best."The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" opens with a somewhat confusing sequence of flashbacks, and for the first half hour, you wish you were watching something more "orderly," but you'll be hooked anyway. For the next hour and a half, however, there is a crescendo of images and situations hitting the viewer over the head, amazing and moving.Taking the corpse of a friend - and his very much alive killer - back to Mexico for a "proper burial" and to mete out justice, Jones' voyage is a quirky, epic adventure, based on the brilliant writing of Guillermo Arriaga (of "21 Grams"), and filmed to perfection by Chris Menges (of "The Killing Fields" and "The Mission").Besides Jones (who won the 2005 Cannes Festival best actor award for this), "3 Burials" features fabulous performances by Barry Pepper ("25 Hours"), Julio Cedillo, and a large group of remarkable supporting actors on both sides of the border.Jones says something in the production notes that could sound arrogant or affected... except that it's true: "Some visual influences have been the kabuki theater, the art of Donald Judd and Dan Flavin, and the films of Akira Kurasawa, Sam Peckinpah, and Jean-Luc Godard." Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a surprise. Directed by Tommy Lee Jones, marking his first time behind the camera, with a screen play by Guillermo Arriaga, this is a film that tells a story about an murder in a troubled border area between the US and Mexico. The film is loosely based on a true story that happened in that part of the country some years ago.Pete Perkins is a decent man. When his ranch hand is killed under mysterious circumstances, Pete jumps into action. Pete wants to take his friend, Melquiades Estrada, across the border to Mexico to make sure he receives the proper burial he deserves. A coyote has lead to the first burial site and the following investigation involves the local sheriff, Belmont, but Pete will have none of that.Pete's investigation leads him to the corrupt border guard Mike Norton. Perkins captures the man and with the body strapped to a horse and his captive in another, Pete begins the long journey to Mexico. He passes the hot land between the two countries in a voyage that will bring Melquiades to his home.The separate narratives at the beginning of the film are somehow confusing and the viewer is advised to pay close attention to it since it has multiple stories going on at a time when we don't know much of what is happening. We get to meet the cruel Norton and his bored wife Lou Ann. It also serve as the way to tell us how Pete and Norton meet.Tommy Lee Jones, with his rugged looks, brings a tremendous presence to his own film. Mr. Jones is a decent man who can't stand the injustice his hired hand suffered as he delves into solving the mystery of Melquiades' death. Barry Pepper is quite good as the nasty Mike Norton, a man who gets much more than what he bargained for. Dwight Yoakam, January Jones and Melissa Leo are seen in minor roles. Julio Cedillo plays the dead man, Melquiades Estrada.Tommy Lee Jones is blessed to be working on his first venture with the great cinematographer Chris Menges. Mr. Menges' take on the scenery is one of the best things in the film. The musical score by Marco Beltrami is also another asset. The editing of Roberto Silvi sets the tone for the early part of the movie."The Three Deaths of Melquiades Estrada" shows us a mature Tommy Lee Jones who has learned his lesson well in front of the camera. Now, working behind, as well as directing himself and his amazing cast, he shows a humongous talent that ought to be seen in future ventures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada(2005) ****Tommy Lee Jones steps up to the plate and takes a big first swing with 'Three Burials.' This is a movie that captures the old Peckinpah-esquire style of the rugged west and combines wonderfully with Guillermo Arriaga's moody and alienated script. This is a film that could have took a political mood and dealt with the issues of border security and the like, but it smartly refrains from doing so and instead focuses sharply on the heart of society itself - people. Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete, a rancher who has few friends with his closest friends being a woman from town, and a man from Mexico. The woman is the wife of a local diner owner, Rachael (Melissa Leo). She also happens to be extremely bored and engages in extramarital affairs. Pete loves her, but she loves her husband. And possibly the sheriff, and possibly Pete. The other emotional connection in Pete's life, the Mexican, is Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), an illegal immigrant who finds work and friendship with Pete. Pete loves him like a son, or a brother, or friend, or a combination of all three. Barry Pepper plays Mike, the new border patrolman in town. He is brutal. Perhaps by nature, or not. He is bored; he passes the time sitting outside of his jeep looking at dirty mags. His wife, Lou Ann (January Jones), is also bored. She feels isolated and separated from her husband. She spends her time at the local diner and befriends Rachael. While she sits at home, her husband, the rookie border patrolman, makes a stupid mistake and tries in vain to hide it. The whole town is bored, even the police and the border guards. They find out, the police find out, and in a small town people talk, but more importantly people listen because they have nothing else to do. Pete finds out about Mike's mistake and sets out to carry out Mel's last wishes and bury him in his home town back in Mexico. The story has its characters and connects them in ways that we don't always suspect they will connect. No one is a cardboard cut out. Even better, no one is simple. Each character is complex and has their own distinct feelings. A major theme is that of alienation. The characters are alienated not only from each other, but from themselves as well. Earlier i stated that he film took the right road and avoids making a blatant political message. The movie still carries a message though. It is a commentary on life and society. The story has parallels to Peckinpah's 'Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia.' It has a very Peckinpah style, and features a man who makes a long journey with a dead body. He cares for it and tries to preserve it, even talks to the body sometimes. The film has some great cinematography as well, and the score suits it perfectly. The acting is wonderful, and I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones has rarely ever been better than he is here. Barry Pepper also gives a solid performance. This is Tommy Lee Jones first directing credit in major film and he knocks this one out of the park. Jones clearly has a strong control of his movie and this should go down in history as one of those rare first time wonders. 4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie not only has some of the best acting I've seen in a while; but also it features a full cast of interesting characters - from the protagonists to random encounters, each one seems... to exist somewhere beyond the screen. Top notch photography, emotionally wrenching, dealing with complex issues of today's society and depicting everything unashamedly, this movie is simply awesome. Every little detail seems to have been worked at, pondered over and hammered out until it was just perfect. Every single character is memorable. Every single shot is beautiful. I could simply find no flaws with it. While some may find the subject of the movie distasteful, I found the manner in which it is approached to be just perfect. There are of course clichés - these are inevitable. But the attention to detail brings this movie to such heights of perfection that you cannot help but twist your face into a satisfying grin while the movie is on, and for much time afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody is beyond redemption...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is for me the film that saved 2005. Written by Guillermo Arriaga, also writer of "Amores Perros" and "21 grams" and the first movie of Tommy Lee Jones as a director (but also lead actor), "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" tells the story of Ranch hand Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) who wants to fulfill the promise he made to his recently deceased Mexican friend by burying him in his hometown in Mexico. The power of this modern western and initiatic journey resides in the complexity of the characters, their depth and their controversial behavior. None of the protagonists are one dimensional; none of them are right or wrong but all of them do right and wrong things. They are not always rational, and most of the time they feel lost. In one word they all appear profoundly human. Build over a chase dynamic fueled with contrasts and paradoxes, the film opposes Wild West landscape and Modern carton built houses, 4WD tracking hunt and horse back journey, fake TV soaps and true friendship but maybe most of all Freedom and Prison. Indeed most if not all characters are trapped in their apathetic lives from which they can't or don't want to escape forcing us to ask ourselves how close is our lives to the spectacle projected in front of our eyes. Melquiades Estrada embodies this possibility of Escape and now that he has been buried 3 times he transcends this Freedom making redemption possible not only through death but also through rebirth, suggesting that nobody is beyond it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The road to redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As if we were being thrown smack in the middle of a Cormac McCarthy novel, &gt;&gt;Three Burials&lt;&lt; powerfully serves up the borderlands milieu through its bipolar texture and tone: both graphic and dreamy, tragic and comical. That fusion is accented by memorable characters and age-old themes: immigration and the Rio Grande; Spanish and English and Spanglish; violence and personal relationships; coyotes and border patrol; a tired waitress with a Chekhovian longing and an inept sheriff with nervous problems; a young, blonde wife terribly out of place, and an aging, rugged cowboy firmly in place (&gt;&gt;Ride the High Country&lt;&lt;, anyone?). Finally, the film centers on a classically picaresque story of personality development through trials and tribulations: Pete (Tommy Lee Jones), on a flashback-laden quest for his own way of justice, dragging along the rapidly disintegrating corpse of his friend, brings about the personal journey of a trigger-happy, macho-racist border patrol officer (played by Barry Pepper) from guilt to redemption... Wonderfully borderlands, comparable to &gt;&gt;Lone Star&lt;&lt;. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>- Strong piece of work from Tommy Lee Jones..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada Directed by Tommy Lee Jones (2005)I have always liked Tommy Lee Jones as an actor. He has made some really great performances in the movies JFK, Heaven &amp; Earth, and The Fugitive. And otherwise he has always been good, although he got some typecast in some stereotype roles. In 1995 he debuted as a director on TV, with the movie The Good Old Boys, which I sadly haven't seen. Now, he has joined some of his famous and acknowledged colleges like Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson, Denzel Washington, and made the step from actor, to actor &amp; director in his own very first motion picture - The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.In this movie, Tommy plays the lead as Pete Perkins, who under some mysterious circumstances, finds out that his best friend has got killed. As a consequence of this, he reacts strong and dramatically, wanting to fulfil his old promise to his, now gone, friend.The script is written by Guillermo Arriaga, and he mixes the characters and the beautiful landscape into an original story, dealing with many subjects. As said before, the movie is beautifully filmed and good edited. Aside from the director, the shooting star ? Barry Pepper ? delivers another very good and solid performance! He is a very good actor, which I hope to see a lot from in the future? All in all a solid, and good piece of movie craft from Tommy Lee Jones, which I know respect more than ever! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless indeed... amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' film about a rancher (Jones) who keeps his promise to his friend and co-worker Melquiades Estrada who wanted to be buried in his homeland in Mexico. The film is slow at times, but gets it point across well, and I believe those instances in the film where not much is going on actually help it in order to put things in perspective for us viewers. The cinematography is artistically beautiful, while the score, screenplay from Guillermo Arriaga (who also appears in the film) and the performancer are first-rate. Amazing how films like this go virtually overlooked in the press and eyes of mainstream American cinema-goers. This film deserves to get all the nomination and award hype that less worthy stuff like Brokeback mountain or even Walk the line have received. This is a true masterpiece from Tommy Lee Jones, who proves hes just as credible in directing as in acting. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee will get better as a director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, but after reading the critics and many of the comments herein, I can't believe I'm the only one with some nits to pick.Strengths ? 1. CINEMATOGRAPHY. If you've ever visited the Southwest, you know that it's difficult to represent accurately on film. Kudos. TTBOME is accurate to the countryside depicted and panoramically beautiful. 2. ACTING. Although Barry Pepper will always be Roger Maris to me, he is easy to hate here and then even easier to be ambivalent about later. Pepper makes a great hostage. Melissa Leo nails the role of Rachel. Nearly everyone else is superb.3. NUANCE. Why make everything in black and white? The world is beautiful with shades of meaning and so is TTBOME.4. THOUGHT PROVOCATION. This isn't a kids'movie, but not for the reasons the rating states. My wife called it a "thinking an's 'Weekend At Bernie's'". You do have to think about a lot of things:a. Roles. Do we like who we are? Do we like what we do? ?where we live? ?what others think of us?b. Racism. Is everyone you meet of Mexican origin undocumented? How about the reverse? Are the bad guys now always the gringos?c. Economics. If it is so beautiful, friendly, peaceful, musical, and well-fed, would so many south of the border risk all they have to come north of the border and "pick strawberries"? On the other hand, if I lived in Van Horn, Texas, I'd be looking to escape to anywhere else. Seriously.d. Endurance. Could you survive this trek? I wouldn't make it 100 yards without shoes.There are other strengths. Refer to the other reviews.Weaknesses ? 1. CHARACTER BUILDING. We are given very little reason to believe that Pete would do this for anyone. We are asked to believe that he is deep, e.g., thousand-yard gazes, fierce loyalty, rugged determination; but also shallow, e.g., dalliance with a married woman, gullibility, disrespect for the law. We may like nuance in a movie, but who is the protagonist? Pete is a weak one, considering the milieu he came out of. If he were a match for the country, we'd be cheering for him like Shane.2. CHRONOLOGY. Stupid! Unnecessary! Contrived! Distracting! Egotistical! Stupid. A poor substitute for character good building.3. LOGIC. a. Lou Ann's relationship with Mike adds nothing to the story. He is central and we already have enough to dislike him.b. Rachel's loyalty to Bob strains at reason. He loyalty to anything is questionable.c. Gomez' willingness to cut a quick deal with Belmont has no history to back it up.d. Why is Rachel able to hear every syllable through glass?e. Lack of conversation between Mike and Pete. If you thought coming clean would buy you your life or even some more time, you'd talk your head off.f. Cincinnati? That hotbed of INS recruitment?4. ACTING. Dwight Yoakam will not be offered leading man roles. He's already found his shtick and this isn't it. Tommy Lee's performance as Pete would benefit from a more seasoned director. Joel Coen comes to mind.5. LENGTH. This could have been over sooner. You especially know that when there are long silences in the commentary version with three good commentators.6. BIZARRE COINCIDENCE. Am I the only one who thinks Cedillo looks like Johnny Damon? Couldn't shake it.7. ROTTING CORPSE. OK, we get it. He's a dead guy.8. CREDIBILITY.a. Snake bites kill. They really, really kill people weakened by travel, forced labor, deprivation, and lack of a hat in the desert.b. Law enforcement is not that venal. Venal, yes?just not THAT venal? or impotent.c. Also, which is it? Sheriff and I.N.S. work together or they don't?d. Sixty grand for a single-wide in Van Horn? Fifty-four? Got to assume that this is prior to the current realty reality.e. Man #1 is shot by Man #2. By wild cinematic coincidence, Man #1 has been indiscreet with the wife of Man #2, but only because Man #3 has induced him to do so? The mind boggles.f. How exactly were three distant cowpokes watching soaps they couldn't understand, with excess food they freely give away?SPOILER. The movie's title gives away the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING - THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING There are some films that you just don't know what to make of at first. The Western ? period or otherwise ? remains the definitive genre for portraying warped morality plays packed with layered themes and dense symbolism, but I found this one more difficult than many. I feel that to appreciate a film I have to get to grips with the leading players' motivations, but in a film where the supposed hero is a lunatic who's blown an unremarkable event up to absurd levels, what am I supposed to do? The answer is to constantly ask questions about the film. The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada offers no particular answers of its own, but it remains accommodating to whichever possibilities you wish to assign it. The lead question, of course, is what has driven Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) to such extreme measures. Whether the attitude of Patrolman Norton (Barry Pepper) ever actually changes is another obvious one. But this is a film on which obvious answers to obvious questions are only going to shed a limited amount of light. Why, for example, the cuts back to the dessicated border town, where the citizens have no way to pass the time except to sit in a diner and smoke, or to have casual sex with people in motel rooms? Most importantly, what would Pete do if Melquiades (Julio Cedillo) had been buried in a pauper's grave having died of a heart attack? In the end I came away very impressed, but still feeling that I'd missed many of the nuances.The first half of the film uses complex chronological fragmentation to give the viewer an immense amount of information in a small space of time, by allowing us (for example) to observe an event knowing what its consequences are going to be. It also disrupts any sense of empathy by not allowing us to watch the characters' emotions progress in a linear fashion; in a sense, these early scenes become semi-independent vignettes. They allow us to identify early on what turns out (retrospectively, to the characters) to be a key scene: a promise that rancher Pete makes to his illegal immigrant labourer Melquiades to take his body home should he die in America. This fateful conversation takes a central role in Pete's motivations when Melquiades is later accidentally shot and killed by pig-headed border patrolman Mike Norton in a moment of carelessness. When Pete learns who killed his friend, and realises that the local police don't plan to do anything about it, he decides to take matters into his own hands.So far so good. But Pete's idea of revenge is anything but simple. It's not enough to gun down Mike, as Mike did Melquiades. Mike must be shriven. He must suffer in the desert. He must realise exactly what he did. As his estranged wife Lou Ann (January Jones) lounges in a diner muttering through her ennui that her husband is "beyond redemption", he is busy atoning for his sins (albeit against his will) by returning the festering corpse of his accidental victim back to his home village. If my use of religious terms seems pretentious, then I'd like to point out that there's a scene where Mike is dunked in a river. Admittedly he's dragged through it by a horse, but I never claimed that allusions have to be airtight. We don't like Mike, but we grow to sympathise with him. He's certainly closer to being redeemed at the end of the film than Lou Ann is. That might just be what drives Pete to his extreme course of action, of kidnapping Mike, digging up Melquiades and carrying them both off on horseback towards Mexico: however insane, at least someone in the town is actually doing something. As such the old man in the desert, begging to be euthanised, becomes a weird, living prophecy of the town's future; he could easily be all that's left of a similarly dead town, in a symbolic sense at least.What takes the film deeper into surrealism is the ending, where it is revealed that Melquiades, to an unknown extent and for unknown reasons, has lied to Pete. The little village of Jiménez, where he wanted to be buried, doesn't exist. The woman he claimed was his wife is nothing of the sort, and cannot understand how Pete has come to possess a photograph of herself and her children. As it happens this is only a minor setback for Pete, who quickly locates a suitable spot out in the hills that looks about right based on the background of the photograph he's got. And like that, with Melquiades's final burial, the film is virtually over. It just lingers on the face of Norton, whose brutal "lesson" is now complete, asking the departing Pete if he'll be okay. He has gone from the film's least sympathetic character to it's virtual hero, a man who made a terrible error through thoughtlessness and was made to pay for it in the most painful way possible. A satisfying transition to watch.The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada is a grotesque and extremely complicated portrait of a madman out to do the right thing in a world where right and wrong have been hopelessly skewed. This meaty concept is what makes it such a satisfying film, and why there's still very little that can top a good Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was really looking forward to seeing this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that from the previews this looked like just my type of film - powerful, good acting, tense, maybe a bit slow but only in a smouldering-with-tension kind of way. Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed with the plot-less tedium that was Three Burials. A border patrol guard kills a Mexican and this prompts an hour and a half (it seemed like at least 3) of the guard being dragged across the country by the Mexican's friend. And it is revealed that the guard's wife had sex with the Mexican - but with no character development this is simply unfathomable. This utter lack of character development is the inherent problem with the film and it renders most of the characters' actions to be inexplicable. Moreover we are expected to sympathise with the Mexican immigrants yet without any of the protagonists in the film being any more than almost comic stereotypes I was left completely cold. I agree that the politics are sledgehammer PC but this would not have bothered me at all if the film hadn't been so lacklustre. Unfortunately, despite the excellent acting of Barry Pepper as the border guard, this film is as vacant as the Texan desert in which it is set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit of a disappointment since I was expecting it to be one of the best films of 2005, but it still ended up being a gritty and superbly-acted modern western. The film is split into four acts, but it's really just two halves. The first half is interesting, yet it jumps around too much between characters and time periods that one gets completely lost and begins to misunderstand where he's even at in the film's sequence of events. The second half is completely linear but ends up being very dull and filled with meaningless plot devices like a snake bite and an old, blind man who just wants someone to kill him. But don't get me wrong, the film definitely has it's fair share of good points as well. The acting is superb. Everyone from Tommy Lee Jones to Barry Pepper to January Jones are incredible, though none of them really shines above the rest of the cast. The cinematography is also top-notch and does a great job of setting up the ambiance and scenery for a film as bleak and dull in tone as the life of a border patrolman is. Overall it's just a run of the mill film that tries some new tricks with the screenplay and completely gives that up in the second half, for good reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Payoff for a Plodding Tex-Mex Combo of Black Comedy and Melodrama Full of Red Herrings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is little doubt that Tommy Lee Jones has potential as an absurdist filmmaker, but this snail's-paced, oddly discomforting 2005 film is neither a mythic tale nor a prodigious directorial debut for the veteran actor. The pokey momentum and arid West Texas locations remind me a bit of Bruce Beresford's 1983 "Tender Mercies", but Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay lifts the intriguing plot device of Sam Peckinpah's 1974 "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" to move the story forward. Unfortunately, the resulting film does not come close to either classic because of its unsavory characters, implausible and often irrelevant story turns and worst of all, the deadening pace of the whole venture.It focuses on local rancher Pete Perkins, who finds out through the local sleep-around waitress that his friend and ranch hand, Melquiades Estrada, an Illegal Mexican immigrant, has been shot dead by a new border patrolman named Mike Norton. The first half of the overlong film shifts back and forth in time and bounces among characters that may or may not matter at the end, while the second half is a desultory trek where Perkins is intent on bringing Estrada's decaying body back across the border to his hometown. This is where the absurdist aspect comes to fruition as Perkins goes to extreme measures to preserve the body and the intent of the mission. I was hopeful the more straightforward narrative that takes hold on the journey would lead to a greater emotional resonance, but what it really does is elongate the story unnecessarily.Jones is fine as Perkins, though his character is mostly a cipher as we are never clear why Estrada is that meaningful a friend to him. Barry Pepper has an unenviable task playing the surly Norton, and he bears the brunt of the plot's absurdities in the second half. Dwight Yoakam portrays the local sheriff on one consistently sour note, though there are decent sideline contributions by Julio Cedillo as Estrada and Melissa Leo as the waitress. Levon Helm shows up in a cameo as an old, blind farmer, but I couldn't help but be reminded of Gene Hackman's bit as the blind monk in "Young Frankenstein". Give credit to Chris Menges for his appropriately sun-scorched cinematography of the desolate terrain. The DVD is sparse on extras - a full-screen or widescreen viewing option and a relatively terse commentary track by Jones, Yoakam and actress January Jones, who has a red-herring role as Norton's bored wife Lou Ann. In a relatively head-scratching move, the Cannes Film Festival jury bestowed awards for Jones' acting and Arriaga's screenplay last year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some mawkish PC twaddle-- a fairly decent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pains me to criticize an artist of Tommy Lee Jones' talent and truthfulness. This movie, which he stars in and directs, has some brilliant and truly wonderful elements. Sadly, it also exhibits some annoying Oh-So-PC twaddle, so prevalent among certain Hollywood types. For example, every Mexican in this movie is charming, sincere, honest, and kind. When Mexican strangers are encountered in the desert, and the Americans ask to buy some food, the kindly Mexicans say, 'Well, no, we want to simply give it to you'. OK, fair enough. But aside from the clear danger of approaching half a dozen armed strangers in the wilderness, regardless of their ethnic background, Jones and Barry Pepper, as the two Americans, simply stroll into the armed camp without any thought whatsoever for caution or protocol or safety. They just assumed, and expected us to assume, that these Mexicans would be Hollywood stereotypes of civility, innocence, and simply beaming with the luster of the all too common 'Peasant Myth' (i.e., all peasants and poor people are happy, good, and simply waiting for The Man to allow them a chance to plant their gardens, care for their communities, and feed the world's poor, etc.).Undoubtedly there are many, many wonderful, innocent, and trustworthy folks in the third world. Undoubtedly, an opportunity or two might serve them well. But the over-simple and mawkish way it is presented here is naiveté to the extreme. On the one hand, when the trappings of modern Western culture are stripped away, as they are in the crappy Texas border town where the movie begins, you get banality and despair.When the American fugitives arrive at a crappy Mexican village in the middle of the wilderness, on the other hand, there are gay twinkle lights, charming homemade and rustic music, couples and neighbors and family members chatting away with love and affection for each other. Isn't poverty grand? And aren't third world people just the absolute bestest ever? And aren't Westerners too jaded, too artificial, and too banal for words? Anyway--- that's the Peasant Myth. Personally, I do not believe it for a moment. I have been to the third world (several places, at several times), and let me say--- there is a REASON why those people are so desperate to leave it. Those places are horrible! Only in the guilt-ridden fantasies of Hollywood multi-millionaires does the Peasant Myth make any sense at all.Having said all that--- this movie nonetheless has charm. For example, if the movie had NOT used Mexicans versus Americans as a political sub-text, it would be a profoundly powerful movie. As it is, the posturing of the Hollwood rich kid elite spoils it a bit, and makes it merely a good movie.Clearly, Pepper and Jones do a stupendous job of acting. Certainly Oscar worthy. Too bad the sentiments got in the way of full appreciation, but there you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A PC mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skimming through pages of glowing reviews for this movie made me wonder if Netflix switched disks on me. The first half hour was promising, but it rapidly collapsed into a hopeless mess. The story lurches across a field of gaping holes in the plot, and requires a chain of unbelievable circumstances, then simply disappears into complete irrationality. The characters are all shamelessly predictable PC stereotypes. The key plot elements require either suspension of reality or severe naiveté. The film needs to be viewed surrealistically to make any sense at all. But its a not surreal; its just contrived...badly. RoadRunner cartoons manipulate their environment less outrageously. If you want the audience to connect the dots, fine...but for Pete's sake, provide some dots.If you want to revel in a predictable PC piece about Mexican illegals and Texas rednecks, and don't need a cohesive story, this one's for you. If you want to see a good film with TLJ hauling a corpse cross-country, rent the last couple episodes of "Lonesome Dove".I understand that this was TLJ's first feature directing job. Tommy...keep the day job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Moving, Patronizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********** Many Spoilers, Many Flaws *************** The premise of the movie is a Border Patrol agent, Norton, isn't too fond of illegal aliens and kills one. Pete, the title character's slaughtered friend, finds out its Norton and takes him and the body on a journey to bury him in Estrada's home village.Problem: The killing was just a bad accident. Its pretty apparent the agent had remorse but panicked and hid the deed along with his Border Agent buddies. The Border Patrol are portrayed as two dimensional bumbling racists while the Mexicans are kindhearted, trying to survive. Although Hollywood wants you to believe in the dignity of their fellow man there is none for the Border Patrol. Norton is never really given a chance to explain what happened to Pete.Problem: The promise that Estrada makes Pete keep in the event of his death is based on a lie that cheapens the characters involved and doesn't make sense. My guess it pushes the movie over the 1:30 mark.Problem: There is multiple POV versions of a couple of scenes that don't really differ. I'm tired of this cinema trick and its useless here except to push the movie over 1:30.Best Part: Levon Helm as the blind hermit. This is BY FAR the best and most "insightful" part of the movie. Dwight Yoakum's performance is also good but Levon steals the movie.BIG Problem: Tommy Lee Jones has no range. He has an unsympathetic constant deadpan delivery. Shouldn't be allowed to carry a movie.Wait for it to come out on video. Finally, for those who hype the "new Western" such as this film and Brokeback Mountain, rent "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." This shows real conflict, heroism, friendship and sacrifice. Also, "Shane" for the breathtaking scenery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge Fable Is a Nice Try, But Disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie audiences have always loved a good revenge story, and never more so than since 9/11. We can't get retribution for the wrongs committed against us in the real world, so we look for it in our movie theatres.Tommy Lee Jones adds another to the long line of revenge fables that have appeared in the last few years, and the results are mostly lacklustre. However, his film adds a refreshing twist to the standard revenge formula, and that if nothing else makes his film memorable.Jones stars as Pete, a taciturn cowboy living out in the middle of nowhere (aka Texas), who befriends an illegal Mexican immigrant, Melquiades. When Melquiades is shot and killed by a hot-head border patrol guard named Mike Norton(Barry Pepper), Pete kidnaps him and, the body of Melquiades in tow, heads for Mexico, where he intends to honor his promise to his friend and bury him in his home town. Norton suspects Pete's ultimate plan is to kill him in revenge, but the aforementioned refreshing twist is that Pete really just wants Norton to ask for forgiveness for his wrongs; more killing is not what Pete has in mind.This is a promising idea, but the promise is not fulfilled. The movie starts strongly, with bits and pieces told in an out of whack chronology, and a host of other characters introduced whose roles in the story we wait to discover: a local police officer and friend to Pete (Dwight Yoakam), a waitress in a diner and mistress to Pete (Melissa Leo), the young and bored wife of Norton (January Jones). But sadly, all of these characters dissolve from the movie (the women especially) to make way for Pete and Norton's grotesque journey for the border, that's equal parts "As I Lay Dying" and Homer's "Odyssey" (Jones even works in a meaningless sequence with a blind man who comes to the pair's aid). The characters of Pete and Norton remain frustratingly opaque, and neither of them changes much over the course of the film. The progressively disintegrating corpse of Melquiades is used to ghoulishly comic effect, but that disrupts the tone of the story. And Jones uses a heavy hand to address the racism between Mexicans and whites that exists as a constant state of affairs in that part of the country. I suppose Jones's message about the nobility of the Mexican race is aimed at those who need to hear it, but those who need to hear it wouldn't be watching a movie like this in the first place, which leaves the rest of us feeling preached at and talked down to."The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a noble effort that doesn't really work.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to jump on the bandwagon and say I liked this critical favorite, but come on, Tommy Lee, give us a lil' something more to work with here. Both Jones and Pepper -- as well as all in the supporting cast -- are strong in this under-written, scattered and confused little wannabe morality tale. Jones' character lacks the necessary dimension to make him fully convincing, and his friendship with the title character isn't shown developing enough to justify the actions Jones' character undertakes on his behalf. And the film is also unjustifiably grotesque -- to the point of almost being comical and/or offensive. Also, this film's denouement is guaranteed to have you scratching your head, wondering if you missed something. Guaranteed. Solid directing from Jones, but again, its downfall is the screenplay and its many shortcomings, oversights, and ill-conceived and poorly-realized ideas. See something like John Sayles' "Men With Guns" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story seems weirdly insecure about the Old West values it so honors, in that it feels the need to contrast them against a falsely empty caricature of modern life. It is further cheapened by its constant efforts to divide personal vices and virtues by race and nationality.Finally, as I watched the murdering Border Patrol goombah get beaten, horse-dragged, pistol-whipped, drowned, scalded, cut, and forced into a snake pit by those purporting to be his moral instructors, I was disturbed to see this purportedly liberal story espousing the view that virtue is properly imparted to the wicked through torture. The architects of Abu Ghraib and Gitmo must be proud to witness such moral degradation coming out of the mouth of Al Gore's roommate.As a story, this film is an intriguing idea overwhelmed by its disappointing flaws in execution. As politics and philosophy, it is a violently racist revenge fantasy thinly excused by a mask of liberality. In both regards, I found it a deeply unsatisfying watch.I look forward to someday seeing the Great Modern Border Movie, but this wasn't it. Maybe Larry McMurtry should take a crack at the subject -- in its chosen arena, Brokeback Mountain was everything this story was not.</fullReview>

To put this in context, I watch many movies from all parts of the world, and I enjoy slow art house movies as much as fast moving dramas or intelligent action movies. I hired this on DVD, based on positive buzz, and did something I very rarely do with DVD's. After half an hour or so, I could see exactly where this movie was going, and I began to fast forward through the move, reverting to play to observe key plot points. If you fancy being preached to by being beaten over the head by a moral maniac, then you might enjoy this over-rated nonsense. If it were artistic, or intelligent, then I could forgive this movie it's sins. Yet it has the ultimate sin, which I do not often encounter in movies, which usually have something to recommend them, of being rather dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Passion of the Jones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind George Bush and his cowboy diplomacy. Never mind that Tommy Lee Jones roomed with Al Gore at an Ivy League school. In The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrade, staged, fictional as it may be, you will see, in a most unlikely era, perhaps the most authentic cowboy-concept the screen has ever produced. The cowboy as portrayed by Jones is once again, as he used to be, the Western paragon of honor and authenticity, knowing what's right and unfazed by man's law. The twist is that the world has become so debased that this sense of honor now looks like google-eyed lunacy. It is literally one man against the world; not one man against a group, or against a microcosm, with a good woman waiting at the end of the line and children who will restore order and civilization ( the only time we hear a child speak in this film, he yelps "Go--amn bastard a--hole!" ) This cowboy is as alone as God. He may, in fact, be just that, and his outwardly vile actions -- such as his queasily comical attempts to preserve Melquiades's body -- may or may not prove to have some larger point, or even a prima causa.*SPOILERS ALERT* Pete Perkins and Melquiades Estrada are in love, but this isn't Brokeback Mountain -- it is a brotherly love that they share. Melquiades refuses all possessions like a Tibetan monk, giving Pete his best horse on a whim, living in a shack with a bare lightbulb, and dying with a buck and change in his pocket. When he's killed by Barry Pepper's Border Patrol officer, Perkins will undergo what apparently seems a mission of revenge, dragging Pepper and the body of Melquiades across half of Mexico in order to return the body to his wife in his hometown of Jimenez. But does Jimenez exist? Did Melquiades even have a wife? The mission becomes a quixotic -- I use the term advisedly -- search for a city that doesn't exist to honor a love that isn't sexual, satisfies no needs and therefore cannot be seen. When Perkins and his prisoner reach a scrubby area with a few rock formations that might have once been houses, Perkins pretends to recognize Melquiades' description of Jimenez, a place between two hills "so beautiful that once you see it, you'll never forget it." Pepper thinks he's crazy. This place is not pleasing to the eye. But in the end, he will be left weeping and begging Melquiades's forgiveness with the fervor of Dreyer's Joan of Arc. And the last line from his mouth, the last line we hear from a man who is stranded in the middle of nowhere with a mutilated foot and scars up and down his face, and the last line in the movie is "Are you going to be all right?" *END SPOILERS*There's no other way to say it -- this is not only a film that reclaims the cowboy from those who use the image unwisely and inauthentically, but more crucially, takes back Christianity as well, the kind of Christianity that isn't bruited about to win votes, power and money but reveals itself through actions like a chain that connects past, present and future to an unknown source. The cowboy is the samurai is the monk is the knight of infinite faith. Recasting the events of the film back in your mind, you realize that the movie was about the salvation of Barry Pepper's soul, here idealized as the average American -- a product of his sterile, telegenic environment, one hand down his pants and the other on the trigger of a gun, unable to satisfy his wife because he is closed off from his potential, but with a kernel of goodness that can only be brought out through a sort of limit-experience, which is where "crazy" Pete Perkins comes in.It is telling that Pepper nearly dies of a rattlesnake bite before having the poison sucked out by a Mexican woman he'd previously clobbered in the face when she attempted to cross the border. The next shot shows a brief glimpse of the reconciliation of all opposites, as everyone sits together and shucks corn, reminding me of the moment in The Little Foxes when all the patient, suffering characters gather on the patio for one brief moment before Bette Davis's mercenary shrew breaks them up again. There's a couple dozen more shots that deserve mention but space is limited. Suffice to say that Jones is not just a solid actor's director, like Eastwood, but an inspired visionary who can achieve exotic Baudelairean effects. If it's really true that Tommy Lee Jones is gearing up to direct Blood Meridian, for which the times are more than ripe, and for which he is indeed the man required, this macabre yet blissful vision is the ideal primer. It gives us a little something to hope for, illusory as it may seem, before dropping us into hell -- which, like Martin Scorsese, Jones unmistakably believes in and fears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Texas nearby the border of Mexico, the newcomer arrogant border patrolman Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) mistakenly kills the Mexican cowboy Melquiades Estrada (Julio César Cedillo) and buries him in the desert. When Melquiades's body is accidentally found one week later, his best friend, the ranch foreman Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones), claims the body to fulfill his promise and bury Melquiades in his hometown Jimenez and presses the local sheriff Belmont (Dwight Yoakam) to find the killer. However, Melquiades is not delivered to Pete because he is not his relative, and his body is reburied in the local cemetery. When Pete discloses the identity of the killer, he kidnaps Mike and forces him to dig the grave and bring the body to Melquiades's family in Mexico. While in their journey to Mexico, the sad reality of the hopeless Mexicans that live in the proximity of the border with USA is disclosed."The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a weird movie, developed in low pace and non-chronological. It was not clear for me the relationship between the bored Lou Ann Norton, played by the gorgeous January Jones, with Melquiades. Has she become a whore, working in the place owned by Rachel and Bob, or was she only bored looking for fun? The situation of the poor Mexican people living in that no man's land and the stereotypical alienation and arrogance of the border patrolmen are also very impressive. In the end, the loyalty of Pete for his friend Melquiades and the never corny redemption of Mike make this film worthwhile. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Tr?s Enterros" ("Three Burials")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's never too late to change ... for the better ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most overlooked masterpieces of the last decade ? nothing against "No Country For Old Men", but I'd rather trade 'Art' for the unforgettable journey to which Tommy Lee Jones invites us in this modern Neo-Western film "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada".First, what a title! It could mislead by making you believe it's some kind of symbolism, but from the first minutes of the film, you understand that Melquiades is the name of the unfortunate odyssey's hero, and that he's dead. There's no way to resurrect him, but there will be three ways to bury him, understand: to prepare his soul for the last voyage. Burials in human civilizations have always carried a powerful meaning; it's a sign of respect, a way to honor those who are not with us anymore. And Death is not a barrier, when it's a matter of respect and honor.The pacing of the first act is quite slow, conveying with efficiency an atmosphere of boredom and meaninglessness. The movie is set in a small town in the Tex-Mex border whose natural geography offers perfect opportunities for emigrants, to enter illegally. So the town is regulated by the eternal cycle of Mexicans trying to penetrate the frontier and border patrol trying to catch them. This is the town's routine outside while inside, people try to fill their time, by sunbathing, watching insipid soap operas, and banging the restaurant owner's wife, Rachel, Melissa Leo, sexy as ever. There's a feeling of a ghost town where the only living people are actually the cowboys, the only ones who domesticate the wildness and hostility of the place as they do for bulls and horses. They are the present, incarnating both a remaining connection with the past and a light of hope for the future. And this universe is Pete and Mel's routine, two friends, a veteran cow-boy with a stone face and a heart of gold, and a young 'vachero' who wants to work in what he does the best. The friendship between Pete and Mel is crucial as it will cement Pete's feeling of duty, when Mel will be accidentally killed. It's not a revenge story, this is no film for clichés, it's always about respect. It's a man's film that would have made proud the late Sam Peckinpah.And it's interesting to note, how like some old westerns, the movie almost associates the idea of virility with the cowboy world, while the other men seem to lack this quality. The town is governed by boredom, by a sort of emasculating nothingness. The restaurant owner is the most notorious cuckold in town, but the lovers are not the fastest guns in town either ... or they are. It's ironic that in a comic relief scene, the chief police, Belmont, the one who's got the power, has sexual troubles, the kind that affects his self-confidence. But it's a good premonition of the Police's impotence in Melquiades' case, convincing Pete to do the vigilante ? and we sure trust him that he'll handle the case better than Belmont, as he proved to handle Rachel quite better. Let the men tackle this. Still, Melquiades is pictured as a timid man with girls. His apparent sweetness makes his death even sadder, especially because the border patrol guy who killed him, Mike Norton, is a totally opposite character.Mike Norton is a selfish insecure scumbag who visibly hates his life. Indeed, there's something bitter in his whole attitude, and it's hard to believe he was popular once. Barry Pepper plays perfectly the man who constantly vents his anger on the others, not hesitating to punch in the face a Mexican girl who was running away, not the likeliest character to inspire our sympathy. And it's not his sordid sex scene with Lou Ann, his wife played by January Jones, that would contradict this feeling. Pepper as Norton was outstanding and I can't go without mentioning when after cutting his nail toes, he did what I expected him to do. Gross, but authentic. His lack of virile satisfaction fills his life with a boredom he can only satisfy it with the help of a Hustler magazine. Pathetic but also tragic as this will lead to the accidental killing.I took my time to get to the point, but so did the film that needed a long prologue before the odyssey started. Like "The Godfather", it had the time to present the characters, and like "The Godfather", it's about an evolution, not a corruption this time, but a redemption. The story starts when the flash-backs end, and when taking Norton as a hostage, Pete will order him to dig up Mel's corpse in order to bury him in Mexico, in his hometown. Two men and a corpse guiding them, the corpse is still present as if Mel was alive, as if his soul wasn't in peace yet, and this is the whole point: saving souls. Pete has a duty as friend, Mel had to be respected, and Mike was offered an opportunity to redeem himself. In their route, they'll meet a blind man asking them to kill him, he doesn't want to commit suicide, not to offend God, but neither does Pete. They'll meet the Mexican girl who'll show Norton the other side of the mirror, and teach him one thing or two about respect.And at the end, there's Norton, the soul of this film who, through a nightmarish journey, will repent of his acts asking Mel's soul to forgive him in one of the most emotional breakdowns ever, that decided Pete to finally release his prisoner as his initiation was over. One of the greatest masterpieces of the 2000's, sublimated by a dazzling cinematography, "The Three Burials" is a true gem that should have earned many Oscar nominations ? including one for Barry Pepper, who proved through Norton that it's never too late to change, for the better ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accidents &amp; connections that changes our lives in a striking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writter Guillermo Arriaga in his writings believes in the strange power that accidents has in everybody's lives and how they connect different countries, different languages and different people in one common cause. He did that with the accidents in "Amores Perros" and in "21 Grams" and with the accidental shooting of a tourist that connected several characters all around the world in "Babel". And all these scripts have in common a non-linear way to present its story, mixing past, future and present in a puzzling way that invites us to guess what will happen next and how come such strange connections are made. "Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" goes just like the trilogy directed by A.G.I?arritú but it is directed by Tommy Lee Jones and it's more simplistic than the other films (at least in the way the story is presented, less confusing so to speak). The other thing in common is that all of these films are brilliantly well-made, well acted and with many great things to say.Jones stars as Pete, a rancher who wants to find out who killed his best friend, the Mexican Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), and to fulfill his friend wishes, he needs to bury Melquiades on the other side of the border, in a place called Jimenez. Patrol border Mike (Barry Pepper) is the man who accidentally shot Melquiades, carrying a repressed guilt over the fact, hiding it from his wife (January Jones). Pete and Mike will cross each other when Pete decides that the other guy must help him with the body of the deceased, carrying him to the desert where he'll finally be buried in peace (and one of the three burials of the title). "Three Burials..." offers a story about redemption, love, friendship, cultural clashes; fooling us with a new western style on a tale that might approach themes of revenge and hostilities between Americans and Mexicans. It shows that friendships has no borders, is limitless; and it also shows the power of persistence on a mission that seems to be bizarre and too risky. Pete and Mike will carry the decomposing body of Melquiades in a haunting and dangerous place in the middle of the desert, cross between Texas and Mexico, chased by the police and fighting lots of adversities and meeting a friendly blind man (Levon Helm) who asks them a strange request (one of the best twists in the film, pay attention to this part).Arriaga once again wrote a life changing story in his well-known style that reminds us of a magic cube, where things are and aren't connected at the same time but you gotta stick to the end to see the whole picture formed perfectly to understand its complexity. It pales a little in comparison with his trilogy purely because of the introduction of Mike's wife in the story, most of the time she's very unnecessary to the plot until it appears a moment when Mike cries while watching a soap opera that she liked. Only this scene makes a bound between the two that seems relevant but watching as a whole if you remove her from the film it wouldn't make a difference. Other thing that is different from Arriaga's most famous screenplays is the use of humor in "Three Burials...", there's some pretty funny scenes like Mike trying to take Melquiades from the "American grave" without succeeding so much; a sex scene between Mike and his wife, being the most funniest thing of all with Mike's strange face during the act and the unimportance that the girl gives to him paying more attention to the soap opera she's watching and the cook she's preparing; and other scenes too. But all that humor doesn't extinguish the drama of this great story whose major moments is when Pete remembers all the good times he had with Melquiades (in these parts everything is spoken in Spanish and Jones is very fluent in this language), and includes the promise Pete had to make that covers the whole film.Tommy Lee Jones is the man on and off screen that makes of "Three Burials..." a great memorable film that seemed to resurrect his career that was a little sleepy, and gave the opportunity of working in classics like "No Country for Old Man" and "In the Valley of Elah" (very similar films in a way). Barry Pepper has a great performance and so does Dwight Yoakam, Melissa Leo, January Jones and Julio Cedillo in the supporting roles.A striking film about the accidents that change our lives, sometimes for good, sometimes for bad, but it is those accidents that makes us all connected. 10/10</fullReview>

It's a daring and creative theatrical directing debut from Tommy Lee Jones, that only works halve as successful as it perhaps could have had.But its uniqueness is also were the the main problem with this movie lays. It's hard to know how to watch this movie. The movie starts off as a mostly serious thriller about a murder committed in Texas, close to the Mexican border. Later the movie turns more into a quirky comedy and eventually the movie also becomes an 'Odyssey' like adventure movie. It's really not the most consistent movie ever made with also doesn't make this the easiest or most pleasant movie to watch.The movie also doesn't make things easy for itself. The movie is partly told non-linear with occurrence put in that happened before the killing of Melquiades Estrada. All those moments seem pretty randomly put in the movie which does make the movie unnecessary confusing and hard to follow.Sad thing is that "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" could had been a really great and above all fun movie to watch, had it only been made in one continues style (the adventurous comical one). That way i'm sure I would had really enjoyed watching this movie. I also certainly enjoyed this movie now already for what it was but I just couldn't help thinking throughout the movie how great this movie would had been if it had only been entirely just like its last 30 minutes or so.I understood the movie and its deeper layers and meanings about redemption and friendship but still that doesn't mean that I enjoyed the movie.The movie has some good actors in it but still they can't prevent the characters in this movie from being pretty bland and distant. Their fine and professional performance doesn't bring the story and characters enough to life. Not even Tommy Lee Jones, who normally always is an actor that can carry a movie, even if he only plays a small part in it.Sure, the movie is still entertaining and creatively original enough to consider this a good movie to watch but it also is a movie with lots of missed opportunities. Let's hope Jones has learned from the mistakes he made with this movie and may his next movie be as brilliant as this movie potentially could had been.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric and Moralistic Drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be mostly a transparent clichéd propaganda outlet. You have the "evil" white men and the "good" persecuted illegal immigrants. That is the basic premise to the movie. The characters seem one dimensional, and for me, this quickly led to boredom. After 20 minutes I began to consider fast forwarding. By the half way point I did. How much of this syrup are we supposed to swallow? It's too bad that the script wasn't better because Tommy Lee does a good job with his character. I am very surprised that this movie got the rating it did here. But then people are used to being spoon fed Hollywood formula films. Unfortunate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones led a stellar cast in an intriguing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film so much I purchased it and have lent my copy to others so they could enjoy it as well (but it doesn't appear they have). I think this is the best thing I've seen Tommy Lee in but the intense Pepper (perfect for a Border Patrol Agent), the smoldering Leo (spot on for her rather small town street wise role), the folksy Yoakam (couldn't have found anyone better to play Sheriff), and the hapless Cedillo (sweet man just trying to get by, irrespective of borders), and the lovely January Jones (what an incredible beauty) they all held up their end as well. A terrific story of friendship and loyalty, loyalty that could have ended very badly and from which there was no turning back! Tommy Lee plays a no nonsense very decent man capable of doing violence for the sake of friendship and to honor an offhand promise but just as important ensuring some degree of justice is served. Great film that I will always think of fondly and that I revisit from time to time and each and every time it has the same emotional impact! By the way Tommy your directorial debut was as good as it can get I detected nothing lacking whatsoever! Damn film brought tears to my eyes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt that this one of the best movies in 2006. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada really captures your attention and never lets go. I know that many people have seen Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals. This is really the same character, in a sense, just looking really scruffy and hard, instead of the smooth look of Marshal Samuel Gerard. He has the same steely purpose in getting his man and keeping his promises. To see his resolve and determination, no matter what it takes, is amazing. This character was made for Jones, and his direction is magnificent. Unlike Brokeback Mountain, which was a love story, this is a real cowboy film. It is hard, dirty, funny, and real. The scenery is breathtaking, and no punches are pulled. It is not a revenge movie, but one that deals with compassion, racism, and promises. Barry Pepper brings a character that he did well in such movies as We Were Soldiers, The Green Mile, and Saving Private Ryan. Needless to say, he is a changed man after Jones gets through with him. There were no snakes on a plane, but there was a snake on the plain, and that really provided some of the best comedy in this film. Some may not like the way the story jumps from past to present and back, but it really makes the film, and helps you to understand the complexity of what Jones is achieving. In a sense, it emulates Crash, and it also brings the same message. If they are going to bring the western back like this, I will be a fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty disappointing on every level. I love a good western, a good mystery and/or an interesting exploration of moral questions, but this movie was none of those things. Lots could be said about the film's stereotypes, its plodding pace, its rambling storyline, and other flaws.My #1 criticism, though, is that I couldn't understand a word Tommy Lee Jones said (or mumbled). He won Best Actor at Cannes, but I think he should have made the Guinness Book of World Records for Most Gruff Gruffness. I kept wishing that the subtitles they used for Spanish dialogue in this film would keep running when he was speaking.I'm not angry and don't entirely regret watching it, but I would not recommend it to a friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A kind of bizarre Pekinpah like poem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Estrada's dead body in tow, cattle rancher Pete Perkins, played by Tommy Lee Jones, takes a border patrol man named Mike Norton to where Estrada lived and asks Norton look at Estrada's plate, drink out of his cup, and where his clothes. Pete wants Mike to see what an injustice he's done. It's a violent kind of poetry that's felt throughout the film.Tommy Lee Jones directs and stars in this film. The film begins simply enough, with the view of Estrada's body, dead from a gunshot wound. We are introduced to rookier border patrol officer Mike Norton, played by Barry Pepper, and his young wife. They arrive in Texas from Cincinatti. Norton obviously lacks experience at his trade and shows violent and cowardly tendencies doing his job.There is a non linear quality to the film. It flashes back and forth, tracing the friendship between Pete and Estrada, an illegal Mexican immigrant. This part of the film can seem a little slow, though important. When we see Estrada's death and learn of his killer, the journey begins where Pete sets out to give his friend a proper burial.This is also where the film moves from standard drama to a surreal, Pekinpah like journey. Think "Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia," where Bennie talked to the head and gave it a shower. "Garcia" was a violent road film, but some scenes remind me of that film. "Three Burials" is more poetic.In the end, we have a film that deals with friendship, justice, and a sense of loneliness felt by more than one character in the film. We also get a classic semi tense road picture, between Texas and Mexico. While the journey's no match for Jones' turn in "No Country for Old Men," this film blends emotional drama with a dark somewhat violent western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When illegal immigrant Melquiades Estrada arrives in the States and meets cowboy Pete, a friendship is formed. A promise is made. And when Estrada is killed in a senseless shooting, that promise is kept, in the relentless manner that perhaps only a Tommy Lee Jones character can keep a promise.Jones directorial debut is confident and inventive. The harsh landscape is served by the sparse, somewhat oppressive tone Jones evokes. People live quietly desperate lives here, scratching out an existence in the diner only compensated for by stolen afternoons in motels. Squalor and compromise abound, contrasting with the absolute loyalty cowboy Pete shows to his dead friend. Two good Samaritans are encountered on the way to Mexico; both prove less than saintly in their ulterior motives.In many ways this is a classic western - hard men in brutal lands taking on unsavoury quests to serve some higher cause. It could be perfectly remade as a samurai drama, focusing on loyalty and the ephemeral nature of existence. One foolish act, and many lives are changed utterly. A film that succeeds on so many levels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And like all extraordinary movies, this is not for everyone. For one, it requires the viewer to work at keeping track of the past, present and future and for another it requires laughter where humour isn't normally a response: as in red ants crawling all over a decaying corpse.The plot is loosely based on a true story but the genius is in bringing the writer Guillermo Arriaga (21 grams, Amores Perros)and freshly hatched director/talented actor, Tommy Lee Jones together in creating this cross-border cross-emotions film which goes in so many different directions. Barry Pepper, who plays the hapless, emotionless Border Patroller, Mike Norton, has to be commended on a truly outstanding performance.The story begins in a bleak Texan town close to the Mexican border and centres on the friendship between a cattleman, Pete, played by Tommy Lee Jones, and his ranch hand, Melquiadas, in a small but significant role played by Julio Cedillo. It also focuses on the women in the town, the wife of the restaurant owner and the wife of Mike.In the way of small towns, everyone is connected - some more subtly than others. The movie takes an unexpected turn with the killing of Melquiadas, a pointless, stupid killing. Thus is the first burial: Melquiadas being chewed up by a coyote on the further reaches of the ranch.The second burial comes after the autopsy and a closed file. Pete realizes his friend is not going to be avenged by the law and decides to enact his own revenge and honour a promise he made his friend - and bring him back to his wife and family in Mexico.And thus begins the journey of the third burial as Pete brings Mike to justice by having him dig up the body of his friend and accompany him to Mexico, under duress, and bring Mel home to a proper family burial. The journey, as it turns out, is not about revenge at all but about the subtle emotional layering of the main characters: their core loneliness and isolation. And enough said about the plot.Marvellously done, exquisite scenery, terrific music, great supporting players. Dialogue a little difficult to hear at times, otherwise it would be have been a higher rating. As it is: 9 out of 10. A see-again. Bravo, Tommy and cast and crew.</fullReview>

The body is found and given an anonymous, formal burial in the local cemetery. The Mexican's American ranch hand friend, Peter Perkins, investigates the murder and tracks down the killer. He forces the killer to dig up the body and help him take it back to the Mexican's hometown for his third and final burial. On a long, arduous and frequently amusing journey the killer gradually changes until he eventually begs forgiveness, presumably rethinks his existence and eventually forms some kind of friendship with his captor who has made him suffer for his crime.A wonderfully quirky and comic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow murky jigsaw puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is shown with many flashbacks. A body is found in the desert of west Texas. Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) is the ranger who befriends an illegal Mexican cowboy named Melquiades Estrada. Belmont (Dwight Yoakam) is the sheriff in town. Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) is a new border agent. He and his wife Lou Ann (January Jones) buys a trailer and moves into town. Rachel (Melissa Leo) is the married waitress who is sleeping around.This is written by Guillermo Arriaga who has made a career with stories that goes forward and backwards in time. Tommy Lee Jones keeps the directions simple and lets his actors act. The back and forth in time is complicated enough. There is no need to get too fancy with the direction. It delivers a low level intensity in a desolate place. The movie takes its time. The story is a jigsaw puzzle that takes effort to put together. It slowly dawns on the audience what happened and it's a real moral quagmire. What seems simple at first starts getting more and more complicated. It is quite a piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A story about the best and worst of human nature. One of my favorite things about this movie is that Pete and Mel live in a world where a man's horse and his gun are integral to his life and livelihood - this kind of man is so often misunderstood by those with an urban background. But there is also the cautionary aspect of the story, where firearm use is both the cause of and the "solution" to Pete's unhinged and very human grief. His journey with Norton to Mexico is an odyssey that includes episodes of pathos, payback, hubris and humility, not to mention handy tips on amateur embalming. Just about every character is a casualty in some sense, but I identified with Pete all the way through. The cast is superb - I will not single out any one in particular, for how could I choose? But the scene where the sheriff and the waitress discuss Viagra is priceless. Great script and direction - I'll keep an eye out for future Tommy Lee Jones directing projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" A Vista of Man's Sinfulness and Redemption"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The directorial debut of Tommy Lee Jones may likely provide deep insight into Jones' own faith and the influence of author Flannery O'Connor. "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" provides a vista of the bleakness of man's sinfulness, and his need for grace and redemption. An easier to pronounce and less enigmatic title could have been "The Redemption of Mike Norton", but that would have been too revealing.The film, like the southern border wilderness where it is set, exposes the true nature of man ? a dichotomy of the spiritual and mundane. As in our American judicial system it endorses vengeance as well as provides opportunity for forgiveness and rehabilitation. A powerful modern-day Western, "Three Burials" is written by Guillermo Arriaga, an award-winning Mexican screenwriter acclaimed for "Amores Perros" and "21 Grams." This screenplay does justice to Jones' focus in the film on death and redemption as most of Arriaga's stories have death as a central theme, likely a factor of his being raised in one of Mexico City's more violent barrios. It is evident these men have collaborated on a film that embodies laconic pace and visceral images in a western context; both can be viewed as an extension of Jones' Harvard thesis on author Flannery O'Connor:The film's O'Connor connection is not haphazard, with Mr. Jones identifying her, and the book of Ecclesiastes, as primary influences on the story. "You look for the allegorical intentions of what we're taught in the Bible, and then find some way to have it revealed or expressed by common experience. You'll find this happening over and over again in O'Connor, who was a rather classical Catholic thinker who wrote about nothing but backwoods north Georgia rednecks." In that same interview, Mr. Jones continues: "Ecclesiastes is essential to the movie as well. . . . It has to do with the passage of time. You want to start thinking as an actor that the past, the present, and the future are occurring simultaneously, and God requires an accounting of all three." There is ample evidence of a powerful link of this film to the book of Ecclesiastes and the stories of Flannery O'Connor; both of their themes are integral to this film: "Barry Pepper talked about the influence of the Bible and the works of Flannery O'Connor on The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, written and directed by Tommy Lee Jones. O'Connor is important to the way this movie is constructed," he continues. ''What you do is you consider some so-called religious thinking without the didacticism of the classical approach. You look for the allegorical intentions of what we're taught in the Bible, and then find some way to have it revealed or expressed by common experience." Jones adds: Also, family members of the film's co-producer, Michael Fitzgerald, are executors of O'Connor's literary estate. ''So we both knew our O'Connor rather well, and it was just a natural approach for me." The viewer is treated to a colorful and varied screen; from the opening pastel credits, wide rambling hills, mountains, and desert, to the stark filtered colors of the café and morgue. Jones accomplishes a remarkable task in directing, as well as doing some of his own camera work, and as lead actor. In front of the camera Jones heads the cast as Pete Perkins, a ranch foreman, who takes on a Mexican drifter, Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) who is obviously in the U.S. illegally. Pete seems taken with the man, who answers the question of what he does as: "I'm just a cowboy."For my full review (contains spoilers) with a view of Ecclesiastes: http://alturl.com/ghjbb</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done, yet somewhat unpleasant to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the technical side of things this is an excellent film. I can find almost no flaws in its execution. The directing works, the scenes flow very well from one to another (though I don't really care for the flash-forwards, but that's a personal bias) and the acting is top-notch. Add in some gorgeous scenery, nice cinematography and a decent score and there's really nothing much to complain about.So that leaves us with the story, the style and the characters. I don't mind the story. It's actually a rather good tale about a sour man that doesn't really care about much anything, but has grown attached to his protégé and wants to do something decent for a while, even if that something is just giving the young man a proper burial place. I'll buy it and I was actually somewhat interested in the premise. Unfortunately the style and the characters are all very unpleasant to witness. This is a depressing movie. That's not exactly a flaw, as it is a conscious choice made by the makers of this movie, but it didn't improve the viewing experience for me. And the movie actually gets a lot better when we get out of that little American border town where everyone is ugly, sinful and has given up all hope. Sure people are ugly and sinful on the other side of the border as well, but at least they have an explanation for their misery. In that American town there's just this feeling of clinical masochism. Like they're miserable by choice. And perhaps that's the statement that the film makers wanted to convey. If so, they certainly succeeded.And, to the film's credit, there are some good characters as well. Tom Lee Jones' Pete Perkins has given up hope like so many others in this film, but there's still that small sliver of principle in him, shining through the cracks. Likewise with the titular character Melquiades Estrada, the only character that feels alive in this film, even though it is about his burial. Wrap your head around that fact.All in all I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to anyone. It's a well-made movie about hopelessness, frustration and meaningless good deeds, but it's also so very ugly that I kind of wish I hadn't seen it. On the other hand I recognize that my personal taste in movies is the only thing that's preventing me from singing its praises. So if gritty realism is your thing, this movie could be for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, Pete, them ants are eating your friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" stars Tommy Lee Jones as Pete Perkins, a rancher stricken by grief when Mel, a close friend and Mexican employee, is killed by a trigger happy border patrol guard. Enraged by the local police force's indifference toward Mel's death, Perkins sets out to fulfil a promise by taking Mel's corpse home to Mexico. He takes Mel's murderer ? a deranged border patrolman played by Barry Pepper ? with him.The film was written by Guillermo Arriaga ("Amores Perros", "21 Grams"), a writer with a fondness for non-chronological plot-lines. As a result "Burial" is initially off-putting, until its various narrative strands begin to gel and Arriaga's plot becomes cohesive.Like John Sayles' superior "Lone Star", the film is a racial tract dressed up in cowboy garb: an allegory about affluent bullies who exploit their Third World neighbours whilst covering up the misdirected violence of their own hotheaded proletariat. The film works best, though, not as a message movie, but as an evocation of small town West Texas. This is a dead, forgotten world, where emasculated men bully both women and immigrants just to feel alive. The film's title refers to the repeated burials and excavations of Mel's corpse. There are many ways to bury a man, the film says, but only one is right."Burial's" cast is mostly fine, expect Pepper, whose character is written as a raging, caricatural hot head. Not only is his narrative arc clichéd ? he moves from resentment to forgiveness, and so redemption, after witnessing the hard lives of Mexicans first hand ? but his character demonizes and personalises what are ideological, political and structural problems. Lazy, aggressive, violent, sexual perverts patrol the Mexican borders, the film wants you to believe. Look how they bully poor, nice, kind-hearted Mexicans! Which is not to say that the violence of such men does not spring from feelings of emasculation, but that the issue is infinitely more complicated. For example, just 44 percent of the border is actually patrolled, and what is patrolled is mostly a charade, as there is an unspoken understanding that the US economy is heavily reliant on cheap labour provided by immigrant workers. As much as 1/6th the population of Mexico lives and works in the United States, most of it under conditions of illegality, with little protection from the exploitation of low-wage employers. This, of course, is all engineered to keep the cost of goods low (Wal-Mart routinely makes almost 300 billion in annual sales, 11 million of which goes toward paying reprimands for hiring illegal immigrants) and to prevent the problems and violence of the borders travelling inland and engulfing the white lower and middle classes. A somewhat unconscious decision is thus made: better ticked off, poor Mexicans over the border, than ticked off whites at home. The border is less a cartographic demarcation than an instrument of social and class relations.If Pepper is a caricature who distracts away from the core of real issues, Jones fares better. His grief is palatable, though because his relationship with Mel isn't fully explored, his sorrow isn't as affecting as it should be. Interestingly, the film reduces Jones and Mel's friendship to bouts of shared sex with hookers. In an emasculated town, where everyone plays games of dominance/submissiveness, the hetero-couple's companionship boils down to a willingness to copulate in tandem. To get around the contradiction of these "good" men hiring hookers, the prostitutes are portrayed as "hookers with hearts of gold", their male clients totally submissive to the women's needs and wishes.Mixing noir tropes with that of Westerns and Southern Gothic literature, "Burials" belongs firmly to the "Mexican-American border neo noir", or "Tex-noir" hybrid genre. Some of the sub-genre's better film include "Extreme Prejudice", "Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia", "No Country For Old Men", "Flesh and Bone", "Lone Star", "Lonely are the Brave", and "The Border".7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film is a wonderful, slow burning and progressive character piece that simmers in both the Texan and Mexican heat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a wonderfully paced, devilishly involving piece constructed of various segments revolving around the death and consequent burying of a Mexican immigrant in contemporary Texas. At its core is Tommy Lee-Jones doing on camera what he's done a few times very recently, playing an elderly gentleman wondering just what on Earth is happening to the world and the people all around him within it; in what is a remarkable turn given it's his film to direct and manoeuvre on top of playing the rock of the piece. The film is largely influenced by films and certain directors of old, it being able to capture the raw and dusty locale of Texas in a highly effective manner as it blends traditions of age-old genres with both new and contemporary settings and domestic issues. In short, it's a gripping yarn which navigates a series of hairpin turns and dramatic set pieces as various physical and then-some elements combine in a baking hot middle of nowhere.The film will follow local man Pete Perkins (Jones) on one strand and a certain Mike Norton (Pepper) on the other, before brashly bringing them together for a trek across the hot, dusty terrain in which both of them will come to learn and understand various items. Norton is a border patrol guard working on the line that separates the U.S. with Mexico, a relatively young and fresh face to the job, and one that does not uphold certain characteristics that come with both the uniform he bares and the responsibility it demands. Norton's brutality against those of a Mexican ilk whom attempt to cross the border is stark and reactionary, violent in the breaking of one individual's nose as an empty and seemingly anonymous relationship with girlfriend Lou Ann (Jones) back home results in passionless sex and her own gross inability to connect with her new surroundings.His journey with Perkins, for reasons that'll become more evident, offers a chance at both reconciliation with certain sorts of people as well as the chance to identify an epiphany related to procedure and responsibility, the sort which ought to come with the wearing of that uniform and the shouldering of the task at hand to keep those breaking the law from doing so. Norton's systematic abusing and ignoring of this power returns to haunt him when he is rendered second in-tow and relegated to being pulled along as a lackey with Perkins on their expedition, an expedition Perkins dreams up out of respect and a promise to fulfil duty should it ever come his way; the very attributes Norton ought to embody in regards to his border patrol tasks. This brings us to the Melquiades Estrada (Cedillo) of the title, a certain Mexican immigrant who had befriended Perkins over time as indulgence in women; the sharing of where one is in life at that point and so fourth ignite a connection between the two, but whose life is dramatically cut short one day when he's accidentally shot dead.The film runs on some rather deep substance to do with responsibility and the connection in friendship one man shares with another, with the brilliance of the screenplay from Mexican born Guillermo Arriaga keeping it from ever being a one man show. This is not a series of pratfalls and incidences in which Norton must be knocked down; learn and then get back up again ready for the next lesson, this is as much Jones' character's film as it is Pepper's. The film begins in somewhat of a western sense with a long, slow tracking shot across the sandy deserts of Texas before panning left to reveal two guys riding into closer view, not on separate horses, but in a jeep. One of them spies a coyote and doesn't think twice to open fire, one of many incidences in which Americans charged with law enforcing opt for the choice of two options that'll force us into thinking negatively of them. Arriaga's screenplay is rather interestingly full of victimised Mexicans and gung-ho Americans, the likes of whom cover-up accidental deaths; do the minimum of what's required; in Lou Ann's disgusted observation of an obese neighbour, generally come across as shallow as possible, and, it would seem, shoot animals on sight in violent fits of apparent boredom. The exception is, of course, the character played by the director for the piece; someone that connects with one of the film's few truthfully fleshed out Mexicans.Jones and Arriaga's toying with genre is good fun, and their calling to mind of various texts displays a real fondness for the field they're working in. They love the Texan desert like some of the past masters have loved both the sandy Italian wilderness and Monument Valley, respectively; the exchanges between Perkins and Norton as they're on the road to the destination quaintly calling to mind Tuco and Blondie's games of oneupmanship which were again in the desert and which again saw one man on horseback chastise another. This, as an essence of Pekinpah looms large over proceedings; the two are not transporting a bag of money to Mexico complete with all the elements after them, nor indeed are they in possession of a dead man's head: these two are shifting the whole thing. The film maintains a gloriously effective overall tone of relative dishevelment, a piece that runs its characters through a grinder in which the goal is having to bury a good friend; and whilst succeeding will bring its own taste of accomplishment, nothing will ever bring the person back again. Jones' frequent downcast expression and Pepper's desperate longing to be anywhere else but where he is are at the core of it, but all of it combines with imagery and a sense of spectacle to deliver one of the best films of its respective year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid modern day western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Werner Herzog would admire The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. Among other things, it is a story of a man's obsession. As I watched, the names Quentin Tarantino, Sergio Leone, and the Coen bros. also came to mind in several places. Despite an ending that feels unfinished, and some mildly unbelievable story material, The Three Burials is an exceptional modern day western. Tommy Lee Jones is at the top of his game, and he is equally skilled behind the camera as he is in front of it.Texan cowboy Pete Perkins, becomes a fugitive from the law, when he attempts to fulfil a promise he made to his Mexican friend Melquiades. If he were to die, Pete was to take his body across the border to his hometown deep in the Mexican hills. One sunny day, two border guards find the kid's body lying in the desert with a bullet hole in his chest. Pete is distraught, but when finds out who is responsible for the death of his friend, he kidnaps that person, digs up Melquiades body from his 'American' grave, and he makes for Mexico, while the law comes after him.In Tarantino fashion, the movie is split into chapters, and a large section of the first half is out of sequential order. Oddly though, it feels so natural that is wasn't until the end of the first act in which I realized that two flashbacks had already gone by, (and believe me I was paying attention).The simple fact that The Three Burials is able to get my attention and then hold it for two hours, must count for something. The story is a slow mover, and when I look back on it, not a whole lot happens. One could almost look at the film as more character driven than plot driven, but it's pretty solid all the way through.The second half of the film is a gorgeous nature trip of cinematic proportions as we work our way through the desert to Mexico. If there is one moment I wont forget, there is a crane shot as Perkins starts descending on horseback down a mountain slope only a meter and a half wide. As the camera moves towards the precipice, you'd swear you were about to fall off. (or you would if you were watching on the big screen)Overall, The Three Burials of Melchiades Estrada, is a pretty impressive piece of filmaking. It may not be the most emotional of films, but it's engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You got a grave to dig".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the kind of movie that appears every once in a great while that actually makes you think, and more so, reflect on such intrinsic human traits as loyalty, friendship, integrity, and alienation. Coming out as recently as four years ago, it's a film I had never even heard of until it made the rounds on Encore Westerns recently, and even then, it's title didn't interest me enough to tune in at the time. However with the luxury of a few days free time on my hands, I managed to pick it up at my local library. To say that the movie is mesmerizing would be somewhat of an understatement. It's morbid and fascinating at the same time, a slow motion train wreck that begins with the Tarantino-esqe convention of a non-linear story line, then descends into a nightmare reality for it's principal players as the viewer simply can't imagine how it will all turn out.The movie was oddly reminiscent for me of two other films, one from four decades ago, and another quite recent. The picture's early treatment of alienation among it's characters, (Lou Ann and Mike, Rachel and Bob) was as powerful here as it was in 1971's "The Last Picture Show", both taking place in the stark heat and dust of the American Southwest. With a small town population one could virtually count on just a few hands, both films dwell on the notion that "It's always the same, always the same" - with the perverse realization that whatever you do doesn't remain a secret very long. So the indiscretions of a waitress are known to everyone, and stepping outside of the town's comfort zone is a concern for one and all.The other picture that comes to mind is another Tommy Lee Jones vehicle, the recent "No Country For Old Men". Both stories lend themselves to a randomness of events that at any moment threaten to spiral out of control. Gunshot wounds and rattlesnake bites are unseen and unintended consequences of moving in the wrong direction, while even well thought out plans never foresee potential obstacles along the way. With both pictures, you're left with the uncomfortable sense that the Tommy Lee Jones character remains joyless and without direction, even with closure. Both finales are as powerful as they come.It's been a few days now since I've watched 'Three Burials' and I'm still thinking about it. That's in no small measure to those ghastly and grotesque sequences when Pete (Tommy Lee) battles the ants and applies the antifreeze embalming. Is it weird to suppress an involuntary chuckle while at the same time you're going 'WTF'? But there's also the relationship Pete forges and forces with Mike (Barry Pepper) while on the trail to complete his mission. It's a surreal crossroads both men arrive at when Mike asks Pete if he's going to be OK, but no stranger than asking the same question of the man he killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are sides to life we never see. Wrong and right are one of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a marvelous story detailing friendship and tragedy and Right and wrong. The Movie centers on Pete Perkins a Grizzled old Cowboy who speaks Spanish and gives work to the Title character and befriends him. Soon they grow close and become best friends. Then we meet Mike Norton a bitter Border Patrol Guard recently transferred to this little Texas town that is Dying. Norton loves his wife and he actually likes his job somewhat in fact he is overzealous where he beats on the men and the women crossing the border illegally. He sees them as something less then human. Norton lets his anger boil over in his treatment towards the illegal aliens. One day Norton hears shots and thinking someone is shooting at him starts firing back and kills Estrada. Estrada was shooting a fox and Norton in his hurry fails to see this and kills him. Norton buries him and tries to hide his gulit which boils over in anger. The First Burial. The body is discovered and Perkins becomes obessessed with finding the killer. It also seems he promised Estrada to take him home to bury him if he had died there. The Coroner buries him. The Second Burial. Perkins finds out Norton killed him and Drags him out of his house kicking and screaming to dig up Estrada to take him home. The Third Burial. the Third act of this movie is a incredible part of the movie as we meet strange people including Levon Helm in a quirky cameo. The Police are chasing Perkins and Norton as they struggle to cross the border. The rest of the movie is simply about Karma About discovering things You only think you know. We find that life on the other side of the border may be poorer be has more dignity. Tommy Lee Jones created a movie that's not a easy movie to watch at times it's harsh and makes you avert your eyes and at times it makes you laugh out loud. Sometimes you feel shame while watching this movie because of the behavior of the characters. This could be called an art film but I think it comes closer to being a Slice of life of how people act. Sometimes we do things that we think is right but is wrong in other people's eyes Or we do Wrong because we believe what we will end up doing is Right. A difficult movie to watch and a even more difficult movie to like. But repeated viewings is a must to capture the entire scope of the story and film. Tommy Lee Jones created a little film that feels like a big film and deserves praise for what he tried to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones, Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying, I cannot imagine why such a large percentage of the comments are so negative. Must be because this is very much a reflective film and generally people are stupid and don't like reflection; they want bright lights and action. (Like the wife, Lou Ann, watching television almost constantly. She is no mental giant.) However, the voting reflects that a LOT of the IMDb members really like this film; I guess that is more significant.Tommy Lee Jones: I have come to really appreciate him, and lately he has done so much quality work. He has been a superlative actor on In the Valley of Elah, No Country for Old Men, directing himself in this film -- in the more distant past he was terrific in The Eyes of Laura Mars, Coal Miner's Daughter, and, yes, as a Man in Black. Now I find that he has directed an extremely good film, with some excellent personnel.If people are confused by the plot with its shifting back and forth in time, they are not paying attention. If they don't understand the ending, I would love to hear what they said about that awful There Will Be Blood (great acting, highly ambiguous). My friend and I were anticipating everything that would happen in this film, not because it was predictable but because, given the state of the characters' lives, it was inevitable. I don't usually bother rating a film unless it's really good, or at least over 5. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada was exceptional. Unfortunately it must not have done well in the box office because nobody seemed to know about it. I had seen it mentioned several times on IMDb when I was looking up other stuff, so I suspected that it would be a good film to see. I was VERY impressed, even more so than with another uncommon Western, The Propostion. I even think this was better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Journey of Life and Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a first effort for major motion pictures, Tommy Lee Jones pulls off a great piece of work in The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. The division between Mexican and American relations across the border is examined in depth as three men must sacrifice everything; life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Each star does their best effort to make the film even more believable than it already is. Tommy Lee Jones in the lead, Barry Pepper as the supporting character Mike Norton, who is significant to the story.I also enjoyed the soundtrack that was used in this film, as it was a country based film, using country music. The other musically thing that was a great addition to this film was that Dwight Yoakam co-stars as well, It always seems though that his character is a strange man, in this case, even more so. Jones directs his cast so well, that it is hard to believe he could be on set when the cast was referring to his character, without laughing.Jones also uses flashbacks quite a bit towards the beginning of the film when the death of Melquiades is being examined and questioned, which then dissipates towards the end, after Melquiades is unearthed to be reburied in Mexico. The final journey then begins, and the story starts to flow smoother.The border patrol, the police, and a man on a mission are the basis for the film. With a man in tow, Pete Perkins has one last thing to do that he promised his friend. The journey that they take is significant of Mikle Norton's personal soul and his maturing as a human being. Therefore, Mike must come to terms with his own demons. Norton is as well faced with irony when the woman that he bat up must treat him, and he did not die.A very scenic film in which Tommy Lee Jones shows that he can be a great director of major motion pictures, and he directs himself with such clarity that the film works so well. The ending of the film when Pete Perkins leaves on horseback as Mike Norton stands watching left me wondering what might happen. Would Norton go back to the United States? Where will Pete go? We may never know, but that is what makes the ending work so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few things: first, making a film ponderous and largely uneventful does not automatically make it 'stately' and deserving of awards and this film, I think, does suffer delusions of grandeur. However, second: it's still very good. Not very, very good, which it'd like to be, but very good all the same. Tommy Lee Jones is as impressive in front of the camera as he is behind it, Barry Pepper is very good in an unpleasant role and the ending delivers the wanted punch, but this is just not quite a classic. So, third: watch this and like it, but in a toss up watch Unforgiven instead as it is better (and, you know, stately?) and treads very similar ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Presumably Jones makes junk like Man of the House so that he can make films like this...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones appears to be taking the Clint Eastwood route of film-making with this slow-moving tale about friendship and dreams, and hopefully it won't be another ten years before he steps behind the camera, as this is a worthwhile effort that quickly draws you into the lives of its characters and shows ? with varying degrees of success ? that people in general aren't Good or Bad, they're just people.Jones plays Pete Perkins, a rancher who befriends one of his ranch-hands, the eponymous Mexican Melquaides Estrada (Julio Cedillo), who is subsequently killed by sadistic border guard Mike Norton (Barry Pepper). The growing friendship between the two men is shown in flashback between scenes of Perkins efforts to return Melquaides body to his wife and children so that he can be buried on his homeland. Perkins kidnaps Norton to help him do this when it becomes apparent that the town's inadequate sheriff (Dwight Yoakam)is going to do anything about the murder.The film explores the importance of friendship to people ? especially a grizzled loner like Perkins, for whom a friendship like the one he shared with Estrada is all the more important because of its comparative rarity. Perkins bestows upon Estrada's corpse a dignity that is at odds with both some of the situations in which they find themselves and with the true circumstances of the man who Perkins believed had let him into his life. In the end, the fact that Estrada's 'life' as embodied in the family photograph he showed Perkins, is a sham is unimportant ? it was the person he was around Perkins, and the friendship he offered, that mattered. Perkins drunken phone call to Rachel (Melissa Leo), the married diner waitress who offers casual sex to both Perkins and the sheriff, shows that he understands all too well the painful emotions that can give rise to unrealistic dreams.Jones direction is pretty good here. He chooses the occasionally curious angle and gets a little fancy every now and then but, for the most part, he concentrates on the people and the story, which is played out against some stunning scenery. Only the character arc of Mike Norton, the sadistic guard played so well by Barry Pepper, fails to ring true. His redemption, when it finally comes, is too quick, and prompted by incidents that don't seem to merit a personal revelation on such a scale. Having said that, while troubling, this is a minor gripe and a flaw that doesn't detract too much from the film's overall impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Border Country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The western typically presents the American west of one hundred years ago as a wild, desolate place; but so does 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada', Tommy Lee Jones' contemporary directorial debut. But instead of telling the story of wild men who chose to live beyond an expanding law, it tells of those whom the law consciously abandons: illegal Mexican immigrants in the modern-day United States. It's interesting to note that the start of the film is set in Odessa, the Texas town where the Bush family made fortunes; but it could be set in another world. The film sticks to genre, however, in the idea of a lone hero (played by Jones himself) driven by his personal sense of justice. The tone is sparse, and in places nasty; the plot slow moving, and yet, in conclusion, it grows into a surprisingly moving reflection on man's relationship, and duty, to his fellow man. I'm not a huge fan of westerns in general; but make the effort to stick with this movie, and it will repay you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There shall be justice in this world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I have come to elevate Tommy Lee Jones higher and higher into the small group of acting greats. Just last night I watched again "Coal Miners Daughter" in which Jones shines (and which an insane Academy ignored that year). Like other greats like Robert Duval, Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson he brings a serious adult maturity to his work and he rarely disappoints. That craggy face, the sly and wicked grin that pulls the lines in his cheeks into sharp crevices, that voice....he just is so captivating.This is an interesting film which covers familiar territory with an unsettling freshness. In the post 9/11 American climate of fear, the issue of cross border - enemy incursion is front and center. It is a sad commentary on the poverty of the southern border; consider here in Canada where we share the largest open and unmonitored and undefended common border with the Yankees. By and large we take it for granted and only at the clogged junctions of say Niagara Falls and Detroit/Windsor, both sides just don't much think of it. I'm sure the Homeland Security people do but that's their job. The Mexican border is quite another story. In this months National Geographic is yet another story about people from even further south of Mexico who leave their very poor countries, traveling through Mexico with an obvious eye on that border to work and a new life in America. That is the foundation upon which this film begins.But, of course that would be a two dimensional story, already in the news. Instead we have an unexpected insistence on justice coming from a lonely cowboy. After being frustrated by a disinterested local Sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones takes matters into his own hands. With shades of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" he forces the offending officer to undergo a trip that he will never forget. In a version of tough cowboy/desert justice, he drags his unwilling by cowed prisoner into fulfilling and giving respect to the deceased Mexican.I had to chuckle at some point (ok, here is spoiler) when I recalled Jones obsessively transporting a dead body....almost exactly like he did in the wonderful "Lonesome Dove". Made me laugh.This is a terrific film made all the better because the drama is not revealed in a straight, A,B,C fashion. The story comes back and forth, telling us after the fact what just happened and why. The determination of Jones to escape detection is not done with high anxiety. In sure and plodding ways he makes his way slowly without so much as the slightest worry that the Border Patrol will catch him. There is a type of lethargic, slow motion crawl to the way in which people show up for their jobs, taking their duties in a detached, who gives a care, attitude. This gives the movie time to remind us of the ambiguity of the border, the fence and finally, justice. At the end (spoiler....) when everyone expects him to finish the trek with violence, Jones realizes that justice is complete and there is no more need to continue punishing the culprit. In a nod to a cowboy and western codes of law and order, justice had been done and that was all that was necessary. A film that has no intention of providing simple answers to the border and illegal alien issue, it nonetheless forces us to confront the detached way almost all of us view this ongoing story. A very fine effort by Jones and an excellent cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Texas: The State of Solitude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Must be something about Texas that causes normal society, at least as I understand it, to break down. Every movie I see about Texas that isn't a western (but even some of those too) is populated with lonely and alienated characters. The barren landscape is almost a prison - there's nothing out there. Even down to individual scenes, there aren't a lot of two shots. Mostly medium close ups, creating a separation between people even if they're in the same room.Some live in Texas because of that loneliness, some live there in spite of it, and some just didn't know what they were getting themselves into. Border Patrol officer Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) seems to get by okay without any connection to other people. He sees the Mexicans trying to cross the border as hardened criminals and treats them accordingly. He has sex with his wife and she practically doesn't even notice. He pleasures himself one day in the quiet desert when he's interrupted by gunshots. His silence shattered, his solitude intruded upon, he panics and fires back. He kills Melquiades Estrada and tries to hide the body in the desert.Melquiades was an illegal immigrant hired by Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones, also directing) and a good man who didn't deserve to be shot down by some rookie cop. Pete wants revenge, but he won't just kill him - because what's the point of that? He forces Norton to dig up "Mel" (for the second time) and help him move the body back to his village in Mexico. They go on a sort of odyssey to get there, meeting a blind man who lives (surprise) all alone and a band of Mexicans headed for the U.S. border. It's funny how all the Americans in this movie lead lonely, desperate lives, but all the Mexicans seem to be relatively happy in or outside of their communities. All the white people are on their own; all the immigrants are in a group together.Jones is sort of famous for encouraging filmmakers to shoot in Texas (this movie and No Country for Old Men at least). He must know that the isolation of Texas can't be reproduced in another state. I'd have to agree with him there, even having never been. But I can't say it makes me want to move to Texas. Even if everyone there was as loyal to their friends as Pete is to Mel, I do believe I'd go a little bit crazy looking at all that nothing out there in between the hills.http://www.movieswithmark.com</fullReview>

I am a fan of Barry Pepper, but think he as done better in other roles.Regarding the story line, I was baffled by the claim by the woman Melquiades said was his wife: that she had never known him.

		<fullReview>The title was misleading to me before I saw it because I believed that title referred to three different deaths and Melquiades Estrada was a city. Melquiades Estrada actually refers to a man and the title the same death, but three different burials.The film is very enthralling, and absorbing as well as brutal. The first half nearly lost me with its jumbled time frames and mired look at the players of the story, but the second half more than makes up for the first half's ugliness. Tommy Lee Jones does a great job with this film as an actor and director (this is his directorial debut by the way). The best part of this film is its story though.The story is one of redemption. Tommy Lee Jones plays the friend of the title character Melquiades Estrada, who happens to the films most likable character. Melquiades Estrada, of course, is murdered during the course of the film, and Jones manages to discover the identity of the murdered. Jones then forces the murderer to accompany him as he carries out his promise to Estrada to bury him in his hometown. What happens on this journey is definitely the best part of the film.The film is great and should have received some notice from the Academy for its daring, and beautiful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent 21st century Western revenge/redemption tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning this reminded me of The Border (1982) starring Jack Nicholson and Harvey Keitel. A new border guard and his wife arrive in a south Texas town and live in a trailer. She's bored stiff while her husband learns the new job and the border patrol culture. However instead of all the corruption that Jack Nicholson found, here we find that it is the new border guard who is morally corrupt. What is surprising is how easily Three Burials gradually turns into a 21st century Western with the classic revenge theme played out in a most dramatic way.Tommy Lee Jones stars as Pete Perkins, a weathered cowboy somewhat past his prime who befriends a Mexican--the Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedilla) of the title--who has come across the border. One day when the new border guard Mike Norton is out in the hills looking for wetbacks (actually horny Mike has a Hustler magazine in his hands and his pants half down, and he's about to do something else) he hears a rifle shot nearby. He pulls his pants up, runs to his vehicle, grabs his rifle and then just shoots the first target he sees. It's Melquiades Estrada. And he is now dead. Turns out Melquiades was shooting at a coyote that was after his herd of goats.Meanwhile (back at the ranch, so to speak) Mike Norton's wife Lou Ann (January Jones), still bored to tears, has become friends with Rachel (Melissa Lee), a saucy waitress who sets up an adulterous double date with Pete (for her) and Melquiades (for Lou Ann). Well, this could get complex and lead to trouble big time for somebody. Maybe.Dwight Yoakam plays a sheriff named Belmont who is being harangued by Pete to find out who shot Melquiades. But Belmont is in no hurry since this is just a wetback and especially since it looks like it might have been a border patrol shooting. I forget why the body is dug up the first time but the second comes after Pete learns from Rachel that it was Mike Norton who pulled the trigger. Pete takes the law into his own hands and kidnaps Mike and makes him dig up the somewhat decomposing body the second time. Pete is sworn to take the body of his friend back to the little town from which Melquiades sprang. Mike in handcuffs is going along for the ride. And a hellish ride it will be. The third burial comes near the end of the film, and you can guess who's going to do the digging.What makes this work is the fine acting all around and the realistic feel created by Tommy Lee Jones. The trek south is filled with adventure and danger, and along the way Mike begins a forced atonement for his crime. The character of Pete Perkins is one you'll not soon forget. He is an eccentric hero, strong and morally steadfast. It's an interesting tale very well presented with a lot of color and atmosphere.See this for Tommy Lee Jones who gives a fine performance while directing himself in his feature film directorial debut.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>tour de force twist on the revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film made me cry.NOTE: Somewhat spoiling text follows, but not too bad. I don't think it would spoil your enjoyment of the movie. If it tips your hand toward going out of your way to watch it, it'll be worth it.When does Pepper's character finally break down and admit that he was wrong; that it's wrong to take a man's life and not, at the very least, admit that wrongdoing in the depths of your soul? Mix this with what would otherwise be staid elements of a revenge flick--the lawless, desert borderlands; the taking-of-the-boots; a dear friend to memorialize properly and reverentially--and you've got something very special, if not precious.That said, there are a few weak points. For example, the whole setup involving the murder was not done right. Subsequently, it's up to you to suspend your disbelief a bit and flesh in the dynamic of that sequence; mostly involving Pepper's character's dread and cowardice.Still, not too shabby for a movie that dares to make repentance and redemption a core Western movie value! Finally, a note: How nice to see Levon Helm act! I just reviewed "The Last Waltz," and it's great to see his peculiar grace and style on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Serious, Often Gritty Screenplay Doubled with Tommy Lee Jones as Both Director and Lead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones has done more than paid his dues; his acting expertise has grown exponentially over the years, and now he not only plays a dynamic lead, but is, for the first time, directing himself and his awesome cast! As good as this is, I hope to see more of Jones, both behind and in front of the camera. He conveys a tough but caring self assurance to his characters, which endears him to his audience. Though he typically portrays a law enforcement officer in one capacity or another, he is competent and gifted in that he can change that type-casting at will.This story is highly compelling fiction, while it gives a cinematic glimpse into the world of borders, border patrol, and those who live in that world. But more than that, it tells a complicated and enthralling story, which entertains completely.I liked it, though it isn't my usual cup of tea.It rates a 7.4/10 for performance quality from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a case of third time lucky? or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Tommy Lee Jones the best lead actor and character actor in the business today? I think you'd be hard pressed to find any better, currently.There's intensity about Jones that just shines, piercing through the most banal of stories (e.g. Men in Black) to show what he can do with good material in this movie: the almost surreal landscape of the border land between USA and Mexico, and a finely drawn cast of supporting characters, lead by Barry Pepper as the almost psychopathic border guard, Mike Norton, who inadvertently kills Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) who, in turn, just happens to be a good friend of Pete Perkins (Jones). From that event, the story unfolds...But, not how you think it would, or does. Because, in the first place, it's written by Guillermo Arriaga, well known by now as the author of Amores Perros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003). Knowing the manner in which those narratives were constructed should give you ample warning that this narrative follows a similar pattern: the interleaving of past, present and future events into a kaleidoscope of images that you, the viewer, must arrange in your mind as you go along. Not as pronounced as it was in 21 Grams, but still a bit of a chore to put together. Maybe the producer and director had a few words with Arriaga before filming started? One day, I'd like to see something different from Arriaga, y'know...There's realism about this movie that you rarely see in other modern westerns. About the only ones that come to mind are Lonely are the Brave (1962) with Kirk Douglas in his finest role, or perhaps The Misfits (1961) with Clark Gable in, arguably, his finest role also (and just before he died). All three stars epitomize that most important quality about the American western hero: compassion and toughness are not mutually exclusive, and especially when the demands of modern living seek to erode loyalty between true friends.Overall, it's a sad story of incompetence, stupidity, meanness, and lying that serve to show humanity, particularly men, at its worst. But, it's also a story about how even the worst of us is capable of changing his mind and become a better person. So, of course, there are winners and losers and the only question at the end is: who is better off ? Pete Perkins or Mike Norton? Highly recommended to all who like a great story, excellent acting, and equally good direction by Jones. See it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent directorial debut from Tommy Lee Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Tommy Lee Jones re-invents the western with his searing directorial debut, which only enjoyed a limited theatrical release but received much deserved rave reviews and applause from critics.The man himself plays Pete Perkins, a local rancher in the autumn of his life who whiles away his time enjoying an affair with Rachel (Melissa Leo), the wife of a local cafe owner and hanging out with his best friend Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) horse-riding, fishing and general bonding. Enter Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), a border patrolman who's just moved to Cincinnatti with his pretty but high maintenance wife Lou Ann (January Jones.) He's earned a nasty reputation for rough handling of immigrants, but this all comes to a head when he stupidly kills Melquiades and buries him in a shallow grave. When the police fail to do anything about the crime, Pete takes the law into his own hands, kidnaps Mike at gunpoint, ties up Lou Ann and takes Mike on a journey across the desert to honour a promise to Melquiades and bury him between two beautiful hills in his hometown of Mexico.For a while, the western had been a genre that had become pretty stale and stagnant, brushed aside in these modern times for more wild, frenetic Matrix style entertainment. So maybe it's not so surprising that TTBOME was wearily trollied out to cinema goers in the UK. But Total Film magazine calls it 'the finest western since Unforgiven' and it would be hard to find fault in that statement.Texas native Jones has chosen a genre he's obviously familiar with for his directorial debut and given it a unique shine and polish of his own. He's also succeeded in crafting a slow, moody and quietly absorbing tale that's at it's best in it's cleverly under-stated moments. It's odd seeing the usual wild, snazzy characters he plays being transfered for such a gruff, humourless character like this but then this is a film filled to the brim with grimly realistic characters. He handles the lead role well, and rising star Pepper is also fantastic in the supporting role, delivering a couple of emotionally devastating scenes that make his role a great main part of the movie.A fine film, then, crafted with great care by a director and star passionate about the project he's making and taking us on an unforgettable discovery of emotional torment and revenge. Catch it if you can. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times, Three Burials is a good and entertaining film. Occasionally it makes one reflect on the battle of migration that's being fought along the U.S.'s southern border. But just as often it made me wonder if Pete, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was just a loon.During the first half hour, the film's timeline is jumbled up, I suppose to keep us guessing as to what's happened and will happen, and perhaps to keep us from nodding off. Melquiades obviously dies - no spoiler there, I hope - but not before having a little tet-a-tet with the blonde, blue-eyed wife of an agent of the border patrol (la migra).In this sequence, which I simply don't buy, BTW (the bored gringa housewife of a border patrolman running off to a motel with a Mexican national, ain't gonna happen), Melquiades is stunned to find this woman within reach and ultimately in his arms. There's something there, unbelievable as it is, that's true, I think. For a soft-spoken, dark-skinned illegal, the idea of holding a model-thin, good-looking, blonde, American is an impossible dream, one that he can't quite believe has come true.Later, when he's dead, Pete's need for justice runs into indifference on the part of local law enforcement and he decides to take matters into his own hands. This is a good 45 minutes into the film - the pacing is deliberate throughout - and it's here that things begin to get a little strange.All in all, it's a pretty good film, but go into it not expecting too much in the way of action - it's a slow-moving, thoughtful film, not a western shoot 'em up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rancher Pete Perkins (Jones) had promised his ranch-hand Mel that if anything happened to him that he would take his body back to Mexico for burial in Mel's hometown. Pete and Mike (Pepper) take Mel back to Mexico after Mel is fatally shot.Although the movie is a slow roll, the fun is in the journey with this one as you are not quite sure what is going to happen next. Add to this they are being chased by the Texas Rangers and the U.S. Border Patrol. Even though there isn't much dialogue throughout, Barry Pepper should get an Oscar nomination for his role here as he is really put thru the wringer by Pete on the journey to Mel's home town. The rest of the cast also performed well under the direction of Tommy Lee Jones.What would have made this more enjoyable would have been the insertion of some humor along the way. Even dry humor would have been nice. But, Director Jones played it too straight and serious. Not that this wasn't serious, but the only humor installed was when Sheriff Belmont (Yoakam) who was having an affair with the wife of Bob, the diner owner, had a case of ED. Funny, but not ha ha funny. Of course, some of the things Pete has Mike do could have passed for humor to some people. Maybe.The cinematography was excellent. I didn't know there was a shifting-sand type desert in Mexico, and some of the high ridges the horses had to negotiate brought back my fear of heights.You will like Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Pete, an old time cowboy with old time values. You know, like the kind we are all supposed to have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a rare and extraordinarily interesting modern western centering around illegal immigration at the Texas/Mexico border. The complicated plot begins with the discovery of a corpse half-buried in the Texas desert. The shooting victim is one Melquiades Estrada, a young illegal immigrant with a wife and family back in Mexico. His buddy, Pete Perkins (played by Jones himself), a gringo with a natural affinity for Mexican immigrants, discovers that the killer is a violent, hotheaded young border patrol agent named Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), who, it turns out, shot Estrada more out of fear and confusion than any sense of malice. Realizing that the authorities have no intention of bringing Estrada's killer to justice, Pete takes matters into his own hands by kidnapping Norton and dragging him to Mexico on horseback so that together they can fulfill Estrada's expressed wish to be buried there in his native soil.Guillermo Arriaga has written a screenplay that is gritty, subtle and not at all interested in following a pre-arranged formula. He allows the story to go off in unexpected directions and we are more than happy to follow right along with it. So seamless is Arriaga in moving back and forth in time that it takes a full half hour before we realize that much of what we have been watching has actually been in the form of flashbacks. Yet, rather than making us confused, this approach only piques our interest further and makes us want to see how it will all turn out. Arriaga has also created characters with subtle shadings. For instance, even though Perkins is acting out of righteous anger in defense of the friend he loved, some of his actions reveal an underlying element of sadism in his personality. In much the same way, Norton is not portrayed as a one-dimensional villain, but rather as a deeply troubled man with the potential for redemption if someone could just find some way to tap the goodness that is lurking at his core. Even though most of the scenes center around these two men, the film is filled with a whole host of memorable, finely drawn secondary characters who contribute both to the plot and to the desert community milieu of the film.As a director, Jones, working with cinematographer Chris Menges, makes the setting an integral part of the drama, showing how both the beauty and the harshness of the environment ultimately affect human behavior. And Jones has elicited riveting performances not just from himself and Pepper, but from Dwight Yoakum, Melissa Leo and January Jones in various supporting roles.It's true that the film comes equipped with an obvious political slant; Jones and Arriaga portray the Mexicans in a far more sympathetic light than they do the border patrol officers or the American law enforcement officials. It would be a shame, however, for a viewer to let that one aspect deprive him of reveling in the fine film-making and first-rate storytelling that is at the heart of "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another brilliant modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first thoughts on watching this, was 'why hasn't Tommy Lee Jones directed anything sooner?'. This is simply a brilliant story well told and without any of the usual flashy hand held camera usage or art-house style moving camera which can be annoying and has put me off cinema for a while. Tommy Lee Jones prefers to let the camera, characters, story and scenery tell this morality tale superbly.The story comes in when Border Patrol man Norton has arrived in this part of Texas from Cinncinnati with his young wife Lou Ann. Setting up home in their trailer park house, the couple settle into life in this bleak end of Texas. Norton goes to work as the border patrolman whilst his wife spends her days drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes whilst watching the curiously weird, large folk of the trailer park in their everyday business. She also breaks up the boredom with a little prostitution; in this case, entertaining the Mexican of the title whilst her waitress friend does the same with Tommy Lee's character, Pete.Both Pete and Melquiades are both 'cowboy' ranch workers. They strike up a good friendship based on mutual stories, giving horses and, of course, finding women. All of this side of the story is shown in retrospective. The film had opened with Mel's death at the hands of Norton's rifle, a terrible accident committed by Norton when the patrolman believed Mel was firing at him (actually Mel was firing at a coyote threatening his livestock). Mel pays with his life and Pete, frustrated at the lack of interest in the Mexican's death by the other border patrolmen who buried him, decides to remedy this for the sake of his friend's memory.Unlike The Proposition, Three Burials is not such of a revenge movie. Norton is being taught a vital lesson by Pete as he is tied to a horse and taken, with the dead Mexican, by Pete, back to the Mexican's home and family. Along the way, little things remind us that our actions can come back to haunt us. In the case of Norton, he is bitten by a snake and has to go to the Mexican woman he hit on the nose earlier in the film for healing. She pays him by healing him but in the process leaves him in a lot of pain. Finally, Norton is urged to seek forgiveness and to help bury the dead Mexican, thinking he is going to wind up in the same grave, but Pete spares him. The lesson, it seems, has been learnt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best friends Pete and Melquiades are both ranch workers. Melquiades though is an illegal immigrant, crossing the boarder to work, Pete keeping this fact from the authorities. Recently moving into the area, Mike is a new officer to the boarder patrol. While on duty, Mike accidentally shoots and kills Melquiades, thinking he was firing upon him. When the body is recovered, Pete vows to find his killer. Once Pete discovers Mike killed Melquiades, Pete kidnaps Mike and tracks across the boarder to bury Melquiades in his home town.Written by Guillermo Arriaga, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada has the same nuances of his other scripts 21 Grams and Amores Perros. Utilizing the same disjointed narrative, Three Burials starts off alienating. The story arc jumps around and at times in-cohesive, and takes its time to move into a sequential story line. Yet Arriaga is such a gifted writer. Three Burials is densely layered in symbolism, in an exploration of the tensions between the USA and Mexican boarder. Melquiades's decaying body is a great metaphor of humanities deterioration and our post 9/11 times.Though at its core, Three Burials is about friendship, retribution and justice. Melquiades's death ultimately an accident, Pete is out for revenge. Three Burials has a constant air of dread, which resides on suffocating levels. There is such a morbid sensibility, it reaches depressing heights. It runs off this one beat of morbidity, its emotionally hollow and insular. In a scene where Pete drags Mike across a river by the neck, director Tommy Lee Jones should have our emotions kicking and screaming along this journey, yet your left distant from the sadistic undertones.The brilliant part of Three Burials is the impeccable acting. Tommy Lee Jones is mesmerising in his expressionless, verging dead pan performance; he really carries the film. Barry Pepper is equally great as Mike, being dragged across the country. Dwight Yoakam, Melissa Leo and January Jones are fine in their supporting roles.The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a modern day western, drawing parallel to Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, exploring the harsh side of cowboy life. Yet to the extreme undertones, Three Burials comes off a little too cold for comfort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada", one really gets the feeling of Texas. There's the mixture of white and Hispanic culture, the tension between the groups, and the omnipresent music. As the rancher trying to give his ranch-hand proper burial, Tommy Lee Jones seems to represent the older version of the Lone Star State, slowly but surely going out and looking for a path in life. It's interesting that they portray new arrival Barry Pepper as the suspicion-inducing character, as we would probably expect the old Texan to be such.I do admit that the whole issue of tension between ethnic groups is sort of a cliché in movies, but this movie looks at them so as to keep the viewer engaged. It's certainly one that I recommend. Also starring January Jones, Dwight Yoakam and Levon Helm.</fullReview>

I have been recommending this flick to anyone who will listen. Good show mates, very good show. I thought the acting by Tommy Lee Jones was the best that I have seen him, although I can't really decide if it is the acting or the character. Both really captivated me. And the cat that plays Melquiades is somehow charming. But it is really the story that I like. It is so unusual and still realistic.

		<fullReview>An independent flick, directed by star Tommy Lee Jones, 3 BURIALS is a modern Western about the accidental killing of a ranch hand and the odyssey to return his body to his hometown in a tiny, possibly nonexistent Mexican town. Jones as the aging ranch owner represents the Old West and its traditional values of friendship and loyalty. Barry Pepper is a disaffected, abusive border guard who shoots the ranch hand -- an illegal -- more or less by accident. These two very different men go through hell and high water, literally, to deliver the body to its final resting place. Some comic elements keep the film from becoming too morbid, but it is definitely on the grim side and decidedly in hard "R" territory. An almost unrecognizable Dwight Yoakam has an amusing turn as a burned-out sheriff who finally decides he's had enough. Melissa Leo provides a first-rate performance as Jones' love interest, a middle-aged diner waitress married to the diner's owner, who is well into his 70s and whom she loves dearly. Levon Helm has a cameo as a blind man living in the desert. The ending leaves us sort of hanging, but it's obvious that's what Jones intended. Definitely not a Hollywood job, 3 BURIALS will appeal to the art-house and college crowd rather the masses, who couldn't care less about Westerns, anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had very mixed feelings after watching The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, it is obviously a well made film and has artistic merit, yet I very much did not enjoy viewing experience. The cinematography is great and the locations are incredibly gorgeous. Tommy Lee Jones is also impressive in his feature film directorial debut and I'm looking forward to his new film The Homesman as a result (its release was the reason I watched "Three Burials"). However, I found several elements lacking, one of which was the writing. I didn't feel like there was sufficient character development, and besides the blind man I did not really feel for any of the characters. Similarly, I could not understand Pete's actions after he learns who Melquiades' murderer is. There are several scenes showing their friendship, but I felt like these were lacking. This might also be due to the editing. I felt like the meshing of the multiple timelines did not work at all and was frustrated throughout most of the opening acts. The story seemed to me to skip around randomly. Lastly, I was not particularly impressed with the performances of this stunning cast, which I think might be attributed do the dialogue. Perhaps if I was more fluent in Spanish I might have appreciated this film more, though I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Tommy Lee Jones, so I thought I'd take this one out from the local library. It sounded good from the description on the cover, but I have to say I was very disappointed. It is a movie about nothing, really. Jones plays a demented old cowboy who seeks to avenge the accidental death of his new-found friend at the hands of a Border Patrol agent, played by Barry Pepper. He gives a terrific performance as the soulless trailer-trash agent who finds a soul before the end of the picture.In the meanwhile, though, director Jones treats us to a meandering, tedious story which is sorely in need of some action and an element of tension. I found the numerous flashbacks were misleading and confusing, and this in a story which was barely holding my interest.Those of you who found it artful and meaningful, more power to you. I thought the best things about the film were the aforementioned Pepper and the camera work on the Mexican countryside. This picture can't hold a candle to "No Country For Old Men".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an exceptional modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who haven't seen it, suffice as warning to say that this film resembles Sam Peckinpah's "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" in more ways than simply the title. It's a gruesome film on occasion, but all the ugliness is constantly in contrast with the gorgeous natural surroundings, superbly photographed by Chris Menges. The film is something of a personal project for star Tommy Lee Jones, and never has a film so well suited his craggy countenance and his preternaturally calm presence.Jones plays Pete, a Texan farmer who becomes enraged at the death of his best friend, an illegal worker on his farm, Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), and particularly goes off the deep end when he discovers that the local sheriff (Dwight Yoakam) doesn't plan on prosecuting the U.S. Border Patrolman (Barry Pepper) responsible for his death. He takes the revenge, or the redemption, upon himself, kidnapping Pepper's agent Mike Norton and taking him on an epic journey into the heart of Northern Mexico to find the proper place to bury his friend Estrada.Thankfully, the situation between the two men never descends into any kind of typical "buddy" situation; instead the tension between them mounts until the final explosion in Pete's discovered or fantasy "Jimenez." In the course of the journey it's discovered that Estrada may not be quite who he said he was, although much of that is left up for the audience as well as the characters to ponder. As the film draws near its close, Norton takes it upon himself to ask the audience's question: "Are you gonna be all right?" We're left to wonder.This is just an excellent film, full of great performances and wonderful beauty. It's good enough that I'm not sure that I really have it all figured out after the first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jones' directing debut one of the better modern-day westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' debut film as director is pretty nearly exactly what I think of when I hear the phrase "modern-day-western". This is a film that's awfully hard ? because of the irregular, fascinating and unexpected flashback structure ? to describe in any real detail without giving away a large chunk of the plot, so suffice it to say the title character (Julio Cedello) is a Mexican immigrant who is, indeed, dead and does, in fact, suffer the indignity of multiple burials through the course of the film, mostly at the behest of his rather crazy friend Peter Perkins (Jones), and that this involves the unwilling cooperation of a border patrol officer (Barry Pepper) who Jones finds to be deeply involved in the death of Estrada. The TexMex border flavor is well realized, the performances are generally excellent, and the photography (by Chris Menges) is absolutely stunning ? how I wish I'd managed to see this on the big screen, it's just gorgeous and makes a fair comparison with the similarly located "No Country for Old Men"; it's a fine film that suffers only from a bit too much repetition in the final act ? there is so much going on in the first 2/3 of the film that when you realize that you're finally in a straightforward narrative towards an inevitable conclusion, you can't help but feel a little let down. Still, a terrific debut and one of the best westerns of the past couple of decades. DVD rental.</fullReview>

Tommy Lee Jones has been a master at his craft as an actor for decades. He evolved from that to his directorial debut with this film in an elegant fashion.

		<fullReview>Melquiades Estrada(Juan Cedillo) came to the States for about the same reasons that many do: promise of a better life and a chance to either bring his family here or be able to provide for them over there. That promise is cut down when he is shot and killed--mistakenly so--by an unstable and relatively new border patrolman named Mike Norton(Barry Pepper,all dead-eyed and emotionally constipated). Estrada's best friend--well,in truth,really his only friend--here in the states is equally lonely and grizzled fellow rancher Pete Perkins(Tommy Lee Jones,directing as well as starring)does not cotton to the mistreatment his friend is given,first by the border patrol,then the local authorities,who randomly bury him anywhere,since he has no known relatives around. IN a move that is both highly questionable,yet strangely apropos the situation and Perkins' character,he takes drastic action to make sure his friend is re-buried back in his homeland and home town.Jones' treatment of a story/script by Guerillmo Arriaga is something of an artistic conceit,and I suspect that as many or more viewers of this film will be alienated by that as they will be enchanted by it. The show splits,for the most part,into three segments,and the initial set-up is VERY non-linear and choppy,almost causing me to want to downgrade my rating. But by the last part,it worked perfectly and displayed the true reflective,odd and solemn character of the story. It could be argued that this movie is a rather "dry" film:in other words,there are not that many juicy acting parts here,so the performances of note really come down to a worthy few,with JOnes,Pepper (who is effective in spite of being very difficult to warm up to), January JOnes (as Pepper's nearly child-like wife),Melissa Leo(as the loose corner waitress who's the closest thing to a love interest for Jones' character) and Dwight Yoakham (as the increasingly impatient local lawman). The show's themes of redemption and loneliness are as effective as they are sometimes difficult to watch. PAtience is an absolute must to viewing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated film from a wonderful writer/director duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times 21 Grams others Don Quixote. A meaningless killing, leads to three burials and a quest with a corpse through Mexico, Arriaga(the screenwriter here, formerly of Babel, Ammores Perros, 21 Grams) as always weaves in themes both global and personal, political and poetic, with a skill and restraint not often seen. Ostensibally a modern western, this film shares with those others an ostensibly simple event told through a variety of chronologies and characters, great stuff. As with those other films it does tend to have a slow pace, but it does so give the viewer a grander scenic sense of the landscape Arriaga and Tommy Lee Jones, who direction should not be overlooked, unfold for us, a literate, mindful, grossly underrated modern western which manages to say many powerful things about the world today and human life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fate enforcement depicted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I watched this. This is the movie which can be said to "be different, not like others".For me, this movie tells us that everyone has a path in life. The path, which can be changed by what we do. The path, which can be enforced.The plot is built around an accidental murder of an innocent man. The story is displayed mixed, with both current and past events displayed side-by-side. Following the storyline, we learn the psychology behind the acts of each character. The interesting part is that completely nothing is said about the characters - we only observe them living, talking, acting, and feeling.The innocent, who was killed, enforced a kind of fate both on his best friend and on his killer. The fate takes those two through the path of comprehension and understanding - different path for each of them, evidently.Despite the serious ideas visible through the visual row of the movie, it is also a comedy. The woman going out with three men says to one of them, that she cannot escape with him to Mexico, because she loves her husband. In reply to "you told me I'm the only one you love", she explains: "this is completely different...".The end of the movie leaves us completely uncertain as to what happened next to the main characters. Their common and differing paths ended by lifting the fate enforcement, and we cannot know what is next. Though it appears clear that the fate twisted their ways bizarrely, probably without any chances of restoring the status quo.P.S. As a side note, inspired by another review-comment: boredom is really the engine for the events of the movie, except for when Pete takes on a quest of bringing his friend home: then it is not boredom driving him anymore. Boredom drives unmotivated actions in the movie, and this is worth seeing as well - to be warned.</fullReview>

Barry Pepper plays the killer, in denial of his act. Melissa Leo, late of Homicide On The Street, turns in a fine performance as Jones's love interest. Levon Helm has a cameo appearance but one you'll remember.This is Jones's directorial debut. No doubt fans of the Lonseome Dove mini series will smile wryly as Jones takes home his friend, as he did Robert Duvall, this time facing different obstacles to reach his goal.Tommy Lee Jones looks every day his 60 years and one wonders if any make - up was required. He is truly one of the great character actors of his time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Boy digs deep here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are graving I mean craving for a quirky western-type film about a delusional ranch-hand who seeks revenge on a border patrol officer who killed the ranchman's best friend then you should dig into the indie film "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada". I swear to death that this will be the only film ever made about a delusional ranch-hand who seeks revenge on a border patrol officer who killed the ranchman's best friend. The film is the brainwork of Tommy Lee Jones. I guess Jones was "jonesing" to create an unconventional film, which is what "The Three Burials of (do I really have to finish typing the entire title?)" encompasses much of. Jones not only directs it but also stars as ranch-hand Pete Perkins. Pistol Pete discovers that his best friend, Mexican immigrant Melquiades Estrada, is killed by a dodgy border patrol officer named Mike Norton played by Barry Pepper. Perkins' mission is to seize Norton and and force him to give Melquiades a proper burial in Estrada's Mexican village. The film does display flashbacks of Perkins &amp; Estrada's friendship. However, for the most part we see Estrada as a "Chip" of the dead block. Yes! Just like Eric Estrada's career, Melquiades is mostly shown in the film "good as dead". Sorry Ponch! Do not cinematically arrest me! OK, enough! Writer Guillermo Arriaga, best known as Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's right-hand write man, once again contributes a razor-sharp, brainy screenplay. Jones was incisive with his freshman directorial effort, and was scarcely charismatic with his not-so-freshman acting effort. However, it was Pepper's peppery and emotional thespian work that I most digged about "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada". The young acting supporting acting guns of January Jones as Norton's wife and Julio Cedillo as Mel himself did not misfire. Moreover, the older acting supporting guns of Melissa Leo as an adulteress waitress and Dwight Yoakam as the town sheriff also hit the right thespian targets. Also, "Tijuana" know that the cinematography of this semi-western film had all the right shots. "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" might be long in title but short in staleness. Can you dig it??? **** Good</fullReview>

Loyalty, friendship without limits, a bit of yearning for old lifestyles and the redemption of a total jerk in Barry Peppers character.Everyone in Texas wants to play cowboy and talk without moving their teeth in massive contractions. (Sa'antone vice San Antonio) This film does a good job of showing the real way people who embrace the old ways still live in the modern world under there own terms. Horses, spurs and mule-eared boots coincide with pickups and cell phones. (one of the most humorous things I have seen was a Livingston Montana cowboy complete in chinks and spurs ordering a vanilla latte in the coffee shop)The wife Lu Ann says that Mike Norton is "beyond redemption". He is completely self absorbed and unaware of others. He is finally redeemed at the last line of the movie, where he finally demonstrates a sincere thought for someone else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2005 had two great cowboy movies. Brokeback Mountain and this. It's a hell of a toss up for which is better. You have one movie that conquers the subject of love incredibly well, and then you have this which exemplifies loyalty and friendship in a way I've rarely seen.For the movie-goer the story touches on many subjects, from poor marriages which result in adultery, prejudice issues, friendship, insanity, loyalty, love and the list goes on.Three Burials revolves around....you got it, the three burials of Melquiades Estrada. You will see for yourself why it's called this, and you'll see for yourself why this is a fantastic film. They don't make many western related movies, but when they do, and when it's done correctly and with passion, the result can turn out to be one of the best movies of the year. The acting and directing were done incredibly well by Tommy Lee Jones. All supporting actors did their jobs just as well, especially Barry Pepper. He is definitely one of the best actors working today.I've known about this movie for sometime, but never got around to seeing it, until a couple nights back I was looking for a movie to rent. I saw this was available and was actually just about to end it's run for availability. So I ordered it and was rewarded with one of the most well done and underrated movies I have ever seen. If you enjoy westerns, if you enjoy movies with heart and meaning, by all means check this film out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about another kind of love, love of friendship. When the movie starts, it's kind of bizarre the chase of Pete(Tommy Lee Jones)for Melquiades' killer. But as the story progresses we realize through flashbacks the connection they had and we realize that even though for everybody else Melquidades was just another dead wetback Mexican, for Pete he was his dear friend. This shows that a person's value is not based on migratory status or nationality, but on their heart. Also that the journey taken by Pete and the border patrol officer(Barry Pepper), finally made him become human, and see what suffering really was. Instead of being a punishment or revenge, it was really his redemption that Pete granted him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Underrated Movie of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just great. More cohesive than Amores Perros and less gimmicky than 21 Grams, relying even less on coincidences to drive its plot, Arriaga absolutely nails this one. While Brokeback Mountain might have changed the Western in 2005, if indeed it was a Western, this movie let the genre evolve. Terrific directing from Mr. Jones, and it was his debut. Barry Pepper was, in just a word, phenomenal. This was a pleasant surprise as his only other work I can recall was in the five minutes I saw of Battlefield Earth. Right. Anyway, how he was overlooked for, oh, I don't know, an Oscar during a year weak on supporting candidates, will leave me forever wondering. He carries some of the most disturbing scenes and really quite life shattering scenes, a numbingly stale love scene with his character's wife comes to mind, but also triumphs when he exhibits hope and optimism. Truly spectacular, can't wait to see what he does next.The movie is told basically in two parts. The first half, we are discovering exactly how Malquiades died, and watching his first two burials. All the while, we are figuring out through disjointed, but efficient storytelling, just how Pete, played by Jone's, and Norton, Pepper's character, are involved with Malquiades and his death. The pacing of the first half, just how the audience discovers several key plot elements, is quite ingenious and captivating as we try to put all the pieces together surrounding Mal's death, just as Pete is doing.It is the abruptness of the second part that may be the film's one flaw. There's almost a Weekend at Bernie's feel to the movie while Pete crosses the border in order to keep a promise, dragging along a kidnapped penitent and a hapless corpse. Oh, and he's being chased by a three fourths competent police officer. It's a dark sort of Faulknerian humor, and if the audience can buy into it, they won't walk away empty handed. The end is one of the greatest climaxes to any film I've seen. After having rooted for and against both Pete and Norton, sympathizing and questioning with each one's moralities, the conclusion is quite satisfying even beautiful and, most importantly, deserved.Why was no one talking about this movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a beautiful and spiritual mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What motivates people? We are forced to wonder about the souls of Pete, Mike and Melquiades as well as other characters to a lesser extent. Pete is a very strange man, and maybe that is good. A true Old West sense of morality that says, if the Law won't do what is just, then I'll do it myself. Of course, his motive is personal; Melquiades seems to be his closest male friend.The movie is very ironic. For instance, Mike's wife says late in the movie that he is unredeemable, but at that very moment, his ordeal could be leading him to redemption.Everything is well-done: acting--including some local actors--directing, writing. Yeah, the unintroduced flashbacks, at first, are confusing, but once you realize what is going on, it becomes followable.Melissa Leo is extremely good as a woman who sleeps with three different men including her husband. She is a small town waitress juggling more than just orders of bacon and eggs. Someone should make a movie just about her character with Leo in it. (Yeah, that'll happen.)The DVD is good, offering both wide- and full-screen viewing. The only additional feature is a commentary by Tommy Lee Jones, Dwight Yoakam and January Jones. It has some interesting tidbits such as that 1) the French co-producers didn't understand that the multi-colored title credits are supposed to be what T.L. Jones calls "Mexican pastels." Jones had to fight to keep them. 2) One of the French producers, Luc Besson, suggested the brilliant last line in the movie, and even though Besson made no other creative input, this one line then had a profound effect on every other change in the script after that.The worst thing about the commentary is that only T.L. Jones speaks clearly and finishes his sentences. January Jones speaks pretty clearly but doesn't finish her sentences. Yoakam neither speaks clearly nor finishes his sentences. This makes it the second-most frustrating DVD commentary I've ever listened to.On the eve of a beef up of U.S. border patrol efforts, the possible political implications of the film are not dealt with, though the fictional story bares a superficial resemblance to the nearly decade old case of Ezequiel Hernandez, Jr., a Texas shepherd who was shot by U.S. military personnel who were patrolling the border for drug smugglers. They might have made a similar mistake to the one made by the character Mike in the movie. In that real life case, Texas Rangers (that is, the state police) did not try to cover-up but instead raised questions about inconsistencies in the military's explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time someone takes a gander at Tommy Lee Jones' directorial debut, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, it'll be hard for them to believe that such a poignant and moving story could have been made in today's modern world of blockbusters and reality T.V. shows. But with Jones' eye for subtle details and interest in poeticism within each of his characters, it'll be even easier to understand why such a production exists. There can only be two words for this, John Ford. If it weren't for Ford, we probably wouldn't have Jones' heartbreaking tale of friendship and loneliness, as well as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and Kevin Costner's Open Range (ironically enough all were directed individually by those lead actors). It just goes to show people how the past really does matter to obtain the essentials in the present.That is one of the key elements in understanding each character's alienation inside their surroundings, the fact that time obscures all (a technique that Quentin Tarantino is all too familiar with). And with that, one could also compare Jones' film with another mesmerizing poem of society's outcasts, Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider. The way Jones' scenes ease from one another in a way that Ennio Morricone composed westerns (to the likes of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) absolutely reflects the mirror image of how Dennis Hopper moved from one scene to the next, with such tranquility and the least resistance to the fact that the past and present will eventually succumb as one. From pale blue Diners to the pastel images of green valleys, Jones has succeeded in not only creating the type of environment once seen in every John Ford movie, from Stagecoach to The Searchers, but has also sustained the same staple mark that places westerns in a whole different category from all other films. Pretty soon one might feel as if they'll soon see John Wayne cascaded upon the screen, shown holding his elbow (in a sign of loss) as he walks off into the sunset to only be remembered for his reputation and his most famous movie role, Ethan.As one might figure, Tommy Lee Jones' Pete Perkins is very similar to John Wayne's Ethan, if not only for the fact that Perkins has a solemn peacefulness to his structure, yet there's something amid his eyes that tells the audience that whoever killed his friend, Melquiades Estrada, they're going to pay dearly for their action. And when it comes to Barry Pepper's Mike Norton, a Border Patrolman, he's first shown as to having no respect or any regard for the very Mexicans he's been ordered to sustain in their own country, but then as the movie progresses (as does its characters) Norton begins to see the method to Perkins' madness. Overall, this film is just a non-discriminating ensemble piece for everyone involved, no one really tries to overshadow anyone in this(but of course Jones and Pepper are going to be mentioned more when someone talks about this movie). It's just a nice, calm chemistry between the actors, which is rarely seen in today's world. And with Guillermo Arriaga's picturesque script and Jones' quiet solace behind the camera, it's no wonder why The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada works so well. In the spirit of all things that deal with cowboys and their open range stance, this movie has a combination of what Jones learned from Ron Howard on the set of The Missing and what has always been engraved in Jones' DNA (but never truly brought out until now), a good old fashion western. The kind that tells the tale of the love for life and the honor amongst friends.So, after all of my introspections I feel that Jones' movie deserves to be sitting on the shelf next to the likes of Ford's The Searchers and Hopper's Easy Rider, for its ability to make its audience feel comfortable with the images that are placed upon the screen (just as the characters are fine with their status quo, just because they have no other choice in the matter, among the mountains that border on Texas and Mexico). And because of this, I would give The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada an A for its Adjacent Atmosphere to the Western World that once was based upon Admiration and loyalty, as well as its keen eye to how the world is and was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Films of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones makes an impressive debut as a director with this superlative atmospheric film based on the writing of Guillermo Arriaga who has proved his mettle with such screenplays as '21 Grams' and 'Amores Perros'. This is one of those rare 'westerns' where the plot is woven so tightly into the scenery that it takes a legion of excellent actors to unravel it. And Jones has found those actors and has directed them in a mesmerizing story about friendship and the promises extracted from it.Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) is a dusty old man with friends wherever he sets his hat - be that in a café where knows the married waitress Rachel (a brilliant Melissa Leo) as a bed partner, or on his cowboy runs where his best friend is a Mexican man Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), a friendship bonded by promises and gifts and commitment. When Melquiades is killed, Pete is grief stricken and cannot tolerate the attitude of the Border Patrol rednecks who just want to bury the Mexican without investigating the killing. A new agent Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) and his wife Lou Ann (January Jones) have recently arrived from Cincinnati: Lou Ann is bored and spends her time in Rachel's café and cavorts with Rachel, Pete and Melquiades and Mike takes out his aggressions on his job. When all evidence points to Mike Norton as the killer of Melquiades, Pete captures him, makes him confess to the killing, dig up Melquiades body so that Pete can return it as promised to Jimenez, Mexico. The remainder of the film is a 'road trip' as Pete makes Mike transport Melquiades' rotting body into Mexico. They encounter a blind man (Levon Helm) who befriends them and asks them as a return favor to shoot him: he is blind, alone, and his once visiting son is dying of cancer. Pete refuses and heads on. The travails of the trip are numerous but in the course of the story important lessons are learned by all of the characters.The movement of the film is a bit confusing at times as it is not told in a linear fashion: events revolving around Melquiades' death are slowly unwound in a way that makes the story a mystery of sorts. The cinematography is stunning (Chris Menges) and the musical score by Marco Beltrami is hauntingly perfect. Barry Pepper and Tommy Lee Jones turn in bravura performances, as does the rest of the cast in their more minor roles. The after burn of the film is scorching and tender at the same time and the credit for that goes to Jones as director. It is a brilliant achievement. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a while since I have so eagerly awaited a DVD release as much as The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada. Showing at the Cannes Film Festival in 2005, the film surprised many by winning the Best Actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and Best Screenplay honors while being nominated for the Golden Palm Award.In a competition that included David Cronenberg's A History of Violence, Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Sin City by Robert Rodriguez, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is the one film that I kept hearing about during entertainment productions' coverage and in reading in print by those critics attending the event.But the film didn't get the backing and push from its distributor (Sony Classics) and at its peak, its widest release was only 356 theatres. The result was a domestic tally of less than $6 million and it left many common citizens ? in particular, yours truly, waiting for a local theatrical release that never happened.Thank God for DVD. Released this week, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada gets another chance to capture the audience it so richly deserves. And I strongly suggest that you saddle up your horse and trot down to the local DVD rental store to appreciate this gem.The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada tells a fairly simple story. A young illegal cowboy is found shot dead in the desert of Texas. A local rancher, Pete Perkins (Jones) had befriended the Mexican previous to his fate and personally crusades to bring justice to the individual who was responsible for his demise. On the other side of the rifle was border patrolman Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) who clearly has anger issues, but who's act of violence was innocently considered an act of self defense. Norton had just moved to Texas from Cincinnati with his young wife Lou Ann (January Jones) and was having enough struggles trying to fit into the small town kind of life prior to his 'incident'. But after Perkins finds out that Pete was the shooter, life for both men was about to change forever.With Pete's revelation, he kidnaps Norton and then digs up the rotting corpse of Melquiades Estrada to ensure that he keeps his promise of returning the body back to a small town in Mexico. The journey back to Estrada's homeland is the heart of the film as Pete pushes, bullies and threatens Norton into doing his willing while having the audience question his vigilante tactics.The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a character drama that harnesses some of the best acting of the past year. From the grizzled Tommy Lee to supporting cast members Dwight Yoakam and Melissa Leo there is nary a misstep among the ensemble and each character no matter how big or small the part is essential in bringing Pete's odyssey to its peaceful conclusion.This credit can go ? surprisingly ? to director Tommy Lee Jones. Tommy is just the latest of a long line of Oscar winning actors that has had a desire to put himself behind the camera at the same time as in front (Tom Hanks and Nicholas Cage are two others that come so quickly to mind). But as a rookie big film director, Jones shows the strengths of a veteran and uses all of the resources to pull off a one of the best films of the year.Maybe the most incredible feat pulled off by Jones is that he has given a role, and I would argue even a personality, to a dead corpse that is the forefront of the trek. Be warned, this is no Weekend At Bernie's. Instead we have a love of a soulless shell that was as real and as believable as the love two gay cowboys that was projected in another small movie that was so heralded last year. By treating the corpse with as much love and reverence as he did while Estrada was alive, Jones is able to walk what is a very fine line separating a promise to friend and the grotesqueness of the request. No easy task let me assure you.The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is easily one of the best films that you will find on the DVD shelves this year. Much like it's Cannes competitor, A History of Violence, it is a film that probably even plays better on the small screen where you can pause, catch your breath and marvel at the scenery without having to worry about validated parking or whether you have enough time to mortgage your home to upgrade your popcorn combo.A high recommendation.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marking the directorial debut of actor Tommy Lee Jones, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a stunningly evocative film exploring the power of loyalty, forgiveness and redemption set along the borders of Texas and Mexico. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Pete Perkins, a ranch hand whose newest employee and friend, Melquiades (Cedillo), is accidentally shot dead by a rough border patrol officer, Mike Norton (Pepper). After the local police turn a blind eye (Melquiades is an illegal immigrant), Perkins kidnaps Norton so that they can both take Melquiades back to his home in Mexico, to bury him properly.Written by the excellent 21 Grams scribe, Guillermo Arriaga, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada follows a similar time-jumping structure in the first half of the film so that, although we already know what is going to happen, we can explore the characters and their traits fully, seeing the origins of their behaviour (we know Norton is the violent type as we see him beat up a woman who tries to escape from the border patrol). However, the story is not too jumbled so that the audience loses its bearings; in fact, the time-jumping serves the story and the emotions well ? the simple charm of the scenes between Melquiades and Pete are made far more poignant because of the knowledge of Melquiades' fate that we already know befalls him. During this half of the film we also see the lives of the other people of the town whose lives are all interconnected, including Norton's wife (Jones), a mall-obsessed woman stuck in a soulless marriage and a soulless life, and the local diner waitress Rachel (Leo) who sleeps around because there is just nothing else to do.All this disappears for the second half, which is the temporally linear journey of Perkins and Norton as they try to get Melquiades' body back over the border to be buried in his home town. It is a series of episodes including hungry ants, the slowly rotting corpse and, for one of the best scenes in the film, a run in with a blind hermit. This half is where the film, and most importantly the performances, come into their own. Jones is brilliant as the loyal friend who wants to protect Melquiades' honour; but the standout is Pepper's Norton, a loutish law enforcer for whom the journey is as much about his own redemption as it is about Melquiades' burial. By the film's end we can see how Perkins' treatment of Norton actually begins to return to him his humanity. Honourable mention should also go to all the supporting cast, especially January Jones who manages to bring life to a part that could potentially lose all credibility from any current Hollywood 'it' girl.Tommy Lee Jones has crafted a masterpiece of cinema that is only helped by the veterans that he has surrounded himself with, such as cinematographer Chris Menges. He manages to make the harsh landscape of the Texas/Mexico border a character in itself, and each shot has been carefully considered to get the most out the picture. The finale at first feels like more of a hurdle for the audience rather than the characters, but that feeling fades away to produce a resounding payoff to a beautifully made film, with perfect performances all round and emotions that will last well beyond the credits.Rated: 9/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got to see it today. There is no doubt that this the best movie so far for 2006. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada really captures your attention and never lets go.I know that many people have seen Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals. This is really the same character, in a sense, just looking really scruffy and hard, instead of the smooth look of Marshal Samuel Gerard.He has the same steely purpose in getting his man and keeping his promises. To see his resolve and determination, no matter what it takes, is amazing. This character was made for Jones, and his direction is magnificent.Unlike Brokeback Mountain, which was a love story, this is a real cowboy film. It is hard, dirty, funny, and real. The scenery is breathtaking, and no punches are pulled.It is not a revenge movie, but one that deals with compassion, racism, and promises. Barry Pepper brings a character that he did well in such movies as We Were Soldiers, The Green Mile, and Saving Private Ryan. Needless to say, he is a changed man after Jones gets through with him. There were no snakes on a plane, but there was a snake on the plain, and that really provided some of the best comedy in this film.Some may not like the way the story jumps from past to present and back, but it really makes the film, and helps you to understand the complexity of what Jones is achieving. In a sense, it emulates Crash, and it also brings the same message.If they are going to bring the western back like this, I will be a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Border War: with Three Burials, Tommy Lee Jones embraces the idea of a half Mexican, half American Texas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the west in Texas, close to the border with Mexico, the cowboy and illegal immigrant Melquiades Estrada is found dead, with a bullet wound and body half-eaten by the animals. As none of the local authorities demonstrates persistence on solving the case, the rancher Peter Perkins, with whom Melquiades worked with, is taken by some kind of divine fury. At the moment in which he identifies the murderer - the border guard Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), that distracted, responded with a shot without checking that the target was a coyote - he decides to fix things. Mounted, transporting the more disgusting body of Melquiades and dragging Mike like an animal, he crosses the inhospitable territory around the river that separates both countries, to where the Mexican came from, to bury him the right way. In the elapse of this odyssey that is The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2006) the protagonist and director Tommy Lee Jones offers one of the most deep and painful portrayals of the life at the 'texmex' line: of one only culture divided between winners and losers and ruled by incomprehension.Jones is a texan of eight generation and, in a certain manner, makes justice to the stereotype: creates horses, likes to hunt and is rough and coarse. His other half is the negation of this image - formed with honors on Literature in Harvard, is a long date friend of Al Gore, speaks a fluent Spanish and is openly against the truculent and persecutory policing that is practiced at the borders with Mexico. Isn't, at last, of the type that is proud for nothing for taking the state from the mexicans. Jones, in contrary, embraces and admires the cultural confluence that resulted in Texas - and Three Burials, beautifully directed, that was written in partnership with the Mexican Guillermo Arriaga of Amores Pierros (2000) and 21 Grams (2003), is his manifesto in favor of this belief. In resemblance to his author, is a severe, intelligent film, of something irascible and, above all, with integrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the viewing - which means it is about one in 50 for motion pictures made in any given year..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones has offered a body of quality work for more than 25 years. No bombast, no melodrama, no excuses, no teenage roller coaster ride. Dialogue is the primary part of any motion picture. Everything else is second. In this movie Jones has shown himself to have a bit of John Sayles in his work process. That is no small accomplishment. For sociological reasons we screen about 50 movies a year. There have been a number of years when not one film could really be called even Adequate. "The Three Burials of Melquiads Estrada" is easily and 8 out of 10. . .which is quite rare.We here at the Institute have been studying the sociological inclinations utilized by the majority of the movie going audience for several years. The evidence indicated strongly that people will go see a quality motion picture if it's offered - and they will also go see movies completely void of any noticeable talent if nothing good is available. We are now investigation what type of antecedent would work to redirect the population to pass on bad work on a regular basis. If we can latch onto that - the whole industry will chance in one year.</fullReview>

How about a great story, great writing, acting, editing and cinematography! and the score was perfect!This is one I would buy on DVD. And we found it not depressing, but uplifting. Originally we weren't going to see it because the title didn't sound exciting. But Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors, he hasn't disappointed me yet and I saw that he was directing this, as well as starring and producing. The whole cast ensemble was terrific.Dwight Yoakum was wonderful, it is difficult to single out any one actor because they were all great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Just a Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time, there was buzz about what this movie was able to show, and I was anxious to see it. Now, with the Oscar nominations already announced, I can't help but feel more disappointed than ever with this film having not been included in the short list of what Academy members consider the "best" of the year. Leaving aside questions about popularity and personal agendas, I have to call this film an outstanding masterwork without fear of being redundant."Melquiades" is moving, intelligent, a hard-hitting learning experience for those of us who might having a limited understanding and perception of what the word humanity means. Tommy Lee Jones shows clear insight on the bias and perceptions that shade everyday life. There are questions about the complexity of emotions and how those rule our actions. Humans bond, love, hate, trust, mistrust, deceive, yearn for companionship, friendship, and truth. Melquiades is an enigma, a simple man who shows up and tells a story. He befriends Pete and builds a new life in the States. Later on, we discover that his story might be a little more complicated than that.The film is a mystery, a thriller, a love story of sorts, a tribute to other films that dared have vision and were unrelenting compromises. It recalls the scope of John Ford's westerns, and yet there are moments when the raw intimacy of its main characters overwhelms the audience. One detail that I found fascinating is how fingers are pointed only to see how perceptions are changed by an unexpected twist in the story. THere is a universal feeling that bonds and repels us depending on the situation. "Melquiades" doesn't hold back.Barry Pepper will go down in history as one of the biggest injustices committed by the so called members of awards committees. What were they thinking when they neglected to see this movie? if they even got to it. I'm glad we have free will to choose and appreciate. It's time to stop relying on the "expertise" of strangers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very straightforward Western, a fact obscured a bit by a truly terrible editing job in the first forty minutes or so, the single biggest flaw in the film. Jones is the friend of Estrada, an illegal alien trying to make a life for himself in Texas. When he's shot and killed accidentally by a not-very-bright Border Guard (Barry Pepper), and when Jones learns the law isn't going to do anything about, he takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Pepper and taking him on an odyssey down to Mexico, where he'd promised to bury Estrada if anything ever happened. Fine location shots, great casting all around (in addition to Pepper and Jones, Dwight Yokum makes a good, tired Sheriff, Melissa Leo is a very believable good-natured town slut, and Levon Helm, of all people, shines as a poverty-stricken old blind man), The movie has a sense of itself as a Western and also manages to keep a sense of humor about itself, very important in a movie about the interactions between cultures. (I kept expecting the movie to descend into shrill preachiness, but thankfully it never did.) Recommended all around, even with the bad editing job. I'd like to see Jones and the screenwriter tackle another Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones became one of the most well known actors of modern American cinema after achieving worldwide fame during the 90s with highly successful movies like "The Fugitive", "The Client" and "Men in Black". Having built a good reputation as a solid actor, in 1995 he decided to try himself as a director in a modest movie made for television named "The Good Old Boys", and while the film received good reviews and even was nominated to several awards, Jones decided to put his career as a director on standby, and keep focusing on his work as an actor. However, in 2005 Jones returned to the director's seat with "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada", a film written by Guillermo Arriaga, the acclaimed writer of "Amores Perros" and "21 Grams". Using the theme of life in a border town as a background for their story, Jones and Arriaga create an amazing modern western about friendship, loyalty, and redemption.The movie starts with the discovery of the dead body of Mexican cowboy Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) half buried in the desert near a Texan border town. Without any real clue of who killed him, the Police decides to leave the case unsolved, as since Estrada was an illegal immigrant, they assume that he was involved in criminal acts. The only one unwilling to believe that explanation is Melquiades' best friend and coworker, Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones), who decides to discover who killed Melquiades, as he considered him his only friend. After discovering that the man who killed Melquiades is actually a member of the border patrol named Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), Pete kidnaps him and starts the long trip to the small town of Jimenez, Coahuila, where he promised to take Estrada's body as it's the place where he wanted to be buried.Writer Guillermo Arriaga builds up his quixotic tale of loyalty and redemption as a mix of road movie and modern Western that explores the nature of human relations (both real and ideal) as the two main characters travel from Texas to Mexico. As usual in Arriaga's works, flashbacks are used to flesh out the characters and their relationships; however, this time their use becomes secondary to the actual journey itself and the personal growth the characters experience there. This doesn't mean that the characters are simpler this time, on the contrary, they are completely developed and feel very real, very human. While the story inevitably does touch the subject of the political relationships between the U.S. and Mexico, surprisingly it never loses its focus and remains dedicated to his characters and their journey towards Jimenez.The film's biggest surprise comes from director Tommy Lee Jones, who in this his first theatrical feature has truly surpassed all the expectations. Without many pretensions, Jones makes a raw and very realistic portrait of the alienation of the Texan border town, while telling the story of a man whose only friend has been killed and nobody seems to care about it. A native of Texas himself, Jones truly captures the life at a border town (from both sides of the border), although he lets the magical realism style of Arriaga's story to flourish without problem. With the superb cinematography of Chris Menges, and the excellent score from Marco Beltrami, Jones creates a haunting and beautiful portrait of the adventure of this two men. Considering the high quality of this film and his previous directorial effort, it's surprising that Jones doesn't direct more often.The cast is simply excellent, making Arriaga's characters alive with a huge dose of humanity and dedication. Tommy Lee Jones once again shows off his talent, proving that he still has the magic to bring compelling characters to life. It is really he who makes the character of Pete Perkins more than what it's on script, as his natural presence and body language do more to the character than his spoken words. However, while Jones indeed shines through the film, the real revelation is Barry Pepper, who as Mike Norton gives definitely the best performance of the movie. Forced to travel with Perkins, Norton is the character who experiences the greater revelations as they look for the place to bury Melquiades for the third and final time. It is truly an unforgettable performance that shows the young actor as a truly talented thespian.I think that what makes "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" work is the fact that Jones seemed to realize not only the potential of the script, but also his own limitations as a director, and decided to play by them without aspiring to nothing more than to create a good movie. It is this apparently simple approach what fits the story perfectly and makes this modern western a compelling quest for redemption in the purest style of Sam Peckinpah. Spiced up with some black comedy, the film unfolds in a slow but nice way, carefully setting up the stage for the journey's deep revelations. My only complain is that while this is definitely one of Arriaga's best (and more straightforward) works, his use of flashbacks, albeit limited, is still a bit confusing and initially it breaks the pace of the movie."The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2005 (despite its 2006 release), and a terrific cinematic experience that reminds us that the Western genre is not dead. Quirky, deep and very spiritual, this tale of friendship, justice and redemption is a must-see not only for fans of the Western, but to movie fans in general. Hopefully, the success of this film will prompt Jones to direct films more often, as this is one truly remarkable "debut". 9/10</fullReview>

Tommy Lee &amp; Barry Pepper are such strong and compelling actors.The waitress floozy had me fooled at first -- I thought it was the warden's wife in The Green Mile.This movie works on several levels -- musically the words of songs often tie directly into the story, similarly with the TV scenes. There are wonderful pauses -- that alone sets this movie apart from most. And then there is emotional family of lust, anger, redemption and loneliness.In thinking about the negative comments that have gone before, I think the reason is the same in all -- sad, lonely people hate a movie like this.Tommy Lee does it again.

		<shortDescription>How Far Friendship Can Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Small lives, and the people caught up in their small world until a stranger among them gets killed. Guillermo Arriaga's story unfolds in his trademark, fragmented fashion seen before in 21 GRAMS and AMORES PERROS, bringing to life a vivid view of these unremarkable people who live in a place where there is nothing to do but watch time go by, and the only real, idyllic place is the image of perfection within a dead man's dream.Tommy Lee Jones' directorial debut indicates the hand of someone who knows not only film but film pacing and the people of a terrain at an intimate, quirky level. Instead of going for grandiose, sweeping flares of camera moves closer to that of Kevin Costner's DANCES WITH WOLVES (complete with that overwhelming musical score -- here the music is less intrusive, pat but equally effective), he prefers to pace it in a quieter scale. It doesn't deny the power of the landscape. There is never a doubt as to the deadly beauty of the land. However, in relying more on the actors who inhabit this largely forgotten world, he comes up with delicate performances that resonate long after the actors have left the screen.An accident brings two of the most opposite men together and deadlocks them in an act of retribution and duty to a third. Mike Norton is the villain of the piece, not because he's a bad man but because he's a man who, as a border patrol agent, is the wrong man for he job. Even so, things about his character -- how he treats his wife and her fraying patience with him -- indicate he wouldn't be good for any job requiring responsibility. He also preys upon two Mexicans trying to cross the border, an act that will come to haunt him later on. He's a louse, and Barry Pepper, usually an actor who plays likable roles, never makes him sympathetic in any way. He misunderstands a bullet aimed at a fox as intended to hurt him, but this is more due to the fact he was pleasuring himself over a Hustle magazine while on the job. Guilt and the fear of being discovered lead him to murder.The man murdered: Melquiades Estrada. A quiet man who lives in fear of "la migra". Unassuming, like most illegal aliens, but trying to make a living nevertheless, as a cowboy. I know several of these people and they work harder than most of us who were born here. Melquiades, a man with many secrets, is a good man who has the misfortune of getting caught in Mike's stupidity. (Flashbacks bring forth his relationship to Pete Perkins -- one scene in particular hovers over the early part of the movie. If he were to die before Pete, he wants Pete to not bury him in "this land full of billboards" but in his own native Mexico, in a place called Jimenez.) Pete, who suspects foul play, pounces on Norton and forces him to owe up to his actions. It could have been a simple revenge plot, but Arriaga has more in store: he's out to teach Norton a harsh lesson of respecting your fellow man.Darkly funny, with poor Melquiades' body making appearances here and there for relief -- which alleviates the tension of an otherwise dreary moral tale -- Arriaga's Western is very much in spirit with the importance of honoring a man's word, even when that may seem nearly impossible to do due to circumstances. There's a feeling that this could have been made in the glory era of Westerns, with grizzled Henry Fonda playing his role to the hilt. I enjoyed it, down to its smaller performances by Julio Cedillo, Melissa Leo, January Jones, Dwight Yoakam and the actor who played the lonely blind man who listens to Spanish radio and wants to die.THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA is a lovely allegory of friendship and the lengths one goes to make sure that word transcends its meaning and becomes a shining symbol, perfectly encapsulated in the name of the land Melquiades dreams of returning to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hating or Loving the Movie (one SPOILER, sort of)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is about honoring a friend's wish and providing justice to a guilty man who's getting a free pass from the authorities. But it's told through a dense scrim of metaphor. Some people look at such movies (Pulp Fiction is one) and love it; others just throw up their hands and scream, "more plot, please, less meaning." The story is really a quasi-Christian parable about heaven and earth. There is no real home on earth. We all live in a limbo of mortality (or the Tex- Mex border where no one quite feels they actually belong, or will stay). The border patrol guy lives in a mobile home; Jones's place is dark and never really seen. There are no other homes in the movies that we see until we get to Mel's shattered paradise. The journey of this unholy trinity is one of burial (and possible resurrection in his heaven) for Mel, the pain of seeing one's young friend (or only begotten son) unfairly killed, and Norton's long journey into the power of redemption. There's a kind of Father, Son and Holy Ghost here. (Those who don't go for Big Metaphor in movies can start screaming now.) When they get to the village, they see that the place Mel described doesn't exist here. Maybe even Mel doesn't exist on earth. (In the photo, he's barely in it. Hardly there, merely passing through.) "No existe," the Mexicans keep saying to Pete's questions. (It may well be that the false Christians running around our nation's politics don't understand this anymore), but Pete, Norton and Mel now do. The Kingdom of Heaven is not of this Earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunate misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquides Estrada brings first-time director Tommy Lee Jones into the conscientious but ambiguous domain of Clint Eastwood, casting shades of Unforgiven in an engaging drama of fear and violence in a West Texas border town.While this film features strong and passionate performances, well written characters, and a thoughtful awareness of border issues, its second half dispenses with its best virtues and leaves one with the sour taste of dramatic contrivance. For the lengthy journey through the Chihuahuan Desert, Jones's protagonist abducts the guilty border agent, played by Barry Pepper, exposing him to a series of humiliations and sadistic treatments that are regrettably tinged with a sense of humorous vindication. The viewer is asked to forget that the agent is a visibly shaken, paranoid and regretful human being, and accept Jones as the tough but merciful enforcer of moral righteousness. Consequently, both characters become less human and less believable. The film's final exchange, in which Pepper begs for forgiveness under a barrage of gunfire before solicitously asking after the welfare of a departing Jones, reaches the peak of condescension by manipulating the viewer into accepting the legitimacy of the screenwriter's misbegotten fantasy of justice.While Eastwood's Unforgiven, by all accounts the superior film, is content to leave the viewer with nagging uncertainties about the protagonist's moral choices, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada finishes too cleanly and decisively for its own good. This is more unfortunate because the earlier parts demonstrate a sensitivity to the conditions of the characters that is uncommon in cinema today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing film, but too many flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie to be a quirky story of friendship, retribution, commitment and forgiveness. Some of its positives are the beautiful scenery, and some of the acting portrayals were very good.One of the biggest problems I found with this film, and this is symptomatic of Hollywood in general, is that it tries to get the viewer to accept certain basic premises that are truly ridiculous. While I applaud Tommy Lee Jones effort as a first time director, the lack of credibility of certain parts, in addition to serious storyline ambiguities make this a movie that falls well short of its 7.8 rating.MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS:For example. The scene where Tommy Lee Jones makes Barry Pepper dig up the body from the town plot. A keen eye will notice that Pepper's character is wearing FLIP-FLOPS!! As someone who's done some digging in his day, there's no way in hell this guy digs a 4x4x8 foot ditch in flip-flops. You use your feet to dig... Totally ridiculous. How hard would it have been to have him wearing work boots? While we're on this digging, to dig out a ditch like that would have taken hours, even if it was recently excavated by a backhoe. And yet Jones, the director, pans out to some sporting event while the digging takes place, which leads one to believe that it's still early evening. To further reinforce this awfully ridiculous compression of time, a few scenes later, outside of Melquiades apartment, Jones pans to the distant twilight-signifying that it's been dark for a relatively short period of time, giving further proof that this ditch digging took maybe an hour at most, in flip flops, no less...And did I mention that Pepper's character does all this digging wearing hand-cuffs...silly me.In another scene, we see Pepper tearing up his blue jeans, using the material to craft some makeshift footwear. Ever try tearing denim, while wearing handcuffs no less? Usually, when you tear something apart, your hands move away, in opposite directions... Then, to think that Pepper crafts these denim moccasins that miraculously stay on his feet for the rest of the movie. Couldn't he just have gone barefoot? Was I supposed to applaud Pepper's ingenuity, was that supposed to make me sympathize for him more or despise him more? I guess I'm supposed to check the analytical part of my brain at the ticket window of the theater? Or perhaps Hollywood thrives on the dulled senses(and shrinking craniums) of the average American moviegoer...hmmm.The anti-ant alcohol fire remedy scene was also a big stretch. As was the one where Jones and Pepper were out on a ledge, plain as day, and the Border Patrol chopper flies nearly on top of them without them being spotted. I realize that Jones the director needed to give Jones the character an impetus for making the deal with the Mexican guide during that scene. But couldn't Jones the director have chosen a shot of the chopper from a mile away, in the relatively silent desert, seeing as choppers tend to be very noisy machines. Just a thought...Want more...okay. Pepper's character is a border agent, who is very familiar with firearms. Do you think just once that he would try to wrestle the gun from Jones, or perhaps do it while Jones was asleep? Especially since he believes that Jones is going to kill him, as he later confesses in the movie. Also, wouldn't you think that Pepper would make a serious attempt to gain control, for his escape, seeing the gorgeous wife he has awaiting him back home, in addition to saving his own life?Finally, the whole thing with the Polaroid picture of Melquiades "family", what was that all about? And what's with Jones not being able to find the town of Jimenez, despite having a map and receiving directions from the locals? Perhaps it can be explained that Mexico is a big country, and the desert terrain must start looking all the same after awhile. I have to say that the ending did not make much sense either. Pepper does break down, but wouldn't he have done that much earlier in the "trek"? And for Pepper to have no thought of revenge for Jones is hard to fathom, and yet he ask Jones in the movie ending statement-"Are you going to be alright?". Who's forgiving who? And to think that Jones goes through all this trouble to take the body back, as he promised, only to never fully carry out his mission-(Jones never finds the right place nor tells Melquiades' wife about his death). Jones character would have been better off leaving the body in Van Horn's cemetery, at least he could have visited his buddy's grave whenever he felt the urge, but that wouldn't do much for the story. I guess that's life for you.Well, you get the picture, pardon the pun. In my eyes, a film cannot be considered great if it contains basic flaws of logic. I admire and enjoy a film that maintains a strong sense of basic realism. In my opinion, this film does not do this, and cannot be considered even very good, much less great. I'm sure Jones will be behind the camera again, and perhaps will produce efforts that far surpass this one. Why should one buy into a film where Hollywood insults the intelligence of the viewer over and over again is beyond me. Millions and millions of dollars are spent on films to make them appear so real, and yet this is all undone by simple story ideas that don't make sense, which end up shattering that high priced illusion of reality. There's irony for you... Chalk it up to the idea that a film is supposed to be a vehicle for escapism-fantasy I guess, even if the movie is supposed to portray a real life storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>rich and full, mean and real; but mostly just beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada review by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com rating: 3.5 out of 4 It takes a certain director to pull off a Guillermo Arriaga script. 21 Grams and Amores Perros were both helmed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (who will soon lead Babel, another Arriaga project), directing them both with a gritty, hand-held realism that shook us all roughly in our boots. Arriaga's characters are generally rich and full, mean and real; but mostly just beautiful. His characters are human, to say it plainly. Tommy Lee Jones grudgingly took the director's chair for this Arriaga script, but executes it with a steady sureness of hand, proving to us that his Harvard education really was worth something. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a stubbornly engaging film, yanking us into its bordertown culture with a coarse smattering of characters that all unfurl with delicious intertwining. And we can trust such a hefty handful of characters in the palms of Arriaga, who assuredly knows how to knot his characters up in the most painfully elegant of ways.Along with directing and producing the picture, Tommy Lee Jones also plays the lead role. His character is Pete Perkins, a cattle rancher working just miles from the border. He's unmarried, but has found love in Rachel (Melissa Leo), the married waitress at the Sands Motel Diner. Also courting Rachel is Sheriff Belmont (Dwight Yoakam), whose main attribute would probably be laziness, a trait that pervades even his genitalia. The newcomers in town are Mike and Lou Ann Norton (Barry Pepper and January Jones) from Cincinnati; Mike finding work as an abusive, oversexed Border Patrol Officer. The title character, Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), appears primarily in flashbacks, excepting his pervasive corpse seen throughout the picture. Estrada approaches Pete about work, having fled from his family in Mexico to find job as a ranch hand in Texas. Pete and Estrada strike an unlikely friendship, each of them beginning to understand culture from both sides of the Rio Grande. This ends, however, when Estrada is killed by Mike in a fatal misunderstanding. Pete at first relies on Belmont and the authorities to handle the proceedings, but soon realizes that the Sheriff's laziness has broadened also into justice. So Pete takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Mike from his crumbling home with Lou Ann (who had been cheating earlier with Estrada), and forces him to dig Estrada from his informal burial in town, and travel on horseback into Jimenez village in Mexico to re-bury him there.Arriaga's screenplays, at their foundations, deal with a human's journey. Amores Perros dealt with the journey of love (hence the translation of Amores Perros as Love's a Bitch), and 21 Grams dealt with the journey of redemption. Here Arriaga deals with a more tangible journey, as Pete, Mike, and the corpse of Estrada trek across the Texican desert, facilitating justice of the alternative sort. But as Pete and Mike leave town, Arriaga doesn't let us forget about those left behind. Lou Ann, Rachel, and Belmont's stories are all panned out successfully, each dealing with estrangement differently. Arriaga chooses even to keep up with a tiny fringe character seen in glimpses earlier in the film. His refusal to drop stories works to unfurl motives and development of Pete, Mike, and Estrada, their characters broadening as they cross the desert. This process is heightened by Arriaga's disowning of chronology. He takes on a milder version of 21 Grams' anachronous layout, inadvertently flashing backwards and forwards without warning. The method works to tell the story in terms of the characters' development, instead of storytelling on chronology's terms.Grittiness always plays a factor in Arriaga's tales, but Three Burials deals with grittiness as a reality of culture of these characters. 21 Grams and Amores Perros found grittiness within a culture that generally avoids it, making it more disturbing (a trait that Three Burials hides in devices of culture). Tommy Lee Jones helps this element of the narrative along, offering us long, steady shots that refuse to cut in to close-ups to exude emotion. Jones knows the screenplay and his cast are strong enough to not worry about stylish direction. He takes the direction with a steady hand, allowing us to see the story's picture in shots often longer than 20 seconds long, while still avoiding the endless shots of the desert vistas common to travel films. His straightforward directing is refreshing amongst the Tony Scott and Wayne Kramers of recent, who assault us with frenetic jump cuts and fuzzy focus tricks. Jones allows us take a step back and let the script and acting take the reigns.Speaking of acting, this is Jones' defining performance. His mannerisms and humor and sensitivity all take manifest in the character's endless determination to bury a friend that meant more to him than any audience could understand. He says little, but as all great western heroes, he doesn't need to. The remaining cast also do tremendously, particularly January Jones and Melissa Leo (who's easily mistaken for Holly Hunter). Their characters are inherently different?one accepting her lonely lifestyle and the other reacting against it?but their differences make them compatible and easy friends. They lend the brusqueness of the film a sincere touch that rounds out what makes an Arriaga screenplay great. Barry Pepper also does well, but also is required of less because his role calls more for teary, screaming theatrics than hard-earned acting bones. But Pepper has his quieter, more thoughtful scenes, and with those he succeeds.Tommy Lee Jones has reported that he hates directing, which is a shame. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is a magnificent achievement that solidifies Jones' career and proves his supreme validity. For Arriaga it's another swath of humanity carved into the paper of his script. On both accounts, the achievement is certainly noted.-www.samseescinema.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Thoughtful !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones has created a Masterpiece about understanding that no one seen coming. It is true that the film's message is universal, but it's also one of empathy in a world it has completely forgotten basic human principle of respect, due to our own petty human materialistic needs and selfishness. Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) and Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo)are truly friends in this film, where they practically share the same THIRST for life. But when a very short tempered Mike Norton (Barry Pepper)a Border Patrolman, accidentally kills Melquiades Estrada, it's Pete that finds it upon himself to find some kind of peace and justice for his friend. Thus, Pete ends up trying to teach Mike a lesson of respect. But it's ultimately both men that learn about life and how far will one go to regain just a little bit of dignity, along with forgiveness...which is all we truly have at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 Cheers for 3 Burials: A Moving Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada", hereafter referred to as "3 Burials", is a moving portrayal of life in the border towns of Mexico and America, with the very real problems of poverty and racism. It follows the friendship between Pete (Tommy Lee Jones) and Melquiades (Julio Cedillo). When Melquiades is murdered, many in the town do not care - including the sheriff. He was a nobody. Just another poor migrant worker from Mexico. To Pete, however, Mel was a great friend. He goes to extraordinary lengths to ensure that both Mel and his killer get the treatment each deserve. It is an wonderful story.The acting in "3 Burials" is superb. Jones is authentic and excellent in his portrayal of Pete - a tough, old cowboy. Jones and Cedillo bring to life the friendship between Pete and Melquiades. Thus it is easier to understand Pete's actions later on. The supporting cast is also excellent. Barry Pepper is fantastic as Mike Norton, a border patrol agent. The ever lovely January Jones is also great in one of her first larger roles as Mrs. Norton. Theirs is a troubled marriage and like everything else in this small town - not as simple as it seems.The cinematography of the film is stunning. The background of the Southwest adds a very real atmosphere to the film. It ranges from weed-covered hills to desert dunes, cliffs, and rivers. "3 Burials" takes place amidst a beautiful and yet lonely setting.Everything comes together extremely well in this film, which is rare. The acting, the plot, the visual imagery - it is all nearly perfect. "3 Burials" is an instant classic and one of the best movies in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something for Everyone in this Movie, but the little kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sunday School on the screen, replacing useless church for me: . Jesus wandering in the desert? You've got it here. The redemptive power of good shown to evil? Right here. Sewing the wind and reaping the whirlwind? Yep. Got a Mary Magdalene? Yep, she tells Pete who killed his friend, at great danger to herself. How about the ethics of terminating someone's life who asks you to kill him? That comes up, as well.And like every excellent movie, seeing it repeatedly unearths even more treasure. And the questions still remain: Did Pete think that the killer of his friend knew the dead man had slept with his wife? He didn't. Are the border guards as inhuman and stupid as they appear? Not hardly, because one of the 'bad cops' has an opportunity to kill the fleeing Pete and doesn't (and then goes to Sea World). Magically, they know the route Pete takes as he accompanies his friend's body back to Mexico. And Pete the same way. He gets the bead on the fleeing killer and doesn't pull the trigger. Jones does not let us think in terms of black and white, but as is true in life....these people all have bad and good to them.Did you think a corpse could be funny? It is, especially when he gets a case of the ants. I didn't think the skin would stay on a corpse's face for that long, but I guess the anti-freeze embalmed him.There's a little too much deaux ex machina going for it, as the woman who heals the killer's snake bite is the same illegal immigrant whose nose Pepper broke when he was patrolling the border. There's even some karma in here, as the killer, the border patrol guard, is forced to wear his victim's clothes, drink his coffee and finally to bury him. As Pepper wanders through the wilderness, accompanied on horseback by Pete, you think of the many migrants he beat up/arrested who did the same thing.Even the last words the killer speaks makes sense: "Are you going to be all right?" to the back of the cowboy riding off in the sunset (no, that's an Alan Ladd show, but Pete does turn his back to us and ride off). But not before he gives the fine horse that Melquiades had given him to the killer. And despite the fact that Pete may show up back at the ranch and be arrested for the murder and/or kidnapping of this killer (who was never going to be arrested) ...you sorta suspect they both will be. Oh, yes, did I mention the killing WAS accidental, or maybe just abysmally poor judgment--- to go shooting off a gun when you don't know what you're shooting at? Shades of Dick (Elmer Fudd) Cheney!!! (Oh why, wasn't Scalia on that quail shoot?)Tommy Lee Jones, who graduated cum laude from Harvard, does a great job as an 'ignorant' ranch foreman, a very lonely foreman. There were definitely overtones of 'Brokeback Mountain' in this movie. Obviously, he was not doing a 'John Wayne' (i.e., playing a part that is essentially yourself).The cinematography is as breathtaking as that in Brokeback Mountain, especially down in 'Mexico'. Stay through the credits and you'll see it was all shot in Texas, surprisingly. Riding those horses on the edge of the rocky cliffs must have been scary. Ask the horse that went over if you don't believe me.You might want to see this movie, but it requires that you have both a brain and a heart, so skip it if you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Very interesting and unique story by the amazingly talented writer Guillermo Arriaga ("21 Grams" "Amores perros"). The journey is pure genius with its subtlety, humor and conflict.Tommy Lee Jones' direction is a bit disjointed and choppy, but it is effectively used to offset the starkness of life in Van Horn, Texas - which truly is the middle of nowhere. Mr. Jones is best known for early intensely dramatic acting and more recently for his "Men in Black" films. Personally, I believe his role as Woodrow Call in "Lonesome Dove" is the pinnacle of this true Texas cowboy's acting career. In "Three Burials", he again shows off his horse riding ability and plays his tough guy with a touch of tenderness to perfection. We feel his pain and need for both revenge and redemption.Solid support work from Barry Pepper ("Saving Private Ryan"), January Jones, Melissa Leo, Dwight Yoakam and especially the great Levon Helm, who unfortunately (for us) just doesn't take very many acting jobs. What makes this film work and what sets it apart is the touching story of a promise made and kept. There are a few laughs and some interesting dialogue, but most of this story can be understood just by watching.These are simple people that maybe aren't quite so simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I simply can't see why this film has scored such a high rating. I'm generally in agreement with a lot of people's opinions on films, so when I was recommended this as being a simply awesome film I had to watch it.What I experienced was film with a plot line so thin it was painful, characters with no real 'character' about them (which may well have been the point) and a bizarre use of flitting back and forth throughout the plot.I mean what is this film about? Retribution? Friendship? Perhaps, but it seemed to go on for a very long time with me wondering exactly if we were going to get to a point...All in all, worth a watch if you're someone who appreciates obscure films that seem to strain a non-existent theme. Hey, perhaps I missed the point but thats the beauty of opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's early, but so far the best of 06'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades" is about redemption, loyalty, and friendship and in the subtle backdrop, boredom.Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete Perkins, who has promised his best friend Melquiades Estrada to travel to his homeland in Mexico if he were to die before him. Barry Pepper, does an outstanding job playing a violent and cruel border patrolman most likely compensating for his insecurities and Dwight Yoakem plays the local Sheriff with issues of his own.The wives are the side story showing the boredom of the southern Texan town, how their lives are moving in slow motion yet they are perfectly content with where they are. The rendezvous' and the lying are just a part of the monotony of diner working and border living. I found it interesting to see the unhappiness though the unwillingness to improve.Melquiades is killed by Barry Pepper in a shooting and this is when the story begins. You are taken through the beautiful rolling hills of Texas and Mexico and encounter some very interesting characters along the way as Barry Pepper learns that revenge isn't necessarily about death and pain but about seeing your mistakes and confronting them instead of shoving them in a dark room nowhere to be found.One thing I loved about this movie is how Tommy Lee Jones used scenery as a secondary character, somewhat like "Brokeback Mountain." Tommy Lee Jones was fantastic in this movie as the grizzly old cowboy, he plays the part perfect and couldn't have done better. Barry Pepper, for me, is the real standout of the movie, so convincing as the insecure jock. His role required and uneven emotional level throughout the movie and he nailed it.This movie was the best I have seen in 06' so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bugs Bunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several times while watching this awful movie I thought of Bugs Bunny. After the movie was over I realized why I had these thoughts: Bugs would occasionally 'reach' into his body and pull out something he needed to further the story. It could be a blowtorch, fully operative, or a bowling ball or a weapon. So too with Three Burials. When the story advances to the road aspect of the movie, we get 'surprise' devices like .... finding a blind man listening to a radio in the boonies somewhere in Mexico .....how this living-alone, elderly impoverished sightless man was able to find the fuel to run the .....presumed..... generator since his cancer-ridden son hadn't visited in six months is a different story problem...... The sub-professional screenwriter .....of this movie....., Arriaga, then reaches for the blow torch again when the Barry Pepper character 'escapes' from captivity and enters a cave to hide only to be bitten by a rattlesnake! .....how this beaten-up man, dispirited, exhausted, malnourished, riding without a hat in the daytime Mexican sun then slung over a horse and riding for unknown hours, over rough terrain, could survive a rattlesnake bite is another story whopper too...... There were other fanciful inventions like the ones mentioned but on to other problems with this movie. Repeated flashbacks can be acceptable in telling a story but only when the question is answered, "Would the story work better being told in a more linear fashion"? During the early parts of Three Burials I was confused several times when characters I was just beginning to learn about were time shifted backwards. For this viewer, the confusion this caused wasn't worth the effort itself and the story would have been clearer had they told it straight forward. .....Plus, later on, this creaky device is just dropped from the movie altogether!..... Something else now: Is Arriaga making a political statement by showing virtually all of the white Americans as defectives in one way or another while all the Latino's are benign, generous and overall, good guys? More: The character played by Jones is certifiably insane. Really weird guy. Next: In brief but numerous flashbacks they show the relationship between Pete and Melquiades as a deep one of mutual trust and affection. How then to deal with the duplicity of Melquiades in telling Pete about his non-existent family in Jimenez? Is this something you would do to a good friend when talking about your death and how you would want your family notified? It's pathological and calls into question M.'s character. Finally: Three burials take place. The final one, after all the tedious agony Pete's gone through to have it occur, is a half-ass job with the body not even deeply/fully buried. The local animals would have his remains eaten and spread all over the place, assuming of course, that there would be anything edible after all the amateur embalming that has taken place. PS: Why the need to show the corpse over and over again?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not understand the praise for this film. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada has to be the most plodding, pretentious, poorly written, poorly cast, poorly directed films EVER! This film features illogical leaps all over the landscape, underdeveloped characters, weakly defined relationships, unclear motivations, leaden pacing and an air of self-importance that reeks as bad as the corpse. I suspect all you need is racist white people, a good hearted Mexican, harsh Texas-Mexico landscape and really bad dialog to pass-off a crappy film like this as some kind of deeply thoughtful art. This ranks with Kitano's Brother as one of the big mysteries of cinema... and wildly flawed, awful film that gets rave reviews. Go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three Rotten Burials</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rotten tomatoes all over the place, a minimum of 85% muchos amigo! You see , the great Melquiades Estrada was good friends of Tommie Lee Jones. And you see, such a good friend , he took care that Melquiades got his Mel fuckie fuckie with nice white woman from Border Patrol man . You understand ? If the right honorable Tommie Lee Jones ever comes to TX make sure you beat the craps out of the man, demand he pays $3000 upfront for the cross border fee to Mexico, and kick his ass south right across the border for a retirement without the right to return. The smell of Melquiades Estrada's rotten corpse riddled with anti-freeze and alcohol is still emanating from that self declared town of Jiménez to all the last lost and destitute corners of Mexico. The way the white college boy from Minnesota is mistreated and humiliated inside Three Burials was in old times never observed with folk like John Wayne. At the same time Three Burials is hailed with the NYTimes movie review, Rotten tomatoes awards and even Christian Today in a way that doesn't bode well for the future of TX. The Bill of Rights and declaration of independence was written in English and not Spanish. There is a reason for that. How does civilized spell in Spanish ? After watching this one, i don't even want to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original and generous-spirited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is like a half-tamed horse: noble, free-spirited, invigorating to see in its stride, but sometimes skittish or wayward, and needing a firmer lead. Maybe that's how it should be, since the same description would suit its leading character, and because it is after all a Western--a modern Western, free of gunfights, rustlers, or Indian attacks, but a Western all the same.It's also a piece about immigration, though it never climbs up onto a soapbox to harangue us on the topic. Rather, it inquires with open-minded curiosity into the relations between the Americans and Mexicans who inhabit one or both sides of the border. The characters aren't agitprop puppets, they're querulous, cranky, wrong-headed, and moose-headed, yet still not sure which way they're heading--much like people in life, in other words. The film is very much a man's film, but less a celebration than a meditation on how men sometimes behave; it shows what men do as their impulses or ideals take them and how these sometimes lead them astray. For all that, it's judicious and mild-tempered, and very different from anything I would have expected from director Tommy Lee Jones.It's also imperfect, as Jones would probably be the first to admit. He appears to have been influenced by the Chinese film Ashes of Time: employing the same cameraman as that film, he shows the same kind of yellow desert vistas, and in telling his story he employs the same kind of flipflops back and forth in time. Both techniques give the film an "artistic" feel, but I thought both misapplied here. The landscapes are unrealistically bright, as if it were always near sunrise or sunset, and while that probably suits Jones's character, who seems to see things in an overcolored way, the romantic glow is out of keeping with the life of the region as the film shows it to us: it isn't that pretty.And the time-juggling is just confusing. Its evident purpose is to keep us from finding out until halfway through the film that the initiating incident isn't happening coincidentally with the hero's actions, but happened first and is what it motivating him now. The scheme is too complicated to understand on a first viewing; that isn't good; and also it seems like a kind of confidence trick, which is at odds with Jones's head-on approach generally.The character Jones plays is incompletely realized, both in the writing and in the performance. In comparison to his past performances, this one isn't quite filled out; I suspect his job as director prevented him from devoting the concentration to it he would have otherwise, and from getting the benefit of a director--that is, someone else--to help him along. Then, the script doesn't quite nail the character, as it does those surrounding him. Why is he, alone of all of them, moved to go on this mission? What makes him tick?I think Jones isn't yet a film director primarily; more like a stage director making a film. Some of the camera set-ups in the film are strikingly right, when the staging is right, but some are perfunctory, and a few are outright wrong. The film is sensitive to details of feeling but not details of movement: it's looking more at the big picture, so to speak.But the film--which is to say, the director--exhibits an original vision and sensibility, a generosity of spirit, and a breadth of feeling that more than outweigh its faults. The most striking thing about it is that it isn't a melodrama. Read the plot line, and that's what you'd expect; but it steers away from that, in the direction of human behavior, at every point. Cf. the treatment of violence: The presumed villain, the border guard, is a racist who punches Mexicans he catches sneaking across. But he isn't a stock heavy; he's the most pitiable character in a story full of pitiable characters. He's a racist by knee-jerk reaction, not as a profession; he punches captives when they're struggling as the quickest means of quieting them. His boss orders him to desist not out of righteousness, but because beating up people causes more trouble than it's worth. The characters' feelings aren't exaggerated to whip up excitement but are all on a human scale and are understandable.The one unavoidable scene of melodrama-like violence is Jones's kidnapping of the border guard, which includes the tying up of his wife. But even this doesn't play up the terror of the victims for our vicarious enjoyment. The Jones character does his best, in his muddled way, not to terrorize the wife, and although he's perfectly willing to terrorize the husband, he never cows him. The husband tells him what he's doing is crazy, and he half knows it himself. Throughout the scene the characters bring themselves to bear on the extreme situation, never the reverse, as would be the case in melodrama.The film is partly about seeing--specifically, seeing other people. As Jones and his captive travel through the desert, the story pauses every so often to observe other characters--notably a blind rancher with nothing left to live for--and allows them to observe the two travelers, in each case from a different perspective. Part of Jones's mission is to get his prisoner to change his view of things--to open his eyes, so to speak. In the end his own eyes are opened, when he learns something he didn't know about the friend in whose service his quest was undertaken. In the end, he sees his friend more clearly than before, his captive sees him more clearly, and so forth. The movie leads the audience to do the same. All its characters are different from what we expected at the beginning, and all human. It is to be hoped that the director will make more films like this, showing the same interest in human beings and the same largeness of spirit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder what my late Pop would have said about this movie. He joined the Border Patrol in 1940. I wonder if he could've sat through it. Probably not, but he would have loved some of the scenes. He would have loved the Mexican villages, the desert, Barry Pepper's parade-rest stance in the background during a law-officer scene. I personally detest the new Border Patrol hats. I guess they're practical. Ditto helicopters. Chiming patrol car doors. Musical cell phones. The crunch of zucchini after casual sex. A small herd of goats. The indignities inflicted on beef cattle. Guns. Mops. Twilight. The mule. The motor coach. Rattle snakes and fire ants. The cafe and the cantina. These are parts of the complete universe of director Tommy Lee Jones. He knits his film story with a Kurosawa-like care. I know Jones is proud of his own spoken Spanish and his sound track. He should also be proud of his work with Barry Pepper. Pepper's character Mike Norton comes out of Cincinnati with 21st Century American plastic values, still a kid, and kind of a mean kid at that. Is the secret to changing chickenshit to gold included in this story? Yes it is. Exposure to earth, sun, pain, kindness--being able to accept all these things. On the DVD commentary, Jones says, "The tears aren't real--" Why does he deny the power of his own film like that? But, my Pop would understand--you can make a song or story so very beautiful, and then never let on that it's absolutely real, that you felt and knew those tender and unspeakably holy things. But, dude, that's how the change comes and why we don't all quit even before our short time on Earth is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tequila Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 3 Burials of Melquiades Estrada stars and is directed by Tommy Lee Jones and written by my compatriot, screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, who is responsible for Amores Perros and the very clunky 21 Grams. Well, this time Mr. Arriaga has written an existential allegory of justice and redemption about the Border, which is no small feat. To sound less pretentious, he has written sort of a pretentious western, but he gets lots of Brownie points for ambition and sheer moxie. Good for him for writing a western about the border. Good for him for finally writing an actual human character that is not a symbolic representation of a big preachy notion. Good for him for imagining a border crossing in reverse. Mr. Arriaga, true to his Mexican roots, has a morbid, sentimental temperament. He also has an original mind, a dark sense of humor and a great sense for structure. Unfortunately, subtlety is not his forte. He doesn't trust that the audience can get it without being hit over the head with a tortilla press. Although the dialogue in this film is much more fluid than the one in 21 grams, Arriaga is inconsistent; he writes good zingers and then some pretty stilted dialogue, to be fair, both in Spanish and in English. Still, this is a real western, which is lovely, and I would say, daring. There are magnificent landscapes, there are horses and cowboys and cattle. The movie does not depict the industrial wasteland of maquiladoras and ugly shantytowns that make up much of the actual border. The majestic Big Bend National Park is the backdrop for a more dreamlike crossing. Here, however, very real Mexicans risk their lives to cross over, where the equally real Border Patrol lies in wait to send them back. Barry Pepper, the American Klaus Kinski, plays a transplanted Cincinattian who has just moved to this nowhere land with his pretty prom queen wife. He is a violent, insensitive border patrolman who handles the "wetbacks" and his wife with an utter lack of finesse. Yet by the end of the film he goes through so much punishment that I was hoping he got part of the domestic gross, at least. He represents the ultimate Mexican revenge fantasy -- Kick the Gringo's Ass. It's between funny and appalling, until Arriaga bestows the character with redemption and everything turns to mush. Tommy Lee Jones directs himself into an amazing performance as Pete, a wizened ranchhand who befriends the Melquiades Estrada of the title. Mr. Jones' face looks like Big Bend itself. Deeply lined and pockmarked, it is a compact landscape of human experience. His gaze is sad, and his magnificent voice quite mellow, but he is a strong and stubborn man, quick and efficient with violence, set in his lonesome ways. It is a great character and Mr. Jones smartly imbues Pete with a quirky, dry authenticity. He is the best thing in the movie. My movie companions commented that this movie was so intense, so bloody and graphic, that it could not have been written by a gringo. It's a good point, because the violence is, unlike most American film violence, feral, intimate and messy, not choreographed. Guillermo Arriaga likes big, dramatic gestures; he has a penchant for the grotesque which is quite Mexican in sensibility. Although there are some very smart twists to the story, it is quite baroque, or, like the Mexican baroque, Churrigueresque. The tone of the film oscillates between dark humor and philosophical musing, and then it turns into an almost surreal optimistic fable about the power of redemption. Even the music gets schmaltzy at the end. Still, the Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is an enigmatic, entertaining film and on the topic of the border, one of the most interesting so far. Can't wait for the one with none other than J.Lo investigating the deaths of Mexican women in Juarez (!!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film about redemption, revenge and friendship. Jones gives an powerful and understated performance and is well supported, especially by the two female leads. The direction and writing are taught with barely a wasted word or shot. Whilst there are few real surprises there is some wonderful ambiguity that gives the viewer the chance to think for themselves. Each of the characters is flawed in their own way, but through their interactions with each other they provide something the other needs - redemption, friendship, someone who believes in them, a purpose. Lets hope Jones has a few more ideas in his bag and this is the start of soemnthing good form him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exhumation of Melquiades Estrada</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of Westerns what do we think of? Gunslingers? Train robbers? Or maybe a wild burlesque show in a bourbon soaked saloon? The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada has none of these things yet it touts itself as a western. A modern western at that, but isn't that very idea absurd? There is no frontier. There is no quick draw at high noon. There is no cool nickname like Billy the Kid. I'm not entirely sure what makes a modern western but The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada pulls it off and I like it.The story begins when illegal, Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) shows up, na?ve, amiable and ready for hard work at Pete Perkins' (Tommy Lee Jones) ranch in a border town in Texas. Before long, Perkins, a lone rancher, develops a dependent friendship with the kind-hearted Estrada. Meanwhile, a new border patrol officer, Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) moves in with his wife, Lou Ann (January Jones). Mike is quick-tempered and unsympathetic towards both illegal aliens and his wife. In a bizarre circumstance Estrada finds himself at the wrong end of Norton's gun. Then it would appear justice won't find Mr. Norton. That is until Perkins kidnaps him, forces him to dig up Estrada's body and bring it back home to Mexico.Tommy Lee Jones makes his directoral debut here and it leaves me looking forward to his next project. Shot beautifully and full of subtlety, this film speaks without speaking and casts shadows of a much bigger picture. This smacks of classic western appeal. Bravo Mr. Jones. As a first timer, Jones boldly trusts his viewers to pick up the details of his story and the intricacies of the characters. The little ways that Norton eats his dinner or the way Estrada speaks very carefully, Jones put a lot of thought into crafting the finer points of this film. Even something as seemingly insignificant as which lines are spoken in English versus Spanish plays a major role in the artistic impact.However, one thing bothered me deeply about this film. It was the out of order narrative. The film starts out with flashbacks, flash-forward's and present action. I've never been a fan of these types of films. To me it seems like a cheap way to shake things up and make things interesting. Post-production cut-ups like Memento or Pulp Fiction show me that the filmmakers didn't believe their story was strong enough to stand alone. They felt it needs that "Gee I wonder what happened when he shot that gun" or "how on earth did he end up there" factor. And a western, I've always thought, should be straight-forward like a man with a machete and a vendetta. Fortunately this method is more or less abandoned when we get into the meat and guts of the story.The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is not an uplifting tale. There is a visceral western appeal about it. A blind man requests his murder in mercy, Norton's wife dabbles in prostitution and rattlesnakes are much more of a danger than masked banditos. And all the while, Estrada's body is rotting away with each day that passes.And Perkins is obsessed with getting this body home, fighting off ants' appetites and the smell. But all the plight and struggle pays off when the wonderful ending makes us wonder what home, friendship and loyalty really mean. And with that the modern western is a success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you'd expect; it's better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon hearing of 'Melquiades Estrada' I was eager to see if it could top the likes of 'Butch Cassidy' and 'Unforgiven' as a western (as this is what I was expecting; a 2D stereotypical western that was entertaining nonetheless), but when I watched it I was in awe. It was a western, yes, but it was so much more as well; the characters are developed to such an extent the audience doesn't know where their empathy lies; they are torn between Tommy-Lee Jones' revenge for the accidental death of his friend and whether or not Barry Pepper's character deserves this punishment, not because of the accidental murder, but because of how he treats his wife.For his directorial debut Jones shows an excellence to match most established film makers, in the same way as Gary Oldman did when he made 'Nil By Mouth'. He has left the audience eagerly awaiting more of his work. He combines a stunning visual style much like Ang Lee's with a raw honesty that is more reminiscent of De Palma's work.The narrative is simple because of it's content, but complex because of how the characters react to it. This film is truly a treat for any film fan; there is something for everybody and the plot twist at the end is utterly harrowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and affecting tale of redemptive grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers have noted that The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada reminds them of Cormac McCarthy's work, particularly his border trilogy. For obvious reasons the comparison is apt, but the film may owe an even greater debt to the work of Flannery O'Connor, whose two novels and thirty three stories, reveal the grace of God at work in the midst of sudden and surprising violence, ruthless brutality, obdurate selfishness, galling stupidity, and potentially soul-destroying sin. Thematically, O'Connor used the grotesque to illustrate the concept of displacement. Few characters have ever seemed more out of place than Tommy Lee Jones's Pete Perkins or Barry Pepper's Mike Norton lost and on the run in the wilderness of northern Mexico. And few scenes in the history of film are more authentically grotesque than that in which Pete, in a touching attempt to kill the insects that are feeding on the corpse of his late friend, sets fire to Melquiades' upper torso and then tries to extinguish the flames when his face and hair catch fire. Jones, who wrote his senior honors thesis at Harvard on Flannery O'Connor's fiction, understands the power of the grotesque to throw human character flaws and strengths into sharp relief. The film is among Jones's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Three Burials of Melquiades Estada" is a first rate hit. It is Tommy Lee Jones's first attempt in film direction, and a complete success. Mr. Jones plays Pete Perkins, a south Texas ranch hand who befriends Melquiades Estrada played by Julio Cesar Cedillo. Melquiades is shot and killed by a border patrolman who is captured by Jones's character. Prior to his being shot, Melquiades insists on Pete's promising him to return his body to his home town, Jimenez, in Mexico if should die first in this country with too many billboards. Pete forces the border patrolman to take the body back and the story revolves around their journey. This film is a black human comedy, and one that should not be missed. Jones has accomplished a masterpiece in his first directorial debut, and he must be extremely proud. Hopefull, he will continue to produce this type of compelling, believable film. My hat is off to him and I give him 10 stars on this cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a very good movie about a man who becomes friends with this Mexican. Berry Pepper shoots the Mexican and Tommy gets mad and forces Barry Pepper to carry the corpse of this Mexican into the bowles of Mexico in search of Jimenez. Pepper was a very cruel and over zealous border patrol AGENT. Tommy Lee Jones was a regular old cowboy. By the way, the scenes with the CORPSE were a tad nasty. Especially when he lit the head on fire just to get rid of some ants. Good movie though. Very good movie. That blind man who begged to get shot was interesting. I went to college in Portales, NM. I can understand how these towns are. They are very po dunk towns and rednecks flourish. I was shocked that January Jones, who played Barry Pepper's wife, decided to be a little hooker for a spell. The dwight Yokum character was a jerk but then again, he was that same way in Sling Blade. I am glad I saw this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Good Directorial Debut From Two Face Himself"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three Burials tells the story of a man who accidentally kills another. When Pete discovers that his friend has been killed, he takes matters into his own hands as he intends to keep the promise of burying Estrada in his homeland. Pete takes Norton, the murderer, hostage and they take a long journey to bury Estrada, along the way learning life lessons.Jones can join the list of actors who want to break their mold and become directors. When I first heard about this film, I had no idea how to pronounce it, know after seeing it, I have a better idea at how to pronounce it, but still not one hundred percent. Here, Jones actually makes a good film with beautiful cinematography, good characters, great acting, and an interesting story. Pepper throughout the entire film gets the crap beaten out of him. This was his journey through hell. He gets the crap kicked out of him, hit the face with a gun and a tea pot, hot coffee poured on him, bitten by a snake, dragged by a horse through water, among many more things. Pepper doesn't really show much emotion, until the final scene. He mostly plays a guy hurt, until the prays for forgiveness. Jones, plays the on the verge of going crazy ranch guy Pete. Jones is definitely the highlight of the film, making it his own in every sense of the word, from acting to directing. The supporting cast deliver what is expected to help get the film along. Although, I felt that January Jones was completely useless in this film. JJ, as I like to call her, was only there for eye candy. Some may argue that she is there to show that Pepper had everything, but abused it. That message may be there, but it's buried under so much that it is lost half way through the film. I also ask myself that if you eliminate a character from a film and nothing really changes, then they have no purpose. Well, if you eliminate JJ from the film, nothing changes other then it's running time.The film is beautiful, ranging from deserted plains to high mountains, you get the sense of a journey that goes on forever. The cinematography is one of Burials highlights. Straight from the opening shot we get a sense of what we will be viewing. Although, the camera movement was awkward in the opening, specifically when the film had to pan down to the oncoming vehicle. It seemed to jerky and off with the rest of the film for me. Three Burials ends abruptly and leaves the viewer with questions that they have to answer themselves. If you re one who likes everything to be answered, you may want to miss this film as we are never told if the boarder patrol catches up with our two characters, or even why the one character lied to Jones. The film is told in four parts, the first two chapters, which are the "first two burials" set up for the rest of the film. The rising action of the film is known as the "journey". At this point that you are either grabbed by the film, or wanting to leave. The final act is the "third burial", which is actually the real burial of Estrada and the most emotional part of the entire film. For a first time effort, I applaud Jones. Burials was far more then what I expected it to be. I am interested in what Jones has to offer after this film though, to see if he's a one trick pony or not. Untiul then, Three Burials is an excellent film to watch, and a good directorial debut from two face himself.</fullReview>

I can fathom this being of educational value for 10, 15, 50, or even 100 years.I give Tommy Lee Jones the highest honors. It is so sad that "corporate American" movies reviews hid this jewel so deftly that I had to be alerted to it by an undocumented Mexican!Tommy Lee Jones, being the protagonist, was marvelously made up and I barely recognized him. The antagonist, a border patrol newbie, did a superb job, and actually redeemed a degree of his self-guilt.

		<fullReview>No spoilers here. Go out and see it for yourself.When it comes to directorial debuts, you often never know what to expect. The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada went above and beyond expectation.Perhaps the most fitting reason as to why this film is worth seeing is that it deconstructs the illegal immigration problem at just the right time. The juxtaposition between illegal immigrant and boarder patrolman sets the tone for the the conflict that meanders and moseys as every good western should.The question that I;m left with has to do with all the preamble surrounding this film, more specifically its billing as a remake of "Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia." Is this because it was a bilingual film? Because of the Mexican element? Three Burials is not driven by a bounty. Rather, its narrative moves forward out of the respect of one friend to another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange but lingers with you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched this film, I can say it is a wholly original movie. At the beginning, we are given a slice of life on a Mexican border town which was enthralling. All the characters were three dimensional and I was drawn into the little web they were weaving. It reminded me of Blood Simple with the same kind of building process. It also strikes home on some familiar chords that it was uncanny.What follows though is a a wacky kidnapping that may have you cringing in some parts, empathizing for both leads in other scenes but all the while involving and maintaining your interest throughout the whole movie. The acting is magnificent from Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Pepper (as to be expected), but the supporting roles add the real flavor to the movie. Dwight Yoakum as the small town sheriff, January Jones as the fish out of water wife and Melissa Leo as the slutty waitress indicate the work that went into this film. And it has to be mentioned, the scenery with the atmosphere it creates is nothing short of genius. One feels the despondency and loneliness built by that unforgiving environment.Frankly, I was disappointed the movie turned in the direction it did and never focused more on small town life. Not to say this isn't a fine film, but I feel it could have been a whole lot better.This movie left me feeling a little unsettled and thoughtful about how we deal with loss and how we turn our aggression on those who spite us. It addresses an ugly side to human nature on how cruel we can be to those who we have power over. An interesting movie, one that leaves you with something, which is more than can be said for most of the Hollywood crap being churned out right now.</fullReview>

His over-handed methods soon get him in hot water when he shoots a Mexican farmhand of Pete Perkins, played by Tommy Lee. After finding out the murderer, Perkins kidnaps Norton and takes him across the border to give him a proper burial in Mexico after Nortons co-workers literally try and bury the crime and Perkins farmhand, Melquiades Estrada, in an attempt to cover up any wrong-doing.

The characters, the whole cast was phenomenal--not just how they acted but how they were drawn. The slightly unnecessary (I'll honestly have to watch it again to see the function) segmented Arriaga beginning is a problem I had with the movie, not just because it was distracting, but because I don't understand the function it had in the story other than to throw us off at first. The thing is, I didn't need to be thrown off, the plot didn't have to have to have Usual Suspect or Memento tricks. The film was strong enough without any plot manipulation. I loved the macabre, dark humor, and overall beautiful storytelling. Outstanding picture, and by far the best movie of the year 2005. My top five: 1) Three Burials; 2) Mysterious Skin; 3) Old Boy; 4) Paradise Now; and 5) 40 Year Old Virgin (yes I loved it). See them all if you haven't!</fullReview>

I don't know how to say it, my English is bad, but well, OK, it's kind of a father/son relationship, that's quite obvious. But if this is the only thing hidden behind the story, it's a bit light I think. Along the movie, and almost from the start, you can see Pete react in a strange way when kids or wives are mentioned. Until the end of the movie I was waiting for the director to tell me how Pete had lost HIS REAL family, or something like that... Well, I'm writing this but I enjoyed watching it. For 2 reasons, and therefore my question: Characters are great, actors too. Landscapes... I mean I'm from France, I don't know a lot about American landscapes, except the ones I see in the movies. And there are not a lot of countries in the world (none I think) that offer such a variety of beautiful and amazing places. And I want to know where this film was shot...

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones Debut Excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones makes an impressive debut as director, and adds his own golden performance to the movie. He dominates the screen as the monosyllabic grisly Pete Perkins, seeking revenge and proper burial for his "Greenback" friend who was killed in a shootout with Mike Norton a Border Patrol Officer of dubious character. The location in a border town of Texas that seems to have seen better days and is inhabited by number of trailer home people, is realistically portrayed with the degree of grottyness, that pervades much of the texture of this gritty movie. Dramatic interaction between the two main characters, Pete and the unfortunate Patrol Man Norton, whom he kidnaps and forces him to travel together with the body to a remote Mexican town. There is a sting in the tail of the movie that is unexpected and sets the scene for a moving end sequence. An interlude on the way with a lonely blind man is one of the best scenes in the picture. This is excellent film as sort of contemporary Western, which has a great deal of bite, with tastes of both Ray Bradbury and The Fugitive along the journey.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the subtle, though constant undertones of riotousness did not particularly play out in a memorable manner when asked to ingest the theme. Tommy Lee Jones does a respectable job debuting as a feature length director but his main character in the movie, while always naturalistic, lacks the depth in behavior (surprisingly blamed on wonderful scriptwriter Guillermo Arriaga) needed to provide me with the believability as to his questionable motives. There are scenes that do justify the acts going on, but are almost mechanical and do nothing to illuminate us into the biggest clue, what is going on in Pete's head. These elements provide a somewhat slow adventure that wishes to thematically dramatize a point I do not feel the film strives to achieve very efficiently. In other words, enjoy the journey, but don't think the destination is all it should be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Long Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being somewhat reluctant before watching the movie (the term 'western' kept echoing in some distant corners of my brain) I ended up as one satisfied bastard. Tommy Lee Jones offers a visual feast in his first directorial role, dubbed by a potent story of redemption.Unsentimental border patrol officer Norton, one of the reckless wannabe devils in green shirts, guns down a Mexican emigrant due to an error of judgement. Most unfortunately for him, the Mexican, who goes by the name of Melquiades Estrada, happens to have a good and faithful friend in the person of Pete (T.L. Jones) - who decides to fulfill the man's wish (to be buried in his hometown) and also to serve some punishment to the criminal, a duty the local authorities do not decide to partake in.Unlike the modern stories of vengeance which are filled with blood, suffering and death, Norton's road to redemption is only compiled of the first two. As Jones meticulously portrays the lonely man figure - the type of man that knows to value friendship - he transcends, in a way, the realm of our puny world. His only concern is for Melquiades and his calmness (despite being followed by the border patrol) is just enticing in provoking a strange change of heart in the viewer. Or at least in me.It's always nice to see a good movie about friendship, devotion and redemption and even though "The Three Burials" never gets very 'emotional', it's deep enough to offer satisfaction to both heart and mind. May this be the first step in a long career, for 'young' director Jones.</fullReview>

And in the beginning the plot moves in this direction...the border guard (Barry Pepper) character is too cartoonishly "bad" "stupid" bumbling, while Mexican characters are almost universally sympathetic. The cover-up of the shooting of Melquiades also draws a line between good and bad characters that is a little bit overdrawn or somehow doesn't mean enough. Then, Pete (Tommy Lee Jones) starts to get more ambiguous as a character and the Mexican characters, including Melquiades, become just a hair more three-dimensional. The movie recovers a little bit.It is also well-shot in a beautiful landscape and it feels as though you get see an interesting small world. Also a very beautifully drawn encounter with an old man on the way is memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones obviously went way back in film history and studied the extreme works of legendary director Sam Peckinpah as "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is almost an homage to that wild and revolutionary film-making style that crept up slowly in the 1950s, was noticed slightly in the 1960s and finally exploded in the 1970s. Jones stars as a ranch-hand in the most desolate and isolated part of West Texas who befriends an illegal immigrant (Julio Cedillo in the titled role). Cedillo is mysterious and leery of being taken back home to Mexico by the Border Patrol. Although half of Jones' age, Cedillo tells Jones where to bury him if he ends up dying in the U.S. Meanwhile a new Border Patrol officer (Barry Pepper) has just moved down to Texas from Cincinnati of all places. Pepper is not exactly a touchy-feely kind of person as he has blatant hatred for Mexicans and seems indifferent with his young wife (January Jones). A freakish accident occurs, Cedillo is killed, Pepper tries to cover up the accident and Tommy Lee Jones finds out just what happened. Thus Tommy Lee Jones comes up with a scheme to kidnap Pepper and bury his friend in his native land of Mexico. While all this takes place, sheriff Dwight Yoakam gets thrown into the dizzying mix, along with local waitress/seductress Melissa Leo via real-time and Quentin Tarantino-styled flashbacks and snap-points. Levon Helm nearly steals the show in a short cameo as an old blind man living right on the border alone that Tommy Lee Jones and Pepper encounter on their long, arduous journey. Tommy Lee Jones is a top-notch director who obviously knows how to film the hopelessness and sometimes utter nothingness of Texas. The narrative development and tone of the picture are also right on target as Tommy Lee Jones lets the camera dictate the action found within and he gets ample support from all the principal performers. "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada", along with the highly under-appreciated "Glory Road", has the cinematic year of 2006 on the right track early on. 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film but flawed in delivery to the point of frustrating and leaving cold much of its audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melquiades Estrada once came to Texas seeking work and met a man called Pete Perkins. The two men became friends as they worked together. Mike Norton came to Texas with his wife Lou Ann to work for the border patrol. When Norton is in the desert he hears shots fired and returns shots on a Mexican man, killing him. The man was Estrada and Perkins is distraught at the death of his friend and, when he learns the truth, is angered by the lack of action against Norton. Needing to keep his promise to Estrada to bury him in his hometown, Perkins kidnaps Norton and forces him to help in exhuming and transporting the body across the border.I had this in my rental queue when a colleague had told me that he'd given this 15 minutes and then fast forwarded the rest looking for anything of interest. This didn't put me off as my man is a bit of an action freak but I can see what he meant because the film doesn't put itself out any to thrill the audience! Instead the film is patient as it develops a very subtle story, which is both a compliment and a criticism. The material is interesting but there is no denying that it could have been more impacting ? not more "action packed" but just a bit clearer with its depth and character development. As it is, many viewers will be put off by the lack of depth to much of the plot ? it establishes what it is doing and then it does it very slowly. It does reward those that stick with it but it did need to have more going on and more depth as it progressed. As director, Jones must shoulder the responsibility for this. Visually he has done a great job in his own backyard but with such subtle and restrained characters it is harder to bring things out and in this area he was only partially successful. Given how the actual narrative isn't the clearest, the film needed to bring the characters out well and sadly it holds back too much and creates almost too much work for the audience.As actor he is again a bit too restrained for the most part. I understand this is what the character is about but in such a case it is vital to show lots when the slightest crack; his Pete just does hold too much back ? even when the cards are on the table. Pepper does yet another impressive job in support and, considering how he is silent for the majority, does a good job with his moments where he does bring a lot out. The rest of the cast are very much secondary although Cedillo, Yoakam, Jones and Leo all give reasonably good accounts of themselves.Overall then an interesting film but not one that makes much effort to endear itself to its audience. Slow moving to the point of occasional frustration, the material asks a lot of the audience by holding a lot back till the end and even then asking for a lot of interpretation and work. More should have been made of the fragmented timeline approach (which is only used early on) to tell us more regarding the end during the film thus increasing our understanding and interest. That it doesn't do this is a failing and, while I still thought the film was worth a look, I have to concede that it is nowhere near as strong as it could have been and is perhaps best viewed by a limited audience prepared to meet it on its own terms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's probably some truth in this story of how badly many honest and hard-working illegal aliens are treated by the U.S. Border Patrol. Not that you'd know it from this movie, though, there are also--probably--a lot of honest, hard-working border patrol agents who every day have to deal with some not-very-nice people trying to enter this country illegally. Still, I did actually enjoy "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada". Just as the Hollywood writers intended, I liked the old cowboy, despised the despicable young agent, laughed at Sheriff Yoakum, empathized with the blind man, and was revulsed by the stiff. The pro-"illegal alien" viewpoint was relentless but much funnier and more subtly done than "A Day Without a Mexican." There is, of course, only one viewpoint that counts in Hollywood. Some day I hope to see a movie that actually recognizes the humanity on both sides of this complex problem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TLJ's gift of redemption -SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent, complex, human film. Stunning cinematography. Brilliant acting, especially the minor roles (Melissa Leo, Dwight Yoakam).The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because of too many *karmic* coincidences in the plot (Lou Ann's meeting Melchiades, or, the Mexican healer crossing paths with Mike again...etc...)The only plot point I did not understand was why Belmont does not shoot them when he has them in his line of fire?RE the comments about the confusing denouement, I think that it was left ambiguous on purpose. The ruins are obviously much more than 5 years old.... Arriaga's real message seems to be one of redemption. TLJ's character brings redemption (unknowingly?) to Pepper's character, who would have otherwise felt remorse for the rest of his life.... The scene at the end after the apology where we see Pepper sleeping peacefully for the first time in a long time seems to evoke this. The ending would have been far too simplistic had they found the town, the grieving widow, the children etc, and for Pepper to have made his apology concretely to them. Instead, the apology was much more poignant and difficult in an abstract setting before an abstract family. It is then that the story stops being about Melchiades being buried in the right place, and becomes rather one of Mike's journey through suffering, stubbornness and confusion, to an enlightenment of sorts. As a Texas native, I have heard stories of abuse, cruelty, and unreported killings on the part of *some* (not all) US border patrol officers, as recounted by Mexican immigrants to me. It is a problem which is seldom talked about in the media. Thanks to Tommy Lee Jones, the issue will hopefully get some much-needed media attention now. Many people in France, for example, had no idea about this brutality. By telling a story about friendship and redemption, the film evokes the problem without being too preachy. Great flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>high atop Mount Ivy League</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As in Faulkner's book "As I Lay Dying" a dead body is transported over difficult terrain. There the comparison stops, for there is no revenge in Faulkner's book. There's plenty of it in Tommie Lee Jones movie, "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada." Viewers expecting the charm, dry humor and stoic philosophy that have become trademarks of Jones' performances will be disappointed. The desolate beauty of the Rio Grande borderland shown by Jones' camera serves as an echo of the bravery once necessary for survival in that country, and of the quiet joyousness which lifted grim survival to a higher level. Not content to imply, however, Jones shows us(in brutal detail) the population's lack of humanity, and only that. His movie becomes a political polemic instead of a work of art.A glimmer of humanity is provided by Canadian Barry Pepper ("Enemy of the State," "Saving Private Ryan," "*61," "The Snow Walker"). By his unsettling performance he again shows what can happen to an all-American when he loses his sense of humor. Otherwise, the characters seem to cardboard cutouts ....... or beautifully painted corpses.Although raised in rough Southwestern terrain, Jones attended a private prep school and then Yale University. He never returned to the sagebrush except in the movies. Now, from his lofty position high atop Mount Ivy League Jones looks down on the little people of the borderland, and doesn't like what he sees. Faulkner showed us seriously flawed Southern hillbillies in "As I Lay Dying" but it was clear that he loved them. Showing love: As a director, Jones ain't up to the job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of ideas, very few worked-out ones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot going on here, and a lot of it is best described as "weird." Where to start when the entire film seems to be saying one thing and doing another, but both things are really weird? I'll start with the plot. A fiery and judgmental border patrol man accidentally shoots a Mexican immigrant named Melquiades. Mel's close friend Pete (Tommy Lee Jones) takes the body and the border patrol man on a journey to bury Mel in the land of his dreams. Loosely, it's a tale of redemption and male bonding.However, a lot of things are going on in this film that make it more, but for little necessity. It's excessive tries at doing different and bizarre things are unfortunate mostly because by the end, they just didn't work.For instance, we have a recurring image of television throughout the work, the boob-tubes themselves representing a character's inner thoughts. It's pretty interesting, but used in a rather distracting and somewhat excessive way. We also have this theme of impotency that flows throughout the work in many different ways, but for a tale of male bonding, it doesn't fit. Maybe the movie isn't, then, about male bonding, and just redemption. But then it's hard to understand why we care about Pete's progress as a character.We also have an overexposed form of cinematography that simply didn't work for--well, let's not be vulgar. It's ugly, and that's all it is. It also has the effect of making interiors look stone cold, which only seems like it's supposed to fit but really doesn't, exteriors look bland and unfocused, which also could be symbolic but is only distracting, and lights/shadows glaring which only hurts the eyes. Jones didn't spend too much time behind the camera, but I don't think the cinematographer did either.Also, the narrative starts out nonlinearly... for what reason? It doesn't really do anything but confuse the timeline. It doesn't provide deeper looks at the characters, as they could have been presented in the same way linearly. Also, the different intertitles "The first burial..." "The Journey" etc. are pretty useless. Hey Tom? We can count. We also know what a journey is and what it means to a character's development. And I think we can recognize a burial as well.So, a lot of ideas, very few worked-out ones. This stands as the first movie I've ever reviewed where it's main problem is that it "just didn't work" as opposed to the many I've reviewed where "surprisingly, it works." --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jones has the patent, always did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Three Burials of Meliquiades Estrada, Tommy Lee Jones's Pete Perkins is what Clint Eastwood tried and almost achieved in his stylized performance with his no-name everymen: laconic, gritty, principled, violent, and lonely. Jones has the patent, always did, and was found out to be the real thing when in the remake of The Fugitive he gave these memorable words with enough world-weary competence to make Bogie jealous: "What I want out of each and every one of you is a hard target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, hen house, outhouse, and dog house in that area . . . ." I am a sucker for minimalists, and director/actor Jones delivers the best of it in this film. Jones's sense of honor and loyalty demand that he return the body of his friend Meliquiades (Julio Cedillo) to his home in a remote region of Mexico. The interconnection between the border guard Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), who shot him, Norton's luscious, bored wife (January Jones), the "wetbacks" beaten by Norton, and the barren but beautiful Mexican border is deftly woven into a slow-moving, relentless story worthy of Jones's tough-guy persona and intelligence. Jones won best actor and the film best screenplay at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival-both honors unarguably worthy.In fact, Harvard English major Jones gave his crew Camus' "The Stranger" to gain an understanding of alienation, a mode Jones delights in portraying in most of his films. A blind Mexican, one of the characters along the way to the burial, could serve as a Tiresias or chorus from a Greek tragedy. I've heard Jones also pushed Flannery O'Connor's short stories, which are often peopled by outsiders who make a difference, change things.But Three Burials is still a John Houston-like story of grit and wit lying on a bed of a morality tale, rife with memorable characters who could survive only against the backdrop of mesas, buttes, cacti, and dust, where the elementary nature of good, evil, and everything in between can air itself out and let us peep into the Darwinian justice of a cowboy with a simple vision of returning a beloved buddy to his ideal resting place. But it's not "in pace" getting there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you asking a lot of questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers* Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) is a cattle rancher in southern Texas, near the Mexican border. One day Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo) rides up on his horse looking for work and is taken on and becomes friends with Perkins. We understand that Estrada is an illegal. Enter Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), an over-zealous rookie U.S. Border Patrol agent. Pepper convincingly plays Norton as a self-centered, oversexed, quick-tempered, unsympathetic character with little redeeming social value. On lone patrol one morning Norton hears remote shots (Estrada shooting at a coyote). Upon investigating he sees Estrada and in haste fires and kills him.Perkins ultimately finds out that Norton is the culprit and, when he realizes that the local authorities are not pursuing the matter, he takes things into his own hands. He abducts Norton from his trailer and forces him to help carry out a promise Perkins made to Estrada to bury him in his home town of Jimenez, Mexico. This involves a long arduous trek on horseback into Mexico.During the course of this journey you are forced to consider questions that do not have clear answers. Perkins endangered Norton's life, so was he justified in his act of vigilantism? Perkins was an obsessive and stubborn man, could he not have used those personality traits to pursue the matter through the legal system? Would everybody in authority have the attitude that, "Well Estrada is just an illegal, so why bother with him?" I doubt that. And what if Estrada had been a legal Mexican American? How would the story have played out then? What if Estrada had been white, which could have been since Norton's act was impulsive? If the shooting of Estrada had wound up in the courts, Norton would probably have gotten a few years for involuntary manslaughter and, after a few years in prison, would he have emerged as an embittered criminal or repentant and changed for the better? Are we being encouraged to admire the extralegal justice administered by Perkins? Did Perkins initially have any agenda beyond vengeance? Estrada was a likable and hard-working fellow who certainly did not deserve his fate, but is the message being delivered here that all such Mexicans who want into the U.S. be allowed in? What is the answer to the immigration problem then? The policy currently in place seems woefully lacking and you have to think about what would be better. Some big questions surface at the end. Based on a photo and some directions sketched by Estada, Perkins tracks down Estrada's wife in Mexico, but she refuses to acknowledge the marriage. Estrada said he had not been back to Mexico for many years, but had he such little contact with his wife that she had given up on him and remarried? How does that scene change your opinion of Estrada? Nobody in the little town that Estrada had said was near his home in Jimenez had ever heard of Jimenez. Undaunted, Perkins set out in search of Jimenez and convinced himself that he found it. Was he in fact convinced? Did he really find it? Does it matter? Is he crazy? Did Estrada lie about his past? What would become of Perkins and Norton after Perkins rides off into the sunset at the end?The movie is artistically filmed. I never knew that the topography of southwest Texas could be so interesting and beautiful. Part of the appeal is due to filming that shows great attention to detail and use of color. The open landscape focuses attention on the two lone travelers.The casting is near ideal. Jones has perfected a grizzled look that projects melancholy, seeming to reflect some internal anguish or regret.I wish the friendship between Perkins and Estrada had been more well founded--we see but a few scenes of them together before Estrada gets shot. The long journey to the third burial is prolonged, but necessary to show the gradual transformation of Norton from ass to someone capable of caring for others. The redemption of Norton is complemented by that of the bigoted sheriff (Dwight Yoakam); when he has a chance to shoot at Perkins to stop his flight to Mexico, he can't get himself to do it and he finally divorces himself entirely from the whole affair by going on vacation.The acting, the landscape, and the ambiguities presented make this an engaging film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada (Tommy Lee Jones, 2005) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good modern semi-Western clearly influenced by Sam Peckinpah's BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA (1974). The film features excellent cinematography of the sweeping but desolate landscape by Chris Menges and a good score by Marco Beltrami. Guillermo Arriaga's script is introspective and elegiac, but also takes care to insert a number of clever twists (Barry Pepper being unaware of his wife's having been unfaithful with the man he inadvertently killed; Pepper, a rather obnoxious Border Patrol officer, being brought back to health - after a skin-crawling scene in which he's bitten by a rattlesnake - by the very same Mexican woman he had previously assaulted; the odyssey which sees Tommy Lee Jones, imposing as always, transporting the body of the titular character across country - with Pepper in tow slowly falling apart - turning out to have been merely a wild goose chase). This was one of four 'modern' Westerns I rented - the others being STRAIGHT TO HELL (1987), THE CLAIM (2000) and THE PROPOSITION (2005) - after my recent genre binge comprising more vintage films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable directorial debut by Tommy Lee Jones.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once read in these IMDb comments that the true strength of a film was was its "stickness". That is, do you remember a film and its details even after the passage of days that turn into weeks and Three Burials has that quality for me; it has been neatly a week since I saw this absorbing movie-longer than I like to take before writing IMDb comments and I find that the movie is still with me as rich and absorbing as it was last week. For a guy with a sieve-mind as I have, that is a high compliment for any film.The first thing that I remember about Three Burials is the extraordinary starkness of the film: starkness of landscape, starkness of emotion, starkness of Jones's portrayal. The south Texas landscape should be given space in the credits on a par with the actors because, through Jones' shot selection, it plays an integral role in the film. Moving further out on the analytical limb, I would say that the landscape is the metaphor for the starkness of the lives endured by the human inhabitants of the region. Working class environments as portrayed in this film and in similar films present an extraordinarily bleak vision of rural America. I've just revisited that 70's classic The Last Picture Show and Texas does not come away from that film any better than this one.To me, the plot drove this film-it was the canvas upon which the actors played out their roles and they played out these roles superbly. Jone's Perkins and Pepper's Norton carried the central story as you will see. I am unfamiliar with Barry Pepper's work but his strength in this film marks him as an actor I will watch for in the future.Be sure to watch carefully for a remarkable piece about mid-way through the movie by Levon Helm; for old guys like me, he was better known for being the drummer and sometimes vocalist for the legendary group known as The Band. His is a remarkably sensitive small role but is probably worth the admission price alone.You owe it to yourself to see this memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guillermo Arriago doesn't get enough credit for planting all the right seeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This script feeds into European cinema at its best and blackest, in the work of Bunuel. Guillermo Arriago follows ideas idea down the rope to their logical resolution, exploring every sublime absurdity on the way, and we know we shouldn't be laughing. Or is it hysteria, are we recognising the ways in which we have been duped by tamely accepting the definitions of right and wrong that our society dishes us? What's happening in this script? It expresses the schizoid war between divine love and diabolical cruelty that has given Hispanic art and religion their particular and uniquely bloody flavours. It can't be an accident that the decent man in this flick is called Pete (St Peter, keeper of the Gate). The sinner who gets his just deserts is Mike (a wry inversion of St Michael, who in Christian mythology weighs our souls, so that we get our just deserts). And the murder victim is also the begetter of a cruel disappointment. The Melquiades of the title could be Melchior, one of the Three Wise Men, who in this script seems to be revealed a hoaxer who sent us all off on a fruitless mission to a place that wasn't there. It is a deep, moving and hysterically funny take on redemption and forgiveness, divorced from the the usual pieties and pivoting instead on an utterly rational idea of justice; and I salute Tommy Lee Jones for picking the quality of this script, for getting it past the Hollywood baloney machine, and for not rubbing our noses in any of the above. It is rare, perhaps even unprecedented, to see Hollywood making space for a script that comes from a foreign literary and narrative tradition. Now, please, loud applause for Guillermo Arriago, without whom none of this would have been possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crossing the border between men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' directorial debut rolls out the expected cast of redneck sheriffs, cheatin' wives and noble Mexican poor but thankfully nobody quite plays according to stereotype. This tells the story of Pete Perkins (played by Jones), a rancher who honours his promise to Melquiades, his illegal immigrant friend, to return his body across the border into Mexico to give him a proper burial in his 'hometown'. In tow, and very much under duress, is Mike (a stunning performance by Barry Pepper) the hapless border patrolman who accidentally shot him.Almost from the outset things start to go clumsily wrong and they just don't stop. An early scene has Pete pouring beer over poor Melquiades' head and briefly setting him alight like a zombie Bombe Alaska, in order to prevent ants from eating him. Later in the movie Pete hits on the idea of pumping Melquiades with anti-freeze to preserve him. I was beginning to wonder if it wasn't all going to degenerate into a sort of "Weekend at Bernies" with cowboy hats. I shouldn't have worried, though. Jones and writer Guillermo Arriaga have created a small gem of a movie with a heart as big as the grand Texas country so beautifully filmed throughout. Everyone comes out of this sadder and wiser, including the audience.Many people have made much of the political aspects of this film, but it feels to me to be more about personal choices. Sad, funny and grim "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is ultimately about empathy. Mike's closing words, just before the credits roll, show that he has finally come to see things from another man's point of view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one could accuse Tommy Lee Jones of making either a travelogue or a valentine to West Texas given his depiction of a flat, empty, melancholy meaningless place which would probably induce rather than heal depression. There is, as we know, nothing new under the sun so the story of a man living out of his time and undertaking a long, arduous journey on horseback whilst being pursued by officers of the law owes something to the novel Lonely Cowboy, filmed some 30-odd years ago as Lonely Are The Brave, with Kirk Douglas as the time-traveller and Walter Matthiau as the lawman on his trail. Harvard-educated Jones has delivered a fine film and if it seems to replicate some of Clint Eastwood's work in the genre is none the worse for it. Although boasting two awesome performances from Jones himself and Barry Pepper it is in fact something of a mosaic with even the smallest roles being filled by more than competent actors. Jones himself is both a native of Texas and lives in the area explored in the film which may well account for his dour film persona. A worthy addition to a time-honored genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tommy Lee Jones and Barry Pepper in a Guillermo Arriaga story, directed by Jones is guaranteed worthy of your appreciation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might wonder about the film title of "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada." This Tommy Lee Jones directed film is like a fable with a Western approach (Western as in cowboys and horses). It is written by the ever thought-provoking Mexican writer-filmmaker Guillermo Arriaga (scripted "Amores Perros" and "21 Grams"). The story is almost like a road trip but on horse-backs. The premise reminds me of Sean Penn's "The Pledge" 2001 (with Jack Nicholson in the lead) - staunchly keeping a promise. "Three Burials" is easier to follow (the promise was to a friend and there's ritual and honor involved) as the purpose of the road trip was quite evident and the characters are down to earth, including Border Patrols and Sheriff.The journey reminds me of Humphrey Bogart in director Raoul Walsh's "High Sierra" 1941 - the scene where the police was going after Bogart being up in the mountains. Also reminds me of w-d Abraham Polonsky's "Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here" 1969 - the trailing on horse-backs across desert land. The tough storyline of "Three Burials" is eased by the skillful cinematography of Chris Menges, who did "The Mission" and "The Killing Fields" (both directed by Roland Joffé).Yes, the film is doubly 'ferocious' in its direction and performance from Tommy Lee Jones - just as determined as the lead character Pete Perkins in keeping his promise to Melquiades. Playing opposite the well-weathered 'nothing to lose' ranch foreman Perkins is an equally 'Tour De Force' performance by Barry Pepper of the cocky, 'doesn't know any better' rookie border patrol cop Mike Norton. The three elements that propelled the film: Arriaga, Jones and Pepper, are enough reason to see and appreciate this 'filmic' gem of 2005.Before the journey begins, Jones took time to show us the various characters, main and supporting, in the small town culture/environment. No one's a saint or sinner - everyone is being human. ('Kinda' reminiscent of the characters in w-d Paul Haggis' "Crash" - we all have our foibles and vulnerable sides). And following Perkins' resolute journey, we are in suspense as to how Norton's fate would fan out. Plot twists/surprises lie in waiting for us. And the ending - when will it come and how will that turn out? Fable or fantasy, it can be satisfying but definitely keeps us thinking beyond.The film's executive producers included Luc Besson, whose films also contain characters who are relentless about honor and promises, with kindness of the heart as life's staple.</fullReview>

It is quite simple story but very well presented and I think it bears quite a strong message...for me this film was about finding the humanity within ourselves. The whole situation changes just when you look at it from a different angle. This film brought me the idea how terrible it is to kill somebody but shows in one scene as well that even the murder can be blessing for somebody sometimes... maybe the film brought me also better understanding what one has to do for his sins to be rectified. ...and maybe one lecture you as well: never masturbate at work!:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So you want to build a fence along the border</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one could have starred in this movie but Tommy Lee Jones. No one can pull off the textured, heart-felt performance he can. Mr. Jones is the essence of the soulful cowboy where soul means the true measure of one's capacity to do good. And in this wonderful movie Mr. Jones does magic from both in front of and behind the camera: as director he transports you to a dusty, hardscrabble world along the border where time moves slowly and lives seem uncomplicated by racial distinctions. Into his world come a couple from Cincinatti. The husband wants to protect the world he knows from illegals though as far as we know he's never really met any. He knows enough to dislike them in the way only a kid popular in high school could. And though his pretty young wife is left to fend for herself, he devotes himself to searching the hills for 'Mex' with fixed ideas of their character born of prejudice and gut feeling.For me the role of the Border Patrol cop from Cincinatti played by Barry Pepper was critical. I was so sure I'd see false notes and the usual concessions to the delicate American psyche. But Mr. Jones doesn't soften Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay, and Mr. Pepper is so convincing he almost steals the show, no easy task. Because, though these two could very likely have carried this movie by themselves, everyone else gives a dazzling performance as well. Dwight Yoakam as the local sheriff, January Jones as the young wife and Melissa Leo as the café's savvy waitress are all cast and execute with such perfection that I really can't imagine anyone else having taken their place.There's something in Tommy Lee Jones' eyes that assure you his character will somehow ring true while expressing the feelings and lives of people you probably don't know. These people have not often been accurately depicted in our theaters. And though, for a moment in the beginning, you'll wonder if the movie's interweaving of the past with the present will confuse you, don't worry, it won't. One thing you won't wonder about is whether the writer and director and actors know this country and its people. And given Washington's current preoccupation with immigration, and their clearly meager understanding of those coming by the back door into our country, I can't imagine a better time for this movie to come out. What a brave little movie this is! How easy it would have been to pander to the Minuteman mentality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Three Burials..' is a very entertaining film. Thoughtful, lyrical, well acted, and with breathtaking cinematography by Chris Menges, the film will remind some of the last obligation Texas ranger Woodrow Call performed for his friend Augustus in 'Lonesome Dove' ? namely to return a friend home for burial.Tommy Lee Jones directs as well as stars, and his first effort in directing is admirable. The film also stars Barry Pepper as a border patrol agent forced to accompany the main character on the task; as well as Melissa Leo - with an unforgettable Levon Helm in a brief scene or two.The film is not perfect by any means. Some scenes are repeated unnecessarily (alright, we know the pretty wife is bored; and dead bodies are gruesome when exhumed), and some linger on too long. And while some of the scenes are also a bit stretched ? and one scene is extremely coincidental - the movie still works well.I also noticed that there was more chemistry between Tommy Lee's character and his friend Melquiades in their short scenes together, than there was between Heath and Jake in all of 'Brokeback'. The irony is that this film will probably last a tenth as long as the better publicized 'Brokeback' before being pulled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story about redemption...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Melquiades Estrada - a mystery man. Kind, warm, pure good, you can say, but there's still something about him, that keeps you thinking about his story. His life story, that was ended in such sudden way. And there's a simple border guard, that made a mistake of his life. In the middle of them you can find an older Mexican cowboy - friend of Melquiades, who's loyal till the end. The story of this three is a story about friendship, loyalty, guilt and redemption. Simply - a "must see" for everyone. You'll love it! I'm sure of that. One of the best movies of the past few years. Great acting, great pictures, that'll hold your breath, great screenplay and very good director. Overall - great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the West Was Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best Westerns are morality tales, and one could argue the very best Westerns are stories of vengeance: The Searchers,Red River, Bad Day at Black Rock, Unforgiven. Three Burials twists the knickers on that great tradition. It is a stark story of revenge for a senseless killing, in which Tommy Lee Jones's cowhand Pete sets his jaw and acts upon a friendship and a promise.Which sounds like the grand tradition of Western hero, but, as Pete's mission takes him down a long, cruel cul-de-sac, the moral of the story keeps getting subverted. What seems an heroic gesture early on may in retrospect be the first wriggling of a great madness. We're entirely on Pete's side in the beginning, and appalled by his pastyfaced and amoral adversaries, who are pointedly indifferent to justice and human dignity. So we cut him all kinds of slack, despite his initial bursts of violence and sadism.When the very object of his mission dissolves away before his unbelieving eyes, when the promise he is bent on keeping unravels into nonsense, Pete doesn't seem to flicker. He slogs through on nothing but determination (and madness?), and finds a home for his purpose in an empty ruin. It's an arresting moment - Pete cannot possibly do what he has set out to do, and yet he finds a way, if only in his own mind. Creepy, fresh, and in the best tradition of operatic oaters.This is Jones's movie, both as director and as star. The camera work is deft and economical (a virtue of modest budgets), and even the smallest performance is worked out with an actor's intent. Barry Pepper is wonderfully hapless as Pete's ostensible nemesis, and Melissa Leo (of Homicide: Life on the Street fame) grounds the pervasive amorality of her tiny Texas border town as a cheerful, slatternly diner waitress. Dwight Yoakam racks another deft film credit as the lazy, cowardly sheriff who share's the waitress's attentions with Pete. Julio Cedillo is sweet and engaging as the title character - somewhere, maybe in Jones's basement, is a badly beaten up latex copy of his head. And watch for the great Levon Helm in a small but riveting performance as a man listening to the radio in the desert.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not know what to expect from this movie, myself, a Mexican, raised in America, did not expect to see the very realistic treatment of the plight of those that continue to cross the border. I remember thinking to myself while watching the movie, how will the average American viewer take this movie? no doubt there will be those who will not bring down the barriers to attempt a better understanding of the people who's only crime is to attempt survival at any cost (like to the young border patrol officer in the movie) - but I also know there will be those that will try to understand the message. I liked it very much and am grateful for this offering, and hope it can contribute to improve racial relations, in this very mixed-up place in which we live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a great surprise. I expected it to be entertaining as it seemed to have a good story but after viewing it i realized it was much more than that. At the beginning the movie was a little confusing. Some scenes takes place at different times and it jumps around. After realizing this the movie became a lot easier to follow. The acting is solid throughout and the cinematography is done well. At the films conclusion one realizes how much more to the movie there is. The film is left in a way that is open to interpretation. It is not only a story but a deeper look at people and feelings. This is best shown with the final line of the film. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a little deeper film than the norm. Tommy Lee Jones did a great job with this film and i can't wait to see what he comes out with next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film made some news while being shot here in Texas, so I was waiting for it to be released...but it played in Europe before being released here in Mr. Jones' home state. What a powerful commentary on the state of politics and culture here in Texas, and on Hispanic-Anglo relations. What a visually striking film--virtually any shot is beautifully composed and worthy of being displayed in a museum. What a powerfully acted film--Jones projects such depth, Dwight Yoakam adds another character to his gallery of colorful but unsympathetic losers, and as the title character Julio Cedillo (a native Texas also) is mesmerizing yet subdued. And Barry Pepper takes a completely unsympathetic role and makes it unforgettable as the Border Patrol agent. As a Texan, I can attest that this film totally gets it right about Texas life and culture. The last film I saw that was equally on-target was the TOTALLY DIFFERENT film THE ROOKIE with Dennis Quaid. The film-making is both post-modern and classic. The soundtrack is diverse and perfectly chosen. I've admired Tommy Lee Jones' work since ROLLING THUNDER (shot here in San Antonio, by the way)--it's nice to see that the man is as complex and intelligent and visionary as I thought he might be. I won't give away much about the plot as it should hit you unexpectedly for maximum impact. People will be watching this film and learning from it 50 and 100 years from now. Why wait? See it on the big screen--it's visually striking. So what's the next directorial project going to be, Mr. Jones?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human story (w/ jokes!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect going into this movie, but it blew me away. It's a needling (and necessary) story about illegal immigration, the immigration officials that attempt to thwart the movement north, a bad mistake made and the horrible cover-up that follows.Tommy Lee Jones (TLJ) directs a powerful movie that tells the horrible story of this idiot misanthrope who shoots a man that turns out to be an illegal, then tries to cover up the murder. Dwight Yoakam does an excellent job playing the IMPOTENT local law pitted between the need for justice and the heavy hand of the Federales(!). TLJ is the dead man's boss &amp; friend who sets out to seek justice &amp; return the body to his homeland.Basically, the story takes the 'bad guy' through some of the troubles and turmoils the people have who are trying to come to this country to work. It really is a gutty, gritty story, TLJ delivers a hell of a performance (as does Barry Pepper as the misanthropic immigration official). I almost want to say he (Pepper) get his comeuppance in the end, but that's too simplistic. He learns, sees the error of his ways, but it's not that trite - there's real meaning to the journey these two take together.There's a very odd twist towards the end of their journey that I won't reveal, but I just don't understand it. It doesn't necessarily detract from the movie, I just didn't understand it.I think the best part of this movie is that it is funny when least expected and (in a story of this subject - very topical right now, always a contentious issue), TLJ's ability to bring humor into it makes it all the more funny - and I mean hysterical at points! I think I liked this movie most of all because I had seen so much GARBAGE in the few months before this - I finally got to see a good movie, I felt like screaming. I think this movie's flying too low under the radar, isn't getting enough attention and all in all, is a fantastic movie that is well worth the time &amp; more than the price of admission. GO SEE IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada," is a story of a man who is trying to honor the wishes of a dead friend and get revenge on the man who killed him. Other than that, there is very little story.This is a film where character development is the foundation. The first half of the film is mostly about the characters living in a small border town in Texas. The second half is a road movie, where Pete (Tommy Lee Jones) takes the killer of Melquiadas back to Mexico to bury the man he killed and teach him to respect him. Pete originally tries to bring the man to justice but when the authorities dismiss the killing of a "wetback" not being worth their while, Pete goes nuts and kidnaps the killer, so he can bury him in his homeland.If you decide to see this film, do not expect a lot of action or clever dialog. This is a film about the characters and how the events in the film change them.The film was written by Guillermo Arriga, who also wrote "21 Grams" It follows the same format in the first half where some of the events are portrayed out of sequence. Tommy Lee Jones does a great acting job and a good directing job, although I can't help but wonder that Alejandro Inarritu might have done even better.If you like thoughtful, well acted, and well photographed films, you should give "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the finest movies I' ve seen recently. I' ve always considered Tommy Lee Jones to be a decent actor but I could never imagine that he could actually direct, and what is more, a movie that would touch me so deeply. This is a "road movie". The two main characters travel in order to fulfill a dead man's wish. The one of them is determined to do it no matter what, the other is literally dragged by the neck. Issues like racism, humanism, friendship, loneliness are but a few that this movie touches. It doesn't preach loudly, like many American movies tend to do. Instead it lets small truths slowly grow inside you in a magical way. Apart from T.L. Jones who was amazing on the main role I was very impressed by Barry Pepper's acting.I'd never seen him before in a movie but I believe that he gave one of the best performances of the last movie season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jones and Arriaga try a Tex-Mex redemption story and get it pretty damn right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jones and Arriaga try a Tex-Mex redemption story and get it pretty damn rightThis movie about a Texas ranch hand who steps outside the law so a Mexican friend will have a proper home burial and his killer may expiate his sin comes from the pen of Guillermo Arriaga, the chilango whose writing led to Amores Perros and 21 Grams. Tommy Lee Jones, a Texas good old boy, directed it and stars in it. These two facts would make The Three Burials worth watching and likely to feel authentic, but the movie contains much humor, poetry and truth besides, its wild final journey almost worthy of Cormac McCarthy, the visual poetry of cinematographer Chris Menges standing in for McCarthy's inimitable prose. (Jones owns the movie rights to Cormac McCarthy's savage and likely unfilmable masterpiece, Blood Meridian.) Like some of McCarthy's characters Pete Perkins (Jones) and his wetback pal Melquiades (Julio Cedillo) have no families at hand, their rough laconic friendship idealized and set apart by being conducted exclusively in Spanish and based on the shared love of horses and women.Arriaga adopts his usual split-narrative form to set up a movie whose riveting and transformative journey across wild lands into Mexico later turns increasingly linear and focused. We begin by sliding back and forth between the idealized, simplified friendship, the locale (a desolate but beautiful stretch of west Texas near the Mexican border), a café where two women are found -- the cook's wife, the weathered but still sexy Rachel (Melissa Leo), who sleeps with both the sheriff (Dwight Yoakim) and Pete on the side, and Lou Ann Norton (January Jones), the bored idle wife of new hothead Border Patolman Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), a lean, intense fellow who's to become the villain and the changeling of the piece. Rachel has a nice thing going, but Lou Ann pines for the malls of Cincinnati and can think of little to do but sit and smoke.Segments cut back and forth to show arrival of the Nortons and purchase of a large mobile home. We see Melquiades dead, laid in the ground. The obnoxious sheriff has trysts with Rachel, but can't get it up. TV and sex are ironically blended. Mike takes Lou Ann from behind, getting off quickly after a long day's work while staring at a bickering soap opera on a little TV. He gets in trouble for grabbing and beating some border crossers who tried to run off. He's about to have an al fresco hand-job to a skin mag while on duty when Mel's shot aimed at a coyote zings by him. The gruesome and the comic consort with the cruel and the kind. The Northern Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico becomes a character too although, as Lee has said, one that "doesn't take direction." In that wilderness Mike and Pete come to a bunch of Mexicans watching the same bickering soap on a little TV hitched to a pickup, understanding nothing, like the aged blind man (Levon Helm) who listens to Spanish radio all day without comprehending a word.Arriaga likes coincidence to the point of the far-fetched and also relishes disconnects: the snake-cure lady is someone Norton gave a broken nose to. Pete and his adversary the sheriff improbably both sleep with Rachel. One time Pete and Mel have motel sex with Rachel and, unexpectedly, Lou Ann. In Mexico, the Spanish-speaking Pete begins bumbling in English to everybody; and when Melquiades' home is tracked down, it seems a mirage.If Jones has a lived-in and comfy feel to him as a Texas border ranch hand/cowboy, it's because he's from there, lives there now training polo teams and (as he told an interviewer for the LA Weekly) "raising kids; raising cattle; raising, training and selling horses." But good 'ole Jones also acted in New York after rooming with Al Gore at Harvard. He's a man of enough culture to abhor the term "Western," talk of minimalist Donald Judd's influence on the film's visual compositions (the Judd museum happens to be at Marfa, Texas), and point out how the lighting in the snakebite cure scene's based on the neon pieces of Dan Flavin (it strikingly is). He's obviously aware of McCarthy. Arriago must be aware of B. Traven. There's something very Traven in Melquiades' lying about where he comes from so when the goal is reached, there's no there there. Like McCarthy's Border Trilogy, Three Burials makes the journey into Mexico a voyage to truth and older values and also wildness, insanity, and purgation. It's a surprising journey with extreme experience and humor. Unlikeable but pitiable as the wired, uptight Mike, Pepper turns into a whimperer and a screamer whose suffering intensity carries the narrative from tragi-comic ramble (and exposition of racism) to redemptive myth. Set against Mike's fear and hysteria Pete's smiling good humor -- Jones's trademark rote mellowness -- may seem too pat. Still, the two tend to balance each other out. The snakebite that poisons and crazes Norton is almost crudely symbolic of the evil that's got to be worked out of him. Pepper gets the final cathartic moment of the movie.More fable than realistic tale, The Three Burials requires suspension of disbelief if Pete's going to seem to you as just and wise as he's foolish and crazy. The chopped-up narration can lead to confusion: some of us can't for the life of us remember seeing more than two burials.The Mexico City-born Arriaga isn't always a convincing writer but he sure is an interesting one. He provided Jones with great material to work with but it's Jones, the good cast, and cinematographer Menges who give the movie its wry authenticity.(Jones' directorial debut was the 1995 made for TV Good Old Boys starring him, with Matt Damon, Frances McDormand, Eve Calloway, Sam Shepard, and Sissy Spacek, among others. This is the second movie he has both directed and starred in.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this would be some type of murder mystery, but it wasn't. The movie tells you who killed Estrada half way through. The movie moves slowly with not a lot of action. That was the main problem with it. The story had a good premise, but wasn't entertaining enough. The latter part of the movie is mainly set in the dessert with not a lot to look at. Jones and Pepper were good in their roles. But, it was rather gross to think about someone hauling around a dead body in the dessert. I don't care if they did put antifreeze in the body. The stench would be horrible. It just doesn't seem like someone who wasn't crazy would do that.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but slow.

		<fullReview>In "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada", Tommy Lee Jones takes you one a crazy, unpredictable journey from Texas to a little town called Jimenez in Mexico, to deliver the dead body of his best friend Melquiades Estrada.The entire movie is a trippy horseback ride, and Tommy Lee Jones is the loyal, but enigmatic, cowboy that leads the way. Tommy Lee Jones made a promise to his best friend, a mysterious Mexican cowboy, to take his body and bury it in his hometown of Jimenez, a Utopia for Melquiades.When Tommy Lee Jones learns of his friend's death, he avenges his best friend by finding the killer and forcing him to come along for the rough ride to Mexico. To disclose any further details of the movie would really take away from the experience so instead I'll inform you what to expect out of this.Expect Oscar-caliber performances all around. Tommy Lee Jones, emotionally petrified from the death of his best friend, and an amazing performance from Barry Pepper, who is forcefully taken on the journey after two rounds from a shotgun he will forever regret.This is an amazing story, and Tommy Lee Jones was skillful in telling it. Full of characters, even sub-characters, (including an old, lonely man who hasn't heard from his son in months, or seen anybody in 30 years), that you will sincerely feel compassion for.There is really something wrong with the Academy if "The Three Burials" isn't nominated for all the major categories. To secure an Oscar victory, perhaps Tommy Lee should have hired the 3-6 Mafia to write an original song. Besides that, the movie is an amazing journey that is as funny as it is heartfelt, and as dramatic as it is intriguing. You will not be disappointed in uncovering the mystery of Malesquiades Estradas and the enchanted land of Jimenez, Mexico.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Lee Jones' "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" is a mournful, strange, intense movie. Part "Pulp Fiction," part Western revenge picture, the film feels its own currents acutely, and envelops us in its threads of loss, regret, and loneliness, so that we're left feeling wrung out.The many characters of "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" share not an ounce of happiness between them. Jones creates an observant portrait of Texas border life, replete with lazy greasy spoon diners and depressing pre-fab mobile homes. Everyone in town seems overcome with an inexpressible melancholy. There's Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), a young border patrol agent who seems drawn to the rough work to satisfy a semi-repressed sadistic streak. His young wife idles away the days in their trailer, and looks forward to trips to the mall. The local waitress beds seemingly half the men in town, including ranch hand Pete Perkins (Jones). And there's the title character himself, whom we first meet as a rotting corpse being munched upon by coyotes, but later see in flashback in the flesh.The film's first half uses overlapping flashbacks to reconstruct the circumstances of Melquiades' death, as it constructs its large cast of characters. For a while, we're primed to expect some revealed truth regarding his death. As it happens, though, the shooting death of an illegal Mexican is no big mystery. Accidental or not, the border patrol and local PD are not going to bother themselves with a real investigation over one more "wetback." Perkins, though, was close to Estrada. We have the distinct impression that the Mexican was, in fact, his only friend. He certainly cares enough about the dead man not only to have him dug up in order to bury him in Mexico, as per his wishes, but to kidnap Norton, whom he's been told was Melquiades' killer.The film here moves into a lengthy, lyrical sequence subtitled "The Journey," in which the two men run (or ride) for the border. Again, though, it has a tendency to zig when a zag is what we're expecting. It's not a road trip, exactly, though both are transformed by the experience. Nor do the men bond in classic movie fashion, although they do enhance their mutual understanding. The sequence is affecting in its imagery: a horse falling to its death off a cliff hardly fazes Perkins; the extreme measures, including fire and anti-freeze, Perkins uses to preserve his friend's corpse for the journey.Jones in particular here gives an odd performance, imbued with detached sadness. His Perkins can seem a maddening cipher. At times I was craving some back story or buried detail that might illuminate a man's motivation and ability to go calmly to such extremes. We want to know what's going on in Perkins' head as he increasingly desecrates the body of a friend whose memory he is working to sanctify. Late in the film we're given as close to an answer as we'll get. In flashback, we see Melquiades lost in recollection of the life he left in Mexico. He holds forth about his family, about mountains close enough to hug, pure spring water, and overwhelming natural beauty with a sincerity that, at the time, makes Perkins laugh. Yet for a man who is surrounded by, and indeed embodies, such sorrow, Melquiades' fond wistfulness is something worth preserving. "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" occasionally leans toward the inscrutable, but it's a film that's hard to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The modern western has taken a turn towards the dark side. Since the early 90's, films like Unforgiven and Dances with Wolves don't focus on the guns and glory that was once the west. They show a darker, more sinister frontier that makes it clear: this is not a happy place to be.From the man who created 21 Grams and Amorres Perros comes The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, the story of a Texas cowboy whose friend is gunned down in an accidental border patrol "shoot-out". Tommy Lee Jones directs and stars as Pete Perkins, the cowboy whose friend Melquiades is killed, and he wants answers. The local law enforcement could care less on account of Melquiades being an illegal alien. Pete will not rest until Mel's killer is found and Mel's final wish of being buried in his hometown in Mexico is fulfilled.Border Patrolman Mike Norton (Barry Pepper) has the misfortune of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. While perched on a hill, he mistakes Mel's gunshots as a threat and takes him down. His tactics are rather aggressive while on border control, but this time he will pay for his mistake. When Pete finds out that Mike was the man behind the bullet, he kidnaps him from his home and forces him out into the desert and onward to the Mexican border and eventually to where Mel told Pete to bury him should anything happen.Jones's directorial debut is exceptional for an actor turned director. The rolling landscape that is the southwest is used beautifully. The story is broken up into four parts, but it is really broken up into two. The first half is like a puzzle, much like 21 Grams in its entirety. The events that occur during, previously, and following the death of Melquiades. The second half is more a straight forward story line going in one direction. Filming a movie where it jumps around can be a daunting task. Trying to hint at the solution and not give away what will happen is quite an art form.One of the more unique aspects of this movie comes from the journey taken by the three men; Pete, Mike, and Mel. What could have ultimately ruined the movie was how Mel's body was incorporated into the story. It was done tastefully and not too grotesque. Pete doesn't treat is like a corpse, but treats him like he would Mel. He has Mike dress him and is never disrespectful. Pete isn't being creepy, he is caring for Mel. He wants to make sure that Mel's body is not disrespected. Although carrying a dead body around in the desert can be troublesome, Pete makes him a passenger on this journey into Mexico.Jones and Pepper shine in their roles. They are not alone with a great supporting cast with Dwight Yoakam, Melissa Leo, and January Jones. Altogether The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is satisfying. It is a great modern western and a wonderful, disturbing story. Jones future as a director looks bright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If after a week you are still recalling scenes, lines, feelings, maybe the movie affected you at a much deeper level than you realized. This story could have been set 100 years ago or last week. It is that rare, timeless, pure gut-level experience.Barry Pepper turned in what I consider to be the best supporting performance of the year. Hands down. He nailed the character. The melancholy Tommy Lee Jones, celebrated for his acting, was better as a director. He felt this material, and it shows. The man is at home in this Lonesome Dove setting.Not since Unforgiven has a western, or a story, been so effectively told. The human experience of how a death can ripple through the living and bring forth actions surprising to the actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just this evening we enjoyed this most unusual and delicious movie on a whim. The lengthy title was intriguing, initially. Following this wordy name, we found a unique plot and well-rounded characters you were privileged to become intimately acquainted with before the credits rolled. Tainted with none of the inanity of the bulk of the mindless tripe that is offered for the movie-loving public, Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada strides right into real life,lived to the hilt, by real people. Each character is multi-faceted,with both good and evil shining forth as life is played out. You'll gasp at the audacity, covertly laugh at the humanity displayed. Tommy Lee Jones is bodacious and robustly all man and devout friend. You may have to skip a bit until you come up to speed with the plot during the first part...but, it's well worth your effort. You have no hope of figuring out the quirks this plot line will employ, don't try. Just immerse yourself and let it flow over you and pull you in with the rest of the characters. You don't want to know the plot ahead of time, your joy will be in experiencing the movie just as I did...in one gigantic feast of cinematic perfection.</fullReview>

And then thinking back to the turning point of his life, the Three Burials.It shows a soulless, young creep, Mike Norton- played by Barry Pepper- who is doing no one on this earth any good, taking a soulful man's life, and then having his own life redeemed at gunpoint by the purgatorial ride to Jimenez, enforced by Pete(TLJ)At first Pete is the ruthless, avenging demon prodding him on through hell, even going so far as to run across a blind man who has "almost paid his dues in hell", then, finally with the gift of Mel's horse- and calling him "son"- did you notice that? Tommy Lee becomes the benevolent angel. I'm very impressed with the writer, Guillermo Arriaga. This is a vivid depiction of man's soulfulness and truth amidst violence and lust, much like 21 Grams was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film very OK. I would agree, it has that something that could make it a very nice film, but...TL Jones, just as Clooney in Syriana, is trying to widen the world vision of his fellow countrymen and give the less fortunates of this unequal world, the voice they deserve. But what I found annoying was the too obvious clichés: The rich, arrogant and superficial Americans on one side, the poor, innocent but nice Mexicans on the other side and in the middle, Pete Perkins, role played by TL himself. It was too "black and white" and lacked of nuances that would have made it even more spicy.This is, I think, TL's first try as director, but I don't believe he had to stretch his talent as he didn't had to reinvent the wheel. See for instance "21 grams" and you'll know what I mean.The film could have put a little bit more focus on the issue of forgiveness, but that came a little bit too short too my taste.Nevertheless, I would highly recommend to anyone. When actors go behind the camera, it is most of the time always worth it. I think of Eastwood, De Niro, Clooney and many others I don't remember the name right now....(6++)7/10</fullReview>

They have minimum wage jobs (janitors, berry pickers, fast food) while we are becoming professionals (lawyers, doctors, accountants). The Black gangs are upset that Latino gangs are inflitrating and overrunning their neighborhoods in California cities and that Latinos are replacing Blacks in general.Asians don't even get the help of Affirmative Action like Blacks and Latinos. BTW, AA is blatant discrimination against Whites and Asians; they get extra points/consideration just because they are Black/Latino even though they are unqualified. I'm glad Asians are grouped with the privileged Whites and Jews and not the Black-Latino-Native underclass.By the way, I agree with the original post. The stats. can't be denied.

		<shortDescription>A Vivid Personnification of Border Culture and Clashes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" personifies border issues between Texas and Mexico through the iconography of the obsessed man in the West genre, such as "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre", "Lone Star", and Tommy Lee Jones' own performance in "Lonesome Dove". The director/star brings his own powerful movie images with him as much as Clint Eastwood does, including from "The Fugitive" and his craggy face is flintily expressive. We absolutely believe that "Pete Perkins" would undertake a monomaniacal, possibly crazy, odyssey for his own frontier justice. The stark environs are as commanding as the very strong actors, with each set off in sun-blinded cinematography by Chris Menges. Small town life in Texas is portrayed as evocatively as in "Last Picture Show", but those teens have grown up into bored and lonely adults with secrets (a maturely vamping waitress Melissa Leo and a bit too foolish sheriff Dwight Yoakam) and the assumption that things will never change. "We were popular in high school" pouts the surprisingly good January Jones about her now border patrol officer husband (a bit stereotypical square-jawed bully Barry Pepper who is only given some humanity towards the end).It takes a few scenes to adjust to the time-cutting back and forth. But it's far less than in scripter Guillermo Arriaga's "21 Grams" or "Amores Perros", and the shifts are clearly related to explaining characters' point-of-view, showing us what prejudices, miscommunications and misunderstandings brought each character to a confrontation and shattered lives. While there are almost as many coincidences of people crossing paths as in "Crash", they are used to illustrate how differently each character is perceived on the other side of the Rio Grande, where one becomes "the Mexican" in the U.S. and the other "the gringo" in Mexico, though, as has been satirized in several other movies, everyone seems to watch the same tele novella soap opera.Framed by titles setting each burial as a chapter heading, this is mostly a road movie brimming with ironies and colorful personalities, including Levon Helm as a blind guy who seems as dangerously trusting as the girl in the "Frankenstein" classic. Left unresolved is if, as one character says, each is "beyond redemption," if that's what Jones's screen-dominating character is seeking.There are bizarre images and quick scenes of graphic violence.The music selections are marvelously representative of the border culture, from country Merle Haggard to Hank Williams, Jr., Tex Mex Augie Meyers, to the bi-lingual Freddy Fender and Flaco Jimenez. This and "Brokeback Mountain" are vividly demonstrating that cowboy movies can still resonate with new insights and passion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am afraid that this wonderful film of the American West got lost in the flurry of attention accorded BBM. There are some definite similarities, in the laconic manner of men and women of the west, in the wide open spaces, the characters out of touch with their emotions, marginalized female roles, the importance of friendship and the inability of people to understand the relationships of others.The biggest differences from BBM are of course that it's not about homosexuality, and it's set in the Southwest, near Mexico.Tommy Lee Jones is striking as Pete, but in supporting roles, I really enjoyed the performances of the always excellent Melissa Leo and Levon Helm. Neither actor is afraid of being seen as aging... which makes their characters all the more poignant and real.</fullReview>

The only vestige of salvation comes from some of the gorgeous filming of Mother Nature.The first half of the film comes across like the editor was blindfolded and arbitrarily grabbing scenes to splice together. The nicest thing to label it is "Incoherent."The friendship between Jones and Estrada is somewhat established, but a session or two of chasing whores doesn't seem to justify the extent to which Jones goes when he finds out who killed his pal.The film's ending was also dismal. Why did Estrada have to invent a wife and family? Why did he have to invent the town of Jiminez? Was he nuts or just a poor lost soul desperate for context? And what about the Border Patrol shooter? After being put through hell, wrapping up his role with the line? "Are you gonna be okay?" hardly seems sufficient.Jones did journeyman work in his dual role of actor/director. Unfortunately he didn't have much to work with in terms of story and script. Nice try but no cigar. Perhaps things will go better next time.</fullReview>

This movie ties for first place with Underworld Extended Cut as the worst commentary ever.

		<shortDescription>Jones' Impressive Directorial Debut Echoes Huston/Peckinpah - Redemption Tale Reverberates</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE THREE BURIALS OF MELQUIADES ESTRADA (2005) *** Tommy Lee Jones, Barry Pepper, Julio Cedillo, Dwight Yoakam, January Jones, Melissa Leo, Vanessa Bauche, Levon Helm. (Dir: Jones)Jones' Impressive Directorial Debut Echoes Huston/Peckinpah - Redemption Tale ReverberatesLately Tommy Lee Jones seems to have been in a rut since winning his much deserved Oscar over a decade ago for his stolid turn in THE FUGITIVE as the relentlessly dogged Lt. Gerard but in his latest - and his first chance behind the camera - Jones does exactly what the film attempts - redeems himself.The premise is simple in a pulpy western sort of way: Jones stars as Pete Perkins, a ranch foreman in a Texas border town who is outraged when his good friend Melquaides Estrada (Cedillo) is seemingly gunned down in cold blood for no apparent reason. As Perkins attempts to gain some hypothesis for this senseless crime and affront to his own personal integrity he is faced with a stonewalling by the local sheriff, Belmont (Yoakam doing a good bad here) whose indifferent racism is barely cloaked as he determines that it was an accident and has Estrada unceremoniously dumped into an empty, unmarked grave (after it was discovered half-hazardly buried not far from where he was killed by a coyote gnawing at the corpse). The reality is Estrada was indeed killed by a careless shot fired by a heedless new border patrolman, Mike Norton (Pepper in an excellent turn here) who has a way of turning off his emotions even when he is screwing his newlywed hottie bride Lou Ann (January). Norton's lame cover-up is soon found out when Perkins' lover Rachel (a fine Leo), the local diner's waitress (whose also having a fling with the jerk Belmont) overhears a conversation between a border officer and the sheriff about Norton's role in the death. When Perkins learns of this - especially after angrily accosting Belmont for his lack of informing Pete that the body was re-buried with no dignity- he is dead- sent on rectifying the situation ?even if it means killing Norton in the process.What follows is Perkins beating Norton up and then handcuffing him, leading him to the body to be unearthed, placed on a horse and to follow Perkins into Mexico to give his friend the right thing: a decent burial.During the journey - and with a steamed Belmont in hot pursuit to nail Perkins' ass to the wall just for the hell of it - the two disparate men face off with anger, retribution and ultimately forge an unspoken bond as Perkins is determined to have Norton literally walk a mile in his slain amigo's path by experiencing the immigrant migration and hopefully to teach the stubborn young man a valuable life lesson: all human beings deserve proper treatment, living and dead.Jones proves a natural talent as a director echoing John Huston, Sam Peckinpah and his contemporary Clint Eastwood in his no-frills/no-fuss, clean- eyed view of telling a story with little fanfare and relying on strong characters as the muscle of the storyline (the screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga (21 GRAMS) is more then a parable of right and wrong). Jones gives his best performance as the grizzled veteran cowboy with a good sense of right and wrong and although he is flawed (he drinks, is a loner and seems to be serving his own good more than his dead friend's) his Pete Perkins is an indelible force at hand. He speaks volumes in just allowing his silent, craggy visage sear through the screen. Pepper gives a strong, shrewd performance - his best since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - making his petty, indifferent asshole a flesh and blood person that ultimately gains the audience's empathy - a prisoner being punished by a nearly crazed stranger - and suffers many indignities (not the least being a rattlesnake bite!) for his unacknowledged blameless sin. I particularly enjoyed the welcome black humor largely in the duo's discovery of an unlikely oasis in the form of a blind elderly man adrift in the vast desert no- man's land (a barely recognizable Helm, best known as one of the legendary musical mates in the Band) who also manages to provide the most jarring sequence as well. (To say more would ruin the viewing experience but when it occurs it really tugs at your conscience).Jones succeeds in depicting how racism is still rampant in this country and as well as Mexico and the plight of the illegal immigrant today just as it has been for far too long. An elegiac peon to an old West sentiment: do the right thing and the right thing might do you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had The Potential, But Didn't Quite Work Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to explain why "The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada" didn't quite work out. All the good ingredients are present: Solid performances (especially by Tommy Lee Jones); original plot with a clever twist; and a professional direction (again, by Tommy Lee Jones). So what is the catch? Before answering the above question, I will recount TTBOME's story: Melquiades Estrada (Cedillo), an illegal immigrant working in a Texas ranch, is accidentally killed by Mike Norton (Pepper), a border patrol officer. As nobody saw the murder happen, and since the person involved was an illegal alien, the incompetent town sheriff (Yoakam) decides to bury the case. However, Pete (Tommy Lee Jones), a co-worker and close friend of Melquiades, does not intend to leave things that way: He kidnaps Norton, and forces him to unbury Melquiades' corpse, in order to help him take it to Melquiades' home town, and make a proper funeral service with Melquiades' family. They thus begin together their odd journey...The problem with the above story is that although it is very unusual and original, it is also very implausible. It is very difficult for us to empathize with Jones' character: No matter how naive and committed to his friend he might have been, it is simply completely incredulous to watch him have Melquiades' corpse carried along as a companion. Several disgusting scenes result from this process, such as seeing Pete inject car fluid into Melquiades' mouth so that his corpse will not be eaten by ants, or watching him trying to comb the corpse's hair and getting half his scalp off. I really think that all this was rather unnecessary for the viewers to have, indeed...Worse, the pace of the film is really frustrating. At the beginning, it rolls quite well. Then, somehow things get utterly stuck; and subsequently, it starts again to oscillate between normal and slow. All in all, it got me tired of watching.I do believe that if TTBOME was produced through a different perspective, something quite interesting would come out of it. Unfortunately, in its present form it gets 4/10.</fullReview>

In summary, this movie is an insult. There is no cinematography, there are no redeeming points for the simple reason that every single action is clearly designed with bias and serves only one purpose; to display the Mexican population as saints by using actors who are not even representative of that population.The entire script is a direct transplant from any western movie of the 60s just with the political message slapped to it on every frame. 1/10A travesty.</fullReview>
