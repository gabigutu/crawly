		<shortDescription>A bland retelling of a powerful novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most acclaimed graphic novels of all time has now come to the big screen. Not only is this one of the most acclaimed novels ever but it's one of the most controversial. The story is basically an origin tale for the infamous Batman villain, The Joker. When this movie was initially announced back at the beginning of 2016 there was some serious hype surrounding it. Especially when it received an R rating. One thing that really made me nervous though was how quickly this actually released. Obviously, it could've been in production long before it was announced back at the beginning of the year, but after seeing the film, I don't think that's the case.The first thirty minutes of the film is a kind of prelude involving, mostly, Batgirl. It talks about how she came to quit being said superhero and draws a thread between her and Batman. Now, this story is controversial for a reason. Not only does it explore tough themes but it shows the details of these horrible things. The story in the graphic novel is brutal, uncompromising, and pretty tough to get through.However the film is just the opposite. It tries hard to retell the story seen in the novel, yet any emotional drama is all but lost. This mainly has to do with the length of the film itself. Being only 80 minutes, it's rather short. As I said, the first thirty minutes revolves around Batgirl. And this segment of time is absolutely the worst to sit through. It's tedious, overly long, and so cliché and predictable that there's nothing remotely enjoyable.While, this part of the film is undoubtedly the worst from a storytelling standpoint, there are a number of things that remained consistently bad throughout. Most notably was the animation. From a studio like Warner Bros you'd expect some decent art work, but not here. The back drops nor art design is well put together. It's clunky, with no style to be found.It looks like they took the animation from a rough draft of the animated series and colored it in. This issue becomes even more clear whenever it attempts 3D animation. The other blaring issue that continues through the film is the music. Which is completely contrived and formulated to the point of it being so cliché that is, in fact not cliché.As the film ended, a crowd that once cheered for the lights dimming, was left in stunned silence. Not a good stunned silence like you get after watching 'Gone Girl', this type of silence is the kind where people don't know what they just saw. For me, this had to do with the complete lack of any emotional resonance. When it attempts to recreate the power of the novel it fails. It doesn't commit enough to the drama of the story. Even with its R rating it doesn't draw the same toughness the novel does. It lacks the rawness that the novel has to make it's audience queasy. It's not graphic enough to be disturbing and it's not lighthearted enough to be fun. It just bounces from scene to scene with little connecting one to another. The best way to describe it is that it goes from this scene to that scene and than it ends. That's about it. &#x200b;This is one film that should have been great. All the pieces are there. It has a great studio behind it, an excellent voice team, and a brilliant story. But it lacks the emotional power that the novel has. Even though it has its R rating it doesn't fully commit to it, or anything for that matter. Without coherent direction and the overall first draft vibe of the film it's hardly the experience we've been lead to believe it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought that The Killing Joke is actually not long enough and not quite suitable enough for big screen. This just proves it.There's a lot of padding to extend the run time. First 20-ish minutes are brand new stuff, not from the comic book. It deals with Barbara and her relationship with Batman. Also, they have sex. Yeah, so, moving on. I guess that new stuff had purpose to extend the run time and maybe add some more character to Barbara, to make the later stuff more impactful. But somehow it (new stuff) becomes totally disconnected from the rest. Again, the comic didn't have that much material to put into an hour plus long movie. So while it does fill the time, it doesn't add much or subtracts from the whole picture. Although, that sex scene was a bit unnecessary.There are few more fillers along the way and they are also in that "nor adding, nor subtracting anything from the whole" formula. Ending was a bit weird too. While it will be an eternal debate about "did Batman strangled Joker or not?", in the comic, that last page ended perfectly, they both laugh, then they both stop, and you can only "hear" incoming cop sirens. Here, similar, only we hear Batman weird laugh extending into fade to end credits. While a small thing, it kinda annoyed me. Also, there's a mid credits stinger, which was also out of place and felt a bit unnecessary.Now, it's nothing new that Alan Moore doesn't want to have anything with transferring his stories to big screen, here they skipped him completely and credited Brian Azzarello for story. I guess he did the best he could to expand the story to fit into an hour and 15 minutes animated feature. Only those fillers were kind of whatever.Voice acting and all that, Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong, Nolan North.. all the good stuff about that. Music, also fine. What I want to write a bit more about is animation. Now I'm aware how painful process of animating can be but here we got DC average animation to DVD/BR home feature - bit stiff, not much texture to the world and characters but passable. It could (should) be way better though. Directing was OK but I can't shake the feeling that a bit of quality directing and editing would make this thing a whole lot better. But it's OK.And that's the running theme here - OK. Good but not great. In the end it was just another DC animated straight to DVD/BR feature and not exactly suited for the big screen. I would be OK if they never made this, but I'm OK with this as well but it could be better, as I already said. I expected more, was fine with what I got... but... I expected more dammit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, but Alan Moore would hate it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK... I'll be honest: I was waiting something great and I didn't get it. Maybe because of the very high expectations that the movie just couldn't reach. There was a couple of things that bothered me. I think the important part was too short (about 45 minutes), they gave too much emphasis to the Batgirl prologue, I mean, the Joker appeared 30 minutes after the movie initiated, for God sake! Yes, there was some things from that part that I thought were interesting, I'm sure some people will hate them though. I was very uncomfortable with the inconsistency of the art style, sometimes The Joker looked amazing, sometimes... not very good; besides, the animation was very weak in several scenes, I mean like 10 fps and that's unacceptable Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy's work was the best of the movie, I can't complain about that. It was OK. But they could do it a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rehashed Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how to approach this movie. I wanted to like this movie I really did. I wanted to like everything about it. From its revival of the good old' Batman TAS to the voice actors to the sweeping soundtrack, the polished animation reflecting a dark Art Deco Gothic ? whatever the hell you call it ? STYLE. Maybe I was asking for too much but perhaps a little story on the side too. Pretty please? That being said, I also slapped a big 'REALISTIC Expectations' sticker over my eyes before watching the screen come alive. I knew this wasn't going to be as good as Batman: The Animated Series. But I was glad to have something reminiscent of that monolith of 1990's animation and storytelling. Boy was I in for a surprise. The core issue of this movie is not the A) story it chose to tell or B) how it told said story but rather C) the juxtaposition of a classic show's established world (including its location, characters and story) with a modern flavor. Telling a new story that kind of breaks the older established world we all fell in love with on the TV screen. Then yes we have the story itself, a dark telling of how the joker became to be, without Warner Bros. censorship. This complicates things a bit. So without further ado, let's go down the list! Issue #1: Old World with new rules that break it. Really jarring, adds a new dimension of sex that was apparently very crucial to the story (or not). Enter strong powerful female figure defined by her sexuality, hit on by every hot criminal she meets, then making kinky love to Batman on rooftops with creepy goblins looking over ("it's only sex!") Definitely not a shallow character, no shortage of hot gay library friends and definitely loads of problems like deciding which guy she wants to be with. Let's see what's behind door number one ? BATMAN. Who is Batman? In this movie, he's pretty much a Zoltar of lazy story exposition. Says the most obvious things. Has no inner conflict. Has no fears. Has no emotions no feelings yet in the end we are supposed to feel his turmoil in fighting the Joker. Batman ladies and gents, is purely a device in this film. Batgirl was fan-service. And the movie spent a good 40 minutes setting up her love story to Batman when all of this information could've been relayed in a few key scenes! Why didn't this happen? Because the real star of the show got pushed out ? the Joker! Wasn't the story about the Joker more than anything? He isn't a witty clever funny man anymore. Now he's just misunderstood and 10x darker than Nolan's version. Although voiced by Hamill, he doesn't even compare to the TAS Joker who lit up the screen. Going to credit this to mediocre writing. Obvious things (90% Batman lines), dumb things (35% Batgirl lines) and unfunny things (75% Joker lines) should not exist. Make your dialogue interesting and worth quoting!These flat characters, the story's misplaced focus on character and conflict arise from the core issues ? the new Batman, complete with its sexy fan-service, empty brooding heroes and second-rate comic relief ? just cannot exist in this world. A Killing Joke is a story of its own and if it takes time trying to break the Batman TAS, then it should've been in its own world. Dear Mr. Liu, please do not use Batman TAS for anything if you're going to give us something new. Just give us something new. This story could've been its own thing and it could've been great. Issue #2: Show don't tell. Pretty much a copy of the graphic novel panel by panel. Come on spice it up a bit give us different angles, close-ups and MOVEMENT. Show us what animation can do even if it's on a tight budget. Show us the wonder and essence of the world. Make us feel the DESIRE Batgirl has to work with Batman, let us hear the thunder and rain crashing down on everything show us the details that move us emotionally. When we see the Joker from afar talking to the police about his wife, give us those strong visuals that tell the story on their own instead of him flatly saying his wife is dead. Show his loss and his madness. Don't deliver lines at dramatic points. Don't make Batman aware and comment on his meta-role as a foil to the Joker ? that's obvious and doesn't need to be in focus (even if in the original).Issue #3: Same story no insights. The Killing Joke is a very dark story and sometimes less is more. The Joker on his tirade fails to truly shock the audience. What he chose to do should've been the true horror of the story and presented as such so it sneaks up slowly on the audience. This could've been accomplished in so many creative ways. It was literally just given to the audience and rather quickly. In closing, it makes me think twice when an older 1993 movie like Batman: Mask of the Phantasm (highly underrated btw) outdoes The Killing Joke as a serious film with some substance to pack and scenes that tell a story on their own. I can't believe I'm saying this but the Joker was downright chilling in Phantasm and I watched that movie as an adult. It's not the inner fanboy leaking but a respect for the art. Watch Phantasm or Batman TAS if you're looking for a mature story that knows what it's doing. They may not have the newest animation or fan-service but it does have characters you'll care about and a story that will touch your soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, It is important to say that I'm not a geek, a huge HQ fan, or anything like that. So, if you want a review done by an expert, this is not the review for you. Otherwise, if you appreciate an honest review you can keep reading. Batman the killing joke is a great adaptation to the screens of a very successful HQ. The humanity that the plot line conveyed to the joker, mainly at the end of the movie, was surprising. This was the high point of the movie for me. His philosophy that states we should embrace the chaos through madness is well built and you can understand his answer to all the randomness around us. At the end of this movie, you will probably even feel bad for the guy. Perhaps, you might even been convinced that, as the joker says, "we really are just one bad day away from being him". Ps: English is not my first language, so don't mind the mistakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the mixed bag joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may seem like this is a high rating given the backlash DC animated The Killing Joke has received, however this is an averaged out rating. &nbsp;In honesty this isn't a very good movie, despite the fact that when the filmmakers and adapter Brian Azzarello (do I hasten to call him a 'screenwriter' after this one credit?) stick to the original Alan Moore source it's a dark and involving delight. It's what comes before it, how they make it into a "full movie" that things fall apart. &nbsp;This is a schizophrenic experience full of high highs, generic lows and some what the almighty Jesus bloody hell for good measure.And I get what they tried to do or felt they had to do as far as making it a complete experience as a 75 minute film. &nbsp;Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl, is more of a plot device in the comic (spoiler? Joker shoots and paralyzed her before kidnapping Commissioner for his amusement park nightmare games), so to flesh out her backstory with Batman is good. On paper. &nbsp;Actually, not on this paper, as it turns into a half hour story where Batgirl is chasing after a ho-Hum "charming" criminal who I don't even recall in the comics (if he was in it he's certainly not memorable) and it's all here to make it a Batgirl story with Batman mostly as the ornery father figure...Which makes that 'thing' that happens between them so jarring; if this was squarely a batman/batgirl story theoretically it could go somewhere )I'm not saying it's a good idea in most any context, again those like Robin or Batgirl are more like the kids to Batman not those he gets uh down n dirty with). &nbsp;But Azzarello crams it in where it doesn't fit and if anything makes the motivations for what comes in the actual Killing Joke story hamfisted. &nbsp;Not to mention how it's presented is silly especially given what room is open with an R rating (the first for any Batman film, ironically you could show this to most kids 12 and up and it'd be fine).Despite this troubling and/or just typical Batman/Batgirl story that squanders potential with really delving into backstory the comic hinted at, or because of it, when that second half of the film kicks in to gear and we get the story of the comic it'S presented largely faithfully and the genius and power of that story comes through; the Joker as a 'sympathetic' being with his own origin story which, by the end, is satisfying as its own story and is brilliant as a circumspect narrative from an unreliable storyteller.I may also be a sucker for Hamill as the Joker but how can one not be when he always sinks his teeth in and makes him a real PRESENCE in a room? &nbsp;Adding to this he creates a good, relatable voice for pre.transformation Joker in the flashbacks and we get drawn in to his story in large part because that voice acting comes through. &nbsp;The animation is also top notch (as far as the limited budget allows), and some moments in that fun-house/amusement park are shown to be iconic for a reason; if you get any allusions to the Burton 89 Batman there's a reason for that.I think my high rating is due to finding that main story so compelling - what a hero or villain means when they have to face existential questions and how they relate to one another through "one bad day" (interestingly though Moore recently says he doesn't like his own work here I find he underrated it, that he got under the skin of these iconic figures to show them as people). &nbsp;So I &nbsp;wanted it to be great, and it flirts with being as strong as the first part of the Dark Knight Returns movie or even Mask of the Phantasm. &nbsp;But that first half hour drags it into a murky, middle feeling where overall you come away saying 'it's alright, I guess,' with an ambiguous ending not landed with the weight that's required either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The complete first half hour was completely unnecessary, it may have intended to add emotional weight to when Barbara got shot, but the studio could have encapsulated that in a much better way. The main antagonist of the film failed to show up until half way through the movie which made the first half utterly boring. In addition, the needless sexualization of Batgirl and her 'special' relationship with Batman was also among the list of unnecessary items that were in this movie, this also contributed to ruining the characterization of Batman. The Joker was on point as one would usually expect. However, in summation the movie fails to capture the magic that the comic presented us with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only joke here is this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke. Where do I start? I own the comic, and I've read it countless times. I absolutely love it. This film gets the amazing Alan Moore comic, and takes a huge, steaming dump on it.I may as well start with the good parts of it. Mark Hamill, as always, brings his A-Game to this movie, as it is The Killing Joke. Mark Hamill has always been my favorite Joker, and as I saw the film in a cinema, there was a nice little featurette about him before the film began.Unfortunately, the film began after that. Let's start with the first 20 minutes. There's this storyline about Batgirl trying to prove herself to Batman or something, which involves some crazy dude who is in love with Batgirl. Absolutely none of that happened in the comics and even if you haven't read the comic, you could probably tell. Apparently every female-lead film nowadays has to have subtle feminist undertones, which is fine, I guess. But in this film, it's not too subtle. Plus, The Killing Joke isn't about Batgirl, it's about the relationship between Batman and The Joker. Barbara Gordon is simply a piece of the puzzle that is The Joker's plan to make Commissioner Gordon go mad. Batgirl isn't even in the comic.The relationship between Batman and Batgirl in the film is completely different from any comic I've read. Batman and Batgirl have a paternal relationship, not a sexual one. Yes, I said sexual. Batman and Batgirl have sex in this movie, and they play it off as if this has ever happened in the comics. How about we talk about the scene where Barbara Gordon is shot. You can tell a comic scene is terribly adapted when Birds of Prey does a better job at it.The actual comic part of the film doesn't start until about 20 minutes in, by that time I just want to get up and leave. And while it does follow the source material pretty accurately, so does Watchmen. They remove anything special about the comic and turn it into a boring, mindless, sub-par animated film. They didn't even try in the animation department, with some scenes looking like they came from a badly- made motion comic. Kevin Conroy returns as Batman, which should have made me happy, but there's something really wrong when Ben Affleck does a better job as Batman than Kevin-freaking-Conroy. It's easy to tell that he didn't really want to be in this movie, as he brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Great lines in the comic come out extremely lackluster.So, wrapping up, The Killing Joke gets an amazing comic book by the amazingly talented Alan Moore, and removes everything great about it to make a Batgirl-centered story that really shouldn't exist. This truly proves that Alan Moore's comics are unfilmable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of the Killing Joke is powerful, but this movie tells it very anti-climatic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anti-climatic is my general feeling about the whole movie. After watching the movie I get the idea of it all, but I don't feel like my emotions were driven the right way to emotionally understand it as I watched it.I get that the first part was added to sort of familiarize the audience with Batgirl and get them emotionally involved, so that later on it will be a shock when the Joker shoots her, paralyzes her and sexually assaults her. The emotion the audience feels is what the Joker intends to exploit on Barbara, Gordon and Batman. Tempting them to part ways with their values and sense of justice, and accept rage and madness. Despite that, at the end they find a way to stand strong and prove the Joker they will not be like him.That's all fine with me, I think it's a very powerful Batman tale, but this movie doesn't really make it feel this way. The delivery is not quite right. The movie is R rated, but it has the tone of a PG-13 cartoon with the sudden bursts of the dark R rated elements that leave you not really knowing how to feel about it until you process it for a while.I don't understand why the sex scene between Batman and Batgirl. I'm fine with it. I think it's great if they wanted if they wanted to play out some romance angle between them, but they didn't. After seeing the rest of the movie, there was never any purpose for it at all. I'm thinking they just had it for cheap thrills.I don't like that there is a Joker backstory. I like the way it is left a mystery in The Dark Knight. We all can already imagine all sorts crazy things that could cause such wild madness, and that is better than having it revealed. There really was no need. The nature of his plan is enough to show us things from his perspective, that was the whole point.As I already mentioned, the movie has an anti-climatic PG-13 feel to it, so it took me a little while to process what happened to Barbara, and get my emotions into how horrific it is, but at the end it all plays out as it was not that big of a deal with Batman, Godon, and Barbara. I get that the point of the story is to say "Don't let those horrible memories destroy the good in you, the joy, and turn you into a man like the Joker", but I didn't see the process about it in this movie. Like I said, they all played it like it was no big deal, instead of it being something that is hard to cope with, and yet you do, because you must. Batman tells the Joker "I don't want to kill you", and I'm thinking: How the fu'ck do you not want to kill him? Batman is all about living with the anger and feelings of revenge, but never actually jumping into the abyss. They said it the beginning of the movie.I understood what they were TRYING to get me to feel and understand from this story, but I don't think they delivered it well for that to happen when I watched it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Goddamn it. I really wanted The Killing Joke to be DC Animation's return to greatness.The parts that are actually The Killing Joke are great, but I just can't ignore the first 30 minutes. It felt like a random episode of a completely unrelated Batman TV show. I get that they wanted to make Batgirl more sympathetic and an actual character in the movie, rather than just a plot point, but honestly, who cares? Who gives a crap about Batgirl? She doesn't matter, she's irrelevant to the story. The Killing Joke is supposed to be about Batman's relationship with The Joker. Instead, it felt almost as If Barbara Gordon was the main character. If they didn't want to just do a direct adaptation of the novel because it'd be too short, I get it, but find another way to expand it. But still, like I said, as soon as the actual movie starts, it's great. Hamill and Conroy were obviously great. They stole the show, specially Hamill. I didn't like Commissioner Gordon's voice though, it sounded weird. Overall, good movie, but it should have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie is not perfect by any means, it adapts most of the short graphic novel into a decent animated movie. Performances are amazing as always with Mark Hamill blowing everyone away again. People are however furious with this scene that takes place between TDK and BG, which I don't really see an issue with. In the comics and on some traditional media I do feel some sort of tension between these two and even though it might be a little out in left field it doesn't ruin it at all. I personally really enjoyed the film as an avid comic book reader and fan of Batman. Everyone calm the f*** down, it's just a movie, and it's fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing The Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ogn material this adaptation was based on, was released on 1988, by Alan Moore &amp; Bryan Bolland. It was one of the most disturbing, nightmarish made in UK stories, that gave an even more psychish tone to Joker as a character and turned (unfortunately) eventually Batgirl into Oracle.The graphic novel is only 64 pages long, more like a special-sized story, thus DC decided to write more script, in order to be adapted into a full movie. And that is the breaking point.THE KILLING JOKE SHOULD BE A 30' SPECIAL, NOT THIS ABNORMAL SNOOZEFEST THAT LASTS OVER AN HOUR! They could adapt additionally another short Bat story and release the equivalent of "Hulk VS", in order to fill the disc time. Although we are years now in digital form and 60' is an ill- forgotten excuse for "minimum time limit".The first half of this raped adaptation is a generic adventure of Batgirl, in which...MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD...she is a young lady that feels useless and loves Batman. Thus, enter Batsex. These 30' theoretically supposed to make us love her character. Personally, it was horrendous and with a major luck of respect to her character. The worst Batgirl story ever. A young naive Batgirl that is useless and eventually bangs Batman as her mentor...Then, as of a sudden, Killing Joke strikes. The transition is awkward, bad and the tone is out of scale compared to the first half. OK, it is a good adaptation, but it is so uneven to the first half that you are already tired. Although, the frames sometimes have a pace problem.IN A NUTSHELL, it is a bad prolonged adaptation and you should skip the first 30' for your own mental sake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bin the first 30 minutes and you have a more fresh feeling,entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman goes on the hunt for The Joker who is kidnapping and torturing Commissioner Gordon and his family in a similar way to his own descent into madness.One thing that immediately stands out about this film is how much it seems to want to be like the graphic novel that it is adapted from. This is because the dialogue seems like it has literally been taken from the novel itself and copied word for word, this is accompanied by animation that looks like it's just a moving version of panels from the original comics/ Killing Joke graphic novel. It basically seems to be a direct literal adaptation of Alan Moore's famous, classic novel. This might majorly stand out at the start of this film adaptation because the first 30 minutes of the film seem to be a bit slow and just a long build up and introduction to the lives of Batman and Batgirl/ Barbara Gordon and so later plot details are further understood or emotional pain for certain characters is deepened because of this connection with the characters. In fact the connection with the characters in this film isn't really that strong and at times they just seem to be there ,even Batman has this feeling when he is present in some scenes, this can also be said for the character of the Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill) he might be one of the best things about the film but he doesn't seem very understandable in his actions and motives until later in the film when his backstory ,if it is even his real one due to the character previously making up many different backstories making him more mysterious and in some cases creepy, is revealed and we see what his life was previously like and what drew him into the state of madness that has made him one of the most famous and iconic on-screen and comic book villains ever. As this is done the character of The Joker gets better and better and more enjoyable and the same can be said for the rest of the film as more is revealed and as more events unravel/ occur the pace gets quicker and the film gets better and more entertaining pulling the audience in and providing a more detective style superhero film which at times feels fresh, new and different.If you ignore the first 30 minutes then Batman: The Killing Joke is a fresh animated superhero film that not only shows a new side to the character of The Joker but puts him centre stage as the star of the show. Overall it might have a dodgy script and seem like a literal direct lazy adaptation at times but it's an enjoyable film with some highly entertaining moments.*** &lt;-- Three Stars (Out of Five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much of the controversy around this movie surrounds the first half, so I am going to concentrate on that portion. People in the theatre I went to said they would have loved The Killing Joke, if not for the first half. I argue that the second half would not make any sense without the first. As perhaps one of the most famous hero and villain duos in all of fiction, it is easy to see Batman and the Joker as diametrically opposed in their approach to crime. I believe the first portion of the film serves to demonstrate some of these differences, especially Batman's tendency to control everyone/everything around him (as opposed to Joker's outright nihilism), and stands them on their heads. We start to see Batman as imperfect, and perhaps not so different from any Gotham resident.This imperfection serves to develop some of the sympathy we feel towards the Joker and his ultimate goal regarding his confrontation with Batman, regardless of his twisted techniques. Evidence of this comes with some of the Joker's quips, which come with a visceral laugh despite their macabre nature.The only area for potential complaint comes with the animation in certain scenes, though I'm not sure this was unintentional due to rushing for completion or due to intentionally demonstrating something quite "off" about the whole situation at hand.4 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good solid movie in which the prologue improves Barbara/Batgirls role as well as set the tone for the main event</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good , solid Batman movie.. People are definitely overreacting because of the Batgirl prologue. I personally believe it is is brilliant because in the comic, Barbara is done no justice and simply used as a plot twist. In the prologue they make Barbara/Batgirl an important character. She has role in the movie which makes the tragedy Joker commits later on even more impactful. I love how the prologue doesn't mess up the original comic. It was a good way to add time to the film. It's like if you get two batman movies in one !! Regarding Batman/Barbara's relationship, I think the twist they added was also brilliant. It shows that even though they are heroes, they are still human and can commit mistakes. It shows a realistic side. When they have sex, I believe it was good to include because it shows how our attitude can quickly go up and down; as well as, how we can act in the heat of the moment. It also shows the difference in experience between them when it comes to being crime fighters. Fanboys are simply overreacting and aren't looking at the big pictureI give it an 8, because the animation had its ups and downs. The art has its moments where it was spectacular to rock bottom. I do feel they could've introduced Joker a little earlier as well. I don't like how Paris had an obsession with batgirl either that was over the top. Overall it was a really good movie. It sticks to the comic, The Killing Joke, like we wanted</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a must-see for non-comic book readers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1988 Comic is a legend that is genuine to its intentions of letting the readers dive deep into the deranged mind of the Joker while avoiding the possibility of ruining the villains image and worst becoming a "Sell Out".The 2016 animated adaptation of "Batman: The Killing Joke" noticeably started out with the addition of a Batgirl prologue which was intended to cement her role in the story. Though this was not shown in the movie, it is worth remembering that Barbara Gordon always viewed her father Jim Gordon as somewhat a hero and after being inspired due to Batman's exploits she became a cape vigilante and sooner or later found herself apprenticing for the Batman himself. And when familiarity principle of attraction kicks in she eventually finds Batman not only as a real hero but a father figure. Apparently this animated movie have taken this relationship in another level. Confused and upset about how Batman was treating her, after a short scuffle she found herself on top of him literally. Now this is where it is disturbing because not only she was maimed and molested, this movie have stoop her further down with a spur of the moment casual sex scene of Batgirl and Batman. This unnecessary scene ruins her essence to attract female fans, not to mention its potential consequence to the interrelationship among the characters in the franchise. Batman was an inspiration to her not an infatuation and they have crossed that boundary for a prologue nobody really asked for. Although we must not dwell too much into this controversy because the grisliness is most definitely still present in this adaptation and it did not fail to deliver the substantial and excellent backstory of the most indispensable Sociopath that we know. It is a must-see for non-comic book readers. And finally I have to say that it is really hard not to snugger while watching Batman and Joker guffawing even though the "Killing Joke" isn't funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An okay Batman movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read the comic months before this movie came out, and expected it to be almost the same. Instead I got a sort of prologue to the whole Joker-arc, and it included some interesting parts to Batgirl. The whole story line regarding her made me think of Batman's partner, instead of seeing her becoming Oracle, as I never read any actual Batgirl comic yet. It was entertaining to see her becoming attracted to Batman, and the problems that come with it are developed well. She changed from being just another member of the Batfamily to a superhero with actual problems, especially the part about crossing the line. It really showed her as a human being struggle with the boundaries of fighting crime.Then the actual comic started, and I wasn't disappointed. It was an accurate adaption with only the animation lacking a bit, but the story was performed almost to perfection, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the comic.The movie was good, but lacked in a good soundtrack, or I did not really hear any standout song in there. All in all, good movie with some minor flaws, but fun if you're interested in Batman or the comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More added to Moore ... a good attempt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What will hit fans on the face right in the beginning is how the movie begins. Mark Hamill, during a promotion of the film, stated that Moore himself will probably not like the changes made in the film. It is probably true. It is quite possible that fans will feel similarly. While Moore's masterpiece sets the mood and tone of the graphic novel right in the beginning, one may wonder why at all begin the movie with a Batgirl pseudo-4th-wall-breaking monologue. The monologue proves that the filmmakers knew that there was a fair chance that fans will hate the inclusion of a Batgirl introduction. For a moment, during the first 20-30 minutes (which has absolutely nothing to do with the Joker) the audience might even think that probably Batman will have a heart-to-heart with Barbara about his encounter with the Joker in the Graphic Novel. Thank the good sense of the director, that did not happen. Why would that happen, right? It's not like they are having sex and want to spill their guts and feelings out.... wait a minute, something of that sort does....spoiler...When the Batgirl arc (sort of) is over, the real story begins all of a sudden. It will surely make the audience wonder what was the real connection? Anyhu, rest of the movie is pretty faithful to the Graphic Novel. However, the mood is already set on a different note and the movie is struggling to set the new mood. The flashbacks are very important, but in the movie it almost seems it is being rushed through. The moment Joe finds out about the tragic fate of his wife has been dealt with such disconnect, it is almost a forced attempt to be faithful. The whole mood of Batman and Joker understanding each other at some level - the "one bad day" - is lost when Barbara's injury becomes the connecting point between the unnecessary Batgirl introduction and the mid-credits introduction of Oracle. As an audience and a fan, I most missed the afterword and the art afterword of the Graphic Novel. Of course, they didn't need to do it exactly, but something of that kind would have made the movie great. In spite of all the negatives, it is a good watch. Definitely, do not miss it, but also do not expect the quality of The Flashpoint Paradox or The Dark Knight Returns brought to the fans by the DCAU.</fullReview>

Half the movie is narrated by Bat girl.Joker wants to prove a point and as always he fails. Its about madness. Which is not by choice.Epic rivalry between batman and joker, turns into a very mature understanding. But this is a point that they can not go back where they have started.The joker's past is a really sad. All and all its the one of the best DC movie. I am a Batman fan. Maybe i am biased.

		<shortDescription>Good for the Second Half, Not for the First</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a disclaimer, I haven't read the original graphic novel. What all I read, which I could've just bought the thing, is the beginning of it. I was, however, interested in seeing this movie, because I do find the DC animated movies pretty good. They may not be the greatest things ever, but they're worth a watch, especially when one of them is probably the only good Teen Titans related piece of media we'll see, unless if they decide to make Teen Titans Action out of the blue.With that said, I do have a huge problem with this movie, and it's mostly with the first thirty minutes. Even though I never read the original novel, which will be fixed sooner or later, I at least know that it has something to do with the Joker being in one of the most controversial book ever, I question if the first half wasn't in there just to make it movie length. The first thirty minutes of the movie is all about Batgirl and her taking down Paris Franz, who really tries to get into her pants (remember that part), and I got to admit, while it would've been better for it's own thing, it doesn't even tie in with the second half at all. You would think Paris would have something to do with the rest of the movie, but no, he's just a waste of script, and we already know that he's not that Joker simply by Barbara Gordon, a.k.a. Batgirl, saying that she was scared of him as a little girl from her father, good ole Jim Gordon, describing him to her, and also, while his real name is mostly unknown, I think the Arkham games has his name as Jack White. Seriously, why was this even put in the movie? They could've easily made a more in-depth backstory for the Joker, but instead, we get this random guy's journey to becoming the biggest crime boss, which will never be touched upon ever again in the second half, and there's a part of it where all I can say is "oh, hey feminists! Look, video games isn't the only piece of media objectifying women anymore." Speaking of the bad joke I just did, this is where the movie got the most backlash from, the sex scene. Most people hated this scene for making Batgirl a sex object and for messing with the relationship her and Batman had. For me, I already thought the first thirty minutes was worthless, and this happened within those first few minutes. I guess you could say that they put these first thirty minutes in there to give Barbara Gordon a reason to be in the movie, but why not have her in another movie instead of having her be Batgirl, quitting, getting paralyzed before being striped naked for a photo shoot, and then becoming Oracle? So yeah, with that rant over, I recommend skipping the first thirty minutes of the movie. It's pointless, trivial, never gets touched upon ever again, and doesn't mesh with the rest of the movie.The second half, however, is where you get the story from the graphic novel, and it's a pretty good story. It's mostly a Joker story, and I can't knock it for being so. Might even provide the critics, the ones who said Suicide Squad didn't have enough of him, get their fix. Since this movie is based on a very dark graphic novel, you can expect a pretty messed up Joker, who is excellently voiced by Mark Hamill who might as well be called the "definitive voice of the Joker since the Animated Series," and like I mention earlier with the spoilers, he does some messed up things. What I really like about the second half is that the movie takes a look at the Joker's past as a failing comedian whose simply trying to make a better life for his soon-to-be family, in which he resorts to doing a "job" with two other men and goes crazy after losing his wife and accidentally taking a chemical bath. As I said, if they really needed to lengthen the movie, they could've easily made a more in-depth backstory for the beginning instead of Batgirl since this is essentially a Joker movie anyway. Even the second half starts off with a murder scene where it looks like everybody was happy to be a part of, and the Batman doesn't have as much screen time as the Joker, at least until the end anyway. I will also say that the imagery can be quite unsettling at time with the harsh shadows. Heck, when Joker was about to shoot Barbara Gordon, all I can imagine was someone waking up with the Joker face two inches away from their eyeballs as the Joker says "I have killed your family, and now I will kill now." The art-style, as for usual for the DC animated movies, is pretty good, though I admit that this one does seem have lower frame counts on some scene, which is weird that I mentioned it, because I usually reserve that con for video games since it's more effective there. It's not a huge issue, it's not it's like a glaring flaw or anything, but it is something you tend to notice.I recommend giving this movie at least a rental. I believe the darker tale told in the second half is really good, but the movie is like Steam's Greenlight System. You have to shovel through junk just to get to the good part, and while the movie isn't as bad as the Steam Greenlight System, not by a long shot, the first thirty minutes will make you question why you're watching the movie in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good adaptation of the comic. Sure this may not seem like the actual backstory about the Joker, but it's interesting though. Mark Hamill is at his best as the Joker in this and Kevin Conroy as Batman. Now one thing that didn't happen in the comic was that Batman and Batgirl just had intercourse on top of a building. How messed up was that?! Also Mark Hamill's Joker just had a musical number in this movie as the Joker did in the comic. It was chilling and brilliant. I was also disturbed by the images of Barbara Gordon stripped naked and bleeding on the floor and it almost drove me mad. lol. Mark Hamill does great dialogue in this too and so does Batman. Also It was weird but amusing to see both Joker and Batman laughing at the end of this. Of course this happened in the comic as well and in the comic the police come, but do not come in this animated adaptation. Like the title of my review this is disturbing but an amazing animated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in all very entertaining,brings back memories form the 1992 series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke is one of the greatest comic book stories and one that I wanted to see adapted into a live action movie, but I'll settled for the next best thing. I was very happy with the original voice actor's return. I grew up watching the animated series and for me these guys are the definite portrayals of these characters. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong are awesome and didn't disappoint. This movie on the other hand is not one of the greatest Batman animated movies but still should rank higher than others. My biggest disappoint was the opening twenty five to thirty minutes. This was the part of the movie that was added in and not taken from the original graphic novel. While watching this portion I thought I was watching the wrong movie up until the Joker appeared. This whole opening sequence could have been done better. Batgirl is being tormented and obsessed over by a character. Somehow there needed to tie this story into the main story and show that Batgirl is caught off guard by the Joker because of what happen or that Joker somehow was pulling the strings. Once the main story starts it's great. A lot of the sequences are taken directly from the comics. In some cases line by line, this was fine by me. Now the comic itself was a short story so what there could have done was too elaborated more and maybe adds a sequence or two to meet the running time which to me should have been near ninety minutes. Batgirl and Batman sex sequence really wasn't necessary. It just alienated the fans. This story part should have been excluded all together. Also this movie achieved an R rating but too me I found the violence dialed down a lot from the graphic novel which took away from the impact of the entire movie. All in all very entertaining brings back memories of the best animated Batman series ever made that is the 1992 series. Without the opening Batgirl sequence this movie could have been an eight or a nine. With all the short comings I'm going with a strong seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah The Killing Joke. It is probably a better adaption of the source than the source itself.Chronicling the struggles of our heroes Batman, Batgirl and the tragic Joker. The first part of the story deals with the relationship issues Batman has with all his sidekicks but throw in a sexual father figure issue and you get the idea with Bats and Barbara.It heavily foreshadows the theme of the movie that you sometimes never always get what you want even when you got it no matter how perfect the opportunity is.This goes for Barbara, Commissioner Gorgon, Bats and Joker. All that matters is when faced with that inevitable fact that you will have to make your decision and power through.*Spoiler - Don't Read If You Haven't Watch It Yet*Batman does kill the Joker in the end of the show. In a moment of sanity, Joker tells Bats 'it's far too late for that" in which you can see Batman grimaced. Joker than tells a joke (which was funny IMO) and laughs. Batman feels pity for the Joker and laughs at the as he rest his hand on Joker's shoulder. The camera cuts down and you only still hear Bats laughing still as he succumbs temporary the whole insanity of relationship and situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Warning, the following review contains a SPOILER!" With the exception of Mark's incredible work on the Joker, this was a mediocre film. The animation was extremely rough and the artwork was average. For what is one of the most iconic Batman stories I found most of it a let down. A lot of people have freaked out over......*SPOILER!!* Babs and Bruce knocking boots, even going so far as to say it ruined Batgirl for them. Fans of Babs are going to blow this off as fluff filler and be done with it since that's all it was. Babs has been in so many shows, movies, books, and games that is impossible for her to be "ruined" by this event (read Simone's Batgirl from the New 52 if you don't believe me).If I were to recommend this movie I would tell people to read the comic first, the trade paperback is easy to find and a great read. Then watch the film and judge for yourself. I have been watching Batman cartoons since I was kid in the 70's and after all the years of fantastic shows like BTAS, this was comparatively a very average offering at best for a standalone Batman movie (at least for someone like me). In the end what it boils down to is "did this movie entertain you" and if it did then that's all that really matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been my favorite graphic novel since i was a kid. Been waiting over 20 years for this adaptation and except for the first 20 minutes it stays faithful to the source material. Those first 20 though... I feel were unnecessary. Did we need a batman/batgirl romance? No. Did we need to see Barbara the librarian and her flamboyant friend gossip? Definitely not. Thankfully after that it goes to the source and stays. This story is about batman desperately wanting to understand joker and rehabilitate him before they kill each other. Joker wants to prove all it takes is one really bad day and anyone could be driven as insane as he is. The ending comes with Joker caught by the book and sharing a laugh with the Bat proving that even the most bitter enemies are simply people doing what they best or giving back what the world has given them. Ultimately we all have that choice, the not crack when bad things happen or to just go mad</fullReview>

This is a much more adult story than Batman the Animated Series, but Hamill is at the top of his game, playing the Joker as this mixture of brilliance and madness. The animation is gorgeous.

		<shortDescription>A temperate review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was really hard to rate this. The bottom line is this however: I am not thrilled by the artwork, but I don't hate it, if you like DC animated movies you like this. In some cases it's great in some others not so much, in cases like here it's OK. The voice work is great as is the music, builds a chilling atmosphere, and does not bother, since in this case the story is more important. But let's go to the juicy stuff, shall we? I think I understand the purpose of the Batgirl backstory. Having Barbara shoot in the first 15 minutes of the movie would be weird for anyone who does not know what he is seeing. So they needed a story to give you some clues about who this person is and what is her connection with Batman, so to understand why it is important for him that she is shot. The backstory is something new entirely, whereas the "main" adaptation is almost panel to panel. And this is the reason why the backstory is weird, because since I have almost memorize this graphic novel, it feels extremely out of place, considering that everything else is, as I said, almost like a "motion comic". If it was a work "inspired by" the Killing Joke it would maybe feel less out of place, but not it's like that feeling when you read a lot of comics and you are not sure if something happened to this or the other comic. Like reading a Batgirl comic and The Killing Joke back to back.However, two important points: If I had not read pr had no idea about The Killing Joke I would probably not had a problem with the Batgirl back story. And even knowing about the graphic novel, everything else is really great! I mean still, the comic is way better, but in any case the "actual" Killing Joke is an amazing movie, not to mention an amazing twisted dark little story. So it feels wrong to put a lower rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30 minutes of disgraceful writing soils what could've been a decent adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>review contains spoilersWhen i heard this adaptation of The Killing Joke was to have an added prologue focusing on Barbara Gordon, i was excited, because the main issue with Alan Moore's The Killing Joke is that the character most affected by the story is hardly seen, and used merely as a plot point. Unfortunately, the 30 minute prologue added to the film is the worst writing for a character i have ever seen. Basically, it boils down to this: Batgirl and Batman have sex. If you don't know the character of Barbara Gordon very well, this might not bother you. If you do, this might destroy the character completely, as well as destroy the character of Batman. What was meant to be a parental relationship becomes an extremely creepy attempt to justify an R rating. The fact that Barbara has feelings for Bruce ruins her character because the point of her is that she genuinely wants to do good. Now she appears to just want to look good in front of Batman. Even when Batman is off screen, he is all she seems to talk about. The once noble, caring, complex and likable Barbara Gordon has now become a shallow, sexually driven teenager. And Batman becomes a dirty old man. His anger with the Joker is no longer about a father figure angry about what was done to the young girl he cares for, now it becomes a story about a guy getting revenge for his girlfriend being hurt. This is so much less interesting and, again, creepy, and betrays the story and the fans of both Batman and Batgirl. This movie is an abomination. While the rest of the film almost faithfully adapts the original story (however, the animation was surprisingly poor. i've seen better on Cartoon Network), it is still tarnished, as it is put in the context of the first terrible 30 minutes, which change the dynamic that made the story great in the first place. instead of adding to the story, it takes away, while feeling completely unnecessary. This is the worst thing Brian Azzarello and Bruce Timm have ever put out, and while it's bad, i would not call them sexists for the treatment of the character (although the character is very much a stereotypical girlfriend, and it would be fair to say that Azzarello can't write women). This isn't necessarily a case of sexism, just blatantly bad writing.</fullReview>

This movie was good other than the sex scene. The writers could have handled filling in time for the movie a different way. The writers could have had the history and ups/downs of being bat girl; then they could have carried out her being shot. The movie was no "Under the Red Hood", but the movie was better than a few recent batman movies. The Killing Joke was what many fans wanted to see on the big and small screen and now they have it. One of the best stories in DC comics can finally be seen in a new an unique was. In all I enjoyed The Killinf Joke and I do recommend that people watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Will Not Spoil anything that is not already Known about this expanded story.First of i wanted to weigh in on the Controversy behind Barbara Gordon/Batgirl's role in the film, as it is expanded with the opening to show a defining moment in her partnership with Bruce Wayne/Batman that started the path to her fate in the original Graphic Novel story that starts 30-Mins in... After an argument about her recklessness in facing a threat, Bruce and Barbara get very intimate (which a lot of people seem to put it across as the just dumped an animated sex-scene in the most important Batman/Joker story of all-time) which is handled very well as it is more to explain Barbara's frustration that Bruce doesn't seem to think she can take care of herself, is a very strong piece of storytelling, and adds a new dimension to the scene after she gets shot by the Joker and is rushed into hospital.In The Graphic Novel, Batman's there to get Information to help find Barbara's father, in the film Bruce is there because of that too but now he see's that someone else he cares for has had to pay the price for his actions.I personally love the additional stuff, I find it boring when someone says we will just throw the comic pages to an animator, and put that out as it seems there is no care and effort.Mark Hamill gives his best Joker performance ever, as we get to hear Hamill play him as Joe (Never named but i always thought of him as Joe), Kevin Conroy shines once again as the Dark Knight and Tara Strong (who I'm so used to hearing her voice Harley Quinn) in her Best performance of Barbara Gordon.BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE is very faithful to it's source material and is very well expanded. Don't let Critics and Idiots make your decision. See for Yourself and make your own mind up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So obviously when i first heard about this movie, i was really pumped, and kept up with updates as it came closer to the release.I've always loved the PG-13 animated Batman movies, and of course I hear about this one's R rating I'm wow this is going to more amazing than any ever before it.So the time finally comes and of course I go to the one night theater showing. Strong start, love it, some good action, funny moments. But then I notice that all the bad guys say "freaking" quite often. Was this a prelude to the rest of the movie? Yes. It was. The R rating was a total scam. There's some brief bloody shots, like 2 actual curse words (mild too), an IMPLIED sex scene, an even what was to be considered the most controversial part of the original comic...was completely censored as well. It was PG-13 by my standards. "The Dark Knight Returns" and "Assault on Arkham" were both PG-13 and had WAYYY more blood, violence and language than this did. (Assault on Arkham also had more sexual scenes and still remained PG-13). It was just really disappointing. The plot was really loose too. When the movie ended I was like..."wait what?" There was no climax. The rising action just quickly crashed into the falling action and ended. This just goes to show that not every comic looks good on the big screen.Really the only thing I liked was the fact that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill were in it.Would I recommend it? It's worth a watch, I guess. Just as long as you go into it thinking, "This is a PG-13 movie."If you want to watch something better as far as PG-13 Animated Batman goes, "The Dark Knight Returns" (not to be confused with "The Dark Knight Rises"), "Assault on Arkham", and "Under The Red Hood" are all three very amazing movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn, that was good!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this film, the only thing i could think of was: "Damn, that is good!! How they can never make a live action film good as this!?!?" I already read the homonyms comics, but the film was really entertaining anyway. He manages to capture the spirit of the characters, develop a great story and all this in less than 2 hours.Meanwhile, that Batman v Superman disaster has 3 hours!!! I can't understand, the thing is: I always watch this cartoon films, and they are always better than the live action films. Good job you guys!This is one of the best movies about Batman ever. Although, The Dark Knight Returns is also very good. Can wait for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely boring and uninspired aside from Hamill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hamill is the only good thing about it, plain and simple. 'The Killing Joke' is such a bland movie.All these adaptations have lacked passion. I love the source material of these DC Animated entries but none have impressed me so far. I was really looking forward to this one as I was hoping it would match the style of The Animated Series. It doesn't. The animation is so lifeless. The characters have almost no expression and the color palette is so barren and gray. The voice actors seem tired and bored with it and that includes Kevin Conroy unfortunately.It also isn't a very good adaptation of the source material. I seem to remember 'Killing Joke' being very short and their expansions don't add to anything we are interested in. They make Batgirl and Batman lovers and I'm sorry but it just makes what happens to her even more troubling. Her torture and mutilation at the hands of the Joker becomes even more impersonal and only a motivation for Batman. I would have added more to the Joker's backstory as that is really the best part of 'Killing Joke'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing is...THE FIRST 31 MINUTES ARE FILLER TO MAKE IT A FULL MOVIE! Come to think of it,...there's lots of filler! The sex, the quit, every moment at the library, etc., it's all filler! Although the movie is well done, and everything after the 31 minutes is all good and accurate to the source material. But for one thing, the two headed baby is now an adult girl(s) and there are no fused girls (Two girls in a big skirt, with three legs in total.) The "Killing Joke" portion of this is even accurate in the script department. The problem is that the first part adds nothing to the story AND messes with continuity; Batgirl never quit, she was still Batgirl when she got shot!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke is a animated movie adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name. The comic that provided the source material for this animated film is very popular and recognized for its underlying brilliance and innovation. I'll start off this review by saying that this movie does not do the graphic novel justice by any means. The movie starts off with a thirty minute prologue detailing the events (involving Batman and Batgirl) that take place before the main story. This half hour piece of garbage is most of what's wrong with the film. It involves Batman acting out of character to the point where he's not even Batman anymore, just a strange man underneath a familiar costume. Also included in this prologue is a forgettable subplot that fails to give the movie the extra substance it needed, and Batgirl complaining about her life. The rest of the movie is nothing special, don't get me wrong. It's pretty much an exact duplicate of the comic (I won't spoil anything, for those who haven't read it yet). If the film had just included the main story segment, I probably would have given it five stars. And I really wish I could. Because, even though I think The Killing Joke is a bit overrated in the world of comics, I still really enjoy it. It would have been fun to see the main story on the big screen, even if it is exactly the same as the comic book. It's not necessarily even a bad thing to take popular source material and give if a twist or add something new, but here, in this movie, it just plain doesn't work. The prologue is only there to give the movie some originality. That is what I can't accept. Adding more to a beloved story for no reason. The animator also has a weird affinity for Batgirl, showing her in a lot of revealing and sexual poses. It just feels really odd to watch an action sequence and then cut to Batgirl's ass while she's jogging in leggings. Maybe that's just me. I would not recommend this movie, or any of the animated Batman movies. If you're in the mood to watch the caped crusader, go watch The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Half good, half bad. Neither of which is easy to ignore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Batman: The Killing Joke in theaters, and I must say, while it was entertaining, I was surprisingly disappointed with the film. I didn't think that the pacing and overall structure of the story were good.The film itself was relatively short compared to most theatrical films (there were also no movie trailers), but accommodated this by adding a commentary featuring Mark Hamill (voice of the Joker) before the start of the film, and after the end credits, another commentary about the music score. They were fun to watch.(POTENTIAL SPOILERS)But more importantly, the film was extended from the original graphic novel by adding a subplot with Batman and Batgirl and their conflict against a criminal (not the Joker). This was a hit-or-miss attempt to make the movie longer and explore the relationship between Batman and Batgirl, and I think the results were a miss, because I find that it made the overall story less seamless and more indecisive.The subplot was the main story for the entire first half of the film. Batgirl was the central character, point-of-view character and narrator. The criminal she and Batman were fighting against added very little lasting importance and soon became irrelevant for the remainder of the film.Then came the second half of the film, and the story is finally about the Joker, who replaces Batgirl as the new central character, as the film now explores his life and point of view. The transition between first half and second half of the film was rather poor, like it suddenly became a different story from another movie with the same characters. The main antagonist of the first half is never mentioned again, and the expanded relationship between Batman and Batgirl also didn't add much emotional struggle to Batman's fight against the Joker either, especially since Batman remains highly stoic and unchanged from beginning to end.The first half of the movie was the biggest disappointment. It made the movie indecisive on who is the most important character, it felt like a story for a different Batman movie, and it did not have enough relevant material to carry over to the second half.The conflict between the heroes and the Joker should have been explored more, they should fight several more times throughout the movie, and whatever more additional scenes need to be relevant and build up to the climax of the movie. But the movie did not succeed in any of these in its attempts to be longer.I'm glad that I watched this movie. Mark Hamill's voice performance as the Joker was not only as great as ever, it was practically a new milestone in this movie. And Kevin Conroy is always welcomed back as the voice of Batman. However, unlike the Joker, I felt that the movie did not take full advantage of Conroy's talent by portraying a near-constantly stoic Batman who displayed almost no personal needs or ambitions except to keep his mind on the job and nothing else.This was a movie adaptation of the famous The Killing Joke graphic novel. They brought back the DC legendary voices of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy. And it was a straight-up R-rated film. Many of us thought and hoped that the filmmakers would not hold back on this adaptation and give fans something special. Unfortunately, almost everything new and unique that they tried were either in the wrong place, wrong time, wrong way, and wrong amounts. Sometimes movies are either great movies with problems, or they are bad movies with pretty redeeming qualities. I think this is a bad movie with problems worth stressing about, but with enough good things to make it worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bat-a-thon comes to a close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well folks, it's been fun, it really has. I've been hyped about this movie for I don't know how long, and over the past month I've gotten even more hyped up by watching three animated Batman shows, as well as every animated Batman movie. All of this was to culminate with me watching the animated adaptation of Alan Moore's "The Killing Joke", and now you'll get my 100% honest opinion. The movie's awesome, but I do understand why people don't like the first half hour. So the first half hour is essentially what happened before Bruce pulled up to Arkham Asylum in the book. Oh by the way, I know what happens in the book, I read it a week ago. So why did they have this 30 minute build-up? Well, I think I have the answer. How much was Barbara featured in the book itself? I'm pretty sure it was just three pages. She was really only in the book to get shot and give Batman a reason to pursue Joker to save her dad. Be honest, her role in the book was just that. So they added the build-up to give her character more depth. If you think about it, how long does it take to read the book? 30-40 minutes, maybe? So they had to come up with something to make it longer. Could they have handled it better, yes I'm sure they could, but they chose to give Barb more of a character. I don't see much wrong with that.OK what else is there? Oh yeah, Bruce and Barbara have sex, which I know wasn't in the book, but I think it was implied. Is it entirely necessary? Not really, but it does explain why Bruce is so protective of her, it's because he loves her. Let's face it, Bruce has never been the most straight-forward when it comes to explaining things. He's kept things from Dick, Barb, Jason, Drake, Damian, and so on, so it should come as no surprise when he doesn't just come out and say that he loves Barbara. If you still have a problem with it, it lasts a total of about 10 seconds and is never mentioned again 5 minutes after it happens. It's not that big a deal.Everything else, is perfect. The animation's awesome, the story is almost scene-for-scene taken from the book, Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy do wonderful jobs as usual, and it all adds up great. It's not as good as say "Year One" or "The Dark Knight Returns", but I thought those two stories were better than "The Killing Joke" before I even watched this. The first 30 minutes are admittedly rather slow, even though I know why they are. Everything else is awesome. If you avoid the bloodthirsty fanboys and internet trolls, and just want an adaptation that's done well, you can do a hell of a lot worse than this, believe me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Faithful Adaptation, Just A Shame The First 30 Minutes Are Questionably Delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke is my favorite Batman comic out of any of them. Needless to say, I was pretty darn excited that this was finally getting its own film after I saw the trailer, and after hearing some familiar voices I thought this was going to be the best Animated Batman film. Is it? Unfortunately no, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The biggest flaw with the film is the first 30 minutes of it. And for an hour and 15 minute film, that's 1/3 of the film and that is just looking bad on DC's part. But let's discuss on what's wrong with this part. The first part of the film focuses on Batgirl (Tara Strong) and Batman (Kevin Conroy) trying to hunt down a criminal named Paris Franz (Mauley Sterling) from multiple robberies. Paris develops a strange lust for Batgirl that slowly gets to her. Batman is of course worried for her safety and tries to take her off the case, Batgirl ain't too happy about that and tries to beat him up for it and...*sigh* here we go. The infamous part in this film is when Batman and Batgirl have intercourse. The reason this is so wrong is that not only this is horrendously executed, but didn't Batgirl look up to Batman as her spiritual father? In that case, it's like having intercourse with your dad! And that's just disgusting. This first part of the movie killed any sort of development of Barbara Gordon. Because that scene was just plain insulting to me and hurt this film. Barbara just became a cliché rather than an interesting character. When the actual Killing Joke story line happens, nothing is too different from the comic (musical number aside) but hey, I'm happy they didn't drastically change the story line. I must give praise to the voice acting, it really feels every voice actor tried to give their personal best for the role they're suited in. My personal performance is Mark Hamill as Joker. So overall, I think this film was certainly good, it's just that the first 30 minutes was painfully unnecessary and it should've just been removed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacked the impact the graphic novel had when I first read it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally thought this wasn't a terrible adaptation but it wasn't great as I wanted it to be. To put it simply, the graphic novel this animated movie is based on is better. The graphic novel is more engraving, dark, gritty and has more of a impact when it comes to how it ends. Mainly because the build up is more gut-wrenching and piercing to the heart when things start to get down. Which made me wondered why the animation wasn't as great as some of the previous animated Batman movies. When it comes to the animation it was good in certain parts and just bad in the others, despite it being a animated movie that hit the theaters for a short time. So yeah, for such a beloved graphic novel I was surprised why they didn't spend much more on polishing up the animation. They tried to add the Batgirl segment in the beginning to lengthen the running time to build more of a attachment and get the audiences to care a bit more. Which some viewers disliked because it wasn't even in the graphic novel. But it was loosely based on a Batgirl comic that came out before "The Killing Joke" to wrap up some of the Batgirl story-line. So I personally give them a pass on that one. Plus I personally thought that it didn't take away from the entire experience. I am not quite sure if it's because of the bland animation, but the film just didn't really drew men in as much. And the ending was less ambiguous than the graphic novel as well. For a rated R movie it lacked the dark, gritty and even more psychological aspects that is in the graphic novel "The Killing Joke". So in my opinion, this is a watchable animated Batman movie but not something I would rush to see again.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never earns the empathy it demands</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the other Batman movies, give it a watch. It's dark, depressing, and moody ? and (perhaps purposefully) unsatisfying. Conroy, Hamill and Tara Strong are great as always. The animations looked a little stiff sometimes, but usually as good as Under the Red Hood. Good direction and decent music. But the writing. Oh, man. It didn't really hit me until I had reached the ending (SPOILERS follow). Usually the "bad guy" tries to decrease the height of his crimes by pointing out similarities between himself and the "good guy." Instead Batman is the one saying that he and the Joker are very alike. Joker gets the tired line, "It's too late to help me," while sounding all too sane. He tells a joke, and they laugh like two old friends. Batman not wanting to give a "moral high ground" speech was strange. The fact that he laughed was stranger. Is Bruce beginning to go insane? The ending scenes would have been amazing in that case, but it's never established or built up. The one-night- stand with Barbara could even have played into that (I always thought they "did it" anyway, so I wasn't surprised by it). Would it have been THAT hard to play up a Batgirl v. Joker vendetta in the beginning, instead of using a throwaway gangster character as a vehicle for Batgirl angst? Average movie that never earns the empathy it demands. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell was this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not much into Batman, but I wanted to watch this because of all the hype of it being R-rated and because I liked the trailer. It is a bit longer than an hour and in it there are only defective people. The R-ratedness was not really something that I noticed, really. Maybe because I am from Europe. It just seemed a normal violent hero movie.I could go into the Joker origin story, I could understand the senpai fixation of Bat-Girl, I could even get Batman's uberdominant stance - I mean, it's his signature mark. What I couldn't get was the ending. It completely went as nuts as Joker himself and deconstructed the entire Batman universe.Now here come mild spoilers: Batman almost wants to get killed walking calmly into what is clearly a trap, only to finally catch the Joker and then... he talks to him. The reason for it is because he knows at one time or another he will kill Joker or viceversa. But that pretty much dissolves the reason Batman does anything he does. If he knows jails won't hold the Joker, why is he jailing him all the time?The entire film underlines the futility of every character's efforts and even life. Batman jails people only for them to always get away, Batgirl does things for the kicks and then she loses them, Joker doesn't understand why a sociopath like him is the joke of the story and the other - Batman - is a hero, the gangsters go through the motions only to be foiled at the end, almost expecting it, and Gordon fails in everything: as a father, as a cop and as an upholder of order. Bottom line: the joke at the end... it's not funny. I feel it was intentional and therefore my analysis holds ground: this is a story that outlines the pointlessness of the Batman universe and if you look into the story of the writer, it may very well be what he had meant all along. The Killing Joke was supposed to kill Batman, the comic book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent and almost perfect, but... (minor spoilers included...maybe)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, a disclaimer in that I have not read the graphic novel--yes, I know, shame on me--and so I'm not totally sure if the movie follows the events of the novel faithfully or not.The Killing Joke is really two separate stories, one told from the viewpoint of an of-age Barbara ("Batgirl") Gordon, and the other from the viewpoint of the Joker and details his origin story...maybe. It all leads up to a violent confrontation and a somewhat subdued and not totally satisfying ending.I won't go through the details, as they've already been dissected, but I will summarize the positive and negative aspects of the movie.Positive Excellent animation, color scheme; the saturation of the primary colors is fine, and the blackness of the night never looked better or more ominous. When we finally see the first emergence of the Joker, it's something revelatory and frightening, right out of a cartoon panel and that makes the movie even better.The voice acting is superb. Mark Hamill IS the voice of the joker. John DiMaggio was good in Under the Red Hood, but Hamill stands shoulders and grin above everyone else. Tara Strong as Batgirl was also fine and then there's Kevin Conroy who has no equal as Batman, although many have tried. In my opinion, there were no weaknesses in the voice cast at all.Action: fast and brutal, nasty when it had to be and with the Joker, over the top, as it should be.Minuses Here's where the hate might come. There were two story lines, Barbara's and the Joker's, and while both were good, to me, they never meshed into a cohesive whole. Just my opinion.Is the Joker's origin story the real one, or something he made up to fool others and perhaps himself into justifying his horrific deeds? We never know for sure, and that is, to me, a weakness...but it also does lend another layer to the aura of mystery surrounding him, so let's call it a minor minus. (It could also be called a minor plus, as the origin story has never really been included in an animated film, not to this degree, although it was done in the live-action version in 1989, so there it is).As for the intimate moments, we get Barbara as a teenager who's no longer the gawky sort as depicted in some animated takes on the Bat, but a mature young lady who needs to prove herself in every way to her mentor. And...she does. Her tryst with her mentor--under the eyes of a gargoyle, no less--while not shocking, comes across as shallow and needy, as opposed to something natural.Even worse, after the Joker is done with her--the famous 'picture' scene--and bashes the living daylights out of her father as well, poor Commish--the Bat shows little emotion when he finds out the extent of her injuries. Of course, he swears vengeance, but there's only ice-coldness. I don't blame Conroy for his interpretation of how Batman should have felt. I do blame the script for it.As for whether the Bat gives up his no-killing code at the end of the movie, does he really kill the Joker? A lot of people are waxing back and forth over this. I think he did, as the Joker knows he's gone too far over the edge into madness, and the Bat grimaces at the Joker's confession. He understands the meaning of those words. He's seen Barbara disabled, his friend Jim Gordon hurt...all that pain flows, and yet he laughs at the Joker's little gag (which I had to admit was amusing)and the camera moves away, the scene fading to black, so maybe...Altogether, it's a very good movie...but not totally successful. It is worth buying, though, IMO, and a worthy addition to a DC animation lover's collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"All it takes is one bad movie?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Moore's Joker may be preoccupied with "one bad day" being enough to tip the average person over the edge into homicidal madness, but for several readers, Batman: The Killing Joke amounted to 50 such "bad pages". One of the most iconic, revered/controversial Batman stories ever released, it's no surprise that the announcement of a feature-length adaptation of The Killing Joke as Mark Hamill's return from retirement from voicing the Joker was greeted with trepidation. My most telling experience watching the film? My inability to banish Liam Neeson's growls of "You never did learn to mind your surroundings" from Batman Begins, as the big screen Batman: The Killing Joke proves tone-deaf to most concerns regarding its subject matter and transmutation to the big screen, coasting by on only the husk of Moore's morality parable. There's enough of a power in Moore's chronicling of the Joker paying forward his descent into madness that a decent amount of his unforgettable darkness holds up here, even diluted. Certain sequences - largely the central set piece of the Joker's macabre, carnivalesque torture of Commissioner Gordon - hit their strides with horrific precision. Even an ill-advised musical interlude(!) plays as the right form of disturbing. Still, Moore's prose has a particular rhythm that cinema for the most part has struggled to translate, and screenwriter Brian Azzarello's crack at working in Moore's philosophical monologues naturalistically is a helpful reminder of how it's sometimes best if comic book dialogue stays on the page. It might have helped to have complimentary stylized artwork, as in the comic, but the film's animation is hugely underwhelming, shooting for the iconic, blocky '90s cartoon aesthetic, but lacking its atmospheric, chiaroscuro artistry. Things pep up slightly in the peppered fight interludes, helped immensely by ferociously crackling sound editing that makes bullets and punches pop with rare vibrancy. However, action is largely besides the point in The Killing Joke, and as such these are the most fleeting of diversions. It's largely in addressing the story's most controversial component - the 'fridging' of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl, in the Joker's crippling her to torment Commissioner Gordon and spur Batman to action - that Azzarello makes matters worse in adaptation. Plunking down an unrelated prologue involving Batgirl pursuing an obsessive, flirty mobster may be gratuitous and clumsy (more than one audience member at our screening jeered "where is the Joker already?!" 20 minutes in). Still, it's nice to have some time getting personal access to Barbara as protagonist (if only because Batman himself is far more interesting as an enigmatic peripheral character), and Tara Strong's hugely endearing voice work is the perfect fit for a compelling and nuanced lead. So, naturally, she's hampered hugely by Azzarello's oblivious insistence on reducing Batgirl's characterization to lovesick pining over Batman-err-her-"yoga-instructor" in a cataclysmically misguided and fairly icky warping of character, including a strong contender for the most cringey sex scene in any superhero film. Azzarello gives us more time with Batgirl to reduce the gratuity of her later mutilation, but his uncomfortably sexist leaning on her only accentuates her role as plot device. It's a toss-up as to whether this, or the film's dud of a flat, absurdist non-ending, is more uncomfortable to behold. It's fitting how transparent the entire creative team has been that the project was greenlit to lure Mark Hamill back to his (second) most defining role, as his Joker unleashed is the film's sole triumph. Saddling the Joker with a tragic backstory was always a dubious move - even the Joker himself admits, in-text, that he prefers his past to be "multiple choice," and its telling here still serves to undercut, rather than feed into, his malevolence and power, as his 'Red Hood' flashbacks are too underwhelming to lend much poignancy. Thankfully, Hamill's Joker is as fresh as ever. Vibrantly expressive, garishly funny, and utterly unhinged, Hamill's at the top of his game here, and his unpredictable affectations make him endlessly compelling, painting nuance even when the hand-holding script does. Kevin Conroy's Batman, by contrast, sounds more nasal than usual here, and he sidles into Moore's pseudo- philosophical tirades uneasily. And if you thought Hamill's Joker laugh was creepy, just wait until you hear Conroy's Batman cackle away. Nightmarish is the understatement of the century. Batman: The Killing Joke is not wholeheartedly a write-off, but such clumsy, rushed, and ideologically dubious treatment befits neither the strength of the story itself, or the talented performers who fight admirably to bring it to life. R-rated and source of good combat sequences or not, it's one of the more sluggish animated Batman works, and memorable primarily for its faults, apart from Hamill's stellar work. It's official: "one bad day" may not have quite become "50 bad pages," but few will argue that The Killing Joke's epitaph is now "76 (mostly) bad minutes."-6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In spite of much outrage The Killing Joke is easily one of the greatest animated comic adaptations ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The graphic novel: The Killing Joke is a very short read, and with would need extra content to fill in the 72 minute time slot. How they did this is what sparked the rage of the comic community. The addition consisted of an intro setting up the relationship between Batman and Barbara Gordon(Batgirl). When I say relationship I mean it, and this is where the fans are angry. In short at one point it is heavily implied that Batman and Batgirl 'got together'. Despite fans complaints I'm not of the belief that this took away from the overall experience, and if anything added a sense of tension that the source material lacked. It also allowed for a better introduction the the characters of Batman and Batgirl and shows just how the story affects them.The meat and potatoes of the story comes in the by telling the Jokers backstory in a series of shorts intertwined with a tale of him breaking out of Arkham asylum. He disables Batgirl and attempts to drive Commissioner Gordon to insanity. It's a very dark tale, but also an engaging one.The vocal performances are top-notch. We get what is often regarded as the best Batman vocal cast. Consisting of; Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, Tara Strong as Batgirl, and Ray Wise as Commissioner Gordon. The biggest stand out is easily Mark Hamill, Who's been voicing the Joker for over 20 years, and this is his stand-out performance. Every line makes you feel for the character and truly see his insanity.In spite of much outrage The Killing Joke is easily one of the greatest animated comic adaptations ever. I recommend it to any fan of Batman, or just anyone curious about the film. Not quite a must-see, but, If you're in the mood for something incredibly dark, consider giving this one a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great adaptation, but it has a few flaws. Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The voice cast all did great as usual.The added scenes of Batgirl/Barbara Gordon was a nice little mini movie in it's own. She had very little time in the graphic novel so it was I found necessary screen time to spend time with the character before what happens to her later on. It doesn't improve the story but that was never going to happen since the graphic novel is already perfect, it's more for adding minutes to the runtime and character development.The animation was the big negative for me. It looked cheap and there was no reason it couldn't look better. Though it is fine as it is and I can see how Bolland's artwork would be really hard to animate. The first 30 mins had the best animation because they didn't have to rely on source material.The music was surprisingly better than I expected.I don't understand some people's complaints about things that were straight out of the graphic novel. No one complained about them being in the actual story, but seeing it on the screen all of the sudden some people now have a problem with it. This story isn't completely canon and should be taken as a semi-elseworlds story.After the trailer I was expecting too give it a 6-7/10, but it was better than I expected and I will be watching it several more times. Ranking it with other DC animated films it probably ranks between #5-10 all time with Mask of the Phantasm and Under the Red Hood being at the top.I give it an 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the hate for DC anymore..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like with Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice everyone goes insane because Barbara and Bruce have sex and OK we get it it's weird but should i remind to everyone that she was pregnant in the comics and the child was Batman's and Dick Grayson beat the hell out of Bruce Wayne that happened in the comics in Batman Beyond when Bruce was looking at previous girlfriends Barbara was in there which means that they were more than friends also another thing is Batman killed a midget 1 or 2 maybe yeah he did it even here. Many people said that this comic is misogynist maybe it is maybe it isn't but like i said i don't get the hate for DC should i remind to everyone that super weird Age of Ultron couple called Hulk and Natasha? yeah that actually happened just one freaking year ago. Batman: The Killing Joke is way better than Batman Bad Blood and Teen Titans v.s Justice League which they put Batman as a freaking sidekick and he was extremely weak. I found the Batgirl story interesting for the most part and honestly i didn't go insane for the sex scene sure it was kinda weird but i've seen worse for instance for decades or at least the last few animated movies we saw Superman and Wonder Woman kissing and being in a relationship and that is still weird cause i'm sure many people would like to see Diana and Bruce i know i would. The film also has some cool easter eggs from Batman 1989, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight even the death scene of Jason Todd. The flashbacks of Joker was kinda interesting but they should spend more time with that a bit and also this whole scene with Barbara's photos and James Gordon was freaking creepy i haven't read the comic i have seen photos from the comic book but overall it was a good movie sure it has problems that i understand and although i didn't have a problem with the Batgirl and Batman thing what really bugged me is that he showed no freaking emotion on the news of what happened to her he should go insane or in a rampage i mean common stay by the book but also do something that will make us feel something as a freaking audience. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 + Part 2, Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker, Batman Under The Red Hood i found those stories way more interesting but that doesn't mean that this one sucked it just wasn't as great or epic as those movies were so far the film has a 46% on Rotten Tomatoes which is the first time that Kevin Conroy gets a rotten Batman film and a 62% on the audience which i'm sure it will go way more down. Also the ending kinda felt very quick and i wanted to see more but unfortunately it ended disappointing and that laugh from Conroy it's even more creepy than the Joker's in the end The Killing Joke isn't a bad movie it's still a great piece for the Animated DC Universe but unfortunately for anyone else that wanted to see another Under the Red Hood epicness they will be very very disappointed. I give it a 9 out of 10 and an A cause i liked what i saw at least Batman didn't have Nipples or Barbara was Alfred's niece think about it this has actually happened 19 years ago and it was awful!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity to expand and deepen on the Joker's personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all this is NOT a bad movie at all instead it just feels bland and flat at sometimes, having Batman emotionless the entire movie and the lack of combat action also did not help at all.this movie is supposed to be about the Joker and how/why he became the villain that we know but instead there comes the BatGirl's backstory which is completely out of place and totally unnecessary (I can see why they went to it but this isn't how it works) especially with some awkward scenes here and there that altered the original comic in a bad way.they should have used that first 30 minutes of the movie to expand on the Joker's personal life and use it as a character in-depth building to the Joker to let the people get to know him more instead of showing short duration flashbacks of his life.The ending was so anti-climatic it should been done in way that makes more sense for people who haven't read the comic and in fact if you have read the comic then there's not so much going on for you to see in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Should've call it: Batman &amp; Freaks !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the weakest animated film of batman and here are the reasons: First and the most silly thing is the sex scene between batman and batgirl, i know someone might say they wanted to do a new thing but the place that they did in it (For GOD SAKE) in the roof of a building where everybody can watch them! and what about the coffee! Second the story is complected first there is a prologue from batgirl which was a really nice thing but then we go back to the Joker(i mean can't the producers think of something new just for once) and what about the flashback of how the joker became the joker it was OK but we already knew that from comics! Third: at the last part the film turned to be batman &amp; freaks (taking the same idea from 1932 movie and at the same place at circus!) Finally when Gordon became shocked at circus scene, it wasn't a clear at all, because his eyes were opened as he was dead! and when someone's body is in a shock no one became as the way the had show to us! The only thing that was likable was the ending scene it was really something new, gay and at the same time funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DC Animated's Killing Joke Absolutely Not For Fans of Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: This review contains spoilers about the story, especially for those who haven't read the source material.)DC Animated productions, mostly headed up by the fantastic Bruce Timm, have had a series of hits, with great animated films such as Batman: Under The Red Hood, Batman: Year One, Flashpoint, Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths, and more. Even some of their generally lesser efforts are entertaining and still enjoyable.Timm also worked on the great Justice League animated series, Batman: Beyond, and of course the original Batman: The Animated Series, which helped pave the way for all of DC's animated productions. It goes without saying that Bruce Timm knows the Batman character and what drives him, and what Batman stories need to be told, so that's why this recent adaptation of Alan Moore's classic 80's graphic novel: The Killing Joke, is such a disappointment. If you haven't read the Killing Joke, do yourself a favor, and go ahead and do that now, if you're in any way a fan of the Batman character. It's not the most comfortable read, but gives insight to how dark the world of Batman is meant to be.The Killing Joke features a great misunderstanding of the themes of the story, and a lackluster and dull set of production values to go along with that thematic miss. The animation is the first thing that turned me off to this piece. Unlike the fluid fight scenes and lush colors of The Dark Knight Returns, or the sharp, defined shapes of Under the Red Hood, The Killing Joke has awful character designs and flat, bland colors, with vehicles rendered in a 3D that looks like bad Playstation 1 graphics. None of the fight scenes, which are often a crowning achievement for DC animated, have any intensity or true kinetic action to them. Whenever the characters are still, you can truly see the lack of detail in the designs, which makes the characters look very plain.As far as the story, the movie takes the worst possible turn you could by adding a whole 30 minutes of story and background centered around Batgirl that is plodding, dull, and feels like a totally different story and style than when they arrive at the Alan Moore material over halfway into the movie. They use direct dialouge from the Alan Moore material, some of which felt awkward and strange-sounding spoken aloud, especially contrasting with the much different sounding dialouge of the first act of the movie. One of the spoilers I'll mention here is this clunky first act ending in Batgirl having a totally out of place sex scene with Batman. I gave up hope on enjoying this animated film at that moment, since I knew they had totally departed from the comic book's vision of the story, already muddling the story with irrelevant events, and then making it worse by confusing the relationship of two of the characters.Batman and Batgirl have a parental relationship, like between him and Robin, where he mentors, trains, and sometimes keeps her in check, as Batman is an uncompromising character who always does things his way. This scene served no purpose in the story, and makes it seem as if he's going after the Joker because Barbara is his lover, not because of the tragic events that happen. On top of all of this, I didn't feel that the original novel's ambiguous ending translated to an animated format. They didn't build the tension of anything that happened in the movie, it all just kind of came and went. Even the fantastic voices of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill don't really have the same usual enthusiasm here. They still have a great sound for the characters, but the intense feeling you get from hearing those portrayals at their best, in past material, just wasn't here. I have to say that especially Kevin Conroy felt like he was phoning it in, which pains me to say as he is the definitive Batman voice in my opinion. The rest of the voice cast is forgettable, with some especially stilted lines from the actor playing Gordon, who's supposed to go through some very serious, harrowing events here. It's a shame that Bryan Cranston wasn't available again for the role.Overall, the poor animation, terrible and blundering writing, and the mediocre voices contribute to a very dull and flat telling of what should be a dark, disturbing, and uncompromising Batman story. What we're left with in return is a product that makes me think this story really should be left in the comics.Batman: The Killing Joke gets a 4 out of 10, only for the continued commitment of Conroy and Hamill. Let's hope that this isn't their final work together in these parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good animation, great voice acting as always from Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, awesome to hear an origin story I have never came across before for the Joker and I'd imagine discovering Oracles origin story would have been an interesting find if I hadn't just discovered it in the Batman Arkham Knight game this past month. Overall, a great film, animation was a little scarce, wasn't always much too look at and it's a little slow getting into the more entertaining parts, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am eager to check out other Batman animations.9/10, highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let the haters hate. Bland fanboys who want everything the same as the comic. Well, I loved this. It's a fine adaptation of the best Batman story ever put in comics. It's also the most accurate adaptation, some scenes are scene by scene of the brilliant comic. Some hate the prologue, but the comic itself isn't long enough to be a movie. Aging this particular Batgirl story, with Proto joker villain, pushing her to the edge, works, as does the Post film coda. Conroy and Hamill are simply brilliant together. They are so familiar with one another, playing their roles to perfection. The rest of the cast is, as usual with DC, well done. The backgrounds, especially the carnival looks like it fell right out of the comic onto a cell. No other company can touch DC animation. None. A fine addition to the cinematic Batman library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killed it! It was a great adaption to a great graphic novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's weird and disturbing like the best stories involving Batman &amp; the Joker going at each other.The Killing Joke is a classic graphic novel (It's like a classic novel (I don't read so I can't suggest a novel) that you are excited they are going to adapt into a movie, and that's the Killing Joke).Anything coming out of DC Universe Animated Original Movies is so great and so adult and way better than anything that the DC Cinematic Universe seems to be doing.I was so stoked that the movie was going to be released in theaters and it shocked me when I saw the movie was going to be Rated R. It was an interesting R, more about the dark adult content than sex, violence and language.In the Killing Joke, Batman's relationship with his partner, Bat Girl gets too personal for the both of them to focus on their commitment to crime fighting, so they decide to part ways before anyone gets hurt, which Ironically, despite no longer being in the mask, Bat Girl gets hurt anyway when the Joker escapes from jail and plans another outing for the Dark Knight.A subplot of the movie tells an origin of the Joker as a comedian who falls in with the wrong crowd and meets Batman in the process, which creates an accident that would create the cape crusader's worst nightmare.Keeping with the fad of Nostalgia, Kevin Conroy who for many is the voice they hear when they think of Batman, reprized his role once again as the Dark Knight. It's a bit of an unfair comparison, but I think many 90s kids would agree that Kevin Conroy is the best Batman ever (poor Christian Bale)And reprising his role as the Joker is the great Mark Hamhill. What I always loved about Hamhill's Joker (other than he laugh obviously) Is these basic one-lined jokes that they give him to say that makes you giggle just before he does something totally messed up. They really take it up a notch in this film as those jokes lead up to joker doing some really messed up things. But the joker is not the only villain in the movie. Francesco Franz is a robber trying to rip off his uncle whose a big gangster in Gotham, and he's also obsessed with Bat Girl and this obsession is just Dark. So awesome to watch.Glad I got to see this on the big screen it's a note worthy film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What more do you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this film yet, skip to the second paragraph. Whiners and complainers, the first is for you.1. Something that frustrates me is that most people who complain about films like this are never satisfied with anything. The Hobbit movies barely followed the book: people got mad. DC makes a nearly scene by scene exact reenactment of The Killing Joke: people are furious. What more do you want? The simple facts are the original novel was not long enough for a feature length, those who don't know Batgirl need some background, animation has never been flawless for any Batman film, and finally...it's just a movie. If ya don't like it, don't watch it.2. If you don't know how to find the graphic novel, this is a great way to see the story. it is almost exact to the comic and is well done. Sadly this is Mark Hamill's last performance as the Joker which makes for a great farewell to a legend. Watch through before showing to kids (very graphic). All in all, i find this to be the best and most true to comic Batman film/game/TV-show i've seen (and i've seen 17 so far).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of The Killing Joke, I think of one of the darkest, most-twisted Batman comics to ever be printed. I think of the Batman comic that is the final confrontation between Batman and the Joker. The end-all be-all that is second only to The Dark Knight Returns on the list of greatest Batman/Joker stories. I think of Batman possibly killing the Joker, and hating himself for it. I think of a very personal story for Batman, as well as his arch-foe. Batman: The Killing Joke was none of those things.I had such high hopes for this movie when it was announced with an R rating, when Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill signed on, when I saw that it was coming to theaters for not one but two night, but even so it did not deliver the way it should have and I can tell you exactly why.Political correctness.PC is what destroyed this film for being as good as it could have been and I'll tell you why. Because the 30 minute prologue about Batgirl and her life is not something that ANYBODY but hardcore Batgirl fans care about seeing when they buy a movie called BATMAN: The KILLING JOKE. They expect lots of Batman and lots of Joker, but instead they get lots of Batgirl and lots of Paris Franz while wondering when the movie is actually going to start. This prologue was added to the film so that when Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) is later shot and paralyzed by the Joker in the film, like in the comic, we can feel for her, understand her side of the story, and not promote violence against women.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating violence against women, or anyone for that matter, but the PC train has gone off the tracks when they decide to mess with something like The Killing Joke by adding a whole Batgirl story that has nothing at all to do with the plot just for the sake of showing that "yeah, women can kick butt too!" before paralyzing the only female character in the film. I understand the intentions, but it's dumb and wrong. If Commissioner Gordon was the one who was paralyzed and Barbara was abducted by Joker, a 30 minute prologue about Gordon's days fighting criminals in Gotham would NOT be added, so why do we need one for Batgirl? I would say the same thing if you replaced Batgirl with ANY Batman character, it's just dumb! But that's political correctness for you (they even go so far as to include an obligatory stereotypical gay friend for Barbara).Also, I love Bruce Timm and when it comes to Batman and DC Comics as a whole I love his work, but I cannot stand his obsession with the Batman/Batgirl romance, it's gross and I don't like it. It's also used in this film to give Barbara "power through her sexuality" when she tells Batman that "it's just sex" and that it "means nothing". I seriously wonder how anyone thought the Batgirl prologue was a good idea.The actual Killing Joke story starts about 30/40 minutes into the film, and that itself is left relatively untouched, which is good. In fact, The Killing Joke is done extremely well and I love the talents of Conroy and Hamill in the film. The Joker song was actually really dumb though, funny, but dumb.Overall, Batman: The Killing Joke was as a whole a massive let-down, but if you just watch the Killing Joke portions of the film it's easily a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: The Killing Joke - Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this was a flat joke.Batman: The Killing Joke is one of the best graphic novel ever written by Alan Moore. It's dark, haunting and really engaging. It took two iconic characters Batman/Joker and dissects the relationship between the two and how both of them tick. It's such an interesting storyline that was pulled off so magnificently. I'm not a comic book reader myself but I do consider the graphic novel to as brilliant. Word quickly spread that a movie adaption was on it's way and I sure was excited for it. Bruce Timm and Sam Liu were directing. Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy Tara Strong and Ray Wise are set to star. It's based on the most beloved graphic novel ever. What's not to get excited.And then I saw the movie and I wasn't impressed. This was very disappointing since it had so much going for it, but somehow fell so short. Barbara Gordon 30 minute prologue was by far the weakest part of the film. I know the creators wanted to add some character to her since didn't have that much in the comic. If so, It could have been so much better, because it added nothing to the movie and it did drag it down. I don't care about Barbara Gordon, I'm here to watch "The Killing Joke". At one point I was wondering when the actual film was going to start and it eventually dose. It would have been cool if we saw how the Joker broke out of Arkham, having extra scenes of Joker torturing Jim Gordon, or creating the death of Joker's wife that the book never showed, maybe even add a few more investigation scenes and conversations with Alfred. That would have easily covered the extra 30 minutes that was added. Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill both are once again brilliant as the characters. Their voices are so iconic to the character's that nobody could top the brilliance of Hamill &amp; Conroy. It's no surprise that both are the best parts of the movie. The animation doesn't look that good and I can't be the only one that thinks that. How much better would it have been if the animation was visually striking and more effort was put into it. There are parts in this where I thought the animation was pretty damn good and also parts when the animation was pretty bad. Now lets talk about the most controversial scene in the movie that involves Batman and Batgirl having sex. Yes, that actually happens in this movie and it dose nothing with the main plot. The sex between them had no real emotion to it and it's only thrown in there to get Batman angry when Barbara gets shot. The Batman and Batgirl sex scene was like a creepy fan fiction that some die-hard fan would write or draw to satisfy their fantasy.Overall rating: Batman: The Killing Joke is basically a giant middle finger to the fans who loved Alan Moore's novel. I never really felt engaged in the story and the emotional impact that was in the graphic novel is nowhere here. It was rushed, dull and very flat. Fans and Alan Moore deserve better.I expected so much more from this and I think everyone did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly recommend - superb adaptation of the comic with some extra character development added</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is not going to be spoiler free even if you've read the comic front to back so much you've worn a copy out and had to buy a new one. While there won't be many spoilers for you, there will be some. That's not to say this movie isn't for the fans of the comic. I don't think you can truly appreciate it unless you are, in fact, an avid fan. If you've kept up with the news of the movie, then you probably were already aware that the film-makers added extra material in the beginning to help the audience relate with Barbara (though some of us didn't require that, I'm sure it helped others). I won't give too much away about this part except to say that there were some questionable actions which might seem unnecessary to the overall story. I will defer to each viewer's interpretation to decide how they feel about this scene once the movie is released on DVD (and you WILL know what scene I'm referring to). There is also a setup alluding to Barbara developing PTSD later on ? again, it's hard to say whether this was necessary or not. It's difficult to view any of what I'll refer to as "the Barbara part" without feeling a tinge of urgency to get onto the grittier parts of the story you know are coming. I'll give "the Barbara part" its dues though; it pulled me right back into the old feeling of the animated show in a way that I had missed without realizing I was missing it. Now for the fun stuff ? onto the show! Here it is, the beginning of the REAL Killing Joke. Batman walking somberly into Arkham Asylum to meet with who the audience knows isn't actually the Joker. At this point, it was as if the comic leapt off the pages and came to life. Every scene breathing new life into this old story, but not in a way that made you feel like it was shaking the dust off its bones. Every movement was carefully planned, every word precisely recited ? and then the most horrifying part of all. The Joker was perfect. Not perfect in the nostalgic way that you're happy they got your favorite caped crusader just so in the new action movie. Oh no, perfect in the way that I'm laughing at Joker making light of shooting Barbara and oh god, why am I laughing? BUT I CAN'T STOP BECAUSE THE JOKER IS PERFECT. Perfectly horrifying. And we don't stop there, boys and girls. We still have the musical number. Joker gleefully sings and dances the same song that's in the comic while the beaten and stripped down Gordon rides along, chained to the Funhouse car, all while pictures of his injured and undressed daughter fill every last inch of the ride. The song is deliciously malicious, just like it's supposed to be. You want to yell "Stop, stop!", but part of you also wants to hear one more lyric, one more musical note of madness elicited from Joker's deranged vocal cords. We also can't forget that you want more because sprinkled throughout this tour de folie is Joker's origin story. His "one bad day" motif explained in a series of flashbacks that force you to relate to this thing you don't even want to admit is human any longer. I'm sure you're all waiting for me to mention Batman. Of course I will, because it is a Batman story, but really this is Barbara and the Joker's story. Batman is there because he has to be (both in the comic and in the movie) and while that sounds like a complaint, it most certainly isn't. One of the most powerful scenes in the comic and the film comes at the end when Joker is driven to throwing furious blows at Batman over the anger he feels that he hasn't succeeded in driving anyone mad. Why was he the only one driven mad by his one bad day? Why is everyone else able to hold onto sanity? But no, that can't be a glimmer of humanity we see in Joker, can it? Without Batman's intervention, Joker would never be driven to such acts as to let his mask fall like that. And that is the most terrifying thing of all; we can relate to the Joker because some of what he says makes sense, even if you'd never let that admission escape your lips. Just one bad day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a Batman fan since I was little. When I was 4 I would watch the old 60's Batman movie all the time with my parents. I watched reruns of Batman: The Animated Series and watched The Batman every Saturday. I grew into darker stuff and a few months ago I stumbled into a little comic called "The Killing Joke." I noticed it was by Alan Moore who wrote my all time favorite graphic novel Watchmen, so I gave it a try. And I loved it. Not to far down the road I noticed trailers popping up for a film adaptation of this novel. I was so hyped. Then I found out about the one night premier on the 25th and saw it then. And boy oh boy, it delivered the goods. This film reunites the legendary rivalry of Kevin Conroy's Batman and Mark Hamill's Joker. They both nail there parts. What really took me off guard was the opening 15-20 minutes of the film. When it was announced that the beginning was going to have extra footage not in the comic, I was nervous. However, it played out really well into the story. I've never really payed that much attention to her, but after her narration, it took me off guard how much I was into the story. She kind of reminded me of a female Jason Todd, reckless and doesn't seem to obey orders. Oh, and on a side note her and Bruce have sex. That was a bit awkward but it did add to the plot.Anyways, getting into the graphic novel part. Once the film picks up where it's source material begins, it gets really good. It follows the novel line for line and page for page almost. The flashbacks were done extremely well and the character designs were exactly like in the book, the backgrounds and everything. Yes the movie keeps every little disturbing detail and image from the book and adds to it. Mark Hamill really nailed his role as Joker in this. Even his musical number was on point. Now when we go to reread the graphic novel, we've got music to go along with the song! The end when Gordon tells Batman that, he has to get Joker by the book gave me chills and goosebumps, just like when I read the graphic novel. The very end scene were Batman reaches out to Joker and Joker has his most humane moment abd tells the final Joke before the movie ends almost got me in tears because of how powerful I thought it was. Overall, by far the best DC movie this year and in my opinion, the second best animated Batman movie of all time. A job well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Timm, Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and Mark Hammil return for this animated adaption of the classic story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I loved this movie. Let me also say that I knew that some people would have problems with the bat girl prolong, mainly because I think it was surprising how long it was. However I didn't mine it. I enjoyed the story they did. You can tell the Bruce Timm influence because the bat girl prolong felt a lot like an episode of the old animated series. I found the "mini-adventures of bat girl" prolong enjoyable. I like when bat girl and batman had sex because it humanizes them. Just because their superheroes doesn't mean they don't have lust or urges. I like the inexperience of bat girl being a major plot point. I also enjoyed the villain who is a narcissist that became infatuated with bat girl. I thought the prolong was a good appetizer to the main course. Then we got into the killing joke. It was very faithful to the classic graphic novel and different when it needed to be. I wondered how the great Mark Hammil would make his voice work with this grim take of the joker and he was great. I can't say who's the best joker is because Nicholson and Ledger were both great but I love how Hammil brings this whimsical side to the joker while being completely maniacal. My favorite part is when the joker shoots Barbra in the waist and cracks a bunch of jokes about Barbra being paralyzed while his goons beat up Jim Gordan. I also thought the flashbacks to joker's past was great and Hammil was great in his pre-joker voice. Kevin Conroy is also great as batman. I like how batman is portrayed here. He's a no non-senses vigilante with a code of honor. I love the final battle between batman and joker at the end. I like how the joker always wants to turn people into him, physically(by putting a grin on their face) or mentally(driving them insane). I really enjoyed this film and the animation was great, especially the look of Gotham City but the highlight was Mark Hammils great and possibly final voice work as the joker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a good movie but not great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a entertaining Batman animated film, having been and probably the only animate Batman film with an R rating from the MPAA and also the last time Mark Hamill will voice the Joker, so I was excited to see this nonetheless specially when I saw the previews for it.Also, I can't compare it to the original graphic novel because I have not read that, but this film is very dark and is not lighthearted, this was not the same as the Television series containing blood, and profanity (in the TV series when someone is punched in the face a white flash is shown so it is not directly shown, in this film however it is shown fully), the story is very interesting and holds your attention, but there is some things i didn't like.. what I didn't like about the film is how after Barbara Gordan is shot by the Joker she is barely seen afterward...also I did not like the ending where it just shows Batman and the Joker laughing...But the story was well done and was animated well with lots of fluid animation. The voice acting was really well done especially for Mark Hamill who can still do the Joker voice after all these years (he even has the ability to sing in the Joker voice lol which shows she is really talented.This was a good movie overall but it was not great. I give Batman: The Killing Joke a 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We've been spoiled with Batman of late. Affleck was great in BvS, Lego Batman looks about as outrageously entertaining as a Bats film can get, and the Arkham series along with the DC Animated Universe has consistently put out great material. Unfortunately, The Killing Joke is a messy unsatisfying waste of great source material.I haven't read the graphic novel, but like every Batman fan, I know the story of The Killing Joke. With that said, this adaptation does an unfortunate injustice to the story. It blatantly deflects the attention off of Batman and Joker, and into a Batgirl tale. Knowing there needed to be material added for proper length, I was glad to hear they added more Batgirl backstory. It's not like the prologue is awful, but in retrospect, it really dampens the impact of later events in the film, instead of strengthening them.Which leads me to my biggest complaint with The Killing Joke, all of the supposedly most impactful moments, don't feel earned. I never felt like relationship between Batman and Joker got to the point it needed to pull off the thought provoking themes and character exploration that the novel seems to suggest. The novel's writer, Alan Moore, has stated that it's about two characters that don't really relate to the world but are nearly mirror images of each other, because of one bad day. That idea is fascinating, and it's touched upon, but I would have liked to have seen more of that psyche.Of course, there are plenty of positives to The Killing Joke as well. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy have and will always be the quintessential versions of Joker and Batman, and they absolutely kill it once again. The only thing better than a Hamill-Joker long monologue is a great one-liner by Conroy's Batman completely shutting him up. And that never fails to happen here, they are endlessly entertaining together. It's really the material added and changed when it comes to the Batgirl character that ticked me off a bit. The fact that a strong female superhero, and an intelligent one may I add, is suppressed to being someone only fighting crime to get into Batman's pants is quite uncomfortable. There were plenty more ways to expand upon Batgirl's role here, but that wasn't one of them.The Killing Joke hits high when it hits, but it's few and far between, which is extremely disappointing given the fascinating source material.+Hamill and Conroy+Brutal and uncompromising at times-Added Batgirl material-And why is Batgirl pining for Batman's pants?-Big moments aren't necessarily earned5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman the Killing Joke is an great movie with amazing voices,the script is great(it's just like the comic book)the added scenes were great,the animation was good,the Batgirl prologue was almost good(it was more bad than good)because of the sex scene between Batman and Batgirl(that scene was stupid).When Bruce Timm said that in the comic Barbara was more of a plot and that in this movie he wanted to Batgirl to be more characterized,I was thinking that he will do the 28 minutes only with Barbara(which wasn't happened),not with Batman or if he done it with Batman than I think it was more OK if the prologue have said how Barbara became Batgirl but this thing hasn't happened.Anyway,overall the movie was really great(it probably is one of the greatest DC animations) and I totally recommend to see it on theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a movie really made for the true Batman/Joker fans of the world. This movie did a great job in taking us back to the Batman of the Phantom Menace and not this newer Batman that is just some dark anime fighter wannabe. This movie really animates the comic"The Killing Joke" almost word for word right out the comic on screen, even down to the corny song. Even with the older traditional DC ending that isn't some "happily ever after" BS but just another case closed in the ever dark city of Gothom. I believe this movie to be a marvel and a treasure of the DC universe, even if some people of the newer age Batman could find him boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the right ingredients but it tastes terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at the theater for a special screening and it was miserable. I never read the graphic novel but have heard a lot about it and loved the old animated series so I was excited. I heard the added some content to extend it to feature length, and it was immediately apparent that what they added was an incredibly dopey, poorly written, bland, and on top of all that offensively sexist intro plot introducing Barbara (aka Batgirl) that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie other than making us care about her character.The actual Killing Joke section had a couple good scenes (like Joker busting in on Barbara and Gordon) awash in a sea of cheap animation and really bad editing. The most cinematic parts were rushed and lifeless such as the Joker's "climactic" fall. They didn't build the tension or even show his reflection when he saw himself for the first time.The ending was probably the most awkward thing I have ever seen. Both scenes where Batman is like "must we fight?" are cringe-worthy. You can write this, George, but you can't say it. It ends with an awkward hug between them I guess and another example of hilariously bad pacing and editing.The whole thing just felt rushed and poorly directed. Mark Hamil's performance is awesome, of course, but he can't save this garbage or even elevate it to watchable. After seeing some of the frames of the graphic novel all I can say is what a waste of a great opportunity. With that source material and getting the band back together, this is about the worst possible movie that could be expected.</fullReview>

The plot was just okay,Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy make sure they don't turn you down with their voices but what really got me into it was the last 10 minutes or so,they were absolutely incredible to say the least,however the first 1h or so was just dragging.Honestly the movie,according to me,would have been a lot better if the length was shorter.

		<shortDescription>Good... but not as good as I had hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you read this review it should be noted that as of the time I am writing this review I have not read the graphic novel on which The Killing Joke is based.Going into this movie I was hoping for one of the best Batman films I've ever seen, and while Batman: The Killing Joke was very good, it was also somewhat underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed myself thoroughly throughout the movie and there wasn't anything in particular that I truly disliked, but I was still left wanting more.That said, there were still many elements of this film that I greatly enjoyed. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, returning as the Joker and Batman respectively, gave truly outstanding performances, as to be expected from the two of them. This provided a bittersweet sendoff for Mark Hamill's Joker, as he has said this will be his last time voicing the character.Speaking of characters, the Joker has been my all time favorite villain for a long time now, and this film does nothing but strengthen that opinion. I will not go into detail in order to avoid spoilers but this film proves to me that there is no greater hero/villain relationship out there than between Batman and the Joker. Batgirl is also given much needed development as she is a very underused character in all forms of Batman media. Even Commissioner Gordon is also given at least a few moments of characterization. However if I had one gripe with any of the characters, it is with Batman being somewhat underutilized as a character until the final act. Now I know that a character like Batman doesn't need much development as he has had so much already in other media, but this movie doesn't feel like a Batman movie as much as it does a movie which just so happens to have Batman in it. In fact, if anything this is a Joker and Batgirl movie, which is fine, as long as the title of the movie doesn't have Batman's name in it, which it does. Honestly this is just my own biased opinion and I'm sure not many people will sympathize with it as there is no real problem with Batman other than this one little detail that I happened to notice.On an animation level the film is just slightly better than most DC Animation films. But the art is another story. This film does a great job of portraying emotion in it's characters, particularly fear. I can't go any further into that without delving into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that.Something that I most greatly appreciated about the film was it's ending. I dare not spoil it, but let's just say it left me with goosebumps.In short, Batman: The Killing Joke is a very good film and worth watching, but not with your kids, this film earned it's R rating, not so much as Deadpool, but it certainly went beyond PG-13. So lower your expectations, rent or buy this film, and enjoy.The End</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this is not the best Batman movie there is. Neither is this the best Joker movie. But it is a good movie. I don't understand the First Act of the movie, it is weird and there had nothing except a little bit of character development that was not really required. Other than that I don't have, pretty much, any problem with this movie. I love the Joker in this movie and the story they created for him. I like the character arcs and I like the Batman.But what I find absolutely incredible about this movie is its ending, trust me you will not be able to predict its ending no matter how many predictions you have. And I loved that about this movie. if you like Batman and if you like comic book movies you definitely should watch it. I mean, I enjoyed it and I think you will. So yes, give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will begin by saying the New 52 Dc animated universe is a total crap bag,except Gods&amp;Monsters which was not included in that universe but it is pretty recent so people might think it is. This comes from the same brilliant people who gave life to the best era of Dc animation and created the original and best DCAU.Mark Hamill returns to his iconic role as the crowned prince of crime and Tara Strong returns to deliver a strong part as Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle,and last but certainly no least Kevin Conroy returned as Batman/Bruce Wayne.First I will talk about the animated style since some people complained about it:it is modern,amazing and some scenes were literally taken out of the comic book and animated but without taking that effect away such as:The Joker going to the Gordon's apartment or him coming out of the factory and realising what he became and starting to laugh maniacally.The characters were represented great and it still gave The Joker the chance to say he prefers multiple origins for he is a man of mystery so all we saw was just a version of how it was,because no one can know the truth,not even The Joker himself because he denies reality and all logic for the sake of fun.This was his greatest scheme ever so far and he wanted to make Batman cross the line but did he fail?Did he succeed?It is open for interpretation.I felt for him,for the first time in my life when he proved some sanity saying it was too late for him to be friends with Batman.Batman had a darker tone,more serious and determined than ever and it was really terrifying seeing him laughing at the end.Barbara, as Bruce said, was just a child and until their sex scene she felt it all as a game and a chance to be with her lover,her idol,her teacher.The commissioner proved himself to be a strong man who kept his sanity in all of that carnival of madness.I feel the Batgirl backstory of almost 25 minutes was necessary and it was well chosen to portray her relationship with Batman and show that even if she was out there for three years she was not as ready as she initially thought.Overall it was a masterpiece to witness and I hope this movie will open a new Animated Movie Universe fo Dc for more quality stuff,lead by Bruce Timm,of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another animated superhero flick, in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series (and the first one ever to be Rated R). This one is adapted from the 1988 graphic novel (of the same name), by Brian Bolland and Alan Moore. It tells the story of an escaped Joker, who attacks and tortures the Gordon family; in order to prove a twisted point about his troubled past. It was directed by Sam Liu (a veteran DC animated movie, and TV series, director) and it was written by Brian Azzarello (who also wrote a segment of the 1998 DC animated feature 'BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHT'). The film stars the voice talents of Kevin Conroy, as Batman, and Mark Hamill, as the Joker (both reprising their roles from 'BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES'). It also costars Tara Strong, Ray Wise and Maury Sterling. The movie received mixed reviews from critics, and fans alike; and it performed modestly well at the Box Office (during a very brief theatrical run). I really enjoyed it. The film begins with a 30-minute prologue (that was not in the graphic novel) detailing Batman (Conroy) and Batgirl's (Strong) troubled relationship, as they pursue a criminal named Paris Franz (Maury Sterling). The movie then gets to the heart of it's story, when the Joker (Hamill) escapes from Arkham Asylum. The superviallain then attacks Commissioner Gordon (Wise), and his daughter Barbara (aka Batgirl), at their home. He begins a diabolical plan, to prove that everyone can be driven just as mad as him. The whole time we see flashbacks of the Joker's origins (detailing how he became an insane master criminal). The movie has been negatively criticized for it's added prologue scenes; which also include a (heavily criticized) sex scene, between Batman and Batgirl. None of that bothered me though (I actually liked it); but I'm not a regular comic book reader (and I've never read more than a few Batman comics). I am a fan of the Batman movies though (especially the last four, and Tim Burton's original two), and the animated series (which I did watch regularly as a kid). I really enjoyed this new feature; I like the action, the look of it all, and the story. I also love Hamill and Conroy, in the lead roles, and I really like all of their character development (as well as Batgirl's). I also like that they chose to go the R rated route; it's an exceptionally well made film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phenomenal stories!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman The Killing Joke walks in with that same old stunning Joker lore with a bit of Barbara's emotional turmoil hooked to it. Halfway through the movie, you can't stop yourself from appreciating what you are served ? extraordinary psychopathic Paris Franz story with Barbara's constant battle with herself to confess her love for Batsy. But then the later half gradually degrades, without a strong cemented backbone to uplift the story. No doubt The Joker was magnificent as ever, but the story falls down in respect to Joker's evilness as it reaches climax."It's like he's fallen off the face of the Earth." STORIES IN BATMAN THE KILLING JOKE (SPOILERS INCLUDED) There is an ambiguous disconnect between two main story-lines, that seem to work in different parts of Batman The Killing Joke. We have an exciting, ballsy, different and emotional tale to the Batman-Batgirl relationship that continue with Joker shenanigans that try to rampage past human sanity.THE FIRST PLOT BATA starts off with a diegesis of sorts, Batgirl narrating her story beautifully. Animation keeping up with her as she scales down the city explaining rare accounts from her head. This side of the vantage is well thought of and well written. It engulfs you almost instantly.A smug introduction to a titular Paris Franz character compels you to ponder upon those rare shades of psychopaths that the city of Gotham houses. He pulls off the villainy fairly well until he is battered down by the decimating Batgirl fury, which was actually nothing but a vent from her relationship trauma.Batman's portrayal will bring all those memories back from the past. The way he puts it:"You haven't been taken to the edge yet. The abyss, the place where you don't care anymore. Where all hope dies." Barbara's constant reasoning with herself to win a dead man's love will have you feel sorry for her. Her emotions are so real that it beats the inanimate off the CGI. Her incessant scrimmaging with herself to prove herself, to prove her love for Batman, is as gorgeous as she looks in Batman The Killing Joke. The beauty of it all as they make love right underneath a Gargoyle silently watching on a rooftop, is so poetic that you can't help getting mesmerized by its sheer description. Brilliantly pulled off! As she describes it:"It was fantastic, like fireworks." The aftermath ? the avoidance, brims her up with thousand questions. There is poetry everywhere. When she sits amongst pigeons like a delicate bird she is, for hours thinking about him. It is an enchanting frame.Unfortunately she ends up getting devoured by the ugly side of insanity. She makes one of the most difficult choices of her life. Leaving Batman, one true person she wanted to be with, as she decides to get out."I saw that abyss you spoke about, very scary, but so tempting. I don't know how you resist it. I don't think it's humanly possible." THE SECOND PLOT Batman the Killing Joke moves on to a different enclave altogether after leaving the Batman-Batgirl story right there. Enters the main event after which the moniker finds its meaning. Joker is absolutely stunning with that wicked gleam in his eyes, and the delivery Mark Hamill brings home is simply majestic.You see this rare side of Batsy who tries to reconcile with Joker too, trying to squeeze in a reason for him to hold on to."How can two people hate so much without knowing each other?" Joker's madness is drenched in stark psychosis. He does a loony song too to pull Gordon towards the ugly clutches of insanity. His take on memories, his past and craziness is so brilliantly written that is hard not to applaud him for his ingenious comportment.As if those stories weren't enough, there is another backdrop side-plot that oscillates occasionally to and fro, taking you to the Joker's past every now and then. If only they were shown at junctures worth revisiting, it would have been perfect.The final bits are left for viewer's interpretation. It is actually a nice way of leaving the story like that. You can't help but wonder if Batman might have killed Joker in the end or if he might have taken him to the Arkham Asylum yet again, overlooking his horrific deeds to prove he doesn't win.THINGS THAT DON'T WORK OUT Given the colossal theme of the movie, we expected something much more exhilarating eventually. Climactic bits wizen down gradually during the final bits, as Batman hunts down Joker to a Carnival. Gordon fails to succumb to the insanity Joker had planned for him. Given the monstrosity of Joker's villainy the tale ends quite stale, leaving us with a weird sense of disconnect, as it fails to merge with the leftovers.THE FINAL VERDICT Batman The Killing Joke is different, yes, no doubt. Screenplay absolutely brilliant! Story wise, I am afraid I liked the Barbara story more. Music is just as gorgeous, forever complementing every single frame. The movie also pays homage to a lot of previously depicted materials that will at once throw you into pits of nostalgia.Whilst Batman The Killing Joke might not be the best of Batman Joker movies, it certainly stands in the vanguard as one of those rare movies to serve us a breathtaking glimpse into their enmity-inevitability. Also, it poses a daunting question out at the end. What did Batman really do? Read all my reviews here: http://straightfromamovie.com/</fullReview>

He isn't the usual psychopath we have seen. True that he isn't funny and crazy. But to me the movie plot was more powerful than these things.

		<fullReview>To be honest, I had no interest in checking out any of the DC animated feature length Batman movies. None whatsoever. After seeing Batman: The Killing Joke's graphic novel adapted into an animated feature I thought I would check it out. It is worth watching but it was not spectacular nor amazing. This is definitely not for children.The movie starts off with exploring Batman/Bruce Wayne and Batgirl/Barbara Gordon and their working relationship, focusing more on Batgirl wanting to prove herself to Batman that she is an equal and more than capable. After the Joker escapes from Arkham Asylum, he shoots and paralyses Barbara and captures Commissioner Jim Gordon. Commissioner Gordon is kept prisoner in a disused amusement park where the Joker subjects him to psychological torture, proving how tragedy can transform a person to descend down the path of insanity, as the Joker once did. It's up to Batman to save Commissioner Gordon and stop the Joker.I know the graphic novel was met with critical acclaim although I've never read it. It certainly didn't look like an easy task bringing the graphic novel to life on screen. Seeing the novel transformed into a feature length animated feature, I thought I would watch it and give it a go. It's worth checking out, but it's not something I'd watch again.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From a fan of the comic, this is not the movie I've been waiting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited when i first heard they were making a adult animated movie of 'The Killing Joke'. But just like most people have said, this story has a whole first half that doesn't exist or fit in the comic. The whole Batgirl first half of the movie drags with very boring narratives from Batgirl. Seems they tacked that on to try to make the viewer more interested and care more about Batgirl's story and extend it so it could be a full movie. The second half of the movie isn't that bad. It depicts what a fan of the comic would expect this movie to be. So if you don't mind sitting through roughly 30+ minutes of boring Batgirl story than you may enjoy the remaining run-time with a true animated take on the classic 'Killing Joke' comic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best from DC Animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be up-front about one thing: I don't read comics, instead enjoying these characters through movies and TV. So, I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel upon which this is based. However, I do know that this adaptation added a half-hour prologue centered on Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. I didn't really have a problem with this addition, per se, but I feel like her portrayal was occasionally sexist and certainly clichéd. Ultimately, I feel like the film would have been fine without this prologue because Barbara Gordon wasn't the point of the story anyway, merely being the precipitant for the main plot of Batman's conflict with the Joker. As for that portion, I thought that it was among the darkest and best work that DC has done with their characters (thematically, at least). I still think that BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES is the high watermark for DC Animation, but the way THE KILLING JOKE explores Batman and Joker's complex relationship made for a thrilling, occasionally frightening, story. The gist of Joker's argument is that all it takes is "one bad day" for someone to be driven to madness as he was. Peppered through the second half are flashbacks to his life before becoming the Joker which did a lot to humanize him. Quality-wise, the animation was OK. Dialogue scenes were fluid enough, but the action scenes had some really obvious computer augmentation. As for voice-over work, Mark Hamill was the best he's ever been, while, unfortunately, Kevin Conroy was kind of spotty. As for the rating, aside from some bloody headshots, I don't know why they went for an R. Yes, it was disturbing in parts, but I feel like the rating was sensationalism for its own sake. THE KILLING JOKE is one of DC's most famous stories, and it receives a mostly proper adaptation here. However, a misguided prologue keeps it from being as good as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Because he CAN!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read the original graphic novel you know it's about Joker's possible origin story (he's an unreliable narrator at best) and his attempt to prove anybody can go crazy from "one bad day". I always thought Joker's sexual assault of Barbara Gordon was unnecessary and gratuitous but this treatment goes WAY too far! While not showing the act beyond unbuttoning her blouse, Joker makes a lot of very tasteless puns about having DISABLED Babara. There's no way he could guess the extent of her injuries at that point so it's just the writer being mean spirited. And "gratuitous" is the word here, as you may know, the original book wasn't an action story, almost all of the fighting here has been added for excitement and to stretch the movie to feature length. That's okay, but, SPOILER: after Bat Girl saves Batman, after the heat of battle, they...they kiss. I know, but it doesn't stop there with the cliché pull away, "sorry!" No, me little droogies, they kiss some more and Batman grabs Bat Girl's "Bat-Butt" and they DO IT! This is such a foul it disqualifies the whole thing for me! What if Batman kissed ROBIN? ANY of the Robins! Yuck, you guys, just because it's rated R doesn't mean "go for it"! I was pleased to see or hear Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil reprising their roles as I consider both to be the ultimate voice in those characters and apart from some computer- generated merry go round stuff, the animation is quite good. But the Batman/Bat Girl relationship gets tawdry and repulsive, he's a Father Figure and a Mentor and the bottom line is: Call them a "side-kick" or a "partner", you don't DO IT with them! And shame on you Brian and Bruce, you shouldn't do it just because you can!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brian Azzarello adds clichés and plot holes to an otherwise great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The creators of this film decided there wasn't enough story in the comic "The Killing Joke" and decided to add a Batgirl prologue. They got Brian Azzarello to write the screenplay and build on her character some more. The problem: He's not a great writer. The original story by Alan Moore that was depicted in this movie was dark, gripping, and disturbing. The additional scenes concocted by the movie makers, however, has a completely different look and feel. It plays out like a tiresome soap opera. Check it out. A street thug named Paris Franz becomes obsessed with Batgirl. He makes a video, inviting her to show up to a certain location and challenge him. Batman gets the video from the cops and shows it to her, and then says "you're not going." They proceed to get into an argument we've heard Batman have with every sidekick ever. She's determined to do this herself. Why did he show her the video if he didn't want her to go? Batman is supposed to be smart! This is the lazy writing style of Azzarello. The whole Batgirl prologue is chock full of absolutely cringe-worthy scenes. There's not enough macaroni for all the cheese in this movie. If you can get past the first half of this movie, the second half is a pretty good adaptation of the graphic novel. However, I would recommend skipping the whole thing and just reading the comic. It has better art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good try on DC part, but hampered by bad writing and lack of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a huge fan of Bruce Timm. After all he did Batman: The animated series, Superman: The animated series and he is coming of his very strong work in Justice League Gods and Monsters, but here he ends up faltering to Brian Azzarello;s poor sloppy writing and his overall direction in the film. While I see what Bruce Timm was trying to portray the overall execution was just really poor. The film has these really poorly done added scenes which do nothing but hamper Barbara's character and make her seem more incompetent. And while the prologue did d add some extra level of tragedy to a already messed up story it also hurt who Barbara Gordon was a person. To put it simply I feel like the choices Barbara made just were off. This isn't the comic book Batgirl but rather some silly overly preppy Barbara Gordon who has sex with Batman even though the Barbara Gordon in the comics is a lot more hesitant to sexual relationships. But what really made this film hurt for me is that the added prologue added nothing to the actual comic book story of the Killing Joke, and instead hurt it a lot more than it should have. Lines have been cut from the comic and all the scenes with the Joker feel to rushed, and heck even the Joker's actual backstory feels so secondary and it is all because of this very bad prologue that damaged the rest of the film. Overall I gotta say I am little underwhelmed by all of it. I mean nothing seemed as powerful as I thought it would be. Honestly while I enjoyed what I saw I couldn't help, but feel the pacing was going a bit to fast at points. I don't know, but this film didn't feel like something I would watch a million times like I would if this was a lot more true to the comic book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know today how everything slightly egregious is accompanied by euphemism, we can't seem to tackle reality on its own terms. So we have to invent new words, phrases and contrive concepts in effort to conceal the remorselessness of the real world and keep the temperate bubble of blissful isolation comfortable. Well that principle is not confined to language, it's intrinsic to a particular attitude; that attitude being paternalism. Paternalism is the notion that the enlightened have a duty to defer the grimier aspects of reality from being realised into a broader consciousness.Historically, paternalism is almost universally prevalent when pertaining to the treatment of children. It's probably necessary in the context of immature minds but it has an unfortunate consequence, because it conceals reality, it destroys personal volition, making those who're subject to paternalism, dependant. Narrative and narrative convention is key to the realisation of paternalism, the very concept of narrative resolution is intrinsically paternalistic. Which is why, when you're presented with an event relayed trough the media, you'll find it presented as a narrative, they'll even call a news item a story, if that wasn't enough of a clue for you.So--comics are for children and it's no surprise they should reflect a paternalistic attitude, except in the 1980's a few people were writing comics for adults; or rather writing in a style that didn't support dependency and promoted free thought, Batman the Killing Joke is one such example. In truth this period of creative liberalisation, is not an event that should be considered in isolation but the product of the cumulative efforts of those pushing the bounds of industry censorship during the previous decades.Progress may be a linear concept but it not one without dimension and unfortunately, for those seeking less fettered entertainment, much of the progress towards liberalised narrative has been undone in the decades subsequent to the publication of Killing Joke. Much of this regression has been accomplished under the yoke of ascendant ideology. The problem with ideology is that not all ideology is of equal merit and an ideology that promotes the notion of virtue through adherence to doctrine, is not one that promotes creative freedom. It is such ideology that has impacted upon the reception of the Killing Joke, at least within bounds of media opinion, if not amongst the broader public.I can only make a guess at the motive at DC/Warner for making the animated version of Batman the Killing Joke but it is such an appalling piece of work, taken in the light of the source material, that I can only assume it to be to mar or destroy its legacy. If you were to encounter it will no foreknowledge of the printed work, you'd probably think: that last 45 minutes is a bit weird, so it doesn't really work either way. It's depressing that it should've been treated this way, depressing not because of the failure; it's the wilful iconoclasm that betrays such disrespect for the source material and bodes ominously for the future.Censorship, dissembling and hypocrisy inevitably follow from paternalism as does sanction upon those individuals and institutions that transgress. Just as language is guarded and policed to conceal and obviate with euphemism and equivocation, so must the truth of such sanction and their consequences be obscured. Without the need for such occlusion and in an earlier age, perhaps a bounty would've been issued on copies of Batman Killing Joke and fires would've raged on campuses and in the streets. Today though such feats are accomplished by burning books without matches, which holds the added benefit of a little profit from the sales of reprints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this adaptation of the book, Batman sleeps with teenagers (Batgirl), her best friend has jazz hands, Batgirl beats up innocent civilians because she is in a bad mood, and on and on. As a fan boy, it was unfulfilling. I bought it on PPV and didn't even enjoy it enough to make myself a copy. Overall, it is worth seeing but don't get your hopes up too high. Like FLASH PARADOX and GODS AND MONSTERS, DC is trying to move into movies for adults but unfortunately, kids will see this. They throw in a dozen cuss words that are not necessary to get the controversial R-rating. If this trend continues, I don't see the future going well. This movie, for instance, I saw and talked to a dozen friends about it. They all agree that it was a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: The Joke Killed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke is one of the most iconic graphic novels ever written. We've waited years to see this adapted as an animated movie. Hopes were raised with the great adaptations of the Year One and then The Dark Knight Returns. Then Bruce Timm was connected to the project and it seemed like there was no going wrong. Sadly there was a way to go wrong and this adaptation found it. The movie shifts focus to being more about Batgirl, aka Barbara Gordon, pining over Batman and their totally irrelevant and subsequent love affair that adds NOTHING to the story. We waste half of the story on a narrative angle that's so detached and so uninteresting that you're almost ready to turn off the movie before it even reaches the comic. It's so filled with cliché dialogue and heavy in tropes that it plays like an eye rolling chore at times. Then when we finally get to the true story they add on incredibly unnecessary screen time with trivial crap like Batman interrogating criminals for the Jokers whereabouts, which in the comics was covered in a single page. Something about the ambiguous ending doesn't translate well to this film either. Now it's not a total waste. The voice acting of the great Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy is on point as usual. There are moments that they handled well from the story. It's just as a whole, really disappointing when compared to other DC adaptations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Bad Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets get this out of the way, Alan Moore's: The Killing Joke is one of the best Batman Graphic Novels out there. Right up there with Frank Miller and Paul Dini's entries in the universe, The Killing Joke acted as an observation of one of the greatest and most well recognized rivalries in pop culture. Not just the psychology of a criminally insane villain and how easy it is for an average person to step into their shoes. A Story this deep and acclaimed is worthy of a film adaptation. And when this film was announced everything seemed to be set up to make a modern masterpiece. You've got Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their respective parts, the film is 2D animated, and its R Rated! Allowing for the disturbing imagery that made the graphic novel iconic to come into fruition. So how did the film turn out? Well.. let's break it down.'The First 30 Minutes' Literally my biggest problem with this film. I don't know if this was in the original graphic novel or not, but the opening 30 minutes of this film is literally pointless. The film in short is about The Joker attacking James and Barbara Gordon in order to illustrate descent into madness. So how do you open such a film? How about with an uninteresting rendezvous with a Z Grade Donnie Brasco and his mobster uncle. When the first act of your seventy minute movie opens with what I can only assume is the sacked pilot for an unreleased Batman Series that's bad. Bad for an adaptation.'The R Rating' Batman: The Killing Joke is Rated R for Bloody Images and Disturbing Content. And outside of Barbara being shot and paralyzed, a few headshots, and some of the weird stuff that happens I don't feel this was too R rated. If an animated film is willing to be violent and disturbing go all the way. And yet it still feels more like a hard PG-13. Maybe if we got to see some more naked Barbara during the sex scene... But honestly the R rating seemed more like a gimmick to get wider audiences to see a 2D animated film. Valiant but Not Quite Warranted. Honestly if this weren't R this film wouldn't have too much else going for it outside of the animation and respective cast.'The 2D Animation' It was okay. A little stilted but the designs are still good. It's passable but not living too it's full potential.On the Plus Side.... The Performances were good. What I like the most about this is that there isn't a mainstream cast in a mainstream animated film. Outside of Mark Hamill this film stars voice actors. Nowadays animated films star A-List Celebrities from Movies &amp; Television (Inside Out &amp; Kubo and The Two Strings). Even though the celebrities they get are great and give in good performances, it's pretty much Hollywood Nepotism to just hire movie and television actors. Just take Charlize Theron in Kubo, when you say 'Hey did you see Kubo? Charlize Theron was really good in it.' Of course Charlize Theron was good in it she's Charlize Theron. I expect her to be good in anything. Oh but how satisfying is it to say 'Hey have you seen The Killing Joke? YEAH Tara Strong was really good in it.' How satisfying is it to have voice actors in a mainstream animated film (in a starring role) also give in really good performances.Kevin Conroy is great as always, Mark Hamill was great as always, Tara Strong was great as always. Even through the fluff of the opening thirty minutes you sit through it for Batman and Batgirl.But honestly what makes this move suffer is the fact that it's a slight film. In clips it seems epic, but together it feels like you had flashcards of Batman story lines and you pieced them together in a story that made sense. As a result, the characters aren't as fleshed out, and the deep monologues are swallowed by off pacing and jammed in action sequences. Which for an adaptation for one of the greatest Graphic Novels ever is not good.It wasn't the masterpiece we expected overall, but I couldn't say I hated it. It was cool to see some of the best parts transcended to the screen, and not to mention the performances were great. But the great film this could've been is instead more of a sparknotes edition. You may get something out of it If you're a fan (dedicated or casual) but other than that I'd hate to see Alan Moore's review. Good but Not a Masterpiece. Apologies Mr. Batman, Good Luck Barbara, and Stay Creepy Joker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ohhh?This wasn't supposed to turn out boring," says the Joker. Well it did. Unbelievably, it did.I just didn't get the hype or the "joke" of Batman: The Killing Joke. I thought this was supposed to be thought-provoking. I thought this was supposed to be waaay Rated R. I thought this would get better after the first chapter. I thought wrong. This was all-wrong.Basically, the movie is split into three stories, none of which were fun, interesting, deep, action-packed, detective-worthy or memorable. The first one, "Bat-Crybaby," literally put me to sleep. Luckily, I didn't need to rewind since they expositioned the crap out of all the events I slept through, over and over and over to the point you start questioning why anything is shown when they're just going to rehash everything countless times in future dialogue. The second and third stories overlapped and gave the insight I really didn't want to know and when I did, was sorry *that's* what they came up with.There was no threat, no depth and no charisma to any of the characters. The animation was blah, uninventive and they randomly tried new things to make it "edgy" when it just didn't fit the rest of the 80's-esque cartoon. Plus there's even a song and dance that was painful to listen to.While Batman &amp; Robin remains the low point of any Batman film, this comes very close to how bad that movie was. There were tons of scenes in that movie that contained very little sense, plausibility, realism or were physically possible. Wait. Hold on. I forgot which movie I was describing.The funniest part of this "Joke," was that while at only 76 minutes, I felt like I wasted my entire night on this. Totally skip this waste.***Final thoughts: Rip on Jared Leto's Joker all you want. This one was the worst I've seen on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first fifteen minute of the movie focus on Batgirl story, her story is stupid. It play as one of Batman: The Animated Series episode. They could've add anything but Batgirl story has nothing to do with the story. Barbara act like a teenage girl. Batman and Batgirl were partners not lovers plus he's older than her. So what happen to her attract to Dick Grayson. I prefer '89 Joker background as already a criminal, not failed comedian that was kind of boring. The movie had sex (Barbara had sex with Batman, that a don't) and rape (The Joker rape Barbara while she lying bleeding). They portrayed The Joker as sexual predator. Ithought it would be like Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker.Because I remember first reading the book I see similar what the Jokerdid to Tim Drake that show how The Joker went to far and Batman beat the crap out of him (I wish this film adaptation should show it). This movie is suppose to be about Batman and The Joker not Batgirl. The good parts they brought back Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as the voice of Batman and The Joker, when I first read the novella I always heard these actors voices at my head. It faithfully to the graphic novel even. Watch Batman Beyond: The Return of the Joker and Under the Red Hood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing Joke is based off the comic of the same title and follows Batman's adventures both with Batgirl and with the Joker as he attempts to prove that anyone can go insane. The story itself is a really interesting concept. I thought it was both really cool and unique. The action scenes are fairly good. They're mostly fast-paced and exciting, accompanied by some great animation. The voice work from everyone, especially Mark Hamill as the Joker, is great. He captures the Joker pretty perfectly with his voice. Unfortunately there were a handful of scenes that just didn't make sense. One part towards the end of the first act didn't make a whole lot of sense, specifically when Batgirl got mad at Batman and what followed. It just came out of nowhere and didn't make a whole lot of sense. How some things happened weren't always explained when they needed to be as well. While I like the concept, the presentation wasn't always great. The way the Joker tries to turn people insane just isn't that crazy or anything. It had it's moments, but it came off as more disturbing. Like the Joker was only furthering his own insanity over driving someone else over the edge. When the Joker does try to turn someone insane it goes by too quickly, and I felt like it could have developed the man's newfound mental state a bit better. Overall I really enjoyed Batman: The Killing Joke. Although I had a handful of problems with it, it was still really enjoyable. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done animation film that's blended with action, adventure, and bad guy against good guy chase journey!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read the graphic novel of Brian Bolland called "The Killing Joke" you know that it's one of the best and most important works of the "Batman" and DC comics universe, as it's somewhat of a significant and universal like origin story of "The Joker" it takes an interesting look at the "Clown prince of crime". Now with this animation adaptation it mostly stays true to form with the graphic novel as it has plenty of action and devious twists. Only the first half of the film is somewhat of a prologue and tease a subplot of romance and passion involving "Batman" and Barbara Gordon(AKA "Batgirl")as the two even make love the old fashioned hero way! Aside from that now enter the meat and potatoes of the story as Gotham city is being overthrown by dead smiling faces as word is "The Joker" has escaped from prison and on the loose. Things get more interesting when Commissoner Gordon is kidnapped and something that's near fatal happens to Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. "The Dark Knight" knows the man who laughs last is most likely responsible for it, as "The Joker" takes everyone and everything on a wild ride with twist and turns that all lead to the nearby amusement park. Also as if you've read the novel you see flashbacks of the early life of the purple one from his days as a struggling comic before his short time as a young criminal with a red hood for a face! Plus a personal and family tragedy is revealed that makes "The Joker" crazy and sick for the rest of his life! Overall well done film that is a must see for any "Batman" film buff or D.C. comics fan it's a fun adaptation of an important graphic novel that sheds more light and info on "The Clown Prince of Crime", and the film is blended with a good subplot and treat type romance and love encounter between "Batman" and Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. So a big thumbs up to "The Killing Joke" please please watch it if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On what should of been a fantastic film, the movie is horrifyingly bland and dull thanks to the incoherent story that ruins the film. First of all, the prologue is actually better than the actual killing joke segment. I was actually intrigued on how the bat-girl story would develop and I liked the action segments that involved bat-girl. The problem begins when it switches to the killing joke story. There is no consistency and the tone is totally different from the prologue. As a result, the film suffers from a mishmash of the two tones of the beginning and middle of the film. If you want to see a batman film that combines dark and lighter fare, just watch batman forever. You won't be bored and you'll be actually entertained unlike this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1988's Killing Joke meant a lot to me so i'll write what i REALLY felt about this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i want to say that when the Batman TKJ animated movie came out i still hadn't find the time to read the original comic (although i had read plenty ABOUT her). So one night, i went to thepiratebay - yes, i confess i'm into media piracy, i support the idea of a community sharing content in order to facilitate people's access to all kinds of information that are of their interest - and downloaded the cbr file so i could get straight to it. Here's the thing, i don't know how many hours i spent with that book but i know it ROCKED ME. Rocked me like Apocalypse Now did when i watched it for the first time after being a long time fan of movies with the Vietnan war impact on it's participants for theme. It hit me in the head and took me without consent into a dreadful ride through the meaning of madness. Every thing in there was FLAWLESS. Every single aspect of each panel was immersing. The gritting noir atmosphere in the flashback sections; the dystopian setting of the amusement park; the dark, intimidating corners of Gotham city and it's inhabitants; the gloomy, imposing figure of the Batman and it's terrifying yet fascinating archenemy as well as the extremely fitting reality of both, and of course, let's not forget about the deep, jaw-dropping, unmatchable script and dialogue. I went in with my expectations high in the clouds and somehow they were all surpassed. What i was feeling was genuine involvement with what was going on in that tale. I instantly fell in love with the comic. I was so taken by it that i had to pause my reading about 10 pages before the end to order a physical copy of it's deluxe edition. I was always a huge fan of the Batman's twisted romantic relationship with The Joker, i know of no other clash between antagonists that portrays so wonderfully the duality of man and the absurd reaches and outcomes of the pressure that the world places on individuals, even so, i felt like The Killing Joke took the whole thing to a new level. It was a masterpiece from the beginning to the end. As a matter of fact, i believe the reason some people can't fully appreciate it is that they don't manage to understand how powerfully symbolic are the analogies within the story. I'm not even talking about the Joker's philosophy, i'm discussing the final gag, that one last anecdote that cracked the whole secret behind what drives the fight of those two characters that can only be compared to nature forces. I'm talking about the speech that unveiled to us that Batman and Joker are not opposites but different versions of the very same material. Just two men pushed to the edge by a world that's more demented than any of them. Two lunatics looking desperately into each other for a way to free themselves from their ordeals before they are consumed by it. Anyway, i think some people look past the implied details that make the comic so unique. It's a classic case of people who simply don't get the joke &#x1f0cf; Right, now that i got through this part i'll tell you why after this title's credits started to roll the biggest thought that roamed my mind was that what i just watched could only be described by one word: INSULTING. I'm not exaggerating. Apart from what my over-the-top text can lead some to think, i'm not some deranged fanboy that can't deal with the fact that superhero movies will always be different from the sources they are based on. This animation was really outrageous because it nearly KILLED OFF the entire vibe of the story (and i'm not even considering the Batgirl prologue, for all means i'll just pretend i didn't even watch it). Maybe my shock was a lot more significant because i saw The Killing Joke in the same day i read it so i hadn't exactly recovered from the experience i had with Alan Moore's epic work but i totally felt like every single character (certain ones more than others) had be ridiculously reduced to over-simplistic caricatures. The tone was simply gone. Every set of elements that breathed life into the original environments was grotesquely blanked. The nightmarish chemical plant that looked like a factory of hell when seen through the red hood lens was absolutely boring; the nostalgic bar &amp; grill filled with sinister and overly human figures (nothing is more repulsive than man in it's non-idealized state) never looked duller; gosh, they even managed to leave the amusement park less funnier. And then there's the dialogue. Apart from like literally a couple of decent interventions (like the one time Joker told Batman that wearing himself like a flying rat wasn't hiding the fact that he was crazy but screaming it) most of modifications didn't fit and the new lines were pretty lousy. Heck, even the voice acting wasn't satisfying. I never imagined Mark Hamil's key speeches could possibly fall short. I'm not saying it was bad but it could be drastically improved. The point is, if i had never heard of The Killing joke i'd probably give this a 7/10 or even a higher rate but for something as pretentious as a screen adaptation of one of the best (if not THE best) and most influential Batman comics this is an unacceptable failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Batman Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The summary's not a joke or hyperbole. This is honestly one of the worst Batman movies I've ever seen. I mean, if the alternative was Batman and Robin, I might watch this again, but it's still kind of a close contest. It's so bad I actually just made this account because I wanted to warn as many people as possible not watch this movie, if the "sex on rooftop" keyword for plot elements didn't already raise enough flags.From beginning to end, this was just a thoroughly unpleasant experience. It's a far-too-long animated equivalent of a snuff film that fails to acknowledge or correct the problems of the source material as it claimed, instead substituting pseudo-philosophical debates about the nature of humanity and even more sexism and ableism the worst Batman stories are always known for.The only reason it's not a flat 1 is because, as is typical of DC animation, the art and the voice acting is fantastic. Kevin, Mark, and Tara all do their best to salvage this sinking ship, but there's nothing really to salvage to begin with. It's especially sad to see Kevin have to be in this, given the near-compassionless brute version of Batman for the majority of the film is exactly the opposite of the character he normally plays.Bottom line: A faithful adaption isn't always the best adaption, and this wasn't even all that faithful until the second half. Alan Moore's writing style works great on paper, but translating his long speeches word for word into film is always a recipe for a boring disaster. Aside from the flashback bits that don't even start until the actual plot does, there's no substance to any of this (including the tacked on after-credits).The Killing Joke is a chronically over-hyped comic far worse than most people are willing to admit, and this movie managed to be even worse than that. Save your money for something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A case study for why no one should adapt an Alan Moore work to the screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what a disappointment.I was really looking forward to this animated adaptation. What I saw was muted, uneven and, frankly, boring. I really wanted to like this one, but it fell flat on the floor. Not hard, but it just kind of rolled over and sighed.We had a 10 minute intro of Mark Hamill talking about his voice-over career, and how he was finally wrangled into doing the Joker one last time (I'm sure $$$ had something to do with it too, although I don't believe he mentioned that outright). Then we get a half-hour Batgirl story, followed by a straight up flat retelling of The Killing Joke.Now, I like Batgirl. I appreciate that they had a Batgirl story to give her somewhere to go. But she's the protagonist to start things off. A movie shouldn't then shift gears into a Joker origin story. If they do, it should be clever and with real purpose- this wasn't the case at all with Batman: The Killing Joke. A Batgirl story slapped onto the front serves neither story. The voice performances were subpar, but I feel that they were held back, so not entirely their fault. Probably due to the animation constraints. Let Mark Hamill really do his thing, and nobody can keep up. The flashbacks to pre-Joker were slow, flat and didn't build up properly to give him his ""one really bad day". #JokerfailThere were some nice things I liked, but these actually had nothing to do with The Killing Joke portion. All Batgirl, her relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman, and her storyline of becoming Oracle.So, yeah. Batgirl: The Killing Joke. Not sure if it was laziness due to the built-in fanbase, or if they really missed the mark in editing, but it was hard to find something redeeming in the theater last night.I did get to tell the millennial in front of me to put away his cell phone, though. But that was the only really rewarding thing I came away with from the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in to this I knew that it was based on a highly acclaimed graphic novel but that was about it, I had no inkling whatsoever that it'd be such an utterly fantastic watch that by the end I'd consider it to be possibly the best thing I've ever seen attached to the Batman name. It took a bit to get going, what doesn't, but once it found its feet to me the atmosphere just built upon itself and I found it so thrilling and was thoroughly engrossed, the darker more adult tone enhanced it all so beautifully and it was so effectively gritty! The violence was some of the most graphic I've ever seen in an animated feature, and the quality of the animation which I thought was pretty fluid and full of energy, made it so that you felt every punch and bullet impact. Following complicated issues between herself and Batman after, to be frank about it, in the heat of the moment she first fights then kind of pins him down and has sex with him in one outrageous and rather off-putting scene, Barbara Gordon is decidedly unfit for duty and hangs up her Batgirl cowl presumably for good. And then the Joker who has escaped Arkham again at some point, is really on the demented warpath and embarks on one of his most hellishly twisted schemes ever, when he first surprises and paralyses Barbara with a shot to the midrift and then abducts her father the Commissioner and proceeds to mentally beat him down further and further in a sick and cruel attempt to rob him off his sanity and prove to Batman that even the most noble and steadfast soul isn't beyond the reach of madness... And some of that stuff was straight-up disturbing! I am calling it, Mark Hamill makes this movie. He's really honed the iconic role that he's been voicing on and off for a good twenty years now and he owns it all, you can tell the man was having a ball with this. He and Kevin Conroy both are such perfect voiced personas of their characters, they're my absolute favourite versions. Never has the laughing clown prince of crime seemed so joyfully evil and devoid of empathy or feeling. Batman's toughest internal conflict is to remain a symbol of justice, and the Joker's primary goal is to challenge undermine and do whatever he can to taint that image, and the real meat of this movie is seeing the deep dark psychological sparks fly between the two as the Joker tries to force his greatest adversary to see the ridiculous absurdity in everything he stands for and tries to do, as well as to admit that in a way he's a little crazy himself. Maybe.. It's so awesome how it delves into who they both are as characters and what they're grim connection is. I loved the flashbacks that reveal the Joker's origins as a poor unfortunate man who failed as a stand up comic and naively joined the mob to try to make ends meet for his pregnant wife, only to lose her and soon after himself thanks to a fateful tumble into a vat of toxic chemicals that forever altered his appearance and shattered his mind. Of course this may only be a possible version of the villain's beginnings, one mustn't forget the "multiple choice" line. In any case I think it gives him added depth and even a little tragedy. Batman and the Joker have never seen eye to eye when it comes to ethics, but irony is something they can both appreciate. I for one loved the final scene where even after the horrible acts that he's committed, Batman still offers to try and rehabilitate his old beaten foe, who rejects the offer, but does share a joke with Batman that seems to break the tension and causes them both to burst out in genuine laughter, which is pretty freaky to hear coming out of the Dark Knight, but I really loved that. On some level all the Joker really wants is to share a good laugh. I certainly don't speak for everyone, but based on how much I personally got out of this in terms of entertainment, emotion, and sheer pathos I'd say they did the source material justice, people are coming down on this way to hard. It's fun to watch, it's exciting, haunting, memorable, I simply cannot say enough good things about this picture, it works brilliantly on most every level and is as epic as you can possibly get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexciting to say the least... but satisfactory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, not the comic it's based off, bored me to be honest. I was expecting a treat but found the flavor to be sour. This film was shorter than other DC animated films and that damaged the journey, even with the additional Batgirl arc, which I was a little intrigued by, the movie felt out of place and introduced the Joker suddenly and too far along into the plot. His fed-in origin story also felt a little unnecessary, although not as much as the poorly unforgettable sex scene between Barbara and Bruce, but this added more depth to the character with the death of his wife and unborn child, being forced to stroll along with the actual bad guys. It made me feel the smallest empathy for him and that was a bonus to the film in my opinion. The art style was not so great but resembled the comic to satisfaction. I would prefer either an older choice, like from the original Batman: The Animated Series or even more modern like Justice League vs. Teen Titans would have been more preferable. If not for the incredible combined voice work of Conroy, Hamill, Strong and Wise I would probably have had a worst opinion of this film. The cast held the film together and I believe it is the strongest showcase. Both Gordon and Batman felt the same as any other film, no new surprises there. But Gordon did develop his relationship with his daughter a little more which meant more character development, meaning more screen time. Batgirl takes up only half of the film before she is cast aside until the mid-end credit scene ? her as Oracle in the office. Overall I will say that this movie was hyped up to be only what fans should have expected it to be ? a comic to screen feature ? and that's exactly what it was. Even with the R rating this film was not the greatest adaptation as Under the Red Hood still remains my personal favorite as I found little emotion in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing Joke: Mediocre at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS AHEAD* Batman The Killing Joke was one of my most hyped movies of the year. It was a big deal because it was based off of Alan Moores amazing graphic novel and would receive an R rating to tell the story more properly. So what did I think of the film? Well, I have mixed opinions about. So I'll start with the good things:1. The Voice Acting The voice acting in this film is incredible. You have Kevin Conroy and Mark Hammil reprising their roles as Batman And Joker. And their voices really sold. It was spot but something overshadowed it in which I will explain later2.The Killing Joke Story It comes to no surprise that the film depicts the novel with a lot of respect and sticking to most of the dialogue between the characters that made the graphic novel so memorable and thanks to the r rating, their was no holding back on portraying this gruesome, powerful tale.Now we have to move onto the bad things, or the aspects I didn't like.1. The first 30 minutes *SPOILERS* Their is a first act in the film which was tagged in to make the film longer (which makes sense because the graphic novel is quite short). This act revolves around Barbara Gordon (AKA Batgirl) and her battling with a mob boss who has some sexual interest in batgirl. This was probably to better flesh out her character better than the graphic novel did. But unfortunately these first 30 minutes add absolutely nothing to the plot and it felt very forced, as if it was 2 separate short films. So the first act was completely unnecessary.2. The Animation It's quite a shame for film with this much hype that it gained a theatrical release for a day had such mediocre animation. This should have had a better budget because the animation felt very low budget and didn't really love up to the hype. It works for a made for TV film rather than a movie you would see in theatres. A lot of the VO didn't ,arch up with the lips of the characters which was very distracting for conveying such a great story.So The Killing Joke failed to live up to the hype with amazing performances and a great story but is sadly overshadowed by mediocre animation and a completely unnecessary first act which added nothing integral to the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, no good, quite terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So to contrast the comicbook, wherein Batgirl was a bit part, a plot device to get Gordon and Batman all riled up, they've nearly doubled the length of the story to flesh Batgirl out, give her depth and meaning. So now Batgirl is a whiny, angsty and impulsive teen with very few redeeming features to her personality. Other than a little Kung-Fu, there is no reason for Batman to "hire" her at all - she's stupid, emotional and easy to manipulate.Moving on though, nothing about this film works. None of the moments that make the graphic novel great LAND at all. I'm not sure it's the actors or the script - it's the direction, purely. The timing is off. The tone is off. It's all wrong.So disappointing. Don't watch this. Read the novel, and forget this ever happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Killing Joke comes to the big screen finally! Does it live up to the hype?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting years for this movie, and it finally comes.As a Batman fan and a Killing Joke fan, I have to say this movie was great, but it's not flawless.I recommend the film a lot. It's a great adaptation of the comic, every panel of the 1988 graphic novel was brilliantly brought to the screen. The voice acting is more than perfect, bringing back cast members from the animated series, such as Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong. The animation is pretty good, but it does feel weird at times. Sometimes its good, sometimes it just feels odd. But overall it's probably one of the best adaptations of a comic book to the screen.So... What went wrong? As I said it's a brilliant adaptation, but the comic is not long enough to make a full length feature film, so some of the scenes were expanded and there was a prologue written taking over the story of Batgirl. The scenes that were slightly extended I did not have a problem with. Most of the problems come in the prologue, written by Brian Azzarello. Though it was not bad and had me entertained, it has three major flaws.1. It had nothing to do with the main story, at all. It was neat and made me care more about characters like Barbara Gordon and made her more of a character, but it just doesn't fit the overall story and felt out of place. I suggest this should have happened just hours before the story of ''The Killing Joke'' begins, and had to do something with what happens in the story, maybe following something with The Joker or just with their relationship (not as a couple, but as mentor and sidekick) and the whole Joker story intervening with it. Though it was an interesting story and arc, it would have been better on its own.2. The infamous controversy, Batman and Barbara's scene, it's not just out of place, but out of character. Yes, she wanted an affair with him in ''The New Animated Adventures'', but Batman did not go down that path. It just was in a way unnecessary.3. What's up with any of this characters? Paris? Francesco? Who are this guys? As I said, the prologue was pretty good, but it had nothing to do with the story, and what bothered me the most was that we know nothing about this characters, they are never explained and they have no connection to the actual story. The prologue on its own was pretty good, but it feels like it doesn't belong in this movie, it should have been a separate movie and the prologue in this one should have just been connected in a way to what happens in the story.Those are my major flaws, with the other half in the movie, it was just the animation and some of the character designs, Joker looked weird sometimes, Batman's ears also looked odd.So. my conclusion is:It's a must see for all Batman fans, it's enjoyable, it's brilliantly acted, captured the essence of the original comic book, even though it has flaws, it's a great movie and definitely one of the best Batman movies.My rating (as a critic): 8.5 out of 10My rating (as a fan): 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Worthy Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When adapting a beloved story, there is always going to be fear the studio, the writers, or the directors will mess it up. It has happen innumerable times. So, it is all too natural to be wary. Especially when those involved openly admit they will be adding new material. All too often, that new material feels out of place. Not so here.The story of the The Killing Joke is about The Joker. It weaves back and forth between present day and how The Joker came to be. That is all the comic is. The movie, however, opens up with Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl, and Batman tracking down a stolen armored truck. The person leading the heist is Paris Franz, the nephew of a Gotham City mobster. Batgirl and Franz meet face to face, and it immediately begins a lust- filled plot by the latter to dominate her. He taunts her, pushing her beyond her limit. Batman, for his part, tries to keep her away, telling her not to go after him. After the final confrontation between Batgirl and Franz, where she nearly kills him, she hangs up her cape. The film then segues into a direct adaptation of the comic. Joker's first appearance, at the apartment of Comissioner Gordon, is chilling and effective. The musical number, while it feels upbeat, is equally chilling when you listen to the words. All in all, this is a terrific adaptation, and worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a word: Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is there, but the darkness that was hyped in the trailers and promo material was grossly missed. The Batgirl prologue during the first 20 minutes or so, that was not included in the print version and made purely for the motion picture, is entirely forgettable and very unneeded. Coming in, viewers more than likely know about Batgirl, at least the basics that are needed to understand minor details about the character. We can at the least inference the tight relationship with Batman, her family ties to Commissioner Gordon, and minor personal details. A sex scene between Batgirl and Batman was added, that should not have existed; it adds nothing to the plot, and has the potential to destroy decades of continuity. Turning to my biggest issue with The Killing Joke, the darkness. This was given a R rating; they could have/should have put that to the test. Go to the places only the Joker himself dares to go. Give the viewers something new. Let them think what they will about the Joker before the feature starts, and then blow that out of the water. Show the dark, non-comical side of the Joker. The truly sadistic side behind the clown prince of crime. Make the audience want to look away from the screen. To put things in perspective, take the anarchist version that we got from Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight, and add a new twisted, maniacal side to it. Make the Joker something from our nightmares, as you already have the voice actor to pull it off.Turning to voice cast, that is all superb. Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong, and especially Mark Hamill pick up wherever their previous characters left off, seamlessly recreating the voices we're all too familiar with. In conclusion, my issues with The Killing Joke isn't with the story, many knew what they were getting into when they hit the play button, but the R rating it ultimately was given, it did not earn. This could have just as easily been given a PG-13 that somewhat pushed the bill. Don't just remind us what the Joker is capable of, completely destroy everything we think we know about how far he can go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Joke = Just a Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today we will be talking about the latest DC anime, Batman: The Killing Joke. As a few of you already know, I am a hardcore Batman fan, so I was pretty excited going into this movie, and wanted to like it, but I did not. I simply thought it was just okay. The Killing Joke is one of the most famous Joker comics out there. And I have a feeling they did a rush job on the movie, just to put it out before Suicide Squad, as a sort of indirected promotion. The first half of the film seems like a completely other movie because, I'm guessing it is just that. I'm pretty sure DC was going to put out a solo Batgirl film, but did a U-turn, and turned it into the Killing Joke. The thing everyone is talking about is the sex scene between Batman and Batgirl, and I felt that could have worked with the overall film, if it wasn't turned from a Batgirl movie into the Killing Joke. And if you are wondering, yes. Batman did grab the booty. But seriously, the scene took place because Batgirl initiated it. Maybe because of her emotions for Batman, may-be because that was her way of trying to establish a hierarchy in their student teacher relationship, or maybe because of a million other reasons, The problem is that we will never know. Because the scene was meant for a totally different movie. Anyway. The animation in the film is a mixed bag, some of the artwork looks amazing, and other times it comes off as rushed, because it is just that. However, I did more than enjoy the last 15 minutes of the film but, if you red the comic, then you'll know it is more or less a far cry from the original work, because you're not as invested in major themes because of lack of character development, and a superficial taint. The Killing Joke animation felt like reading a paragraph off of Wikipedia about the Killing Joke comic book. My final score for the film is a 6 out of 10. And I guess I should address the ending of the film because, this is an adaptation to the killing joke after all. The ending was not as ambiguous as the comic, and I'm sure you're casual viewer is not going to get it. Whatever, the controversy around the ending of the Killing Joke is a whole other topic in and of itself. Anyway, thank you for reading this review. Over and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a real treat being able to see it in the big screen. The entire experience was amazing. Before the film they showed (bonus features from the Blu-Ray) an awesome interview with Mark Hamill and he talks a bit about the history of his evolution with the JOKER. Once the film starts, the mood changes to doom and gloom and that's very important. This is not a kids movie. The subject matter is dark and Gothic. It earns its rated R rating in spades. Most of the negativity DC gets is due to this darkness. People are shallow and want everything to be copies of something they hold dear. Marvel makes fun exciting films that focus on being light and full of humor. That's a great thing, but it also gets old quick. I myself love the darkness. BVS was fantastic due to this darkness. Who says comics are just for kids? Why can't we have both? Why do one liners and jokes have to be the norm? I like my characters dark. Batman is the moon, the night, the things that go bump! He is the MIDNIGHT SUN! This is basically the JOKERS origin story written by one of the most talented men on earth. The music is amazing, the voice acting is top notch and the animation is flawless. THIS IS ANIMATION at its VERY BEST.</fullReview>

Kevin Conroy and Hamill were obviously very good Voice Actors in this and you won't be disappointed. As for the R rating, I absolutely think it earned the Rating R badge with a lot of similarities to the extremely dark comic itself.

		<shortDescription>Would be better at 45 min. length</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problems with this adaptation all seem to stem from where it tried to stray from the source material. The first approx. 30 mins is out of place, uncomfortable and verges on ridiculous at times. The film has a clear shift in writing style when it switches from the new added parts, to the faithfully adapted killing joke. What's worse is the first 30 mins has nothing to do with the rest of the story at all, it's only there to achieve the feature run time.When the story stays close to the original graphic novel, it's brilliant. It's disappointing that the movie was tainted by the first 30 minutes, considering how great the rest was. The joker origin is shown well and the relationship between the joker and batman is also portrayed cleverly. Also, the voice performances are amazing. Conroy and Hamill returning for their roles here, and delivering the iconic lines the way they do was worth a lot for this movie. The animation is also good and what you would expect from an animated DC film.Overall The Killing Joke is definitely a disappointment, however if you ignore the first half an hour and enjoy the rest, it is worth the watch. The Killing Joke deserved to be a great film or TV adaptation, which I feel could have happened with a much shorter run time, but staying true to the source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing adaptation: a rare misstep for DC Animation &amp; Bruce Timm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's fair to say that Batman fans have been waiting for an adaptation of Alan Moore's 1988 graphic novel for a long time. At the time it was the first telling of the Joker's history &amp; origin that I had read and I loved it. Elements from the story have been incorporated in various Batman films over the years (Christopher Nolan's multiple origin story for Joker, for example) and when news was released that DC &amp; Warner would, not only be adapting the story, but that Kevin Conroy &amp; Mark Hamill would be voicing Batman &amp; Joker as well; wow! Unfortunately the end result, while having its moments, is a mess. In fact, you'd be forgiven for thinking 'am I watching the right film' when you first start watching. This is because the writers, for some reasons known only to them, decided to create a 25 minute story consisting of some weird sexual triangle between Batman, Batgirl and 'mobster that wasn't in original story'. It's clearly been written to a) extend the running time (the graphic novel is quite short) and b) create a bond between Batman and Batgirl so that when she is attacked, Batman definitely now has a reason to go nuts. I can't go into why it's so wrong having Batman and Batgirl have sex on top of a roof; fans know why this would never happen and it's a major mis-judgement on the writers part to have this storyline included, it's awkward and doesn't feel right; it's more suited to a soap opera and by the end of this first part you just think 'typical man, doesn't call once he gets what he wants...' For me, the film starts after this and it does get better; panels and pages are recreated faithfully and the voice acting is excellent. I'm still not 100% sure about the animation; usually the decision to alter from typical DC animation style is taken when the film wants to emulate the graphic novel but this is not the case here. The novel's artwork is outstanding. The animation here feels sloppy and a step down; Batman almost drawn in 1960s style artwork but everyone else isn't which means that scenes in which he is with someone else, Batgirl or Joker, he looks underdrawn and more amateurish. Because of this, scenes not featuring the Batman look far better animated. It's a strange decision and I can understand the idea but not the execution; either animate the entire film in 1960s style or don't.Violence and psychological torture are huge themes in the novel but here you don't feel that limits have been pushed and that deaths are more for cheap shocks rather than contributing to the psyche of a character.Finally, the song; why? Completely out of place and its inclusion is baffling. It interrupts the momentum and for an animated film that wants to be 'adult' and shock with its scenes, the song makes it feel like it's for kids. I can almost imagine Mark Hamill saying 'okay, I'll do it but you guys know how much I love songs so make sure I have one.'Overall, it's a disappointment and certainly not one of the strongest DC animated films. It is worth watching and once you get through the first mawkish 25 minutes, it does pick up. It's a mish mash of trying to shock viewers and trying to ensure that it doesn't overly offend; characters say 'frigging' an awful lot and far more than anyone ever would, done by the film makers in an attempt to say 'hey, we're adult and if you don't like it, well that's okay because there's a song later to show that we haven't grown up just yet.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The laziest kind of edgy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this was... something.There's something so offensive about animated films trying as hard as they can to be edgy. The comic this is based on is certainly a dark piece of work, and really didn't need any help. The story was fine, though I really disliked the origin story given to The Joker, it seemed to cheapen the air of mystery about him.The biggest problem with this is, obviously, the beginning. The set up with Batgirl, during which she has sex with Batman, she is set up as an over-emotional, bumbling, and all around useless crime fighter. She loses her judgement over a male criminal, she is under threat of rape (which is alluded to later in the film after she is attacked by the Joker), and there is even a "that time of the month" gag thrown in for good measure.There were any number of ways to give Batgirl a more involved set up so that she wasn't simply a plot device as she is in the comic book, but the route taken was lazy bordering on misogynistic. There is clearly someone involved here who thinks sex and rape equal edgy, and they're completely wrong.The movie as a whole is fine, and reasonably entertaining. Mark Hamill is great as The Joker, but that's kind of where it ends for me. I really don't need any more dark, broody, edgy work from DC, but that seems to be the bread and butter of their animated and live action film selection right now.If you are enamored with the story for some reason, then just read the comic book again if you want. I mean, if you love the book you've probably already seen this. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm not recommending it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its been over 2 weeks since I watched 'Batman: The Killing Joke' &amp; sadly, the film hasn't grown on me. Whats with the DC universe, off late? Batman v Superman lacked spark, Suicide Squad settled for ordinary thrills &amp; 'Batman: The Killing Joke' too lacks spice.The Biggest Letdown here is the lack of The Joker in its first-hour. Why can't you keep it simple &amp; fun, like the old times, eh?'Batman: The Killing Joke' Synopsis: As Batman hunts for the escaped Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime attacks the Gordon family to prove a diabolical point mirroring his own fall into madness.'Batman: The Killing Joke' has a tepid first-hour, where a lazily written Batgirl romances, screws &amp; bores the Batman &amp; us. Its only when The Joker arrives, is when the things get moving. Mark Hamill as The Joker is astonishing, once again, as the legendary villain. I wonder how cool it would be if they took Hamill in a motion-picture as The Joker? That would be so awesome. Kevin Conroy as Bruce Wayne / Batman is extraordinary too. BUT, The Writing lacks the bite.'Batman: The Killing Joke' needed a stronger Screenplay. As a hardcore Batman fan, I expected a much deeper, darker &amp; gorier tale on The Joker (since this is Rated-R), but the material doesn't make much use of it. I wonder why did they have to make it Rated R, when there wasn't anything, but a tacky sex-scene? The confrontation between The Joker &amp; Batman in the finale, is confounding. But that's what it is, its only in the finale.'Batman: The Killing Joke' is A Middling Disappointment! DC Universe, get 'Marvel'ous soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak mash up but enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kinda liked it a bit. but the two stories seemed to be way too different and separate from each other. Each part deserved a stand alone work. I liked the batgirl part as its own, but not as a part of the whole thing. There is one detail that is way too creepy in it but it wasn't bad as a whole. The killing joke is an iconic graphic novel that deserved more respect. It could've been easily developed and elaborated. The voice actors were cool, the animation is pretty. I give it 6/10 because it looked like 2 mashed episodes of some series... But I still enjoyed it. A better title would've been: "Horny Batgirl &amp; the killing joke"... Sorry!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Batman: The Killing Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Foremost, a shameful confession: I didn't like the graphic novel The Killing Joke as much as the rest of the world did. Don't misunderstand me; Brian Holland's art is phenomenal, and the story written by Alan Moore represents a milestone in sequential art, displaying maturity, dramatic consistency and ingenuity to transform the clichés of the relationship between Batman and Joker into brutal revelations on the psychology of both characters, until leading to an unexpected and disturbing ending. However, I found the book too short, superficial on some aspects and a weak and unnecessary "origin story" for Joker. After 50 years of story (in 1988, when the novel was published), the characters were already perfectly defined in the collective conscience of the fans; there was no need to detail their origins or introduce ret-con. And even though Moore is one of my favorite writers, and I like almost everything he has done, I feel that his origin of Joker was a bad creative and editorial decision of DC Comics. Regarding the animated film Batman: The Killing Joke, screenwriter Brian Azzarello made a good work expanding the story with the sub-plot of Batgirl and the criminal "Paris France"; he's not a particularly interesting villain, but he represents a good challenge for the incipient heroine, while denouncing the unavoidable sexism a woman would face in the hyper-male world of superheroes. And we also have the solid voice performances from Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill and Tara Strong; on the other hand, I didn't like Ray Wise's work as Commissioner Gordon. I generally like Wise's "live action" work very much, but as a voice actor, he wasn't able to transmit his traditional energy, something which negatively affected some scenes which should have been devastating, but ended up being "meh". After all, I liked Batman: The Killing Joke, but I didn't "feel" it with the same intensity as Batman: Year One or Batman: The Dark Knight Returns; or with the detailed characterization of Son of Batman or Batman Vs. Robin (sure, they tell such different stories that I shouldn't be comparing them, but that doesn't explain the indolent tone occasionally adopted by Batman: The Killing Joke). In conclusion: I liked both the graphic novel The Killing Joke and the film Batman: The Killing Joke; but they share similar problems which decreased my enthusiasm and made the experience less epic and satisfactory than expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Joke That Leaves You Speechless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER FREE* This movie is ominous and leaves a chilling feeling down your spine, with the amazing performances from Mark Hamill as well as Kevin Conroy once again shattering expectations and leaving us in shambles with their brilliant voice acting that submerges us into the characters of Batman and Joker. Conroy and Hamill once again make the movie come to life with their ingenious approach to the characters as well as their understanding of the motives of each character. The beginning of this movie focuses on Barbara Gordon, and allows us to get an insight on her motivation's as a hero as well as give us development between the relationship of Bruce Wayne and Barbara. We truly understand Barbara's thoughts on Batman and why she struggles to work with him, but then something happens between Bruce and Barbara that honestly felt unnecessary. Bruce and Barbara had a very strange...interaction I will say that honestly felt way out of left field. The beginning may feel like it may not have anything to do with Joker, but let the movie explain itself. The beginning was very integral in helping us feel for the character of Barbara. The Joker was truly terrifying in this movie and truly made me feel afraid and wondering of just what he will do. If you are expecting an action packed, well choreographed action movie, then I feel you won't be pleased. This movie is more focused on character and while it has good action sequences, it definitely shines with what makes Batman movies the best, the characters. The characters all go through a very weird development cycle, and it is a GOOD WEIRD! The movie leaves you bewildered at what happens to the characters and adds several layers of depth and moral dilemma that may change the way you view characters such as Batman or The Joker. The Killing Joke overall was an astounding ride with thrills and fluid animation. The characters are very well realized and go through an awesome and the character development is highly unorthodox, but that's what adds to it's charm. The amazing performances leave chills as well as expand upon each of the characters and make you see them in whole different lights. Despite the weird event that happens in the beginning as well as some unnecessary provocative jokes that I feel didn't belong in the movie, this movie left me mind blown and was one of the greatest Batman movies I have seen in awhile. With that, Batman: The Killing Joke obtains a solid 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed fan ( Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed very few things about this film. One and probably the one thing anyone would enjoy from this film is of course the joker. Mark Hamill as always is brilliant, probably the only brilliant aspect of this movie. The only good scenes are those from the carnival and even so they lack the detail and color from the graphics in the novel. I also thought Tara Strong did well as batgirl. However the first half hour of the film is pointless and takes away from the true tone of the story, which is supposed to encompass the joker. If a batgirl film wants to be made that's fine. Don't ruin what could have been an amazing project by adding something completely irrelevant to the actual plot. Now let's talk about Conroy. I am a huge fan, but his performance in this has no heart or passion behind it. The portrayal of batman is not what you would expect from Conroy, and it really ruined a lot of the dialogue and story because it seemed as though he didn't care about the part. They could have brought anyone in off the street to give the performance that Conroy did in Killing Joke. The graphic novel is in my top three favorites, and this movie was a huge disappointment to a very dear and loving fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This could have been another DC Universe Animated hit but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First a history lesson: Pre-Crisis (before 1986) Batgirl had a crush and Batman that inspired her to take up the mantle. Characterizations were different back then, the entire arc never went anywhere and was a perfectly valid and innocent fluff. Then came the 90s Batman TAS cartoon and Bruce Timm, the producer of this movie, decided to pursue that plot thread further as he was in intrigued by how "wrong" (a direct quote from the DVD extras) it was. The problem is that the first interaction between Bruce and Barbara on that show was to hand him a teddy bear and that Bruce revealed that he viewed her father as a father figure of his own in the sequel episode I Am the Night. You may now begin to see why fans have complained about this doomed romance for nearly 2 decades and a 2013/14 Batman Beyond comic by Kyle Higgins drove if off a cliff, look it up. I have to bring this up as it will be the only thing this animated film will be known for due to the original 30 minute Batgirl arc at the start. That part of the movie is a top to bottom disaster in all but animation. Tara Strong chosen voice for Batgirl is too old, too aggressive and out of character. Every single creative decision, as her life being driven by men, the gay best friend with relationship advice (wow!) and her utter inability to fight crime shocked me as a 2 decade fan of the character. The new nemesis Paris Franz is another mess and all these decision ultimately "fridge" her while messing with the main TKJ plot. This is no Barbara I know off but Black Canary from All Star Batman &amp; Robin instead. The already infamous sex scene lines up 1 to 1... Even shippers will question this part of the film and I can only repeat that the "rooftop action" wasn't the main problem, just one of many. The original 1988 Batgirl one-shot by Barbara Kesel that set up her retirement and served as a prequel to the TKJ comic should have been adapted instead, as a spate short on the disc, to "fill the run-time". A thematic double bill with an adaptation of The Man Who Laughs, a one-shot remake of Joker's first appearance, would have worked wonders too. 3,5/10The titular film is another beast entirely and was my most awaited film of the year. Most of it is a 1 to 1 adaptation with some edged up dialogue on the one hand and some censorship on the other. The film was never intended to get an R-rating according to the film's preview on the last DCU animate release. The producers decided to stick with the rating as a form of promotion and not to censor the film down, as with DKR and Wonder Woman. I find it pointless to go over the film's numerous qualities as the source material is well documented by now and will again stick to flaw. Some of the voice acting was a bit emotionless, even Kevin Conroy's delivery. The animator didn't animate the background characters during Joker's flashbacks in a bar. They move in the comic, so it can't be directorial decision to highlight the dreamlike nature if the scene and it stood out due to the phenomenal animation for the rest of the film. WB certainly knows how to do beautiful "OVAs" on a budget! The film also dances between panels to add run-time and the one panel prostitutes Batman questions now get dialogue that suggest that Joker is a sex addict. What? No seriously! This and the new take on Barbara derail the source material's point beyond reason. A new mid-credit sequence is also highly problematic as it shifts away from the intriguing ideas of the final scene to again focus on Batgirl. Couldn't they just have revived the Batgirl Year One film instead? I can't believe that the film's dream team could make such mistake. Do I dislike the film after complain so much? Of course not! It's The Killing Joke come to life, new flaws and all. 8,5/10Do yourself a favor and tune in @ minute 31, out of 76, and watch the Batgirl short thereafter, if ever. It may ruin the film's numerous qualities for you and that would be a shame. The Batman Year One film (9/10) showed how to extend short source material, while empowering the female lead, so don't ask me what happened here! 6,5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I've started reading Batman comics, I've been waiting for THE KILLING JOKE's adaption. Finally D.C. comics made our wish come true. The movie is well designed and well plotted, obviously it has some disturbing scenes but that what makes this one of the darkest comic stories of all time. Some people are complaining about the Barbara(batgirl) prologue, well, to be honest it wasn't necessary but it was well crafted and gave us the point of view of Barbara. This story-line is also peppered with flashbacks to the Joker's origin story, or at least his origin "as he remembers it," suggesting he has different memories of his past (another aspect of the Joker used by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight). Just like in Moore's original storyMark Hamill is the greatest Joker we've ever had on screen.And again, it goes without saying that Conroy is THE Batman. All in all I'm truly happy that they made this adaptation</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark and Kevin are my favorite voice actors and their combination for this greatest comics of all time made me excited about this prospect and what are all the things it is capable of achieving. I thought there is no way they could screw up such a great plot. But somehow they did screw it up. They mess things up by adding too much of Bat girl and not too much Joker. The plot of the movie starts after 30 minutes, from there it gets better thanks to Mark's brilliant voice acting. Even the climax &amp; flash back fails to capture the essence of Alan Moore's greatest work. They should have made this a 30-minute movie and left out the Bat girl sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...how bad this is. Let me tell you I'm not your usual comic geek that growls every time an adaptation isn't 100% true to its source material. I believe different mediums call for different solutions, and things that work on a novel don't necessarily work on a film (and vice-versa) The big issue here, that completely made me dislike The Killing Joke - the movie, is how they fail to bring to the movie the very things that were movie-like in the graphic novel. They didn't get most of the brilliant cinematic panel transitions in the comics (like changing the shot from someone lifting Barbara's dead legs on a Hospital to someone picking dead lobster legs on a restaurant, and so on). They didn't get most of Alan Moore's very film-like subtext or subtleties . Instead of bringing a comic alive, they decided to do a flatter version of something that was originally printed on flat paper. Dumbing the story and dumbing the storytelling makes me wonder what was it in the original source material they found special first place, cause they certainly didn't get the special things in it. And I'm not addressing budget issues, or the impossibility of transposing Brian Bolland's art to an animated feature - I'm talking about the little, simple, basic, beautiful stuff they just cut out. And don't get me started on that Batgirl prologue. Was it just to add time? Because if it was to develop a key character then they're once again proving they didn't get the best part of the source material. The pace is all wrong as well. Talk about an epic fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay to start off I had been waiting for this movie since the news came out last year. This was probably my most awaited film this year and turned out to be the biggest disappointment. So the film is 1hr:16min long, which is a very good length, but the first 28 minutes, were almost unrelated, unconnected to the rest of the film. Maybe they wanted to add more depth to the character of Barbara Gordon, and show her relationship with Batman, but in reality to extend the runtime from 44mins. So they have sex, yep. Also the scene is totally unexpected. Also, my MAIN CONCERN is with the character Paris Francesco. At first I thought he might be our Joker in this film and somehow this film isn't hanging in with the comics. A sociopath, talks a lot, has eyebrows and a long face like the Joker, a wide grin. But then for the rest of the film he disappears. His character was the most pointless characters I have ever seen in an animated Batman film. Moving on, the story wasn't great but the script was even worse. I mean the dialogue felt forces, some lines were added only to fill the film quota. The music was okay, the direction was...mehh okay. The characters could have been voiced with more realism. The Animation sucked though. The one thing I sort of liked about this film was the ending, it was a bit of a cliffhanger, though it is different from the comics. The ending saves me from giving this film a 3 tbh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, not a patch on the source material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has long been held that Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's 1988 graphic novel "The Killing Joke" is one of the best Batman standalone tales ever told. A gritty script, coupled with sumptuous art, means it stays in the mind long after it's 64 pages have been devoured. Moore, in typical grumpy style, as said that he 'never really liked it', and found it 'far too violent and sexualized'. Odd quotes from a man who had the final say in the script, but let's be honest he's always been an odd bugger. You won't find Moore's name anywhere in the credits to this brand new animated version, simply because that's what he wanted, happy to see all monies go to artist Brian Bolland.After thoroughly enjoying the 'comic to screen' animated version of Frank Miller's "Dark Knight Returns", I was still skeptical about this one, mainly because it was never going to look like the comic. Bolland is and was one of the best, most detailed comic artists about, and no way was anyone going to be able to do him justice. As expected, this is in DC's house style, farmed out to the far east presumably to cut costs. It looks as okay as the comany's other output, with slightly jerky animation due to a lack of frames and some nice touches throughout.Comics stalwart Brian Azarello handles the script, and because the source material is only good for about 40 minutes he gives us a pointless extended prologue involving Batgirl, Batman and a villain who has no involvement or relevance to the main story. Batgirl fans should probably skip this, as it really doesn't do her any favours. Once it gets to the actual source material, Azarello lifts dialogue wholesale, even down to the Joker's "I Go Loony" song. This is not, however, a bad thing, as Moore's dialogue is always a pleasure to read or hear, and for the most part doesn't suffer from the shift to animation.So this is really a mixed bag, with the first half coming across like a separate episode from the TV series that's been bolted on, and the second half doing a good job of living up to the title. After watching it I felt like I wanted to read the comic again, as it's so much better, something I didn't feel so much after "The dark Knight Returns". Whatever Moore thinks, it's a superbly good read, and will always get recommended over this version. "The Killing Joke" animated is simply an adaptation that wasn't needed, and succeeds mostly in watering down a great piece of literature. There have been a few moans about it's 'adult' themes, but there really is nothing too graphic, although the script does add in a needless extra scene to let you know that the Joker gets horny when he escapes. File under 'watch once then forget'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who have read the comic obviously know the story, so there is no adding to that. Still reading it and seeing it makes a huge difference and when the Joker cometh, it's something. The one major flaw which I found, and I am sure I am not alone, is the animation. I don't know why the animation looked even worse than the Batman animated series. Nowadays 2D animation is peaking and in comparison to that the animation looked very choppy.No complaint about the voice acting for sure. Mark Hamill as the Joker is just riveting. It feels like if I talk to him in person, I'd go insane. There is something about the way he throws the anecdotes and quotes in one breath that it brings your brain to a halt and you start to think his way, the Joker's way.Final verdict: I think better editing and animation could have made the viewing better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another hit for DC animated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: The Killing joke is an animated superhero film directed by San Liu. It is a direct adaptation of the graphic novel with the same name that came out in 1988. It stars the voices of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong and Ray Wise. The comic book that the movie is based on is a classic and most anybody has heard of it. It is basically the origin of the Joker and involves a lot of graphic content. That's the main reason as to why this movie is rated R, the first animated film to be so. I personally really liked it, the animation is not great unfortunately especially considering that DC has had better "animated" movies in the past. But the story is engaging and interesting all the way through. There's a lot of controversy about Batgirl in this film, mainly because "she's objectified" and her only purpose is to serve as a motivation for Batman (and another "dirty" purpose for the Joker). But that is absolutely stupid in my opinion, it is reminding me of the controversy over the X-Men Apocalypse poster where Jennifer Lawrence's character Mystique was being choked by Apocalypse. Fox had to apologize for THAT because feminism nowadays is out of hand. But that nonsense behind, the action scenes are really good, the voice actors all do a phenomenal job and while it is a bit short, it is still a good animated entry for the DC Universe Animated Original Movies.</fullReview>

IMO: it is a good film i would even stretch to call it a great film (compared to DC's releases this year) but if you are looking for a dark and gritty i would recommend Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 and for live action i would recommend Christopher Nolan's trilogy my favorite character in this film was either bat-girl or joker as they shined the most out of anyone. its R rating was earned due to partial nudity a heavily implied sex scene (it doesn't show us anything) and gore. 7/10</fullReview>

It really ruined what was an otherwise great film. I think this was Mark Hamill at his finest, but that scene really destroyed the movie. The animation was a lot better than what I have seen from DC movies lately. I think that DC has done a poor job of adapting movies, especially with Batman v. Robin and Batman and Robin. I still think that Year One, Under the Red Hood, and Return of the Dark Knight are much better films, because they stay almost completely true to the comics themselves. I really was excited for a reunion of the animated series cast, but I was immediately concerned with Azzarello being a writer, because he has almost a different universe of his own for Batman, similar to Grant Morrison. They try to be edgy, but it ruins what preexisted. It would have been nice to see Dick Grayson and Barbara in some form of a relationship, but Batgirl and Batman have almost a fatherly mentor relationship, not a sexual one, which is what ruined the movie. I have it at a 3, because the rest of the movie is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary prologue for a cult classic Batman story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, take away the first 30 minutes of garbage and this should be OK. The animation and drawing seems mediocre. From what I have seen on previews Batman animations like the Gotham Knight that was great animation, this one is a way step down. Why not just get the animators from that film if that worked.This film just lacked style, attention to detail. Plus the Barbara thing, oh no, this isn't about Barbara Gordon, it's a Joker story please. Did the writers of this film read and understood the material??? Probably not. Just terrible execution and this is coming from a Batman fan. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, lacks good animation, and the correct character traits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched the movie, overall it was okay, but i was NOT a fan of the animation (felt weird, and clunky) as well as the controversial sex scene, it strikes me as odd how people involved apparently okay'ed it, Bruce and Jim are long time friends, and Barbara is like a niece to Bruce. I get that Barbara can be attracted to Bruce, but Bruce not stopping her and just giving in, it's completely against his character. The only time we get anything about the robins is a picture of a beaten up Jason, and they are not even mentioned.It great to have the talents of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy back, their voices are so iconic.I wish this movie was better, but there are some big flaws, that if you love the characters can be jarring. I just hope we get to see a good dynamic with Bruce and Barbara one that, that isn't romantic, but platonic and that of a student/mentor, just like with the robins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't underestimate him.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know some regard it as one of the most influential graphic novels of all time, and to be honest, I have never read it, because I've not had the cha............well there's no excuse really, I've never read it.I was eleven when the GN was released, so four years later I would have been at a prime age for reading it, but SNES overtook my life.But there is a point to my little biography. Having never read the source material, am I right in thinking that despite this being highly watchable and being one of the most darkest of The Dark Knight films ever bought to screen, is there something missing?I just didn't get the oomph factor that I was expecting....Batman must save Commissioner Gordon from the Joker's twisted quest to drive him insane.....And that's the simplest way to explain the film, it's a revenge story primarily, and secondly we have the film told mostly from the perspective of Barbara Gordon, and this is when the film is at its most strongest. Her narrative is interesting, and her battle with her inner and outer demons pack quite an emotional punch to the proceedings.And thirdly, we have quite a wonderful backstory into the creation of The Clown Prince Of Crime, and it's pretty thrilling to see that you cannot help but show a little empathy for the monster. And this is where the film succeeds, there is more than one instance where you actual feel sorry for The Joker, and wish Batman would let him be.But, and it's a very big but, once we get to the carnival section of the film, and we see The Joker begin to play with Gordon, the film falls a little flat, only a little, but it's just goes a little off piste.But the voice work is excellent, it's extremely,Ely dark and very deserved of its certification, and if you are a fan of Batman, it's one hell of a step up from Dawn Of Justice, even if it does depict Batman as nothing more than a supporting character.And the ending is pretty leftfield.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the most hipped films of the year. So is it good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Batman: Killing Joke was extremely hyped for this is one of the best Batman story-lines of his existence as a character for about three quarters of an century. And with news saying that we would see more from Batgirl every fan of the DC animated movies was excited to see her get some time in the spotlight. But the true reason why EVERYONE was hipped it was that, this was thought to be Joker's movie, because that was the focus of the comic, a look to the insanity house that is his brain!So why is it rated so low, previous adaptations of Batman's mythology, which had changes are praised ,like Under the Red Hood?The issue isn't that the film is bad ,far from it.It has a good plot, you see Barbar Gordon (Batgirl) kicking ass and the comic come to life both in quotes and scenes! The problem is that there is too much of Batgirl in the movie, to give you a clue the film if you cut out the opening credits and the end titles is about 1 hour and 10 minutes long and the thirty of them are the Batgirl and Batman current case and after wards we get the Killing Joke! In short the title was deceiving to say the least, if it was something like "Batgirl in the Killing Joke" ,I would been fine,but that no.As for the animation is very good and for Batgirl ,well, Miss. Gordon you are a total knock out! Also it is nice to have back Conroy and Hamill in their roles as the Dark Knight and the Clown respectively. But my main concern is that their names and the name of the title were used as a marketing tool to increase sells and not to enhance the final product! One the other problem was that the flick didn't use to its full extent the R rating, for sure this is not a kids film, but for Gotham sake you take elements of one of the most terrifying graphic novel in history, go all the way in!All in all it is just a good film, but it had the ability to be awesome. So I will say what I said when Batman vs Superman ended ,MEDIOCRE! Bats, for real, pull yourself together you started in 2 mediocre films so far, I hope that in Suicide Squad you will do better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not your average Batman Movie. It takes you to a very dark place and is definitely not for little kids. Having said that it really is a fantastic, fast paced, unique way of telling the story of Batman and the Joker.The voice cast is brilliant. Nobody can beat Mark Hamill as the Joker's voice. He has brought this terrifying, memorable, and yet funny joker to life. In this one he is as dark as you can possibly go. Tara Strong gives another great voice to Batgirl and Kevin Conroy as Batman.The song "I Go Looney" is incredibly spooky and shocking, and yet very memorable. One of the best scenes in the entire film. The one thing that really upset comic book and Batman fans was the "sex scene" between Batman and Batgirl. FYI you never see anything. But the theater I was in was laughing and obviously thought it was ridiculous or just way out of place. While The Autistic Reviewers didn't really care, it didn't really makes us feel anything. To us it was just a pointless scene. Having said that, it's probably the best Batman Animated Movie to date! Highly recommended. 4/5 8/10. Autistic Reviewers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the movie that made me realize how stupid Batman is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I understand this is a movie adaptation of a really famous comic. I have read the comic and if you feel that invalidates what I have to say, that is fine. This is the movie that made me realize how stupid Batman is. He ha his one rule where he doesn't kill criminals, which is admirable. Then we have the Joker, who has killed over a hundred people (or more) in his life over the one incident that happened to him, which is shown in the movie. He paralyzes Batgirl for no reason other than to screw over Commissioner Gordan and then they hint at a possible rape too? Batman learns about this, is all cool with it, goes around to find Joker pretty casually. Then he finally finds him after he gets an invitation from the Joker himself (so much for the world's greatest detective) and does everything that the Joker wants him to do. Then they have a mild fight and it all ends in laughter? What the .....Is Batman's rule that solid that he doesn't understand that his rule is hurting more than helping? I can't watch stuff like his again. Batman is really just for kids I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you subscribe to moral relativism and Batman xoxo Joker romantic innuendos this is the film for you. There is no black and white, no good or evil here. Batman is supposed to have a female romantic interest but the only time he opens up and shows his soft side &amp; emotions is when he's dealing with the Joker, which seems to imply the the most intimate relationship in the film is between the Joker and Batman.The end product is an animated Batman film that attempts to cater to atheist ideals: implied Batman x Joker gaydar and moral relativism within the guise that neither good nor evil exists, as morality is but a "man made abstract".Aside from those things, it doesn't have much going for it other than Batman/DC brand name appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feminist agenda for President</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animation is crappy and choppy. Made in a rush with no attention to details and they skipped animation frames to rush it out the door. For the inconsistencies you can say that this is a kids animation and they're not smart, but a sex scene in the first 20 minutes and rape = NO. I really did liked the way Batman is drawn, i give them that. Too bad they had to push the feminist agenda instead of focusing more on the story's logic and making the animation better.First 20 minutes made me want to stop watching it.**Spoilers** In order of appearance- Batgirl gets up on her feet in two seconds after being kicked off from a speeding truck- The redhead prostitute climbs the stairs like she has a wooden leg- 3 bad guys on a boat, one gets shot, escape plan is two diving suits+- Feminist agenda gets into the scene(shy at first). They use the "objectify" word in a sentence that has logic (+ for using logic). But in the end, they feed you that the bad guy objectified the girl (Big feminist issue and they are loud about it, but feminists fighting for equality forget that guys are objectified more often).- Batgirl hides behind what looks like a wooden armchair and the armchair deflects bullets.- Batman says that he and Batgirl "are partners but not equals, not even close" (no reason to use exactly those words, but... feminist agenda. And we are left with a taste that Batman is misogynistic)- Batgirl gets aggressive for being rejected, lands some kicks on Batman and even manages to throw him to the ground after she blames him for things that exist only in her head and because she is in this because of him. (In their pursuit to push the feminist agenda, the writers forgot that Batman doesn't partners with anyone that easy, unless they are orphans or already a vigilante, and Batman doesn't beg them to do it. So her claim that she is in this because of him is just in her head and making Batman responsible for it, but the writers wanted to give you a feeling that it's Batman's fault and show that aggression from women towards men is OK)- After kicking Batman and throwing him to the ground, Batgirl is on top of him holding his hands to the ground and then kisses him out of the blue without any warning or confirmation. Sex scene follows. Writers show that when a girl jumps a boy it's romantic and she is empowered, if Batman would have hold her hands to the ground and do that he would be a rapist.- Next scene adds nothing to the story but it's put there because... feminism. Batgirl walks out of a coffeehouse, outside is a pretty(well drawn) girl clinging to an ugly guy. The ugly (intentionally poorly drawn) guy tells her that she is too clingy and he needs space. Batgirl punished the intentionally poorly drawn guy for wanting some space and throws the guy in the bushes out of the blue and the girl gives Batwoman a surprised look, like she was shown the correct way and the writers manage to send that message. If Batman would have done that to the girl he would have been a horrible person.- Batgirl calls Batman, talk for 50 seconds. Timer shows only 5 seconds when hanging up.- Missile hits Batman's car. Car rolls over. The batmobile only has a flaming tire, smoke inside the car. Batman being into his seat belt struggles to pull the ejection lever (why? did he got dizzy that easy?)- Second missile turns the batmobile to ashes.- Batman is rescued by Batgirl who slams the bad guy into crates at high speed from a motorcycle. The crates are destroyed, the bad guy got up on his feet 2 seconds later (he doesn't get dizzy that easy ?)- Batgirl kicks the bad guy into other crates, the crates get destroyed and the bad guy is now way dizzier. A girl power kick is more powerful than being slammed into crates from a speeding motorcycle.- I'm 30 minutes into the movie. It seems that this far the movie is only good at advancing feminist propaganda and was rushed out the door in order to do just that.- A cop lifts the police tape, but Batman can walk trough it with the costume's bat ears without breaking it (ghost bat ears power) - The man Joker used to be, is portrayed as an unfunny comedian (See the 2016 Ghostbusters failing) - The Joker is portrayed as a rapist+ The movie is 1h 16min. Half way trough the movie (40 min) Batgirl exits the scene, feminist propaganda stops and the story gets "closer" to what Batman should be about. Still an empty story more appropriate for a 2nd hand TV episode. - It suddenly stopsThe movie had no substance, like its only purpose is to brainwash kids for feminism and they squeezed in a deal where they also get half of the movie where it's not just about using the Batman franchise to push feminists agenda. First half of the movie has nothing to do with the second half. You could have watched them separately and one would be a feminist propaganda movie with poorly animations and inconsistencies using the Batman franchise and the second one just a poorly drawn Batman animation with no substance. Stitched together just to force you to watch the feminist part.And so, feminists agenda being pushed out for Hillary Clinton as president, ruins Batman.Hopefully when the political race will end, they will stop ruining movies.</fullReview>
