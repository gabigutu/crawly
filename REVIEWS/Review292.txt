		<shortDescription>Disney is getting back on the right track</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing reviews for a German movie website and thus got into a press screening of the new CG animated Disney movie "Meet the Robinsons" in Munich a little while ago. I'm a big animation fan myself and love many of the old Disney movies, although lately I've been more impressed with Pixar's films than anything Disney had to offer in the last few years. However, the story of this one is actually quite interesting and not as uninspired and generic as Disney's last traditionally animated feature Home on the Range or as messy as their first CG outing Chicken Little. It offers a number of nice surprises and even a good plot twist or two without causing too much of the old time-traveling headache. The humor also works quite well, although many of the jokes seem to be aimed at adults and little kids might not get all of them. (Didn't bother me, though?) Most importantly, this film does not contain a single fart joke nor any talking animals or even animal sidekicks (except for those singing frogs you might have seen in the trailers, but they're really not the same thing). I don't know how close this adaptation is to William Joyce's novel "A Day With Wilbur Robinson", as I've never read anything Joyce has written, but it all works pretty well and manages to be an exiting and entertaining family adventure movie.One aspect of the movie that works particularly well is the design. The buildings, machines and landscapes of the future really look totally cool and have a very own look that is inspired by Joyce's illustrations and various visions of the future from the 50ies and 60ies. They're beautifully rendered, too. Furthermore, the animation is pretty awesome. The movements of the quirky characters are very fast but funny and cleverly stylized. The best example for this is the Bowler Hat Guy who moves in a unique style that makes him look like a giant Spider. This really is a welcome change from the hyper-realistic motion capturing stuff we've been seeing in a lot of movies lately. The character design isn't so bad either. However, the humans don't look quite as good as the ones in The Incredibles, the stylization of some characters makes them look a little too artificial for my taste. The voice-acting, which relies on solid voice actors and luckily doesn't involve any fancy stunt casting, leaves nothing to be desired. Danny Elfman's score is pretty fine, too. I could have done without the cheesy pop songs that were played at some parts of the film, though.Altogether, I highly recommend seeing this warmhearted family film to any animation fan. It might not be as good as my Pixar favorites The Incredibles and Finding Nemo, but it sure is a lot better than most of the other studios' wisecracking-and-farting-animal flicks. With Pixar's John Lasseter pulling the strings at Disney's animation unit now, they finally seem to be getting back on the right track and I'm looking forward to their next projects, especially the traditionally animated The Frog Princess.One last thing: as some of you might have heard, Disney wants to start putting original animated shorts in front of their feature films again. Meet the Robinsons kind of makes a start by showing the old Mickey, Donald &amp; Goofy short Boat Builders in the beginning. It's a great experience to see one of those on the big screen again and the kids in the audience apparently loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney 'keeps moving forward'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline of this movie is perfect... because it describes exactly what Meet the Robinsons means for the Disney Feature Animation studios... a step forward. Disney had been on a slide in the last few years... they were beginning to make cheap comedy movies with thin characters and story lines. I am happy to report that those days are over.Now, I'm sure many are wondering just what kind of influence John Lasseter has had on this film... and I can report that it is all positive. This movie could easily have been just as pointless as Chicken Little and The Wild... it could have been another thin comedy... but it wasn't. Here we finally have somewhat of a return to Disney's old style, where they make the audience laugh but also have a deep story with real-life problems and great characters. And I am happy to report that the humor is actually made with wit! There are no fart jokes, no potty humor, and the sidekick characters don't annoy the heck out of you.The first part of this movie, where we first see Lewis and Goob growing up at the orphanage, and then Lewis is whisked away to the future, is where all of my complaints lie. The beginning is very rushed, and does not give you a chance to really get to know Lewis or his feelings before he is whisked away into the future. And once he gets there, everything remains rushed. You meet the entire Robinson family in only about two minutes, and it's slightly overwhelming to have that much thrown at you. The opening of the future part is the part of the movie where you see what it COULD have been... a comedy that did nothing for you, and tried to overwhelm you with endless one-liners from wacky characters. But then the movie turns serious, the plot begins to unwind, and pace is much better. The characters become deeper and more realistic, their motivations and personalities shine through, and the storyline becomes absolutely fantastic. By the end of the movie, you really feel like you have been on an adventure. The main character shows hope, he develops and grows quite a bit through the course of the film, and there is a very uplifting message, from Walt Disney himself, to keep moving forward.So, overall, this is great family entertainment. The animation is quite good, much better than most other studios, but I don't think it's quite as great as some critics have made it out to be... maybe because I didn't get to see the 3-D version. But for me, it was the story that made the movie. Combine the great story, witty humor, and fun animation, and you have a movie that is definitely a step in the right direction for Disney. The motto could not be better placed... keep moving forward, and keep looking for better and better films from Walt Disney Pictures in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Back to the Future" meets "The Incredibles"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere Walt Disney must be smiling. "Meet the Robinsons" is the perfect, unlikely marriage of manic, absurd humor, eye-popping visuals and honest-to-goodness emotional depth. It is a close cousin to the first "Back to the Future," yet it feels completely original at the same time. The 3-D animation works seamlessly within the story. It is not played for a cheesy gimmick (like, for example, "Spy Kids 3-D"...groan). In fact, it is so well integrated into the narrative that you could almost take it for granted, so it's a good thing that at the heart of "Meet the Robinsons" there is a wonderfully entertaining story. In typical Disney fashion the central character is a motherless (and in this case, fatherless) youth -- however this time it is not merely a device whose sole purpose is to leave him unencumbered to embark on his own adventure. In fact, his orphaned status and quest to find the mother that left him at the orphanage as a baby IS the point of his journey. But there's no room for sugary sap here, thanks to an almost unending stream of quirky characters and plot twists. Of course stories like this can't succeed without a great villain. In this case the filmmakers have managed to craft a bumbling villain who is simultaneously hilarious, sympathetic and just menacing enough to keep the tension going. He reminded me of Snidely Whiplash, Mack the Knife, and the magician from Rankin-Bass' "Frosty the Snowman," all rolled into one.This movie has all the seat-of-your-pants fun of a great amusement park ride and still manages to make you (well...me) cry at the end. The deft combination of love and laughs results in a movie that stays with you well after the lights have come up, leaving you wanting more. It is rare nowadays for and entire audience of moviegoers to spontaneously burst into applause at the end, but that's what occurred when the credits began to roll for this film. "Meet the Robinsons" is loaded with enough heart, rapid fire jokes and blink-and-you'll-miss-them sight gags to make it worth repeated viewings. We can't wait for the eventual DVD release -- hopefully in 3-D. Come to think of it, we REALLY can't wait, so we're going to see it again on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was pleasantly surprised at how much a 50's something mom of a teenager liked this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the theater this afternoon to catch an R-rated film and goofed on the times. The only movie available in my time frame allowed was Meet the Robinsons. I reluctantly bought a ticket and was pleasantly rewarded with a movie experience that reminded me very much of my childhood. When we got to go to the movies in the 50's and 60's, there were trailers, followed by the newsreel and then a cartoon before the main attraction. The non-three D version started with non-R rated trailers, followed by a Mickey Mouse cartoon (loved it!) and then the main feature. It was very entertaining to sit back and relax and not worry about the good guys dying, the amount of slaughter that would be portrayed, or that there wouldn't be a positive message at the end. As an adult, there were enough references to keep me entertained and from the sounds of the kids in the theater, they were obviously enjoying this movie. I would highly recommend it to all but the crankiest movie-goers, and I personally loved the quote from Uncle Walt at the end of the movie. When I was little, our whole family watched Walt Disney every Sunday and I particularly remember when it changed to Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Walt Disney was a man ahead of his time and I really miss his adventurous spirit and inquisitive mind. He introduced and ended each episode and I really enjoyed seeing him every week. I wish that Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color was still on every week and that new episodes would still be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring the Uninspired....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outside of the beautiful faces that I helped to create and another that made an honest man of me...I truly loathe most everything that passes as...anything, truly. I took two of my sons and a young friend of theirs to see Meet The Robinsons, today. Having never wanted to shout anything from a mountain top - let me just offer up a piece of advice for anyone looking for something uplifting, inspirational - heartbreaking but re-affirming...you must see this movie. I'm a braveheart guy, I love goodfellas and Will Ferrell movies - I'm an idiot; but I can't imagine hearing more beautiful words come out of my sons mouth than when we left the theatre and hearing him say "that movie made me feel good about myself". Poetry - from the mouth and mind of someone who doesn't know any better - or any worse. The movie is about - and this isn't a spoiler - family and caring for someone other than yourself. It isn't standard Disney stuff - even though that sounds EXACTLY like standard Disney. I'm running out space and I'm not completely making the most sense which is exactly how I feel at 37 anyway....Do me a favor, do your drive to work tomorrow morning a favor...go see this movie. Take an extra second in the morning to smell your kids, kiss your spouse and lay off your horn...it's nice every once in a while to leave something...inspired, and feeling "really good about yourself" - even for just a second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but a little frightening for very young children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was a little "ify" about taking my 5 and 2 year old daughter's to this movie. Actually was concerned that it may not hold their attention. Based on some reviews, I honestly didn't think I would care for it.Being a huge fan of Disney's work, but seeing their young target audience erode to the digital-only studios, I was hoping they'd come back to strong story lines.Well, Meet the Robinsons was a surprise to me. Had a great story line, extremely visually appealing, awesome voicing (I do professional voice work so have a different appreciation for this), and an all-round great movie.The only negative thing I must say (without spoiling the movie) is that when it came down to the part of the movie where it changes and you see much more of the hat in the future (again, don't worry.. no spoiler in this info) both of my daughters were pretty frightened and jumped to my lap. The visuals and content during this part of the movie really took on a different edge (color/music changes, etc.) As far as making it to frightening, I would hate in retrospect to see it changed to be a little more "small kid friendly". I would say that it might be a much better movie for children over 7 or 8 to see. I have to say again that as an adult, I thought it was really great.One of the features of this movie I thought was clearly outstanding was the musical composition (and songs) that Danny Elfman (Nightmare, Corpse Bride, Simpsons, and a million other compositions) did. One particular song is such an awesome, up-beat, fun song that I really hope Disney puts a push behind it to give it radio airplay. (I'm also a former radio jock in Dover, Athens, Akron, Cleveland, Denver, Fort Collins, and Madrid-Spain) Certainly Elfman has written some great and memorable music ("What's This? - Nightmare Before Christmas), but I'd have to say the music in Robinsons is some of his finest.I'd sum this all up in saying that, like the Disney tradition, this is story with great writing, great music, a lesson to be learned, and fun in general. It might be a little too much for the very little kids (even Beauty &amp; The Beast or Aladdin had parts that could be frightening to very little kids though). I get (and hope) that Disney stays on the course they've moved with Robinsons. It's nice to see Disney getting back to their roots for story telling, yet moving forward (Shrek-like) with their animation and modern feel.On a side-note: Ironically, the new opening cartoon (Mikey, Donald &amp; Goofy build a boat cartoon) was made to feel very old by Disney. Audio was clearly intentionally "warbled" (for old-time 1920's/1930's affect). It was shot in 4x4 ration (not TV's 4x3 or Cinemascope) And drawn images were full of dirt-type flaws (specs that were on their drawings and not on the lens of the camera or projector and they "jumped" throughout the short cartoon). Very tradition cartoon which traces back to the Walt Disney roots. Wondered if it hadn't been placed to really show the contrast of the original Disney and the new Disney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An eccentric, witty, inspirational and charming outing with the family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Robinsons is a one weird family. It takes time to know them, and once you do, you will like them.They come from the future, filled with colourful buildings, flying jets, travelling tubes that would remind you of the Jetsons. Everyone is strange in their own way, from Frannie who conducts frog band, Grandpa who wears his clothes backward and twins Dimitri and Spike who stay in flower pots. Plus a talking robot like C-3PO.In Back to the Future style, 13th year old Wilbur Robinson brings a smart nerd Lewis to 2037 to recover his invention. Are you lost yet? Now, all these eccentric characters and story can be quite hard to understand. Everything happens so fast, so don't lose your attention.Once you get past the initial stage, everything falls nicely into place like a jigsaw in this intricate story. Although there isn't one main character who will appeal to you like The Incredibles, the whole Robinsons family will charm you the same.Some critics may say: Too many characters. Too much dialogue. Too confusing. Too many things happening at the same time. Indeed, there were points where young children may go "huh?". Nevertheless, the singing frogs, big-headed dinosaur, colourful setting and music from Danny Elfman makes it all quite likable.With a strong "keep moving forward" educational message and a touching ending, this animation is recommended to families who will continue to enjoy this work from Disney.(As a bonus, audience will also be brought back in time with a nostalgic cartoon featuring Mickey, Donald and Goofy)http://themovieclub.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All round feel-good family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advance screening of 'Meet The Robinsons' today with the family and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. After getting a bit sick of recent CGI animal flicks (with the possible exception of Flushed Away), this was a refreshing change.An intriguing storyline revolves around orphan Lewis who, as a 12-year old, is an up-and-coming inventor, and dreams of building a time machine to find out who his mother was. He meets a mysterious boy Wilbur Robinson who tries to save him from the equally mysterious man with the bowler hat. We are then drawn into a time travel story that, while having as many paradoxes as Back To The Future, ends with some interesting plot twists.We saw the movie in 3D - and while there were a few "especially for 3D" visual effects, such as flying food - the 3D was not overdone and did not detract from the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Meet the Robinsons" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. Clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. Loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.Love the music. Gorgeous "Little Wonders" by the fantastic Rob Thomas played at the end coordinated with the story ending - beautifully done. And the phenomenal Jamie Cullum doing 2 great songs for Frankie the Frog - 2 bouncy songs, done to perfection by a great artist. Enjoyed Rufus Wainwright's songs - fit in well with the story. And, Danny Elfman's score is wonderful. So, I also highly recommend the soundtrack!!! I really do not have enough superlatives for this movie. It could be my favorite Disney film, (and I've seen them all). I definitely plan on seeing it again in 3-D. But, even in 2-D, it is not to be missed!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Turn Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A heartwarming story with eye-popping 3D special effects. If you have the option of seeing this in 3D, you should opt for it. The story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3D is a rare instance in this day &amp; age, you should go that route. This movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big A-list names like the Dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles. I prefer the subtlety of casting for quality versus stunt casting, and this movie delivered. You can tell that John Lasseter played an important role in this movie - "Cars" delivered the message that the journey is more important than the destination and "Meet the Robinsons" delivers a message about not living in the past...keep moving forward. John Lasseter should be commended for helping lift Disney features back to their glory days. I will be the first to admit that they are not there yet, but with his help and movies that focus on the story &amp; the characters like "Meet the Robinsons", we won't have long to wait...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Funny, Cute, Touching and Overall Very Entertaining Disney Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For much of this film, even though I was being entertained by it, I thought it was geared mostly for kids.....and that's fine. That's what I always thought the target audience was in animated films. I just got spoiled with so many good ones in the last few years that also had a lot of funny material that adults enjoyed, too. Films like "Cars," "Madagascar," "Barnyard." "Chicken Little," "The Polar Express," and so forth. Well, in the end, I have nothing but praise for this film, too, because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age. This simply turned out to be - at least for me as an adult - a really nice film with a heartfelt message of friendship, family and a sense of belonging. At the same time, it still had enough jokes, charm and colorful animation to make it interesting all the way.The film goes from so-so kid stuff to very good as soon as our hero "Lewis" and his new friend "Wilbur" go into the latter's world: the future. The most amusing segments of the film revolve around the Robinson family, an eccentric but extremely loving group. That family makes this film tick and, hopefully, we'll see more of them in some future feature-length film. These guys - The Robinsons - are just too entertaining to have their movie "careers" end with only this one film. The story brings out a very thought-provoking theme to ponder. How would you react if, as a 12-year-old boy, you could meet yourself as an adult perhaps 25 years later....and vice-versa? How incredibly strange that would be? Or to see yourself face-to-face as a small baby?This movie really digs into deep territory in the last third, which is why, as an adult, I found it getting better and better right to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started out with some semblance of a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain engaged with this film. This movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio. Clearly there are morale and motivation problems at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control. That management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins my very short "worst movies of all time" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now for the truth, its very very weak storyline - for a Walt Disney film its total rubbish. When the robinson appear, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor it was. It like "alice in wonderland" gone wrong!. It feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they don't. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending, you just want the film to finish. Its a film to forget, and forget quickly. If you've got some spare time, don't waste it on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about Disney's very future.A while back I wrote comments for Disney's first post-Pixar film, "Chicken Little." My thoughts at the time were that Disney was at surrender stage, and that they had inserted explicit commentary to that fact in the film itself.Disney and Pixar have since reconciled, and the first fruits of the patched-up partnership are obvious here, complete with the same type of self-referential embedded commentary as in "Chicken." When the two companies parted ways, Disney was lost. As helpless as an infant left on an orphanage's front step. So this story goes, of an abandoned child. An extremely gifted and inventive wreck of a child in search of guidance and nurture.Disney went back to the drawing board here. The first task: get back that magic they once possessed, monopolized even. So our hero seeks to invent a machine to help him obtain forgotten memories. (Highlighted by an old Mickey short which ran before the film began.)The bulk of the film is an exploration into what the future may hold, and an admittance is made that said future is wholly dependent on family (Pixar).Think I'm reading too much into this? Check out how the movie is bookended: At the beginning Disney unveils its brand new (and very impressive) logo. The end is a direct quote from Walt Disney himself about the future of Disney and the importance of moving forward.</fullReview>

In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out.Not to say that the film isn't an interesting concept, it's just told so oddly, (bad screenplay?) especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know we're supposed to get the impression that the family is wacky but good lord, they could've shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (seemingly, I didn't actually time it). By that point I was scratching my head looking for an exit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, maybe the summary says it all. I don't understand why so many people seem to like this movie. The biggest problem for me is the story/screenplay itself and the characters. It all doesn't feel lived through. I just see a bunch of superficial, stereotypical characters, trying to overcome clichéd, uninspired obstacles. starting with a bad story, screenplay it's obvious that you can't have good characters/acting. If you want to see the exact opposite of this movie, go watch the Iron giant, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Wall-E, ...The bowler hat guy is probably the most uncharismatic, uninspired, superficial character i've ever seen in an animation movie. The acting, the gags, it all feels really lame, probably because of the story. You can't have good acting, characters if the story's bad. It's something that I think works both ways. Anton Ego (ratatouille), now that's a well fleshed out characters. The way he moves, talks, looks, acts, it all feels right. Just as the chef, skinner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute and fun for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a little over a week ago and I thought it was a pretty cute Disney film about the future of tomorrow. Meet the Robbinsons is one of those animated films where it has humor for the adults and the kids that works well and really clicked, not to mention the animation looked fantastic. While it's still not the best animated film this year, I would agree that it's in the top and wouldn't be surprised if it does get an Oscar nod for best animated film. It really was that good, I was kinda surprised by the average rating on IMDb, I thought the users would get a kick out of this film, but you can't win them all.Lewis is a young genius who has been adopted and cared for by a wonderful family, but he desperately wants to know who his real mother is and find out where she is, so he can find out if she really did want to give him up. But that is put on hold when he makes a brilliant invention, and someone is after it, but he is quickly saved by another boy, Wilber, and he is taken to the future where his invention has been put to great use. But since Wilber wasn't supposed to take Lewis to the future, he lies to his family that Lewis is a friend visiting, but Lewis discovers how wonderful it is to be with this family and wishes to stay. But he may have certain problems when the Bowler Hat Guy desperately wants to get his hands on his invention to get all the credit and money.Meet the Robbinsons is a definite recommendation that I'm sure you'll get a good kick out of. It has great humor, a fun story, and fantastic animation, it's a blast for the whole family, or even for an afternoon with the friends. 2007 over all has been a pretty good start for films, let's hope the great animated flicks keep coming! 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, fast paced, positive movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film on 25th of March with the 3D glasses in an advanced screening here in Australia. This film is extremely colorful and will send a powerful message to kids (keep moving forward). Im 21 years old and i wouldn't say there is much in this for adults, there is the odd joke here and there but it isn't the sort of "shrek", "toy story" movie where it is for everyone.The story follows a young boy (Lewis) who is left at an orphanage practically from birth. He grows up with a passion to invent things. Day in and out he fails and never gets adopted but never gives up. As the movie goes on we find his main dream is to invent a time machine to find out who is mother was. At a science fair when he finally gets an invention to work (that shows what you are thinking on a TV in a particular period of time) a young boy, Wilbur, shows up and insists he is from the future and to watch out for "Bowler Hat Guy". Anyway this Bowler Hat Guy destroys Lewis' invention before he has a chance to show anyone and from there Wilbur gets Lewis to travel to the future with him, closely followed by the "Bowler Hat Guy" and the movie then takes a turning point.CGI (Animation) - This is hard to judge here as i viewed the entire movie in 3D glasses, which i haven't done before, however the animation was very similar to that of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and was decent but not really anything new or groundbreaking. Definitely not up to Pixar's high standards.A lot of the jokes in this movie felt as if they were trying to be funny rather then funny but the Dinosaur (i'm sure most of you have seen him in the trailer) and the "Bowler Hat Guy" really steal the show. The "Bowler Hat Guy" was quite dimwitted and really clueless yet still remained the ultimate bad guy. He reminded me of doctor octopus from Spiderman in that he is controlled by another object (in this case a flying hat) The title suggests that you will get to know this entire 'whacky' family from the future but you really only get to know Wilbur and never any of the other characters at all as we don't meet them until half way in the film (we get a 2 minute quick introduction which is fun but never goes anywhere else).Overall this was a good movie for kids but i don't think it will appeal to anyone over 20-25 like other CGI movies. It was quite fast paced, excellent animation and an admirable main character but as mentioned above it doesn't really get anywhere, the plot does buildup rather well but never really takes off. Still a pretty good, colorful movie for kids with a decent story and a positive message behind it. Other than that there isn't much new here but still a lot of fun to be had in its own right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Take a good look around, boys. Because your future is about to change."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, I've come to the conclusion that, as far as American studios are concerned, Pixar is the only one producing great CGI-animated films. However, its always a delight to be proved wrong, and I am surprised to find that 'Meet the Robinsons (2007)' is a truly terrific science-fiction children's film, one that exceeded all my expectations. Produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, with John Lasseter as one of the executive producers {so it's not so far from Pixar, after all!}, the film is my most unexpected favourite of 2007, boasting a fresh and intelligent screenplay, as well as impressive 3D visuals. Though the film deals with time travel, a rather sophisticated concept in itself, director Stephen J. Anderson ensures that the plot is straightforward to follow, approaching the notion of paradoxes in a manner than is easy for children to understand without being exasperating for adults. In addition to a terrific script {which is credited to about seven screenwriters}, 'Meet the Robinsons' also has a motivational maxim from which we can all take something: "keep moving forward!"Young Lewis (voiced by both Daniel Hansen and Jordan Fry), a twelve-year-old living at an orphanage, desires nothing more than to find a family who loves him. Though he is undoubtedly brilliant, Lewis' elaborate inventions have the peculiar habit of blowing up, and these unfortunate mishaps have thwarted his repeated attempts at charming any potential adoptive parents. While he works on a new invention, a device that will allow him to track down his natural mother, Lewis is confronted by a mysterious young stranger from the future, Wilbur Robinson (Wesley Singerman), who warns that a sinister "Bowler Hat Guy" (Stephen J. Anderson) has stolen a time-travel machine and is attempting to destroy Lewis' future. Whisking him off in a time-travel machine of his own, Wilbur brings Lewis to the year 2037, occupied by the most ridiculous family of eccentrics that you're ever likely to see. Nevertheless, this unconventional gathering of quirky relatives represents the close-knit household for which Lewis yearns, and his experiences with the Robinsons inspire him to make the most of his future.Perhaps it's my love for any film dealing with time-travel, but I genuinely found 'Meet the Robinsons' to be exceedingly charming, exciting and, above all, stupendously entertaining. Though a few moments toe the line of respectability {I didn't care for the dinner food-fight that transformed into an epic anime battle, complete with shoddy dialogue dubbing}, the film carries enough emotional heart to leave you thoroughly satisfied by the time the end credits begin to roll. In addition to a twisting, time-bending plot, you'll also be able to witness an ensemble of jazz-singing Mafia frogs {an amusing nod to Chuck Jones' 'One Froggy Evening (1955)}, an unbelievably dim-witted antagonist, and a dystopian version of the future ruled by malevolent mechanical hats {I actually found this segment to be rather disconcerting}. Most memorable of all is the Robinson family's reaction to Lewis' latest inventing failure, when his peanut butter and jelly dispenser spews its ingredients all over the dinner table. Rather than the cold reception that I had expected, the entire household bursts into enthusiastic applause, his attempt alone being more than worthy of their encouragement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Animated Adventure That Kids and Parents Can Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last year I saw some animated monstrosity at a drive-in theater. It was completely insipid, unfunny and dull. If anyone liked it had to be a kid and a kid who scarfs down paint chips. Throw in the voice of Ray Ramano and you will know why I was cringing in the backseat until the the movie's complete awfulness compelled me to leave. The only other time I left a drive-in theater was when a tornado was in the area.Meet the Robinsons was the exact opposite of the above. It was funny. Kids and adults can enjoy this story. It poses some interesting conflicts and doesn't skirt the consequences. Letting go a lugubrious past for a brighter tomorrow is the best way to move forward. I'll be recommending this at work on Monday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing allegory for progressivism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As WDAS's second all-CGI film, Meet the Robinsons mainly gets off from its messages, but like some of the more influential Disney films (*cough* Zootopia *cough*), it offers quite a bit of substance to go with it. While I will say the writing does get confusing at times and doesn't take full advantage of all of its ideas (including some plot points that I swear I've seen before), what was done right is dazzling for a sci-fi film, including its progressive message of "Keep Moving Forward" and discouraging blame from others so that one can take responsibility for themselves (hmm, seems like something going on right now, doesn't it?). Many of the characters who are important (there are a few more comic reliefs than I am comfortable with) set good examples for children and show the negatives of pessimism and not accepting one's faults. It is depicted through solid animation that is undoubtedly a step in the right direction for WDAS after Chicken Little, giving some nice effects and helping the cartoony action be engaging. It all goes to show that after the horrid years of 2005 and 2006 for animation, 2007 ended up being a revival, and in my eyes, this quickly became a front-runner. While its ideas will surely repel some people, I can recommend this to just about anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good ideas, but a messy execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Lewis is an orphan and a child genius, who nevertheless struggles with everyday life, especially with the prospect of getting adopted. Not helping the matters is that none of his inventions have worked so far. But then one day he meets young Wilbur Robinson, who whisks him away on an adventure unlike anything he has ever experienced before.It's the 47th Walt Disney Animation Studios feature film and only their second fully CGI-animated one. And it definitely shows. It's not as bad as Chicken Little, but the textures and the character models have definitely aged less than gracefully, though it has some neat background designs and colours. But, that could be forgiven if the story was good and captivating. It's not. Though, to be fair, neither is it offensively bad and the message of determination and endurance is a good one, but the fact remains that the characters are not built well enough for you to care about them. Plus, there are way too many of them. The eponymous Robinsons family is huge and we get introduced to each and every one of them. Only for the film to do nothing with them. Absolutely nothing. Wilbur is pretty much the only one of them to have any personality or character development beyond the initial quirk.Now, that being said, there is one good character in this film. The villain. The Bowler Hat Guy is a lot of fun. Not the most menacing or diabolical of villains, but he's a breath of fresh air, being both a coward and a total moron. Everything he does in this movie, starting from the way he looks, is hilarious.The bare bones of a good film are here. The late 00s CGI animation lent itself well towards futuristic and colourful designs, the message is a good one and the villain is certainly a lot of fun. Unfortunately, they crammed too much in, didn't let the story breathe and in the end ended up with a product that's certainly not worthy of the legacy of the studio, the name of which was once synonymous with magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Christmas coming up I started searching round for an animated DVD that a friend could enjoy watching over the X-Mas season.Going to a local fate,I spotted a table with a DVD of what looked like an overlooked Disney title,which led to me getting ready to meet the Robinsons.The plot:Left on the footsteps of an orphanage in a box by his mum,Lewis spends his life wondering about who his mum is.Being turned down (along with his roommate Michael "Goob" Yagoobian) by every potential parent,Lewis decides to invent a machine which can open up his memories,so that he can remember what his mum looked like.Building the device,Lewis decides to take it to a science fare being held the school.Just before Lewis starts the machine up,a strange man appears from out of the shadows and tampers with it. Disappointed about his machine not working,Lewis discovers all that has taken place when he meets Wilbur Robinson,who tells Lewis that he is from the future,and has come in a time machine due to needing Lewis help to stop the strange man.View on the film:Caught up in production troubles which led to it being changed from a planned live action flick into an animated movie,and 60% of the story being re-written just 10 months before it was to hit screens,co-writer/(along with Jon Bernstein/Michelle Bochner Spitz/Don Hall/Nathan Greno/Aurian Redson &amp; Joseph Mateo) voice actor/director Stephen J. Anderson spins a bright,bold Sci-Fi Drama,which along with offering a shining glimpse of the future,also features consistent visual themes which keep the behind the scenes issues hidden from view.Opening up the darkest moments in Lewis past with stylish black and white flashbacks,Anderson unleashes the Sci- Fi set-pieces with a gleeful mood,as dazzling primary colour hues of greens,whites and purples are splatted around the solid block designed characters,as Lewis finds himself beginning to think about everything he has in the present.Lobbying to work on the title due to having been adopted himself,Anderson (who also gives a splendid performance as the boo- hiss baddie) impressively makes sure that his voice is heard loud and clear over the backstage issues.Keeping secrets hidden from view,the writers deliver superbly handled surprises across the time travelling twists,which along with cleverly offering up an entirely different view of the "baddie",also gradually wraps a sweet sense of optimism around Lewis,as Lewis gets lost in space with the Robinsons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the last two not-so-good entries in the Disney Animated Classics line-up (Home on the Range and Chicken Little), I wasn't enthusiastic about Meet the Robinsons. However, after watching it, I was pleasantly surprised! It's an interesting story about a young orphaned boy named Lewis, who is an inspiring inventor and meets a mysterious stranger named Wilbur Robinson. He takes Lewis to the future and together they team up to track down the nefarious Bowler Hat Guy, who wants to change the past.Sure, this movie has another sci-fi themed plot. However, what results is more than just cliché sci-fi action. There is actually heart to the movie and well-developed characters, from Lewis yearning to find his birth mother to Wilbur encouraging him to move on and believe in himself to help him save the future. Each member of the Robinson family is eccentric and lovable and the other supporting characters have their own charm - all delivering drama and humor to the film. This film also has plenty of twist and turns and unsuspecting moments, which gives the story some suspense and intriguing moments, and also sends messages about the importance of family, fate and letting go &amp; moving forward.The CGI animation is colorful and detailed (I especially liked the city outline) and the direction is well-paced. The inscription at the end of the movie by Walt Disney is touching, giving this film a spark of that special "Disney touch." The movie is a little too heavy on the sci-fi elements, but overall, it's one of the better Disney animated films from the 2000s.Grade B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie, excellent animation and all other technical factors. But hey, the script wasn't so great; the true is it was a little cliché and it seems to be took from another thousands of animated movies (And some not animated ones too), that's why sometimes during the movie I thought I was seeing something I already saw before; But I must say that even with those (Insignificant or Significant) defects I enjoyed it a lot; It's one of those movies that took me to past (to my childhood), it has that element of adventure and enveloping effects, together they can result into one of the best audiovisual experiences. Anyway, I felt relaxed and carefree, something different from my daily routine. I hope you'll enjoy it, watch it with your family and friends, it's good, it's high quality, a wholesome movie and especially it's from Disney (I don't know if that's a good reference or a bad one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future is a fantastic place most especially when it is your own and when you are a pretty well-adjusted person. This particular future is even more fantastic in that it allows movement from it back into the past; a fluidity that is made believable by the abilities of the young inventor.What is difficult to believe is the lack of interest by prospective parents in an apparently precocious child who builds a new invention for every interview; all of which inevitable fail catastrophically. There seems to be an unintended motif of adult negligence towards the support of young persons interests and passions.... Fortunately, our hero is brought to a future wherein passions of the human sort are celebrated. The rub is that this world is entirely of his own creation.Solipsism aside, Meet the Robinsons is a fun flick for the full family. The plot line wends its way through layers of time and personality with plenty of fun moments allowing for laughter and discussion; the former uncontained and the latter a matter of choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meet the Robinson's was my favorite movie when I was younger and it was so inspiring. This movie contains comedy that made me fall of my couch and that I remember profoundly to this day. There are several funny creatures and situations that amuse me often. The thought of going into the future is very interesting and I think it attracts many young children to watch. I think the message of the movie is actually very strong as it shows how family comes first and could inspire children to engage i technology through the approach of the science fair. The way that the movie starts, with an orphan who becomes successful beside the fact he has a hard life gives kids a different perspective on how to be whatever you want no matter what. This movie is liked by several children and I believe it's a perfect combination of comedy and life lessons (obviously not tangible ones, but morally) that any family would enjoy watching!</fullReview>

If you're expecting something as good as The Incredibles or Up then you won't get it.It strikes me as a good movie for kids. There's a lot of running around and a focus on the sort of antic humor that seems to appeal more to kids than adults. It's a very broad sort of humor. Had I seen this movie when I was ten, I think I probably would have enjoyed it a great deal. But for an adult, I wouldn't say this is a great choice.

		<shortDescription>These small hours still remain in my heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is no Frozen, but I can certainly say that I really liked it for its message. A couple of years after the disappointing "Chicken Little," Disney tried their hand again at a CGI motion picture. This time it's about science. Lewis (Jordan Fry), an brilliant yet insecure inventor, is on a quest to find his family. He was abandoned as an infant but he believes that was only because his mother wasn't ready, and she may be ready now. He strives to create something that will help search his deepest memories for her. Meanwhile, a mysterious yet immature villain (Steve Anderson) with a robotic bowler hat is trying to take credit for his invention in an act of revenge against him. A teenager from the future, known as Wilbur Robinson (Wesley Singerman), takes him to the future to help him keep moving forward, a philosophy founded by his father, Cornelius (Tom Selleck). The animation isn't very detailed, but I do like the wide variety of unique characters. And the future setting is really cool. The design is indeed futuristic. It's strange but interesting to see so much change in only a couple of decades. You'll know what I'm talking about by the time this movie ends. Each voice matches the characters quite well, and put really noticeable effort into their intriguing, clever and sometimes funny dialogue. I particularly like the Bowler Hat Guy's performance. It is interesting that Jim Carey was asked to perform as him, but I'm thankful for the performance Steve Anderson gave us. You can really feel the emotion in each scene. There are some aspects of the story I like and some aspects that threw me off a bit. The music and sound are great; they match the scene very well. I'm not a fan of the Jonas Brothers, but they're only heard in the credits, so I won't complain about them being involved in this. But the song at the ending scene is "Little Wonders/These Small Hours" and I love it. Finally, the message. Its rare nowadays that such a motivating message can be found in movies. That message is "Keep moving forward." No matter what you do, don't let circumstances bring you down. As long as you never give up, anything can be possible. I recommend that you watch it from start to finish. It provides you with some laughs, beautiful music, a riveting yet slightly flawed story and a fantastic motivating message. You don't need to be a scientist to get enjoyment out of this. 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is actually a very creative and wonderful idea for a show. Pretty much, it's about a kid trying to find a place where he belongs, but keeps getting told he doesn't until going back in time. It pretty much is full of characters but very little actually make a difference in the story line.Wilbur is interesting, almost a opposite of Lewis in some smarts and how easy he is to act a bit crazy? alright, so maybe not opposite. I wish they had talked more about the family characters since they seem really interesting. The Bowler hat guy is rather odd although he was well put together in his reasoning for doing what he does and without Doris, he wouldn't be able to do anything.The animation is perfect and the comedy is so funny! I can't believe some of the funny games that they do. Character designs make them all stand out even if they don't have much of a presence. It is very well done in the textures and modeling although most things look like they were done with nurbs instead of polys. For those that don't know animation, that's when everything has soft edges and look like its squishy all the time. (Ya, I know that makes little sense but just go with it, I'm a 3D artist?) The voices are actually really well done and perfect for what its worth, yet I don't really have anything to compare it to like anime shows. Unfortunately, when its good like this, there really isn't much that I can pick out that isn't good. It just pretty good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young Lewis, the struggling scientist attempts to create his own memory scanner, in order to draw out the long-forgotten memories of the mother he no longer remembers. Now living in a state-run orphanage, Lewis begins the progress and after many attempts, fails his creation. Suddenly Wilbur, an odd boy who claims he's from the future whisks him up, and they journey to the forthcoming dimension. Once there, Lewis meets Wilbur eccentric and dysfunctional family, who attempt to make him release his true potential.I love this film to this day. I am not always the most objective viewer, I tend to see things from a child's perspective, and instead I miss any "goofs" that others will later inform me of. However, the best quality this film has to offer is it's sense of humor, it's so rich and vibrant yet quirky. While it does not feature a performance like David Spade's in The Emperor New Groove, its unparalleled in the sense that it's just all-out goofy. This sense of humor may not appeal to the (adult) masses, it does to children, and anyone who is a child at heart. Another wonderful element is the morals of working towards goals and dreams even when you the odds are against you. To me, it always felt kind of like Back to the Future meets Tomorrowland in a shockingly interesting way. The creative elements used to engineer this future world are magical and I myself wouldn't mind taken a trip there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Be still my beating heart...this movie is one of my all time favorites, and it breaks my heart that it seemed to skip the Disney mega-hits list. I guarantee that is because it was not voiced by an all star cast, which is more than half the reason why any animated movies get attention these days. However, I thought the cast they did get for this movie was perfect. All voices matched their characters and all of them were excellent. This movie is about an orphan named Louis who is a huge lover of science and inventions. He tries to win over prospective adopters by showing off his inventions to them, and it usually backfires on him. He takes a memory scanner invention to a science fair and a kid with black hair named Wilbur shows up in a time machine and whisks him away to the future because of a crisis. He asks Louis to try and replicate the time machine due to a villain stealing one of the two, all the while trying to hide Louis from the sight of his eccentric family, in which he totally fails. There is a huge plot twist at the end, some moments of roaring laughter, and a sob fest at the very end. The part that gets me crying every single time though, is the quote from Disney along with the song "Little Wonders". I am a sobbing mess for that part. I don't know how anyone couldn't love this movie and I wish it had been promoted more to gain a greater audience.</fullReview>

But Wilbur takes Lewis to the future, where Wilbur's family could be the adoptive family Lewis has always wanted. If only it wasn't for Lewis' hair...I love time travel stories. This is a simple one, but it still has a lot of nice touches - the story is very pleasing. There is sentiment, but not to the extent that it is sickly.

		<fullReview>I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Meet the Robinsons. For me this was a decade where animated films were very hit and miss, and while no masterpiece Meet the Robinsons had something that made it memorable and watchable. I do agree the pacing does get a little too hectic, and the villain was a little too stereotyped for my liking, while there are some parts where it wasn't as interesting. That said, visually and technically it is a marvel, with the character designs good and the colours and backgrounds even better. The soundtrack was a great touch too, and while not exactly original the story isn't too predictable, too derivative or too saccharine. Instead it is fun, while the writing is funny and smart while surprisingly complex too. And the voice acting is top notch from all involved. Overall, not an animated classic but nothing to bury either. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Good visuals, except story needs to be as even as the visuals. I know this was a kids movie, except I think kids deserve better movies than this one.The good thing about it, it was the first Disney Animation film to have the Disney Animation logo which was added in 2007 to separate it's films from Pixar's.The bad thing about it, the characters that were cool hardly had any screen time compared to the characters that were lame and uninteresting. Plus the Bowler Hat Guy was just a stereotype villain that's already been accomplished decades ago. And we live in an era where villains can be evil without a mustache or black clothes.In conclusion it's something that kids can enjoy. But it's also something adults will turn their noses away from. If the Disney company intends to make more animated movies, then they need to do a better job than this one. Cause this looks like a B-Movie compared to Pixar's films.It would of done better if it was done by Pixar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful futuristic Disney fun with quick humor and faster plot twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pixar, headed by John Lasseter, has slowly been reviving Walt Disney Feature Animation back to its quality days of the early 90s, when Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Lion King, and others rocked the box office and captured the hearts of audiences everywhere. One of the first collaborations of Disney Animation receiving the Pixar touch is Meet the Robinsons. Of course, while Pixar's films are far superior, Meet the Robinsons is a very hyper, friendly, and eccentric film that will entertain the family without ever being offensive. While the pacing and plot twists might be a bit much for younger kids to swallow, the message and humor make up for it.The film follows 12-year-old orphan Lewis desperately trying to find a family to fulfill his desire for a family that would care about him. At the same time however, he scares off potential parents with his plethora of ideas and inventions. One of his inventions however begins to draw people from the future, leading to a crazy ride of a story that takes you through different timelines and dozens of unique encounters with a family from the future that despite the craziness seems to enjoy Lewis' company. This movie awkwardly (and to an extent successfully) combines very fast-paced humor with deep story lines and a massive assortment of characters that will leave you entertained but then forgetful as to whom is named whom. That's what happens when you have half a dozen writers working on the screenplay.The writing in Meet the Robinsons is its main strength and its main weakness. Its fast-paced humor (that sometimes occurs out of nowhere---try to explain the martial arts sequence at the dinner table please) hits more than misses, and really keeps the movie fresh and engaging. Yet, there is very little character development, resulting in the main hero and main villain as the only dimensional characters in the movie. The rest of the cast is just like the humor; hit and miss. The frogs were rather annoying and unfunny, but the uncles in front of the door were hilarious and much underused.Animation is a strong point in the movie, despite not matching to Pixar standards. The art style of the future has a retro feel; exactly like Tomorrowland in Disneyland and Disney World (we can even see Space Mountain for a brief moment). The rest of the movie is quite colorful and animated with plenty of energy and pizazz. Unfortunately though, we didn't see enough of the future, as the focus is purely on the family and its antics. One would have hoped to see more of Walt Disney's 50s and 60s visions of the community of tomorrow that he expressed so dearly in Disneyland and eventually in Epcot.One of the most interesting aspects of Meet the Robinsons is its uncanny amount of plot twists and sudden revelations; especially towards the third act. While some of it can be predicted (the more movies you see, the quicker you can catch details) the usual audience will be quite thrilled at the inability to predict how the bumpy ride of a movie is going to end. But one can't help but feel sorry for the kids?who would be utterly lost in the third act by the time changes that run rampant. Then the fast pacing doesn't help the kids at all. At least they have some wonderful music to listen to while being lost, courtesy of Danny Elfman.Bottom Line: Meet the Robinsons is one of the deeper rated-G films seen in recent times. Basically Meet the Robinsons is the inferior yet happier version of Wall-E; it's a children's film with deep adult values and a detailed vision of the future. The difference is, Wall-E's future looks very depressing, and we didn't see enough of Robinson's future. The zany humor is what keeps the movie afloat and the kids awake, while throwbacks to retro-future imagination and an engaging plot covering decades and different timelines will be sure to keep the parents and adults in check. After a slew of disappointing projects (Dinosaur, Atlantis, especially Chicken Little) Pixar has breathed new life into Disney animation. Maybe in the future we will see a new Disney Renaissance. In the meantime, Disney "moves forward" with a delightful family film that isn't spectacular, but will not disappoint either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good film but not flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fast-pace comedy with fine imagination and a heart-warming ending.The humor of the film may be hard to get for some for that the film is going rather frenetic, fast, and difficult to keep up from one episode to another, which may also be the reason why some find the storyline confusing and disorganized. However, overall, it has been a pleasant visual experiment at first glance for me. there are some moments worth to be rofl at.I am surprised by the rating of this film on IMDb, and for those who keep criticizing the movie so harshly, oh gosh, y cant u just let past be past and KEEP LOOKING FORWARD?8.5/10 on my entertaining scale</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disneys 'Meet the Robinsons' is a memorable departure from the amount of disappointing sequels created in this past century. It has to be known that the only modern day Disney classics have only achieved that title by being truly revolutionary for the Disney archive.Character design is a major part of this movie, not one of the characters are considered to be bland and lifeless. Their frames are very unique as 'bowler hat guy's' frame is so well constructed that he looks like he has just came from a Tim Burton movie.The plot uses the aspect of time to its advantage, carefully constructing an effective plot and gives the villain a back story, which is truly revolutionary for Disney as most of their villains are just 'naturaly evil' from its disposition.The animation is finely detailed, but keeps the Disney trade marks of bright and cheerful characters.There are hardly any pacing issues within the film and uses a bunch of interesting characters for the use of comic relief.In conclusion I believe this is what a Disney film is meant to be. Fast paced and funny for the kids, but a broad and interesting plot that will keep the adults happy. This is a perfect package for a science fiction story that the whole family can enjoy.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was totally fun and comedy. Lewis and Junior Goob was very cute. The Senior Goob was a pucca villain. The background music and songs were superb and it was melodious. When, Senior Goob goes to the Inventco and shows the Memory Scanner to the people, that scene was totally comedy and Senior Goob will be very funny in that scene. Senior Goob was a villain as well as he was very funny. The Robinson Family was good, kind and caring. Especially, the robot in that family is very cool and superb. The inventions made by Lewis was very awesome and cool. When, so many hats come chasing Lewis, that scene was superb and thrilling. When, the dinosaur comes to catch Lewis, in that scene the dinosaur was superb and cool. When, Lewis brings his Memory Scanner for the first time, that scene was funny and it was totally awesome. When, Lewis and the grandpa are searching for the garage, that scene was funny. When the frogs sing and dance, that scene was cool and it was superb. When, the Senior Goob catches a frog and operates him, that scene was totally funny. Even, Dorris was fantastic and outstanding. The world in the future was totally beautiful and colourful. The time machines are cool, superb and awesome. When, Senior Goob goes to the orphanage and searches for Lewis, that scene was also funny. When, Lewis fixes the time machine and Wilbur will be showing all the inventions, that scene was nice and superb and the background music which comes when Lewis is fixing, that music was melodious. The bushes are shaped into animals and some postures, those bushes are beautiful and superb. I should really appreciate the creators of "Meet the Robinsons".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a somewhat chaotic but enjoyable Disney CGI animation. There a nice moral in the story that makes it all the more pleasant for family viewing. The story is somewhat complicated, dealing with time travel. The title is also misleading as the Robinson family are basically a sideplot in the story. The villain is a hugely enjoyable dim-witted 'Snidely Whiplash type', but he has a formidable sidekick. The climax recalls 'It's a Wonderful Life' and becomes surprisingly scary. All things considered, this is a wonderful return to form for Disney and far superior to 'Chicken Little' and 'The Wild'.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent CG movie from Disney (and not the Pixar unit)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a time travel movie about a genius orphan and a villain (who simply goes by "Bowler Hat Man" for most of the film). The genius wants to have a family of his own or make a machine so he can go back to see the face of his biological mother--but Bowler Hat Man is more concerned with mucking everything up because....well,....an evil flying hat told him to do this! This is an agreeable little film and what you think of it is most likely dependent on your age. For younger audiences, they'll probably give it an 8--it's got plenty of kid-oriented plot and action. For adults, they'll probably be far less impressed and think that they are watching Jimmy Neutron--though an agreeable and not particularly annoying incarnation of Neutron. The problem for me is that both ideas were clearly "borrowed" from the TV show DEXTER'S LAB and having that show plus JIMMY NEUTRON plus MEET THE ROBINSONS is getting to be too much. The fact that there are three genius kid shows or movies out there is indication that this is the case of a film that is almost completely derivative. However, despite not being all that new, the CG animation is pretty good and the story has enough new stuff that it's not a total waste of time for adults, so I'll give it a 6 for the older audience--nothing great but agreeable enough so if you are suckered into watching it you won't be miserable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of like a Disney ride for kids ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's best if you try to see this movie in some sort of high resolution (like on a movie screen or in Hi-Def). The visuals are pretty amazing to watch. The action and zany dialog is almost non-stop. If you're a young kid, it doesn't get much better. If you're an adult, you'll have to give the first hour of the story some major slack (just enjoy the visuals and action and put your brain on hold); it gets better.The movie is about a genius inventor kid who yearns for his true mother since no one seems interested in adopting him. It seems he will become an important person because an evil time traveler is out to get him! Fortunately, a time-traveler kid gets him first and brings him to the future, where he meets the rest of the family: the Robinsons. The lunacy begins there as the inventor kid searches for a way to get back home.As insane as the first hour of this movie is, it does get a bit more mentally manageable when you learn more things about what's going on. Even the lunatic characters (which is just about everyone in this movie) begin to act normally after the first hour.Although this movie is clearly aimed at children, it can be fun to watch for adults who enjoy imaginative visuals. As mentioned earlier, you'll get the most from this movie if you can see it in some sort of high-resolution.</fullReview>

The story about an orphan boy dreams to have a family, in an unexpected journey to the future he meets a group of peculiar people and wants them to be his family. The cast of voices is interesting, Adam West, Tom Selleck and Angela Bassett with very good performances.

		<fullReview>At the recommendation of young Kristen, college freshman transferring to Baylor shortly, we watched "Meet The Robinsons." There is a section in the middle, where Lewis meets the characters in the Robinson family, that almost lost me, but it cleans up its story nicely and is an overall enjoyable 90 minutes.Lewis is an odd sort, intelligent and always trying to invent weird things, often to a mishap at home or school, especially if it is a science fair project. Abandoned on the steps of an orphanage as a swaddling baby, he appears headed for perpetual orphanship, as one family after another interviews him for adoption but passes.One day he meets a mysterious boy who takes him away in a time machine his dad had invented. The boy is part of the mysterious Robinson family. In scenes reminiscent to "Back to the Future Part 2", time machines chase each other in time, as the good guys try to get the best of the bad guys.MAJOR SPOILERS: The dad in the future who is the inventor and owner of a corporation is in fact Lewis as a man. He had become adopted by the strange Robonson character that we meet early in the movie, and the family he meets in the future is his own family. The strange man he was chasing was in fact his childhood friend who had become miserable after falling asleep in the outfield and missing an easy catch to lose a game. Lewis goes back to that point in his time machine, wakes up his friend so he catches the ball, and his future is re-written as a very nice one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walt Disney Animation delivers a good, dynamic show in Meet the Robinsons. As a movie, it takes time to pick itself up off the floor. A decent chunk of film is trying to put together what Bowler Hat Guy is really about, who the Robinsons are and why Wilbur's is dragging poor Lewis around, to try and fix his contraption. But the beauty of Robinsons, is when the movie puts the puzzle pieces together, makes the film all worth the wait as a wonderful story of moving ahead and doing what brings you the most happiness ensures that your kids and family will enjoy the show right to the end.Lewis is on a mission, no matter what the cost, to find his mother. And when his science project that will show her, through his memory, is complete, a 'time cop' from the future does what he can to prevent the machine from sabotage by villains whose motives become clear later on.The beauty of the Robinsons isn't just in heart and character, but the style and wit within the script. There's nothing funnier than Bowler Hat Guy's attempt at getting a frog, then a T-Rex, to kidnap Lewis. Extra credit is given in presenting a pretty terrifying post-apocalyptic world once the true villain is revealed. Meet the Robinsons takes time to pick itself up, but once the characters are established and the story comes together, you have a beautiful, very stylish film that anyone can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet the Robinsons Movie Review from MoviePulse.net</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wildly inventive with super-cool futuristic innovations and an eclectic array of exotic characters, "Meet the Robinsons" is an incredibly enjoyable family film. Presented in luxuriant Disney Digital 3D fused with quirky and stylized animation, this is breathtakingly original entertainment as only Disney can produce.Lewis was abandoned on the doorstep of an orphanage as a child and longs to be part of a family. As an exceedingly creative inventor, he constantly destroys his opportunities to be adopted due to frequent invention malfunctions. He decides to create the Memory Scanner which will aid him in jogging his few memories of his mother so he can search for her and possibly reunite. During the science fair where he plans to unleash his masterpiece, the mysterious Wilbur Robinson, a boy who claims to be from the future, tries to convince him to perfect the malfunctioning machine, while they both must dodge the evil machinations of the Bowler Hat Guy. Unwittingly whisked away to the future, Lewis meets a crazy assortment of characters that comprise the Robinson family and embarks on a time-traveling adventure of a lifetime.Meet the Robinsons scores big with its huge assortment of lovable characters, and the remarkable designs themselves. The Robinson family consists of numerous characters, many of whom receive small amounts of screen time, but make every second worth it. From Grandpa Bud, who easily has the most purely comedic sequences in which he searches for his missing teeth, to the suave family robot Carl, to Lefty, the one-eyed purple octopus butler, the family members are each very unique, funny and most importantly, well designed. The character concepts are sensational, exhibiting funny, cute and bizarre creations that hysterically make use of animation techniques such as squash and stretch. Aided by great voice actors including the talented Harland Williams and Adam West, the characters come to cartoonish life with the help of these popular comedians.Aside from the excellent animation which most recent computer animated films have excelled at, a magnificent story is what separates a decent film from a spectacular one. Disney has been a little under the standards with their last couple of releases, but has struck gold with Meet the Robinsons. The heartwarming story is destined to attract children of all ages for multiple viewings, and adults will enjoy the many eccentricities of the Robinson family. Where recent animated films have fallen short on story, yet flabbergasted with realistic environment renderings, Meet the Robinsons has an excellent blend of both that equals outstanding entertainment. The futuristic setting provides for some amazing innovations including instant buildings and bubble transportation devices. The wondrous worlds are brought to life in the film by top-notch animation and CG models.Vibrant and realistic, the movements of the characters and photorealism of the backgrounds are becoming more and more life-like. Still making use of stylized human characters, which are notably more effective than attempting photo-realistic models, Meet the Robinsons uses exaggeration and cartoon designs to bring to life the high-energy family members. The reflections, refractions and textures of the models are technically masterful and enhance the 3-dimensionality of the film. This is furthered even more by Disney Digital 3D (the film will be presented on more than 600 screens across the country in this revolutionary new digital format). Recent animated films that have made use of the format, including Chicken Little and Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, don't have quite the visual magnitude that this film displays in full 3D.Meet the Robinsons is pure entertainment for audiences of all ages. While recent animated films have failed to intrigue with a solid storyline, character designs, or animation, Meet the Robinsons has successfully fused the best aspects of each into a surprisingly captivating film. The recent trend here at MoviePulse has been to rate animated films somewhat higher than appropriate, but Meet the Robinsons is most deserving of its score.- Mike Massie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney movies are so weird these days. Some suck and some rock. But I'm happy to say that "Meet the Robinsons" succeeds and is a lot of fun."Meet the Robinsons" is about a young boy named Lewis, who's an orphan, but still intelligent. He likes to make his own inventions, especially to impress people that are interested in adopting him. But Lewis's intelligence freaks many possible parents out, causing him to be rejected multiple times. However, he is inspired to invent a machine that can read his own mind to find out why he was an orphan in the first place.Lewis wants to compete in the school science fair with his mind-reader. But things get strange at the fair when another young boy named Wilbur Robinson claims that a man wearing a bowler hat stole a time machine to go after Lewis. Lewis, thinking he's crazy, doesn't believe him.But sure enough, a bowler hat-wearing man really is after him, and he sends his robotic bowler hat, Doris, to break Lewis's machine. The machine breaks in front of everybody, and Lewis is crushed inside, not knowing that it was actually the Bowler Hat Guy sabotaging him.However, Wilbur Robinson knows the truth. In order to prove to Lewis that he's not crazy, Wilbur takes him in his own time machine to the future. Now in a bright, golden, new world, Lewis finally believes Wilbur and agrees to go back in time and prevent his science fair machine from blowing up.Unfortunately, Wilbur crashes the time machine, making both him and Lewis stuck in the future. And this is where we finally meet the Robinsons! The Robinsons are you average family... well, average to the future. So they are strange to us, but Lewis finds them fascinating. In fact, he's even thinking about staying with them! However, the Bowler Hat Guy gets in the way...I'll stop there. I almost gave away the whole movie! Anyway, "Meet the Robinsons" is a really sweet, funny, and an all-around good movie. It sure beats the crap out of that dumb "Chicken Little" movie Disney made a couple years back! The movie is kind of predictable, and the middle gets really random and strange (but that's because we're meeting a really random and strange family), but all in all, "Meet the Robinsons" is a good, if not great, addition to the Disney canon.Bpnix12 rating: 3/5 Stars (6/10) and recommended. It's not the most wonderful thing ever, but it's still pretty good.</fullReview>

The characters were well developed and believable. You got to know the characters very well, and to care about them. The gadgets were cool. The villains were funny and scary. The animation was phenomenal as usual. It was a true-to-Disney original. It's a shame Disney won't be making any more animated movies. This one proves that Disney has still got what it takes. Disney can still stand up with the big guys. Pixar eat your heart out! Walt would be proud to how well the company has adapted to the 21st century technology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately this amazingly animated visual delight was spoiled in part by the excessive effort at trying too hard. The plot was very good, the emotional content was excellent along with the message of the story, the use of time travel was solid, but the execution in a number of spots, especially with the supposed villain was overdone and sometimes vapid and inconsistent with the overall tone of the movie. The use of animation for this particular project was apt and was spot on, the mix of realism and animation well balanced. If only the over-dramatization would have been reigned in this movie could have been another "The Incredibles" that made a clear mark as a classic. Unfortunately, this good movie just didn't have the consistency throughout to make the grade. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great big beautiful tomorrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, I've been a big skeptic of this film from the time it was still called "A Day with Wilbur Robinson". I just though the concept of a mad race through time chasing a boy genius seemed like Back to the Future meets Jimmy Neutron to me. Well, I'm happy to report that even though Robinsons does owe a great deal to both concepts (Yes, sadly, it does seem "Inspired" by Neutron even down to the art style) Robinsons comes off as a great to film to add to the Disney library, something I haven't said since I saw Home on the Range (And this doesn't include Pixar or live action films) Now, the one thing that's always struck me with this film is how flat out awesome Bowler Hat Guy looks, I remember seeing a concept drawing a couple years back of him creeping up on Lewis, it just seemed so...creepy, I love it. The art design in this film is also eye popping, I wish you saw more of the future and not just the Robinsons household, but in one memorable scene, when Lewis and Wilbur arrive that, you get the feeling of a great big beautiful tomorrow indeed.Now, I loved the first 20 or so minutes of the film more then anything else, and mind you, this is before we even get to the future. I thought the story of Lewis as a misfit orphan was just touching, plus, Lewis's roommate, Goob..EASILY one of the most adorable supporting characters Disney has created since Thumper.When you get to the future, things start to get a little messy, and weird, there are times when I really felt like the animators dipped into the same sauce they used to create Fantasia and Alice. Some of the Robinsons simply aren't that fleshed out, like, what's up with that Mr. Garison look alike for a paper bag for a wive, you never get if this guys insane, if that bag is actually alive, or what. There are some Robinsons you really get to love, to. I was easily one over by Adam West's deliciously cheesy (No pun intended) Pizza Delivery super hero and Wilbur's spunky mother. And Bud was just a hoot.There were some I feel who could of been a lot more fleshed out, the dog who wheres glasses, for example, is only seen in one joke. While Frankie the frog steals every scene he's in and is probably the coolest thing about this movie, well, he's again not in very much of it. There's also Robinsons who just are not fleshed out at all, such as the guy with the sausage cannon, the chick with the train, and the butler.While the second act is mostly just randomness, things get better in the final act, and there's actually quite a bit of Don Bluth/Tim Burton style darkness going on, the final chase is really quite intense. I don't want to spoil it, but this film has some really cleaver plot twists as well.So, if you don't mind some randomness, I'd say Meet the Robinsons is easily one of the strongest animated films Disney has done for quite some time, while I thought Chicken Little was a disaster, this easily brings the company back up. There are a few plot holes, and as I mentioned, the film could use about 10 minutes more of character developemnt, still, it's one of the best movies of the year and possibly the best non-Pixar CGI animated movie ever. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Partly because of the fact that most films have not been especially good lately ("The Wild", "Barnyard", and "Open Season" for example) and partly because it didn't sound so friendly, I had my doubts about this film and I was a little worried that I would not enjoy it. However, the characters are excellent and for once, the baddie is one of my favourite characters in the film!! :) The plot is a a little unoriginal (for example, one boy makes a promise with another boy, the other boy breaks the promise. Any familiarity to "Open Season"?), but replaced with some of the best Disney characters, Disney fun and a REALLY good moral: keep moving forward!Taken to the orphanage doorstep as a baby, Lewis grows up, not being adopted, as an inventor. Unfortunately, a time traveller, a sinister one, wants to ruin Lewis's time, which can cause huge problems for the future...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little frenetic and confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I did not bring any kids with me to see this movie, I watched "Meet the Robinsons" with an eye for how it would come across to a 10 year old. If I had seen it when I was ten, I would have needed someone to explain it to me. The implications of time travel are subtle, but are presented here as though one has already seen "Back to the Future". Adding to the confusion is the fact that the "future" we are introduced to looks like 2400 AD when its only, like, 2040 AD. Also, the "Bowler Hat" guy is not, as I thought he might be, from say, the 1890's. He's from.....well I better not say.... and is just a convenient villainous type that is fun to portray. So maybe this was all designed to throw us off and keep us from guessing the plot line. But I dunno.....although I was pleasantly surprised when the plot was revealed, it didn't make any of these "out of time" elements easier for me to accept. For a time travel movie to succeed for me, I need convincing reference points to hold on to, not Hollywood mishmash. Unfortunately most screenwriters do their own mental time traveling as well when creating these movies, assembling bits and pieces from past successful animations. So, all in all, to ten year old............I mean, huh?Anyway, our young hero Lewis is a geek with a dream. Or maybe two dreams. As an orphaned child, he wants desperately to know his real mother and to have a family. He also wants desperately to be an inventor. Standing in his way are, not the bullies that torment him as is usually the case, but a strange villain of unknown origin with a very smart hat. Next we fast forward to the future, literally, as a plot unfolds about a missing time machine. Then the movie makes a left turn, and we get introduced to the Robinson family, who are a little like the "Adams Family". Quirky and decadent, yes, but relevant? It all unfolds at a rather dizzying pace. Then, just as you start to tire of this family, the rest of the plot falls into place. OK, I understand it, but is it believable fantasy, or contrived? Well, try cooking me up a different villain for one, one more true to the character from which he sprang. I mean, he's deliciously evil, but we've seen it all before. Anyway, finally there is a nice climax involving bowler hats gone wild which is a lot of fun. And then things resolve themselves in predictable ways. All in all, "Meet the Robinsons" is not a bad movie. It has an interesting plot with plenty of unexpected twists and turns as well as humor. But did we REALLY go for a ride in a time machine here? Personally, I went for a nice ride in 3D, but not really one in time. In "Back to the Future", much of the humor and interest sprang from the "out of time" experience the characters had to endure. This helped keep the audience's frame of reference firmly planted. But aside from an odd reference to Lewis's hair, "Meet the Robinson's" doesn't exploit that potential at all. Instead, we are presented with a strange vision of what our future might be like - one filled with wondrous technologies and beautiful lawns, but with quirky, Alice in Wonderland type characters that you may have hoped you left behind a long time ago. Lewis should be happy to have that to look forward to - or SHOULD he?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet the Robinsons is amusing in 3-D from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Containing some elements you'll recognize from Back to the Future and The Wizard of Oz, Meet the Robinsons is a charming and amusing 3-D computer animated movie. A 12-year orphan has failed to get adopted more than 100 times because he keeps inventing things that always result in disaster. Then one day, someone a year older from the future takes him on a journey there in a time machine as he meets the Robinson family who provide him all the joy lacking in his present time. I'll stop right there and say while there is a rushed quality in the first 30 minutes, things slow down eventually to the point that you're left feeling inspired at the end. Wish the movie could be funnier but I wasn't completely disappointed. By the way, there is a punchline involving a Famous Celebrity that pays off at the end that I don't want to spoil here. And it's preceded by Working for Peanuts, an amusing Donald Duck/Chip 'n' Dale cartoon that was also in 3-D when it first came out in 1953. What awesome visuals both films had!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun movie that most people should enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this, I didn't know anything about it. But as I watched it I got the plot. This movie is about an 12-year old orphan called Lewis. He is a brilliant inventor, who meets a stranger called Wilbur Robinson. At the science fair, the bowler hat guy ruins his invention. So Wilbur takes him to the future and together they must find the Bowler Hat Guy.Although, the trailer made it look like you see a lot of the family but you don't see them a lot. You mainly see Wilbur. You do get introduced to the family but it doesn't happen until about the 30-minute mark.This movie has a good twist. Although it's a tad predictable, it still works out. Some of the humour was actually more for adults. As in when the Bowler Hat Guy wrote find the $#%*&amp;#$ boy, which obviously means the f word. Then again, some jokes were for little kids as in the dinosaur saying that he has small arms and a big head. You probably saw that part in the trailer. The animation in this film was decent.This is much better than most recent animated films released in the past year, except for cars (which was good.) This is one of those movies that's not great but you just sit back and enjoy the ride. It's good to see that Disney has taken a break from pixar. 3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Jetsons Part Two (by Disney)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen almost all Dysney movies, and this is one of the few that did'n touched my soul; it is pretty sad to come out of the theater after watching a Disney movie in which you don't feel something truly special inside you; i felt something, but it wasn't SOMETHING, as i usually do. This movie resembles a futurist view of the Earth (year 3037) much like the Jetsons; flying cars, round homes among other things, a little unoriginal, but i liked it. This movie also, is confusing for children; it has a lot of adult jokes, too much information, too much characters and dialogs that will confuse child; they will surely come out of the theater loving the personages and will want to buy an hamburger with a happy meal of them in that moment; but the movie won't stay at their hearts, like a lot of animated movies i saw as a kid (Bambi, Snowhite), or a little bigger (The Lion King); the toys from the happy meal will get broken or to the trash very quickly. A really good message is left trough the movie, useful to kids and adults; that i loved! (and put a little higher my rating that was almost all the movie in 6) About the Movie: Meet the Robinsons is the story of Lewis an orphan boy that loves science and inventions; at the age of 12 he, still unadopted, participates on a science fair with an ambitious project, deeply moved by his desire of meeting his birth mother. During the fair, Lewis meet Wilbur, a boy of his age that came from the future and needs to track, find and stop Bowler Hat Guy, a guy who stole a time machine from the future and have evil plans for this time. Wilbur takes Lewis to the future in a time machine where he finds his lovely and particular family (The Robisons) in the year 2037, and join to Wilbur's mission.The graphics and technological deployment of the film is awesome, by far the best that i have seen (in some scenes, like the crash of the spatial ship, you can see textures amazingly close to reality), i cant' imagine the rendering process that this movie had. 7/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I gave it an 8 and that may sound generous from my summary line, but this really shines because of its' wonderful visuals. I would guess had I rented it or seen it in a non 3D form I would have given it a 5 or 6. The story is on par with a good "Jimmy Neutron" episode, in other words so-so, but the visuals are terrific and it has a wonderful family message. I have seen a few naysayers thinking it is too intense for wee little ones, I can see that I guess, but only in one scene. 6 and up should be no problem at all. The new 3D films are much better and more comfortable to watch, though I think I paid a couple bucks extra for the privilege of owning some funky glasses, but I expect that this is a new trend in animation, and I for one am all for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much out of this film. I do enjoy family movies, but the commercials for this flick never made me want to run out to see it. I did wind up taking the kids to it this weekend, but mostly because there wasn't really any other kid friendly movies out there at the moment.The movie was a lot more heartfelt, and touching then any advertisements would have you believe.The Robinsons are almost a futuristic Adams Family, in that they are odd, and offbeat enough to make them interesting, yet loving and loyal enough to make them enduring.Like most major films today (especially kid's flicks) the ending is a happy, feel good one (at least I think so) but any other ending for a movie such as this would just feel wrong. I think Walt Disney would be proud of this movie. After seeing it you'll might just quote "Always Move Forward!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a recent string of increasingly schmaltzy, predictable and mind-numbingly formulaic CGI films (Barnyard, Chicken Little, and the execrable Cars spring to mind), I had limited expectations of Meet the Robinsons, but I was completely blown away by it. Fantastic visuals, some cracking dialogue and throwaway jokes, and a delicious splash of inspired lunacy made it one of those films that renew my faith in the movies as entertainment.Yes, underneath it all was a very Hollywood-traditional message of redemption and "believing in yourself", and the wackiness teetered on the edge of trying too hard, but the whole thing was done with tongue sufficiently firmly planted in cheek, and with a whacked-out lightness of touch for it not to matter. And Bowler Hat Guy has to be the best movie villain in recent memory.My younger kids were a bit restless during the movie, my beloved partner came out of it scratching her head and boggling her eyes a bit, but my teenagers and I just loved it. I went into the movie theatre after a bad day, feeling incredibly grumpy and with a severe headache. I came out feeling electric, with a huge grin on my face. Any movie that can do that to you is worth treasuring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have to say I normally never would have seen this movie, but I ended up going for a Computer Animation class I am taking. I have seen every Pixar film in theaters, but every other Disney 3D movie I have seen were disastrous.Although I didn't love the movie, it didn't didn't leave me with the distinct aftertaste of garbage that I have come to expect from non-Pixar Disney 3D movies. It wasn't all great, though. The majority of the first half of the movie was extremely slow, and most of the jokes fell flat. It is the later half of the movie that made the film. The action was intense, and the plot twists were sudden and surprising. It felt very... satisfying. Not something I have experienced in Disney's previous attempts at CG animation. I give the Film 6/10.The voice acting was very good for the most part, and the children they had playing the kid characters seemed to do alright. Normally I would prefer a professional female V.O. to do the kids voices (Nancy Cartwright, Tress Macneill) but it seemed to work OK as it was. Acting 8/10.I did have the opportunity to see this in Disney Real-D, and boy was it worth it. It was better than anything 3D I have experienced before. It was miles better than those Cyan/Red glasses, or even Imax 3D. It was all very clear, with none of the "Ghost effect" that you get with other methods. The 3D wasn't the focus of the film, which was refreshing. It wasn't too distracting, but it gave a sense of depth and reality that normally isn't possible viewing it in the traditional way. I give the 3D aspect 9/10.All in all I enjoyed this film, but issues with the pacing kept it from being excellent. Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite disappointed. Maybe I should have watched it in 3D, but for me it was not technically better (or worth) than a Pixar movie. But comparing to a Pixar movie it was too much of a "mish-mash", which means the storyline was not strong and engaging, it left me at times quite bored. The family part was very confusing, you kind of didn't see the jokes in the characters and they were not really interesting or important. The villain was really boring. It was very simplistic and predictable and lacked the warmth and quality of a Disney movie...maybe Disney is "moving forward", but it did not reach the sophistication of Pixar and left behind the humour and wisdom of older Disney movies. I gave it 6 out of 10, because I am sure that smaller kids will enjoy it, and the main character and the "little" roommate, were very likable.the massage in the end is also ...hm...Educational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It helps to start with a decent story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an animation enthusiast, and I've followed fairly closely the dance between Pixar and Disney that culminated in the former's purchase by the latter last year. While this consummation was likely brought about by the lackluster performance of Disney's first CGI-animated feature CHICKEN LITTLE, the film MEET THE ROBINSONS was already in the midst of production, and will likely merit the historical footnote of being the last such film from the Disney animation studio.It's hard to look at ROBINSONS in isolation, because it's really intimately connected to other Disney features and the Pixar roster. Pixar exec John Lassiter is credited here as Executive Producer, and I'm guessing he came on board after the Pixar purchase (he is now head of Disney's entire animation department). I find it hard to view this film without comparing it to several others.CHICKEN LITTLE was a collection of potentially-amusing characters in search of a story. Unfortunately, they didn't find one, and the result was messy enough that I wasn't expecting much from MEET THE ROBINSONS. Technically adequate, the creators of CL somehow missed the greatest strength of Pixar's films, namely great storytelling. Fortunately, ROBINSONS has a decent plot, and tells its story with style. William Joyce has a funky retro-tech sensibility, as seen in the movie ROBOTS and the kid's TV series GEORGE SHRINKS and ROLIE POLIE OLIE, and it's the basis for the style of ROBINSONS. The style is catchy, and the animation is actually very good.I won't get into the story much, but I thought it was rather well-told, with a genuine emotional core and some nice, sincere messages. The story here, in fact, might actually be stronger that those of the last couple of Pixar efforts.ROBINSONS is not without flaws; some of the gags are decidedly forced. Fortunately, the characters and the story are substantial enough to overcome this. With this film, I think the Disney animators finally proved that they could work effectively in this medium. I'm gathering, though, that the Disney people who worked on this one will be moved to the Pixar division, and the "Disney" brand will be reserved for traditional 2-D animation.I defy any serious Disney fan to keep a lump out of their throat as the closing credits come to an end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyper-charged energy-full movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest movie from Walt Disney features endless amounts of energy and randomness. At least, that's the best way I can sum up Meet the Robinsons, a flick about a young orphan boy, Lewis, who is an oddball until he is transported to the future by his future son. Confusing, yet interesting. As I mentioned, Meet the Robinsons runs on a lot of sugar, so be prepared to get sudden rushes of energy from the complete goofy feeling that the movie gives out in large quantities.Robinsons has the typical Disney touch- lighthearted, hard-to-resist fun. Even when something isn't necessarily funny (for example, the singing frogs), it doesn't make you hate the movie for the failed attempt at humor, unlike a certain other comedian whose movie opened on the same day as Robinsons. It's hard to compare this movie to other Disney flicks, mainly because (to the director's and writer's credit) it's very different. The energy of Bowler Hat Guy (the main evil man) is unparalleled by any character on screen-- the way he hops around and the way he says his lines is genius and makes you that much more interested in the movie. Basically, if Robinsons was done by any other company than Disney, it would probably come out as flat and monotonous.Like so many movies before it, Robinsons starts off interesting but drags during the ending. My advice is to take the ending as what it is and remember more about the fun and random times in the middle of the movie. I should end this review on the note that it is good to see a rated G movie be for people of all ages, which is exactly what Meet the Robinsons was.</fullReview>

The whole "time-travel plot" plays off the same plot devices that all time-traveling movies use to lure in viewers and in this case, they are used for a kid-friendly comedy that instead becomes a comedy that uses humor surprisingly more like that of Arrested Development, Scrubs, and Invader Zim with slight references to itself and other comedies that will make the adults in the crowd be the only ones laughing and leave your little children CONFUSED because they won't understand ANYTHING.</fullReview>

I found myself day dreaming elsewhere during the Schtick parts that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for the eye candy and it delivered that well, but it lacks Pixar's writing and soul. I think kids 8 and under will enjoy the ride at face vaule, while missing the plot. People old enough to follow a plot will find it wonders too far to return quickly and easily.

		<shortDescription>One of the best Disney films in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to figure out when the last time a movie from Disney proper charmed me like this, not sure. I love the Hefalump movie and I'm a fan of Treasure Planet- though once Martin Short shows up I think it goes off the rails. Hefalump aside (Thats a TV movie on the big screen- so I'm dismissing for purposes of comparison on that technicality- though its easily one of my favorite Disney films) I think this probably the one film from the Mouse House I'm happiest with since Lilo and Stitch. Is it the equal of Lilo? no it doesn't have the "This is my family, its broken but still good" moment that makes me cry every time- nor, and most importantly it does not have the bra wearing caped crusader(though there are moments and lines...)What the film has, that most other Disney films don't, and which is the reason that Lilo, and Treasure Planet and the other really good films work, is the characters. Lets face it this movie is about characters- and how they interact. The plot- the time travel to the future and stop the baddie plot, isn't all that great, but the pieces are- all of the jokes, and emotion and everything else comes out of the people in the film. yes they are people, even the frogs and the t-rex and the hat. They created personalities for everyone and everything in this film. Thats why the film works. You're in a place with real people, there are no cookie cutter characters, there are different people, not ones a dog, and ones a chicken and ones a fish or a pig like in Chicken Little.(which has moments- and two or three real characters). No one is a stereotype or if they are they bend the rules- the bowler hat man is typical Snidely Whiplash characterization, but its turned on its head- things are not what you think they are with him. I loved that they dressed up what you expect with things you don't- the twist of who the Robinsons are-what you can't guess?- twist Rules that you would expect from old time travel movies to make a new sort of sense.Frankly the plot is disposable- but the people are not.the lines of dialog are not. I would love to know what was cut out of this film-65% of it was apparently removed and re-shot-I'd love to know what was there(Hello DVD)- what gems might it contain. I'm guessing the film was more rambling- probably like Robots.I loved this movie, I've been thinking about it since I saw it, which is unheard of on a Disney film-more importantly I'm not remembering the jokes, but the people and the sets and the gee whiz feeling I had. I really want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've mentioned this many times, but first it's important to remember that I'm biased. I don't think there's an animated Disney film that I've given less than a 10 out of 10. Heck, I give a large percentage of their live action fare a 10 out of 10, and almost never give any of their films lower than a 7 out of 10. I don't do this just because they're Disney and I'm issuing a vote to keep me in an extended, fantastical childhood (I need no assistance in maintaining an element of that, thank you); I do it because I really enjoy their work that much.It's easy to see how many people might not care for Meet the Robinsons. It has far more in common stylistically with recent Disney films like Chicken Little (2005) and Lilo &amp; Stitch (2002) than it does with the "classic" Disney films (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Cinderella (1950), etc.), or even their "second golden age" (The Lion King (1994), Beauty and the Beast (1991), etc.)--although it's worthwhile to note that some characteristics are not that far removed from Alice in Wonderland (1951) or even Pinocchio (1940), and you'll find things reminiscent of many other films--from Toy Story (1995) to Robots (2005) to Looney Tunes cartoons. It has an unusual, surrealistic flow, and it often seems like there's nowhere the animators won't go for a bit of weirdness. But especially this latter fact is part of the charm to me. Meet the Robinsons may be adapted from the gorgeously drawn children's book, William Joyce's A Day with Wilbur Robinson (1993), but it seems just as inspired by Edward Lear's "Nonsense" books, which were some of my first favorites as a kid.Visually, Meet the Robinsons is just as beautiful as Joyce's work. And beneath all the wonderfully frantic surrealism, which is loaded with quick, funny pop culture references, there's a great message here about creativity, experimentation, mindful experience and the necessity and acceptance of failure and rejection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I love the big majority of Hollywood's CGI movies I was extremely let down by Disney's first effort: Chicken Little. But alas, it got worse. Meet the Robinsons is so childish and ridiculous, it made me cringe on way too many occasions. While being imaginative with regards to the family and their surroundings the film fails in so many other aspects that made it quite painful for me to watch: The bulk of the jokes are leveled at so young an audience, it is hard to not be bored or even annoyed if you're over an age of 15. As a film that relies so much on a breathless succession of funny ideas, it inevitably suffers if those jokes are completely inane most of the time. A big factor in any animated movie, the bad guy lacks any kind of menace as he is a complete moron. The fact that the quality of textures and animations is among the least sophisticated in recent years didn't help matters much either. I liked the ending and how all came together but it couldn't bring back the 90 minutes of wasted lifetime that came before.I admit it: I'm certainly spoiled by Pixar and Dreamworks Animation. Yet I warn you to watch this movie being an adult with even half a brain.</fullReview>

From the trailers, it looked like a stupid, childish, bad Disney movie. I ended up going because everyone else went. And after I watched it...I wanted to kick myself for ever thinking those kind of things about it. I completely fell in love with it. It was the most amazing movie I have ever seen. Right off the bat, I loved the characters, and easily identified with them. The plot is amazing, there are surprises at every turn. The twist is incredible, and you get to really caring about the characters and what happens to them as the story progresses. The Robinson motto is incredible, too. The score, by the amazing Danny Elfman, is great. The songs, particularly Little Wonders, by Rob Thomas, are incredible. At the end of the movie, I got all teary-eyed, because the whole thing was really touching. I loved that movie so much, I saw it 7 times before it left theatres. If you have not seen Meet the Robinsons, watch it. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

What i saw was an hysterical amazing film that a 17 year old girl, like myself, could watch with her friends and not just her family. The bad guy, Bowler Hat Guy, was so pathetic and incompetent. The hero, Lewis, you've just got to feel bad for him. His sidekick, Wilbur, was probably one of the coolest characters, because of how weird he was. Hell, his entire family was weird. But that was what made it better. And Goob. I cannot write this review without bringing up Goob. He was just so cute! He was Lewis' roommate, and he was like, I don't know how to describe him and still give him justice.I strongly recommend going to go see this movie, I don't care if you don't have small children with you, or if your a teenager with an attitude problem. You have got to see this movie. I guarantee that you will absolutely love it!</fullReview>

How about people who are trying to find their real parents? They will not exactly like what this film is trying to convey.I felt that this film is a rip-off to the incredible "Back to the Future " films. That was class.After a while, this picture became confusing. The toddlers will be shaking their heads with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick for kids and adults alike!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see "Meet the Robinsons" you'll have a choice of seeing it in 3-D or regular. Do the 3-D; it's worth the extra two bucks you have to pay. The 3-D enhances an already enjoyable, fun family flick, and makes everything more vibrant and sharp. Plus, while most 3-D glasses end up giving you a splitting headache, these do not. And it isn't the normal 3-D where things randomly pop out at you just for the sake of looking cool, no; this kind makes you feel as if you are right there with the characters. The 3-D version is a must, as is the movie itself."Meet the Robinsons" is the story of a genius young orphan desperate to meet his mother. He is also an inventor, but when one of his inventions gets destroyed by the evil, but stupid, Bowler Hat Guy, young Wilbur must go to the future to fix the past. If he doesn't, his entire life will be changed all because of his destroyed invention. While in the future he stays with the kooky, slightly crazy Robinson family, and by the end of the film, finds out something remarkable about that family.It is a very well done movie, and actually quite funny. The trailer made it look loud, annoying and not the least bit funny. It does the movie no justice at all. The funniest scenes in the film are with the Robinson family, who'll make even your weirdest relatives appear completely normal. There are some parts that drag a little or other scenes that border on tipping the corny scale. Nonetheless, minor complaints for an otherwise great 90 minutes of cartoon heaven. It finally looks like Disney has done something right. Lately all they've been dishing out are inane sequels (Cinderella 3?! Come on Disney, you're better than that). I'm glad they've finally returned to form and made a film that I'm sure Walt Disney would be proud of. The movie even ends with a great quote by Uncle Walt. So don't skip this cartoon, it is a excellent film for kids and adults, and I promise you'll be entertained.Rated G.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, sweet story with top-notch 3D technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years of trying to prefect the technology of 3D, the Walt Disney Studios may have hit upon something with its newest effort, "Meet the Robinsons," a cute little CGI diversion about loneliness, family, friends and time travel.The first key to solving the 3D conundrum is the glasses. These are usually cardboard, red and blue-lensed monstrosities that are as unattractive and they are ineffective. To solve that, this movie features a more sturdy pair of spectacles (which resemble those worn by Buddy Holly).To prove the worth of these models, I brought my 3-year-old to the screening, and once she put them on, did not remove them until the film was over. This was a major achievement for a child who invented the term "perpetual motion." In a bizarre homage to Roy Orbison, I even felt comfortable enough to wear them on the drive home ? sort of like real cool sunglasses ? sort of).This, combined with some very good camera and cinematography work, make the three-dimensional effects almost seamless and intriguing. Another aspect I appreciated was that the picture did not have to resort to goofy tricks and forced situations to exercise this effect, like the recent stinker, "Shark Boy &amp; Lava Girl." Here, an orphan, Lewis, who is as much of a failure as an inventor as he is an orphan, finally builds a machine which will revive memories and help him find his real mother. But the intervention of a "Bowler-wearing guy," as well as the futuristic Wilbur Robinson, puts a kibosh on that contraption, as well.Whisked forward in time, Lewis meets Wilbur's goofy family ? an addled grandpa, idiot twins, a mother who conducts a frog orchestra, among others.For some reason, the "Bowler" guy wants to go back to where Lewis presents the machine to a big corporation and take credit for it.A few nice twists and turns make this a cut above Disney's more recent efforts (especially "Chicken Little" and "The Wild"), and the little ones will certainly enjoy this sweet story, I know my little girl did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important things about animated feature films are are they suitable for children,and are children entertained by them?Meet the Robinsons is no question suitable for children,and my children,as well as other children present in the theater today,were entertained by it.I suppose in that regard,the film does it's job with flying colors.I regret to say that from an adult standpoint,it comes up profoundly short of the mark.While the animation is above average,the story,at least in my opinion,is (for lack of a better term) boring.It has its slightly humorous moments where I would give a slight chuckle,but I am afraid that's about it.The only bright spot for me was the five minute cartoon that preceded the feature,a tradition that this 40 something movie goer is glad to see resurrected,if only briefly.My advice is to wait for this film to be released on DVD.Rent it,perhaps even buy it for your kids.They will enjoy it.Adults? Meet the Parents,Meet the Fokkers,Meet the Feebles,Meet the Press,Meet anybody but the Robinsons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Disney, but they shouldn't play with time travel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Disney. Don't get me wrong. The classics will always be classics. It's up to now where they are destroying the Disney name with crap. Now, this is one of the many ways to prove that Disney isn't all gone yet.But one thing bugs me. It's the time travel plot. If you are going to do time travel, you either have to do it very realistically or don't do it at all. Don't mess with what most humans don't understand.There were many points where essentially you'd have to NOT understand time travel in order to understand and accept it. For example, the mom who drops her child at the door and then heads off in a hurry, followed by knocking sounds was caused by her own son, in the future. If her son didn't go back in time to see his mom, he wouldn't have startled her, and wouldn't have knocked on the door. Thus, he wouldn't exist. Therefore, he never did go back in time to see his mom, thus he never could have not existed. And it goes around and around.Another problem was when he meets himself as an adult. That's a big no-no. Imagine yourself as an adult, and suddenly you meet yourself as a young boy. From that point on, what you tell, say or do to yourself will affect yourself. In the movie, the boy sees his own inventions and stuff, which encourage him to work hard. But the problem is, he couldn't have created those in the future unless he was encouraged to by the site of his own inventions, which he had to invent based on seeing his own inventions. So his own work encouraged him to build what got him to build it. Confusing huh? There were many points like that where the kid couldn't have known that he was going to succeed in his invention unless he did so, yet when he's told he will, it's obvious he does because he's the one who told himself he would. But how would he know he did so if he was never told to do so by himself? But other than the time travel problem, the movie was great and I loved the message it shared.</fullReview>

In reality, it just makes things more confusing, and none of these characters was compelling enough to make me care all that deeply about what happened to them.It's watchable, but it doesn't remotely compare to any of the Pixar films in terms of great storytelling or humor.I am very glad that Disney got things straightened out with Pixar and is leaving computer animation to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie in incredibly underrated. I found the previews a little annoying what with the over-advertising scene of the small-role dinosaur and was forced to see it at a birthday party and a fell in love! It had me laughing out loud and that's a lot to say for a teenager watching a cartoon with friends (I personally love Disney, but you get my point). The plot was really well planned out while also being understandable to children. The characters were all so lovable and the animation was flawless. A must see! It just made me feel little again and not like I was watching the film, but apart of it. Just makes you feel happy inside. What's not to like?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit skeptical at first. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a good film. But when I saw parts of it when it aired on TV, it got me interested. So, one rental later, I watched it, and it was a lot of fun. I know this has probably already been said LOADS of times, but it really is like Back to the Future if it was made as an animated film. The colours are bright, and the visuals are wonderful. The Robinsons themselves are a lot of fun to watch (especially Franny. She's awesome!), and the music by the always brilliant Danny Elfman was wonderful. The ending was also really lovely with a great song to go with it. It's a great film that really deserves to be called a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney animation takes a time-traveling whirlwind trip with "Robinsons"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney Animation has had some trouble getting its feet on the ground without the word Pixar next to it and "Meet the Robinsons" is the kind of animated film more content with shaking things up. While the film has some lovable elements and does come together toward the end, it mostly suffers from jumpy, unsupported storytelling that will most likely have children thinking "whoa?" instead of "wow."In "Meet the Robinsons," Lewis is a 12-year-old boy who was abandoned as an infant on the steps of an orphanage. Because of his knack for invention-making, Lewis can never find a family to adopt him, but all that changes when a stranger named Wilbur Robinson comes to him from the future, trying to protect him from a man in a bowler hat, and sweeps him off to the year 2037 where he meets the rest of the Robinson family, a barrage of strange and eccentric characters.When Lewis meets the Robinsons, the film gets a little crazy. The pacing is so fast and the objective of the film becomes unclear. While the writers use this lightspeed pace to throw in some humor that you have to listen very closely to catch, little gets truly established and you don't feel like you really get to...meet the Robinsons. Disney's decision to break the number one formula rule with animated features: getting a slew of well known voice talent, doesn't help. As much as getting big names to voice characters is a selling factor for a film, sometimes it helps hasten the process of connection audience to characters. Either way, no big names seems odd. We also know very little about the film's villain, the man in the bowler hat, and while his quirky nature has an appeal, his motives, for the first major part of the film at least, are unknown. Classic villains have strong sinister motives in Disney films, then their quirks come in, but "Robinsons" works the opposite way.That said, somehow this film manages to pull it all together in revealing some important details about the future that show it's not merely coincidence that Lewis is being helped by the Robinsons. The strongest part of the film is its creation of sympathy for Lewis, who desires parents and a family above all else, despite his incredible talents. As the film ends and these details are revealed and Lewis' fortunes change, it's easy to get suckered in to good old family themes and while not exactly mapped out well, they're very present in "Robinsons."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a classic but reasonably enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Meet the Robinsons" is an animated children's movie that may be just a bit too complicated for its intended audience to follow. That's not really much of a surprise given that the scenario centers around a young orphan boy with a knack for inventions who spends most of the movie traveling back and forth in time between the future and the present in a tale so convoluted that even adults may have trouble fully comprehending all of it.For much of the duration, "Meet the Robinsons" feels frenetic and undisciplined, seemingly willing to throw just about everything but the kitchen sink into the mix in the hope that somehow it will all come together in the end. This explains why the movie features a family of eccentric nitwits (the Robinsons), a rampaging tyrannosaurus rex brought back from the past, and a villain with a Snidely Whiplash moustache whose sidekick is a mechanical bowler hat that makes R2D2-type noises.Yet, towards the end, the movie does, in fact, manage to bring most of these disparate elements together and to arrive finally at a satisfying conclusion. The backgrounds and animation are not quite up to the standards set by, say, "Ratatouille" or "Wall-E," but the brightness of the colors, the quickness of the pacing and the enthusiasm of the vocal performances should keep the little ones intrigued for the duration - even if they don't always get what's going on in the story.</fullReview>

I've heard Mc'Donald's drive through cashiers with better voices. Disney-Please stop letting the Directors do voices past test animation! Adam West does a voice and it shows how crappy the other voices are by contrast. Its like the turtle in Finding Nemo its like Vanilla Ice Cream swimming in a sea of more eccentric Flavors- Does this seem long winded after I've made my point?

		<fullReview>The summary says it all really... this film is clever, inspirational, and says beautiful things about life, whilst gently dealing with a few lessons along the way. It also messes around with time nicely in the tradition of the best time-travel films such as "back to the future". Altogether it is a very thoughtful work that comes from a space of love and concern for the promotion of the positive things in humanity.Our two(2.6) year old just laps it up... and so do we. William Joyce's original book was cool but the rendering to film has weaved magic as well. And the music is quite perfectly chosen. Do the film justice and watch it in 720p / bluray format... it just looks better that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disney film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best family film since "Bridge to Terribithia". Okay so it hasn't been that long. But truth be told, the film doesn't offer any pure excellence in its genre. Instead, the film is a well sculpted okay film, from the animation to its back to the future-esquire story. But I think that makes it great. There needs to be simplistic films that the whole family can enjoy with no bathroom humor, political agenda or winking humor aimed at adults. Just pure rare Disney whimsical magic and an entertaining story with some heart, like Disney in the old days. People longing for this formula can find it finally in this animated cgi adventure. And the film is surprising, I'll admit that I didn't see the twist in the story coming. What also makes "Meet the Robinsons" come out in front of other animated features mediocre animations aimed at children is its message. No, not the overly forced "keep moving forward" message coined by Walt Disney, but the entire situation with the character Boog and his fate. I must say, I was most impressed by the impact of the humorous situation of Boog. He's a character who the audience instinctively sympathizes with, but is also the character that we are programmed to vote against. The film's tone is kept in all light seriousness, but I like how it forces you to rethink the situation, or more so, how the bad guy became what he was. A similar occurrence is in the "Incredibles", but with a more cynical attitude and disrespect. The "bowler hat guy" is of course not a real villain. He's a wannabe in which we're supposed to delight in his failed efforts. Evoking sympathy for him in the end, even if it's meant to be funny, is beneficial for children used to the normal conventions of animated villain hood. Of course, the film has some small flaws. It is too quickly paced in some sections and it kind of overpowers any subtle comedic elements. Due to its lights tone, it's true that the film could have afforded to be a little funnier. There were several points in the film where you could feel that last minute improvements were made and it feels a little uneven. When we actually meet the Robinsons for example, the situation is erratic, somewhat like a Saturday morning cartoon. For the screen time given however, the characters are given depth to their personalities and truly feel human. Most of the film's success can most likely be attributed to John Lasseter, because I'll admit that the film could have easily been intolerable. Instead, it offers a fun adventure that adults can enjoy as well, with an almost reflexive attitude on past failed efforts such as "The Wild".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSThis is a great family film, though. It was actually way better than I thought. I was not very interested into seeing Meet the Robinsons. I did, anyway, and I enjoyed it very much. The computer-animation was stunning. The cast was great. The jokes were fresh and nice. My favorite joke is the Tom Selleck joke when Wilbur says that his dad looks like Tom Selleck and they show a picture of his face, who voices Wilbur's dad. The only problem I have with this film is the plot. It is very confusing and odd and complicated. I also kind of think that this should have been rated PG, not G.Here's the plot. Lewis is an orphan inventor. One day he hopes to see his mom. On the day of a science fair he shows off his invention, but the Bowler Hat Guy with his hat named Doris steal it, which is a Memory Scanner. The BHG is from the future. Then Lewis meets Wilbur Robinson from the future. He takes Lewis in a time machine to the future. The machine breaks, though. Wilbur tells Lewis to fix it. Lewis meets Wilbur's family, which are kind of different. Wilbur's dad is also an inventor. The family wants to adopt him, but when they realize that he is from the future they can not. Lewis then learns from the BHG that he is Wilbur's dad and the BHG is actually his orphan roommate Goob. Lewis ruined his life. Goob says that Lewis invented Doris. Goob goes back to the past and mass produces Doris. Doris hats then go on a rampage and takes over the future. Lewis fixes the time machine and goes back in time and stops Goob. They go back to the future, and that causes everything to go back to normal because of a time effect. Goob turns good. Lewis goes back to the past and sees his mom and helps Goob not turn evil. Lewis gets adopted.Overall, this is one of the best newer computer-animated movies I have seen in a while. Still, I can not help but feel that this should be rated PG. The scene where Lewis is chased by the Tyranasaurus Rex is actually very tense and suspenseful. The Doris hats they turn people into zombies are also very frightening. Meet the Robinsons also is very strange, especially in the middle. A prime example is the fight between Franny Robinson and her brother. That was a little too strange. Anyway, this is a great family film that will be definitely better than you would to think.8/10Recommended Films: Back to the Future, Shrek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the Robinsons, crossing "Back To The Future" with "The Terminator" meant a migraine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...but this revamped effort from "Disney 4.0" proves that a good time-travel adventure need not induce dementia! Lewis (Daniel Hansen/Jordan Fry) is a brilliant mind in a young orphan's body. The only thing he wants to do, more than invent, is have a family all his own. He can't seem to get either one right, much to the chagrin of his roommate, Michael "Goob" Yagoobian (Matthew Josten) who just wants his baseball team to win a game, and orphanage mistress Mildred (Angela Bassett), one of the few adults who appreciates Lewis' potential. At a science fair, he crosses paths with the hyper-kinetic Wilbur Robinson (Wesley Singerman), who warns him to look out for a "Bowler Hat Guy" (Stephen J. Anderson) and stresses that it's important for him to complete his project and win the fair. When things go awry, Lewis is ready to give up hope on his dreams and himself, only to have Wilbur reappear, promising to show him the future. He proceeds to whisk Lewis away for a glimpse of things to come--and some enlightenment on their true bond and what it means to "keep moving forward".This is not a new message, certainly not in animation, but it's certainly told in a fresh way. Quite a lot is borrowed in this film, but it's the execution and the way it's put together that really puts things over. One complaint that may exist, if any, is that there are too many characters, but it's easily overlooked when you realize that they're ALL interesting, and each one could have their own movie. I was particularly taken with little Goob almost as soon as I saw him, laughing at almost every one of his lines. That brings me to another virtue of the film--usually in time travel films, there are mind-bending concepts presented in quick-fire fashion (see my title), but not here. The truly kid-friendly folks at Disney's revamped animation wing have managed to put together a plot that doesn't tip the cards too early (even though you may make a few early connections), saving the surprises for the last half, where they belong. A sort of "Back to the Future" in reverse(Wrap your head around that one)? With paradox and mottoes akin to "The Terminator"? Sold. This is one family I'm sure you won't mind visiting, even though truly meeting them will take some...time.NOTE--It is DEFINITELY worth your trouble to schedule yourself for a 3-D showing--the digital-based effect must be seen to be believed; it even looks good on the classic 'toon that precedes the film. Oh, and hang on to those shades--chances are we'll be using them again!</fullReview>

Recently nearly everything they release seems to be unrealistic, weak and pathetic; they're churning out stupid films, awful compared to their beautiful era of older renaissance movies, the much loved classics loved by all. Meet The Robinsons is the best production I've seen Disney let out since Tarzan (1999), and I'm glad to say that.The animation is stunning - complete 3-D brilliance. The characters are also extremely well developed with much more depth than one imagines for an animated production. The plot was simultaneously pleasurable and intriguing with a twist or two, adding to the drama and excitement. Welcome back Disney...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a long time, Meet the Robinsons turned out to be a complete packed entertainer with all that it takes to give a really really good animated movie. I would rate it in line with The Incredibles for its futuristic ideas and for humor, its as good as any other anime, like Finding Nemo etc. The story revolves around a 12yr old inventor who, right from the moment the movie starts, gives you the feeling that he is going to make it big and succeed. But the plot and happenings in this movie, the funny side of it, they all fit in so well and THANK YOU for making it a really really nice feel good movie. The kid in the movie looks cute with his round frame specs on him. The best part of the movie is how the villain's nasty plans come to an end, how the loose ends are tied up and most of all, who the villain is. A must watch movie with your whole family. I give it 10 Stars.In short, a family that any kid would love to have. Meet The Robinsons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd like to hear what Robert McKee and all the other scriptwriting gurus have to say about Meet the Robinsons. All the plot points, inciting incidents, sword-and-shield moments are in place, the characters have clearly defined motives that change and mature as the story progresses, the plot and sub-plots all resolve themselves neatly at the end, and the big themes - Family, Belonging, Redemption - appear and tug away at the heartstrings. So why does it all seem too pat and kind of flat? Has this structure finally worn itself out? The search for family, the need to let go, themes that worked so well in Finding Nemo, just don't get off the ground here. Why is Nemo full of magic and MTR formulaic? Aside from that, the dialogue is way too fast-paced for kids, and most adults, too. Who exactly were all those extended family members? In short, too pat, too contrived (even for animation) and completely lacking in originality.</fullReview>

It is a really new experience. 3D effects are wonderful, images are sharp and clear as usual (perhaps only a little less bright, due to the active glasses).Digital 3D REALLY adds a new dimension to the film. If it takes two hours of car to reach the nearest digital 3d cinema, it is definitely worth driving.The film itself is OK, clever and entertaining, but 3D definitely improve the viewers experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable &amp; Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Meet the Robinsons" is probably one of the most underrated Disney Movies of all times. It is not a masterpiece like other animated movies such as "The Little Mermaid" or "Aladdin", but I think it is very enjoyable and entertaining, at least more than "Chicken Little" and "The Wild".The movie tells the story of Lewis, a young genius and inventor, However, his creations never work. When he fails during the Science Fair, he doesn't want to be an inventor anymore. This is a bad thing for Wilbur Robinson and his Family of the future...While it is generally considered a "children movie", "Meet the Robinsons" easily entertains pre-teens and adults. The story is quite original in my opinion, and the characters are well-written. The villain (Bowler Hat Guy) is probably one of the funniest characters in the movie.With this movie, Disney is probably "coming back". Don't miss it.</fullReview>

I hate it whenever they give away the ending of the story whenever i read a comment here... Well, it's my own fault anyway because I did read it even though there's a big "Spoiler" sign on it. If you haven't watched this movie yet, then i recommend watching this movie. It's not just for the kids but for grown-ups as well. Some scenes are funny, touching and some may make your eyes shed some tears.... I won't say what part... But I did shed a tear in a scene or two... probably because I felt the same way as the protagonist did(metaphorically).. Just to make this short,..... JUST WATCH IT!

		<fullReview>It was almost like watching a movie made from some of the comic books I grew up reading, only with *much better* graphics! And my kids enjoyed it so much they forgot to ask to go to the restroom, even during the "boring" scenes. I was gratified to find an interesting plot that took most of the movie to reveal with many interwoven threads -- no one of which gave away the climax. Plenty of clues lying about... reason to see the movie again and watch for the early ones. I look forward to the questions my kids will eventually ask about historical accuracy, time travel, causality, and temporal paradoxes... We just might go see this one again before it leaves the theater.</fullReview>

There are times when the movies seems to take on a dark tone but again that is part of the story so you just have to hold your little ones a bit closer for that part.But the entire movie is like a fable modified.

		<fullReview>When I fist saw the trailer for MTR I burst into a fit of giggles at the crazy dinosaur with its "big head and little arms". Both my brother and father commented that they hoped that that scene was not the best in the entire movie, because they really wanted to see it and not be disappointed. So I hopped to the task of seeing this movie. I gathered up 8 of my high-school-senior/college-freshmen friends and dragged them to see this crazy flick. Needless to say, many of them were worried at the idea of seeing a family film. However! by the time the movie started we were already bending and crying with laughter (even more so than the abundance of little kids in the audience). The subtle references and crazy characters kept us entertained throughout the entire movie. And I even forgot about my excitement to see the crazy Dino, and was still laughing at that scene even after seeing the preview. So, thank you Disney for producing this movie that made my weekend and proved that teenagers don't have to grow up too fast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of Disney's best animated films! I have already seen the movie twice, and I loved it both times. I love all the characters, like Lewis, Wilbur, and the Bowler Hat Guy. I'd say this was even better than Chicken Little, but not quite as good as the Emperor's New Groove. Before the ending, I already thought the movie was really good. But after I saw the ending, it made the movie better than it already was! I also really liked the dinosaur and the plot twists! I'd say that Disney has tried SO HARD to create a masterpiece, and personally, I'd say they succeeded! I'd say when it comes on DVD, Meet the Robinsons is a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Meet the Robinsons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's recent animated features have been misses, with the likes of Chicken Little and The Wild performing below expectations despite the updated computer generated toons and marketing gimmicks, bringing to mind the age old adage that the story comes first. As far as animated movies go, Pixar's the one to beat, having crisp drawings perform to the tune of a superb story. Meet the Robinsons is not a Pixar movie (given that the two companies have now merged), and I'm pleased to say that Robinsons has indeed remembered to go back to basics, in whipping out a strong, engaging tale for its computer generated animation.The trailers have more or less summarized the story. Lewis is a brilliant kid inventor who meets up with a boy from the future, Wilbur, who enlists Lewis' help in stopping the evil plot of the Bowler Hat Guy, who intents on coming to the present day to wrong certain rights so that the future can be changed, to his advantage of course. It's a time travel movie, and I dare say, space time continuum aside, that it makes cinematic sense, as well as filling it with loads of imaginative fun, especially with the Robinsons, folks from the future whom Lewis meets in the course of his mission.Though the story developed at a slower than expected pace with a relatively dry introduction, its buildup is measured and it got better as time went on, grabbing your attention hook line and sinker. At times you can guess how the narrative will proceed, and how the expected twists will turn out to be, but it is indeed its delivery of the final act that made it all worthwhile, wrapping up the loose ends with that trademarked fuzzy Disney feeling, that lifts the movie from mediocrity, into an instant contemporary classic.It is not everyday that a movie comes along, and celebrates failure in a non-comedic premise, coupled with reminders of never giving up, and a theme of family, camaraderie and belonging. It looks on the positive side of things even when the situation is bleak, and I'd bet by the time the end rolls around, there'll be a tinge of bittersweetness in its triumph. The story contains great characters in its ensemble, even though some only feature for a limited time and most already seen through promotional material and trailers. And I thought they dampened expectations too, especially that classic scene with the T-rex about its arms - you're constantly expecting that scene to turn up, and when it does, it becomes anti-climatic.Based on a book and filled with great songs, Meet the Robinsons evokes the same spirit as movies like Back to the Future and Frequency, both of which are among my favourites, so it isn't difficult to proclaim that this animated movie is a must watch, even if its voice talents are not contributed from those in the A-list.The screening is preceded by a classic Mickey Mouse short called Boat Builders. A rare opportunity to watch Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy on the big screen, so enter the theatre hall early in order not to miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film except for a few character flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet the Robinsons, the latest offering from Disney/Pixar, proved to be very entertaining and humorous. The comedy is outrageous and very random, which is very much in line with the direction of modern comedy. There were plenty of times that I forgot that I was watching a Disney film. Older adults might not understand the randomness and craziness, but the younger generations will appreciate its departure from the traditional Disney-style humor. Some things will slip over the heads of children but will surprise some with adult themes. For example, one character is married to a puppet that he wears on his hand. So essentially the joke is that he is married to his hand. Nice one Disney. Way to teach are kids about masturbation in such a keen way. Anyways... Visually, the film takes animation to the next level without sacrificing the feel that an animated film requires. These are still cartoons, and they should remain that way. I appreciate the departure from reality and exaggeration that cartoons offer. So far as the story is concerned, it suffers from the lack of character consistency. One character is an absolute dunce and pure evil. But on some occasions is intelligent and tender-hearted. This may seem to be a more complex character but once you see the film you will understand what I mean. I don't understand how Disney could let this slip under the radar and use it as a twist to the story. I think it hurts the story and could quite possibly ruin the movie for some critical persons. Despite the weaker story, I still went away feeling happy and creatively inspired. I saw Blades of Glory the day before and was, as expected, disappointed. If your choosing between these two, go see Meet the Robinsons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>colorful, imaginative kid's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet the Robinsons is an uneven but generally entertaining and pleasant children's movie with some wonderful CGI renderings.Lewis Robinson is an orphan that no one will adopt. He is also a science genius. On the cusp of his 13th birthday he builds a machine that will help read his mind back to the day his mother left him on his doorstep, so that he can see what she looked like, as it is the only memory he has of her. Unfortunately at the science fair, two things happen - he is accosted by one Wilbur, who claims to be a "time cop" tracking a villain who has come from the future - and a villain in an evil robot bowler hat. The bowler hat manages to botch his demonstration, making it look like his machine doesn't work, and once he's left, dejected, the villain steals the machine.Wilbur, the time-cop, turns out not to be an actual cop but a boy from the future who takes Lewis into his time machine, where they zoom ahead to the time Wilbur came from. The world of the future is one of the glorious highlights of the film - a candy-colored wonderland. The Pixar influence is evident - the film looks very much like it had been rendered by the same people that did The Incredibles.Once in the future Lewis is introduced to Wilbur's large and very eccentric family, the Robinsons, and learns the importance of getting his machine back from the villain in the bowler hat, who has the only other time machine in existence.The film is very good for children. My three-year old sat still for virtually the whole movie, and the only part that was a little too scary for her was when a possible alternate future is shown where bowler hat guy has won (in a way) and humanity is enslaved.In general, the film is a little too disjointed and uneven to earn a top rating. Much of the middle section consists mostly of shtick, and while funny, it doesn't move the plot forward. People seeking deeper meaning will be disappointed, and the material is not emotionally challenging in the way Spirited Away was. But the beautiful artwork and animation made up for most of the shortcomings. While not a Disney or Pixar classic, this is an entertaining 92 minutes.</fullReview>

I truly believe this was Disneys best picture so far because of the creativeness that the 3-D gave it. Thank goodness the old 3-D versions are over and Disney has brought better quality and technology to it. I hope they do more!! Also, it has a great story line. It really had a special meaning to it. I don't think I have ever been at a movie for kids that the entire theater was silent until the end when everyone wows and claps! It just tells you how amazed and involved in the movie you are.

		<shortDescription>Disney still feeling the weight of the past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney should be leading the pack. With this movie they have put both resource and effort into regaining the acclaim they've lost in recent times. In the UK an old Mickey Mouse short was included before the main feature, which highlighted how much more dynamism and vivid imagery is available to creative animators these days. On the other hand it also proved that charm, imagination and storytelling can not be computer processed quite so easily.My seven-year-old daughter thought the film was "great" and wants to see it again. This makes a great deal of sense to me; this film has so much going on that repeat viewing, especially on DVD, would be rewarding for younger children. My 12 year old son view was that it was "OK"; my interpretation being that the plot was lashed together with little thought for pace and coherence in the hope that the colourful graphics and snappy (but unfunny) dialogue would cover up the plot holes. He was not captured by the Disney magic.Disney needs to re-find the humour and storytelling that used to be their forte. Take a few more risks and use all that new animation technology to be more innovative, they could then be back on top of the game.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Child abandonment and apocalyptic themes...good family fun, huh? The movie opens with a child abandonment scene which immediately made me uneasy. I had my three children with me, of course.The story is about an orphan, Lewis, who is brilliant and sweet and desperately wants someone to love him. Frankly, it was difficult to watch as he was used, lied to, manipulated by seemingly everyone in the movie (indluding his own son).I'm not sure when people began associating eccentricity with genius, but the two do not go hand-in-hand; one can be eccentric and not a genius and vice versa. Lewis's future family was neither. Bizarre behavior and instability highlight these scenes...truly, it was like something out of a lunatic asylum. By now, Lewis's voice has begun to grate on my nerves (everything he says has an urgent, whiny quality to it).The scenes of the future were downright disturbing and frightened my children. The middle of the picture was filled with scenes that are frantic and have a twisted, kind of Japanese anime look to them.There was not a single laugh-out-loud moment in this movie. There was no "fun" in this movie. On the contrary, it was dark; VERY dark. There appeared to be no uplifting message in this movie. "Keep moving forward" lost all meaning by the end of the movie, even with the Disney quote at the end.It's unclear to me what audience this movie was intended for; adults or children. Regardless, it was not enjoyed by either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film, but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. The New York Times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers' cartoon ('Hello my baby, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gal...'). But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox/Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor growing up, and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments....robots... - The servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to those in Robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look.All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from Disney at the end, implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we don't have the attention span for anything less.The villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated, and he's a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s.The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that Disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet the Robinsons, Meet a Life Purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to start, but I have plenty to write about and plenty of ink in my pen, so I'll just let my thoughts splash. Meet the Robinsons is one of the best animated films made in the past decade. Yes, better than Ratatouille, Monsters Inc., Ice Age, etc. Why? This film contains such a strong meaning, and the producers did everything they could to get their message across. Some of the main themes of the movie are living a life with purpose, failure is more important than success, and moving forward. After watching, I couldn't quite mask my appreciation for the film, so this article was written. Meet the Robinsons is supposedly a children's movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it along with the adults I watched the movie with. Now, going along with the catch-phrase of the movie, lets keep moving forward.Purpose is defined by different people in different ways. For example, Lewis' purpose was to revolutionize the world with his inventions. Whoa. Now that seems nearly insurmountable for some, but not for young Lewis. No matter how many times he failed, (with adoption, and the prototypes of his inventions) Lewis was always aspiring to improve the world in the best way that he possibly could. For him, it was inventions. For you, it is probably different. It could be film-making, writing, entrepreneurship, accounting, making music, drawing, or whatever you like to do. The bottom line is that there is always room, in any career field, for a competent individual who strives to live his/her life with purpose.Lewis is introduced to us a young inventor, who makes plenty of mistakes on his machines. Why is that? Lack of experience could be one reason, but it helps the filmmaker prove a point: failure is more important than success. If you take a look around, you might notice that the most successful/wealthy people in the world all fail. A lot. If you don't believe me, go ahead and ask them. Some brave/crazy souls have actually set themselves up to fail intentionally, just because of the experience and opportunity to better themselves. Seems a little extreme, but if you are motivated enough, you can tear through all of your failures. Remember: every time you fail, you are one step closer to success. This is all easier said than done, but who said any of this was easy? When we succeed without failure, we do not gain much. It can actually discourage us in the future when we come face-to-face with failure. So, the next time you are pondering about your past, don't be surprised to find that you have gained the most life experience from your failures. Remove your fear of failure, as Lewis learned to do, and you are bound to hit success in the forehead.This brings us to the main theme of the movie, moving forward. So what exactly does "Keep Moving Forward" mean? It is the act of continuing your mission, disregarding the obstacles you may face along the way. In Meet the Robinsons, it is often mentioned by the characters. Going back to the theme of living with a purpose, and failure is more important than success; moving forward goes hand in hand with these 2 aspects. If you don't live life with a purpose, you will certainly lack the motivation to keep moving forward. And if you don't understand the importance of failure in your life, how can you propel yourself to success? The fact is: IT IS TOUGH! The ability to keep moving forward is not an easy one to acquire; but if you can, it will be one of the best decisions you will ever make. The ability is a blessing that the entire Robinson family had. Like them, if you can keep moving forward no matter the situation, it will set you apart from everyone else.Meet the Robinsons is jam-packed with themes to implement in your everyday life, you just need to know how to look for theme. In almost every scene, there is an underlying message, and that makes the movie special. Moving forward, living life with a purpose, and learning to fail are just a few of the messages; the rest are for you to find. Meet the Robinsons showed us not to let any obstacle stand in our way, or any obstacle hinder our perception of success. Be like a Robinson; enjoy life, and no matter what, just keep moving forward!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the El Capitan Theater back in March 2007, honestly not knowing what to expect from a non-Pixar Disney animated flick. Let's be honest, Disney has been in a slump with movies like "The Wild," "Chicken Little," "Home on the Range" and "Brother Bear." And the trailers for this movie seemed more hokey than anything. All I can say is WOW. This was such a refreshing, witty, intelligent, heart-filled film, it was almost surprising that it wasn't a Pixar film. And it grows on you too. I find this movie climbing up my list of favorite animated films each time I watch it. I get choked up at the ending, as young Cornelius Robinson finally finds the family he was destined for to the heart-tugging ballad "Little Wonders" performed by Rob Thomas. For those who missed this film, I suggest you Netflix it, it will become a favorite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young boy inventor (whose inventions always seem to work on paper but never in practice) encounters a weird kid who zips him away from a school science-fair calamity, 30 years into the future.The movie approaches the time-travel theme it utilizes pretty well. Knowing that many of the ideas presented in time-travel stories have been used before, and some of the wild questions it poses have been addressed oftentimes before, it simply ignores the fact that other pioneers have passed this way, and just embraces all of the bizarre paradoxes inherent for comical effect. How would some of things that happen ever have happened if the time traveler changed history? This film answers, "Does it matter?" and then just has some goofy fun with it. The "twists" involving the future characters vs. their past-tense couunterparts, in some cases are obvious for adults, but then, adults were not the target audience. Kids will accept what the film says, and that's the key to enjoying this film. Trying to dissect it will ruin the fun.Characters are well defined and likable, even the "bad guys." Back stories are developed well, and the story is overall written well. Although you may predict some of the outcome, there are some surprises in how things end up, too. Recommended family viewing.</fullReview>

The two travel forward in time while Lewis learns more about the remarkable Robinson family. The clever Lewis has a number of fantastic inventions; and the most ambitious is a Memory Scanner, which he puts faith in to retrieve early memories of his mother and answers to why she gave him up for adoption. But oh no...his invention is stolen by the mean Bowler Hat Guy. Wilbur whisks his new friend the inventor away in his time machine; they find the villainous Bowler Hat Guy, save the future, and finally uncover the secret of Lewis' family. Animation and color are exceptional. The characters are "voiced" by: Angela Bassett, Jordan Fry, Daniel Hansen, Wesley Singerman, Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall.</fullReview>

I couldn't have agreed with him more. "Keep Moving Forward" The characters were great, the bonus features were good as well. I checked out the Disney website afterwords and found some screen savers, wallpaper and games, that I know my son will enjoy on his next visit.

		<fullReview>First of all this is a KIDS movie and a really good one too. No fart jokes, no swearing under there breath and most of the jokes were aimed at the kids because IT'S A KIDS movie. I took my 8 and 5 year olds and they loved it. I laughed out load probably 5-6 times. The jokes aimed at the adults were very funny. I also liked movie because all our of my kids are adopted and the main story is of Lewis who is too much of a techo-wizard-geek to get adopted. The theme of the movie is family and who is your real family. That part (for me) really hit home (which is another reason I gave this a 10). The movie has it all: Time travel, spoofs Japanese kung fu movies, singing frogs, dastardly villain (that's stupid), flying ships, crazy relatives, a dinosaur, a kids who misses the catch in the baseball game, you name it has it. The best part I thought was the slogan "Keep moving forward" used throughout the movie and how at the end we see where that comes from. Nice touch. If you have kids. The are zero regrets in seeing it (except maybe trying to explain time travel to a 5 year old, my 8 year old got it). If you or someone you know was adopted, you love it. If none of the above then you'll still at laugh a lot and not regret seeing it.10/10 Nice work Disney...</fullReview>

With this film, besides the fact that I could only recognize the great self-parody from Adam West, we are given a cast of no-names, (not to disrespect Angela Bassett or Laurie Metcalf, but they had five minute roles). I really think more animated films should go this route because it leaves all preconceptions at the door and allows the viewer to just experience the movie. I also know that the story itself is a big part in getting an audience absorbed into a film, and surprisingly, for a Disney film of late, this one delivers. I don't even remember the last time I had this much fun at one of their films, Pixar productions excluded.What was wonderful about the story was that it is a straightforward narrative about the importance of family and that love exists in places you may not see at first. Once our hero builds a machine to see into his past and find the identity of the mother that left him on the steps of an orphanage, he starts into motion a series of events that bring the world of the future into his own. Credit the writers, and I'm sure the author whose book this is based on, for visually showing little clues at the beginning that help us to decipher what goes on later in the Todayland of the future, (a nice little commentary on Disneyworld's own Tomorrowland theme park section in the present). What could have been used as a reveal- type device that the whole film hinges on, the aspect of what the Robinsons' connection to Lewis is, becomes an afterthought and simple plot point that enhances the story rather than define it. I found it easy to pick up on due to the clues hinted?think frogs?and when the truth is finally spoken aloud by the Bowler Hat Guy, he plays it up with a "Don't you see yet?" that is as much to the audience as it is to Lewis. The filmmakers never pander to the audience and always stay one-step ahead as they continue the story of how one lonely boy can have the best family in the world if he can just let go of a past that he never had. If we always look to the future, we can make our own destiny.In what is probably the craziest comedy I've seen in a while, the laughs deliver at all times. There are so many moments where you have to think to yourself, "what the heck just happened," and, "where did that come from?" The absurdity of it all, though, brings fantastic humor along with it and never takes away from the overall story progression. I don't know how much of the kookiness was Disney and how much was the source material, but either way it worked. As for the visuals that went along with it, I must say I was impressed. The reflections on all metallic and glass surfaces are amazing and the depth of field well done. How much of this is due to me seeing it in 3D, I don't know, but I will say that if you go to check it out, definitely see the full experience. Besides experiencing the surface work and looking through rainy glass, I admit that I totally flinched during the meatball fight.The fact that really interests me, because of the intelligence and embrace of the surreal, is how much John Lasseter and Pixar changed once Disney bought them. This film was supposed to be released last year, but Lasseter decided to push it back in order to solve some problems he saw with it. It is weird because this film is very much an amalgum of Disney looks and story with the character and sensibility of Pixar. If Lasseter did change a lot, I just have to say that I am even more anxious to see what's next, knowing that he has decided to reopen the 2D animation department and bring the glory days back. Disney seems to be in good hands for the future, and hopefully will continue to keep moving forward themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at Pixar's level, but fun nonetheless; the "Bowler Hat Guy" rules, though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see the new Disney film in 3D, so I can't say whether it plays a lot worse without it. It certainly is a lot of fun in 3D, though (but then, if you've seen 3D movies before, it's pretty much the same as it always has been). The story here is slight and somewhat nonsensical, but it moves so quickly that you don't have any time to notice. The visuals are eye-popping and everything looks like candy. And it's genuinely amusing. The villain, known as the Bowler Hat Guy, is one of the funniest characters to appear in any Disney film. In the distant future, I can imagine that he could be all that's remembered about this film, accompanied by his robotic bowler hat and pet t-rex (the gag in the commercials where the dinosaur can't grab the protagonist is what sold me on this movie). It's also nice to see that Disney didn't pack the film with movie stars. Angela Bassett is the biggest name (and you've got to wonder why they bothered to hire a big name at all for the small role she plays), with the next biggest being Laurie Metcalf (you'll remember her for playing Roseanne's sister on the sitcom, um, Roseanne). Oh, and Adam West, Harland Williams, Tom "Songebob Squarepants" Kenny and Tom Selleck have small parts. A fun time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D elevates so-so film to a perfectly enjoyable one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though "Meet the Robinsons" doesn't offer fantastic storytelling--it feels like an original feature from the Cartoon Network--it is a technical and design marvel. The storytelling is just good enough to keep all ages entertained, but the character design is quite good and the 3D presentation is a wonder to behold. The film is preceded by a classic Disney cartoon that, while in 3D, looks very flat. The characters look like paper cutouts which actually diminishes enjoyment of the cartoon. The 3D flattens the on screen characters and makes them look more artificial.But when "Robinsons" starts, you immediately note the contrast between classic 3D and the new Disney technique. The film opens with a gee whizzy rainstorm that's very effective. Rain falls in the foreground, while in the background a mother places her child on the steps of an orphanage. Though the scene is a dramatic staple, the effective 3D technique breaths new life into this clichéd moment.What follows is pretty standard animated fare about time travel, following your dreams, finding a place in the world, etc. The film borrows pretty liberally--pays homage(?)--to many other films including a climactic chase with moments ripped directly from "Return of the Jedi" and "The Matrix".But the character design is fantastic, filling the movie with interesting caricatures that are practically Dickensian in their lovely grotesqueness. Two favorites include the lanky arch villain and the hyper-jock gym coach. These characters are comic inspirations brought to life by the 3D effect. "Robinsons" takes the gimmick of 3D and uses it to elevate a so-so film to a perfectly enjoyable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall good movie, might scare younger viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just took my 5 year old to see this movie and wanted to underscore that the themes are a little advanced for that age. Older kids will understand the adoptions, orphanage and time travel, but some of it was a little scary for a five year old. We saw the 3D version and it had some great visual effects, but again some of it was a little violent and it might scare a younger audience. My son wanted to remove his glasses and quit watching at various parts in the movie. It will remind older viewers of Back to the Future a little. I liked that it has a good overall message of never quit trying and move past the bad things that can happen to you, but it was probably more entertaining for the adults and older children than it is for young ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Disney film everyone should see!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is amazing! My love for Disney had began to dwindle over the past few years (probably due to being in my early 20s now) but this film has reinvented my faith in their films.This is a very fast and funny film that had me in stitches throughout. It is also very moving and inspiring and it's message "Keep moving forward" is celebrated during the whole film. While it encourages it's viewers to remember past events it also reinforces how important it is to look towards the future and to not let the past hold you back. Walt Disney's quote at the end actually brought tears to my eyes and it shows how the people who made this film truly believe it's message. After you watch the DVD extras you find out more about the film's director and can see how this film was very close to his heart. It also shows the future in a good light-as a bright,colourful and exciting world. Many films depict the future as grey and depressing so this film's vision is refreshingly different.Everyone should see this film, if not for the jokes, laughs, action or twists, then for the film's inspiring message alone-Keep moving forward!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 35 minutes of Meet the Robinsons is an incomprehensible mishmash of manic activity. It makes for and odd dichotomy, as kids watching it are probably torn by confusion as to what is going on, and simultaneously entertained by the manic humor on the screen.Its the story about an orphaned kid who attends a science fair to show off one of his many inventions and is accosted by another kid who reputedly comes from the future. Thats about all I got out of the first few minutes as it--I kept looking over at my kids to see if they were as confused as me, but the non-stop action kept them glued to the screen. Although ultimately this movie's plot makes sense, its probably too complicated for the younger set to "get", and it really made me think that the creators were a bunch of stoned kids putting the craziest crap on the screen that they could think of.All in all, MTR is highly imaginative, visually stunning, and the kid from the future is animated to make him look like a Jim Carrey clone, which I doubt was accidental, although Jim wasn't credited as far as I could see.This film could probably do better with multiple viewings on DVD, but its worth seeing on the big screen because of the great visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun movie with great puns ... and a 1953 Donald Duck cartoon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who woulda thunk that Meet the Robinsons would be a grand time for adults as well as kids? I took a co-worker who'd never seen a 3-D movie, mainly because it was in 3-D and had a terrific time. (My friend laughed every time something was thrust out of the screen into our faces.) As a prior commentator said, the 3-D is not overdone but when it's employed, it's fun. Unlike the throw-away glasses theaters provided in the '50's and '80's, the glasses the box office gives out this time are solid and even fit comfortably over a pair of normal glasses. Before the feature begins we were treated to a cartoon Disney studios had created in 3-D over 50 years ago ... one where Chip and Dale plague Donald Duck. This was my first viewing of Disney Digital 3-D but it certainly won't be my last. The image is strikingly clear and the illusion of depth is excellent. It was a treat to see a cartoon and animated feature played straight for laughs with little or no sexual innuendo. You'll really enjoy the Robinsons, the quirky scene shifts and the great puns. By all means, go to a theater showing it in 3-D ... although I've been told by people who saw it "flat" that it's still a super family show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you want from a movie? Or better, of the various types of movies you encounter, what are the types of things that give your soul value that you recognize?I think the more time I spend with film the more I value things that can only be found in film, that are extreme in this quality and that touch reality with the most economical and effective shorthand. Abstraction and the contrast between intense and subtle, indirect.Disney isn't usually the place I go for these experiences, at least not recently. They used to be experts at manipulating the code, the abstractions that touch little triggers in our minds that spin stories. That means the storyteller doesn't have to weave much of the story directly, rather play the storytellying instrument in our minds as an organ would be played. She works the machine. Animation (and porn) seems to be where these triggers are purest. Romantic comedies which are a blend of the two.Here's why I liked this and why I recommend it to you.The story is clumsy in the beginning. I think we can expect this. Kids are patient for a while and there was a deliberate decision to set up some lengthy story lines at the beginning so that we can have an amazingly economical wrapup at the end. What we remember is the end of course, so this is a good tradeoff. And the story is corny as can be. That's what you get when you abstract into this space. Audiences yearn for these stories and though I do not, they don't bother me. Much. You can see the influence of Lassiter (from Pixar). Supposedly the whole thing was redone after he saw the nearly finished project. In a way, its better storywise than what does from scratch. Its darker. The evil here has a lower bottom than you'll find in Pixar projects. Their evil is a matter of music and escape. The evil here is palpable, a mix of human evil (eventually reversed) and some supernatural evil that is much deeper. It derives from and plays with noir.Its all abstract. The core of the story is "writing" the future: "moving forward," used as a catchphrase as well as a cinematic philosophy.So yes, even on the story end, I would be sending you to this. But mix that with the artwork....What I saw was the three D version. Now you should know that once I traveled across the country (talking US here) to see the only copy, recently restored of the three D "Dial M for Murder." That technology required two projectors, meticulously reconstructed and synchronized. And it required finding and restoring two independent copies of the film, one for the left eye and the other for the right. It was an amazing experience, seeing how Hitchcock, who invented the curious camera, used on-screen space.So I'm a sucker for three D films, except for the so far silly things at Imax. These guys got it right. Its great, what they do. There's some self-aware stuff there just to show you they know you are there and aware of the effect. It increases the noir reality. But mostly, the three D is used subtly, in the service of the narrative. Its rarely done, you know and I actually recognized some clear copies of effects from that old Hitchcock film. See this, its very good.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 102-minute Kid's Cereal Commercial (Spoilers, Be Warned!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know those nauseatingly obnoxious commercials for kid's cereals that you see spoofed on Adult Swim, SNL, and other satire shows? You know, the ones made for the attention span of a flea, with the wise-crackin' kids, brain dead bumbling adults and a one-liner a second? Expand that into a feature film and you have Meet The Robinsons.I don't take any delight in ripping movies apart. I love films and must admit that I'm pretty easily entertained. But this one stunk so badly I felt it my movie-going duty to warn folks to steer clear. Very clear. This is the most dreadful, unimaginative, vacuous animated film to have the Disney label on it in some time. Glimpses of creativity are so spread very thin over a ridiculous story and god-awful acting. It's stunning that the producers can go from fully developed, fleshed-out characters and fantastic story lines to a stereotypical jock gym teacher with no purpose other than to tell nerds to 'give me 20 laps.' Come on guys, you can do better than empty laughs at a hyper-caffeinated woman channeling Aladdin's Genie with every sentence.Proof of the screenwriters' laziness is the nonexistent logic of the story. Lewis builds a memory machine to help him track his forgotten mother, but there's no setup or reason for him to enter the device into the school science fair instead of just testing and using it. A short time later, he's zipped off in the time machine by Wilbur with the intention of taking him back to the botched science fair and rewrite history. So why does Wilbur take him to the distant future first, then explain that they're going back to the past they just left? I know, I know, "it's only a kid's movie." But, to paraphrase Matt Groening, 'cartoons today insult the intelligence of kids.' Do your kids (and yourself, for that matter) a favor and treat 'em to something with more than just pretty colors and spastic movements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(Too) Colorful, a bit too much in a too short time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could have been that kind of quite stupid, quite meaningless but watchable Disney CGI as Chicken Little: very fast, full of possibilities, full of ideas thrown on the screen, full of jokes that partly fall flat... Actually, it still is (except from the flat jokes). But John Lasseter changed it a year ago. As we know, he told the director he didn't like the bad guy (didn't find him too scary) and didn't understand why the main character was an orphan. 'Because I was an orphan too', the director said, so Lasseter asked him, okay, then make us feel what it means to you, being an orphan. So he did. The result? The movie got depth - the scenes about being an orphan and getting a new family are really quite touching. The bad guy's sidekick became really evil with own diabolic plans - well, I think it created a little bit too dark aspect to this mainly pastel-colored kids' movie. There is one scene where we can see the evil sidekick's world; it looks like a scene stolen right from the floor of the editing room of The Matrix, and the family our hero loves turns into a group of kind of zombies for a minute. Even if it is not without reason (this way we can feel how much is at stake), it is simply too much, too dark. I felt some problems with the pacing too; maybe it's because I am 30 and not 10, some scenes seemed to be too fast (e.g. meeting the Robinson family is just crazy, a total mess, the most annoying part of the movie - maybe the only annoying part) while at the beginning sometimes it was all talking heads. Also I felt for a 102-minute movie there is too much story to tell, too much crazy detail from the antagonist's and protagonist's past to the family and the dinosaur and and and..., which might be the result of John Lasseter's involvement. On the positive side, actually every scene seems to be working; the only thing this movie really needed was...time. Ten more minutes for the running time, one more year for John Lasseter perfecting the movie even more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a weird film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lewis is an orphan boy that has natural affinity for inventions, but anyone goes well. One day, when he is going to present his newest invention to a "science party" a Bowler Hat guy and a mysterious kid from the future appear and the result is disastrous. The kid results to be Wilbur Robinson and came from the future, after some strange happenings, Lewis travels to future and, then, he meets the weird family of The Robinsons. First of all, the plot is the typical for kids: as simple as possible. But the simpleness ends there, most of the jokes and gags are quite absurd, much more than you'd expect in a Disney's movie, most of the time things are happening too quickly to really realize what's happening and while presenting the Robinson family, too much character appear at the same time. It's perfectly possible to lose the sense of the movie, and probably kids will understand less than half of the jokes, as many are absurd other they need some "expirience" to understand them. For an adult the movie is unexpectedly funny, like police squad or the recent scary movies, but it is from Disney: humour is not so gross and there's no sex jokes. It is probable that the adult enjoy the movie more than his children, but although being quite stupid (the plot is just silly), I laughed a lot.</fullReview>

Suddenly some of the characters start shouting and do funny actions. The plot is pretty stupid and the story goes uninteresting till the end. I think this movie is meant for children ten and under. There are no, and I mean it, no jokes in the movie. Animation too looked the same. The characters looked as if they were lifted from Incredibles. Disney should start making different kind of animation. Towards the end, there was some of the Disney touch, but that couldn't fulfill the stupidity they had done in the beginning. Its worth a go once for hysterical Disney fans and toddlers. But it is not so entertaining for teens like us who expect more from Disney movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's the basic concept: Boy is left on the doorstep of an orphanage as a baby. Boy grows to the ripe age of 12-going-on-13 in said orphanage under the care of the likable Mildred. Boy is exceptionally creative and bright, and likes to invent things. Unbeknownst to boy, an evil mastermind from the future is trying to steal his science fair project. Boy is saved by the quick-talking Wilbur, also from the future. Boy meets Wilbur's extensive family, and learns more about himself and what he can accomplish. Boy returns to past with this knowledge and that he needs to "keep moving forward," gets adopted, and stops the evil mastermind from ever becoming just that.Not a bad concept, right? Except "Meet the Robinsons" never fleshes it out. We get lots of cutesy jokes (the funniest of which were in the previews) and funny little subplots (like the singing frogs), and a TON of quirky characters, but not much of a story. Disney could have done so much more with this movie; such as cutting about a third of the characters out (why don't we see more of Mildred? She seemed like a good character. Little Goob didn't seem as stupid as older, evil Goob, and he also seemed to LIKE Lewis at first), and allowing us to get to know more of the better characters (honestly, why did the Robinsons need so much extended family?).I am loathe to dismiss this as "just a kid's movie." A good kid's movie is a good movie, period. An eh kid's movie is just an eh movie, period. This is eh. It's not in the same vein as "Toy Story" or "The Incredibles," or even "Cars." It's a lot of flash and not much substance. I'd wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not All That Shines is Gold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the technical aspects are superb. I'm still debating whether there was a screenplay. Most of the time I felt like I was seeing an overlong preview or a series of stand up comedy routines. The visual gags were not impressive or amusing, and the characterizations were poorly written. It's a pity that one of the most exciting genres in film-making nowadays is beginning to suffer from the same malaise that pervades regular movies."Meet The Robinsons" brings to mind many other sources of inspiration. Unfortunately, there it doesn't manage to maintain the quality of those classics. What worked beautifully in films like "Back to The Future" and "The Absent Minded Professor" is not remotely obvious. It is pretty bad, considering that technology now makes it affordable and possible to create worlds that were only figments of someone's imagination.Can someone tell me what's going on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disney Feel-Good With Horror in the Middle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a Disney aficionado as a kid. That was when they were known for family friendly and kind spirited productions. Now a 40 year old with two young daughters, we go to the movies and aim for "G" rated movies. This movie has lovely animation, very creative and upbeat. Unfortunately, the crazed pace and ADD like quality of the actions and dialog combined with a mean-spirited atmosphere spoil the mix. On top of that, right in the middle of the flick you get an unnecessary freakish segment of dark, horror-like action that is downright terrifying to a younger kid. If you heard from your parents or grandparents that some scenes in "Bambi" were scary, this is nothing compared to the freak-show inserted into this movie. It seems that the profit obsessed execs over at Disney may have investments in pharmaceutical companies that they'd like to boost along long-term by helping grow an exploding generation of neurotic/ADD U.S. children exposed to a cultural climate of terror. I give this a solid 1 star, if Disney decides to clean up the production, I'd give the movie a 7. Disney is definitely a has-been and cannot compare to Pixar's productions. Maybe that's a reflection of Disney's culture of greed as rumored on the streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better leave Canada alone... We are your friends, remember!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. It is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why. Stop teaching the kids of the United States of America to think they own the planet. Such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations. Even in jest. I would never refer to the USA as 'Alberta South'. Walt would never put us down, so why start now. Other than that the film was pretty goofy, better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been much better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an "ok" movie about an orphan with a nice theme/message, but it could have/should have been much better. Some of the things that bothered me: Many ideas and characters were stolen...er..."borrowed" from other sources. Some examples: Lewis: A cute young Boy Genius..hmm. Anyone ever heard of Jimmy Neutron? Singing frog: hmmm.... directly taken from the Warner Brothers singing frog mascot. Traveling through time and making changes in your past can make you disappear.... very reminiscent of a little movie called "Back to the Future". There were many other such instances, but as I didn't take notes, I can't remember them all. But you get the picture.In addition, when you "Meet the Robinsons" family, the scene is very odd and disjointed. My girlfriend said it felt like a "drug flashback" (not that she would know). I will say that there were a few funny moments, but a lot of jokes just did not work for me. Thankfully, there were no f*rt jokes (a rarity these days). The animation was pretty good but nothing groundbreaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my 7-yr-old and his two friends today and we all had a terrible time. A complete waste of time for the animators, Meet The Robinsons was poorly conceived, unoriginal, anxiety-driven, misdirected, and completely age-inappropriate. A couple of weeks ago we went to see a wonderful program of Pixar Shorts which was original, witty, good-natured, and fun for everyone - the complete opposite of Meet The Robinsons. Unfortunately for us all, the price of the great Pixar films of the last decade is that we have to now sit through horrible, directionless, inappropriate garbage several times a year. I imagine the Meet The Robinsons "Happy Meal" is next. Somebody please stop these people. Save your time and money, and snuggle up with a good book with your child. You'll both be better off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why doesn't the MPAA realize that kids are frightened of abandonment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is loud and violent. Immediately, upon viewing, my son says "where are his parents", and, when I explain, "will I be in an orphanage?". Sure, it's important for him to understand these issues. But light family fare is no the place to start learning lessons of parental death and separation. Disney has been making psyche-altering movies since they killed off Bambi's mom - and they haven't stopped since. Please consider the message your children are getting when they go see Disney films. Intelligent characters are isolated and vindictive, strong characters are cruel and aggressive. In addition the action scenes contain "peril", which is the MPAA's code word for movies that should be PG. It should be PG, and so should the last 5 G films they made.</fullReview>
