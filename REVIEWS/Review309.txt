		<shortDescription>An almost classic Western with a fantastic cast, great dialog and gruesome horror elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a rather special genre-mix of classic Western themes and gory, insane B-movie horror elements. Films like the quite watchable The Burrowers (2008) and Dead Birds (2004) have mixed those ingredients before with some success, but while those two were undoubtedly B-movies, Bone Tomahawk never feels like your typical straight to VOD genre film.What really stands out right from the start is the writing: the precise dialog and never less than interesting characters are what really makes this film a winner in my book. The premise might not be very original - it's Western to the bone (pun intended) and very much in the tradition of great classics like The Searchers - but despite its dark themes, there is so much understated humour in Bone Tomahawk that I felt at times reminded of some of the characters in Jim Jarmusch's films. And Richard Jenkins' character, back-up deputy Chicory, is down-right hilarious. The acclaimed (and Oscar-nominated) actor clearly has a blast with his part, and the same can absolutely be said for the rest of the cast. This is a film that is willing to spend a very considerable part of its running time just building atmosphere and exploring the different characters, and the action/horror moments are actually few and far between. According to some recent interviews with the producers, the excellently written characters are also what drew A-list actors Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson to the film, despite its micro-budget, and if Russell hadn't been so committed to playing the part of Sheriff Franklin Hunt, the film wouldn't have been made.In spite of its tiny budget, this is a quality film that really should have had a wide theatrical release; everything from the A-list cast to the excellent cinematography, sound and production design practically scream for the big screen. A word to the wise, though; after some initial mayhem, the film moves along at a very considerate pace (and at over two hours it's a rather long film), so for those who seek entertainment heavy on action with non-stop shoot-outs, gory thrills and scares, look elsewhere: this is probably not the film for you (and perhaps also not the film that was promised in the trailers). But if you like old-school Westerns with great characters (played by great character actors), great atmosphere and deadpan humour, and you ALSO don't mind (very!) gory thrills, scares and some bloody shoot-outs along the way, I believe you will enjoy this film very much. I know I did: 7.5 stars out of 10.Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget And B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/All-Time Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh, original blend of genres that results in a new cult classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a great example of what Hollywood is sorely lacking these days: Originality! Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is slow burning western/horror flick that keeps building the suspense until the finale. It's not an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is loaded with action, but it has enough to keep your interest. It has more of a typical western feel to it in terms of character development. The dialogue is spot on for this genre. The acting is superb and plot is genuine. I think that it speaks volumes about the script given the fact that the actors signed on for minimum pay (that means they WANTED to be in this film for the script and plot). The gore is definitely there for the horror fans, although I would say that if you are seeking a lot of gore, you may be disappointed. It does have some that is pretty graphic. I definitely would not let children or even some teenagers watch this, its an adult movie. If you are a fan of westerns, I think you'll like it a lot. If you are a Kurt Russell fan, you will not be disappointed (this was his first western since Tombstone). Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox make an excellent supporting cast and demonstrate their acting skills well. This is a new cult classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Very Special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished this and can't believe there's no buzz... I just HAD to enter a review as its easily one of the best movies of the year. Take a dash of your favourite exploitation film and mix it with your favourite old school western and you almost have Bone Tomahawk. A movie that has a simple premise of love and revenge. It starts out with 4 very different characters traversing the old west frontier on a rescue mission to save a fellas wife who was kidnapped by savages. Hilarious one liners delivered with subtle perfection by our 4 heroes who you will grow to love throughout this adventure. Richard Jenkins character Chicory is especially endearing and it even features horror legend Sid Haig, what a treat! However a little warning as what starts out as a western revenge adventure turns into some visceral horror towards the end which may jar some viewers. This movie has all of the trappings of a classic and it's really too bad there's not more people talking about it at this point. If you are a genre fan there is no way you will not love this movie. Really something special that I foresee earning cult status, one of those movies we will look back on and wonder how did the public and critics miss this? Watch this immediately!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well-made, very intriguing western/horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected some sort of comedy-horror/western hybrid, but what I mostly got was a serious western with noticeable horror touches thrown in (until its third act, where the horror becomes even more prominent). I was surprised at how seriously the film took itself, which I now think is a strength. It could have been so easy to just make it yet another goofy horror/comedy, but what we got instead is a very restrained, very well-made, sort of classic adventure story. The directing is on point and there's a great control over the tone of the film. The decision to have so much of the film silent and without any noticeable score was a great decision. The cast is aces and the three real supporting players (Fox, Russell, Jenkins) all get their time to shine without anything being forced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a 2015 western-horror written and directed by S. Craig Zahler and starring Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins.The story follows four men, the town's sheriff (Russell), a cowboy (Wilson), the back-up deputy (Jenkins) and a gunslinger (Fox) who go on an expedition to retrieve a group of captives from some cannibalistic cave-dwellers. The four actors really shine in this movie, giving very good performances, especially Matthew Fox as John Brooder. It's good to see Fox in such a good role, considering he hasn't done that much since the Lost years.The movie gives us a very good look at the Old West. As the four men make their journey, we learn more and more about them and their motivations. Sheriff Franklin Hunt is a man who wants nothing more than the safety of his town and is willing to do anything to protect it. Arthur O'Dwyer is a cowboy who has a serious leg injury but still goes into this expedition, because for him the stakes are personal. Chicory is a simple-minded old deputy but with amazing loyalty for the sheriff. John Brooder is a well-dressed well- mannered gentleman who joins the ride because he is a trigger-happy gunslinger with a personal vendetta against the natives.The script is very well-written, giving us full tri-dimensional characters. Also the dialogue and the mannerisms feel very authentic, transporting you back to the Old West. As I said in the beginning, this movie is a horror-western, and that really shows in the third act. There are some brutal, gore-scenes that will not be easy to digest (no pun intended) for those faint of heart. One slight negative about this movie is the pacing. Sometimes it feels a little too slow, but not enough so that it will ruin your enjoyment.Bone Tomahawk is a very good movie, with an interesting premise and a nice twist on the western genre. It's a movie that could have gone wrong in so many ways, but surprisingly, it doesn't. Sporting some great characters and an intriguing storyline, Bone Tomahawk deserves an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strong Western with the Brutality of a Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is about a small group of cowboys who set out in search of a group of cannibals who have kidnapped some of their townspeople, including the wife of one of the rough riders. It may sound similar to a lot of other westerns in the sense that it's a rescue story, which is somewhat true in the beginning. The first half of the movie is a great character drama as it follows the group of four for a few day and nights as they travel to their destination. This is where some people might have a problem with the film and the pacing might become an issue. During this time, we get expanded knowledge about the men involved and I found it rather entertaining because the route to their destination is just as dangerous as the destination itself. Yes, the movie could have been trimmed down by about 10-12 minutes, but it wasn't too slow that I lost interest (like many others I have read did).It is during this time where acting comes into play and, for the most part, it's all on point, especially Kurt Russell! To no surprise, he is the highlight of the movie and is no one to be trifled with. He gives a very gritty and convincing performance worthy of his filmography. As well as the three other gentlemen that ride along with him, they all hit their marks (even my boy Matthew Fox from LOST). The only real problem outside of the pacing is Lili Simmons' awkwardly dull performance (mostly during her captivity). Normally I wouldn't point out such a small characters performance but it was seriously lacking. It could be because her character was poorly written for the type of situation she was in. For example, why was she so relaxed and showing barely any emotion in such a frightening situation? Yes she could have broken down mentally but that doesn't let her off the hook. Also her line delivery was highly questionable and her overall performance felt like dead weight.But it is the final 45 minutes of the movie that will leave everyone talking. Bone Tomahawk explodes into the horror genre with its cannibalistic violence (is this the return of cannibalistic horror movies?). The action is swift, and I mean very swift, it really comes out of nowhere. And this was what I loved most about the movie, you know they are getting closer and closer to unprecedented evil but you aren't quite sure when or where they will strike. It's this trepidation that makes the final third of the movie so thrilling. They're clearly unprepared for the gauntlet that is waiting for them. I won't spoil anything but the movie really doesn't shy away from violence once they get to where they are going. Bone Tomahawk transcends from a slow moving western into a carnage fueled frenzy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare, but effective blend of genre's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: 7.5/10 A rock-solid western in the beginning, Bone Tomahawk transforms midway to become one of the most gruesome horror movies this year. It's not an unlikely combination. There have been a few titles in the past that falls under the western-horror category, but not many of them delivered so well.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie has a smart and tight screenplay. Zahler's story is unflinching and he never dilutes the intensity of what is shown on-screen. He succeeds in maintaining an air of unpredictability throughout the whole feature, and yes Zahler's name is definitely something to look out for in the future.The story is set in the American old west, maybe during the end of 1800's. Four men are on a mission to rescue a few kidnapped people from a tribe of inbred man-eating savages. The quartet includes The Sheriff of the town Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell), an injured Cowboy Arthur O' Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) whose wife Samantha O' Dwyer (Lili Simmons) is one among the captives, an armed gentleman John Brooder (Matthew Fox) and the Backup Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins).The casting is okay but not great. The veteran actors Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins give their best. Russell gives a fine performance as the Sheriff, making the whole premise believable. Jenkins' character Chicory might be the most likable of all and his role feels so natural and belonged in the whole plot. Patrick Wilson does a commendable effort, and so does Mathew Fox. The only character that appears to be misplaced is the town doctor Samantha O' Dwyer played by Lili Simmons. Her performance doesn't seem to blend in the 1800's period.The cannibals were nightmarishly original. And their savagery is not just spoken of; rather it is shown in detail. The camera doesn't shift around much when it comes to the bloody violence. The eerie atmosphere together with the unpredictably quick turnarounds makes the feature quite effective. A major plus of this movie is that it sticks to being as realistic as possible. Be it the dialogues, the situations, the acting or even the gut-wrenching violence and gore, Bone Tomahawk is realism to the bone.Recommended watch, if you can sit through a good old, slow paced, formal talked western in the former half and all the bloody gore in the later half, but ultimately the movie pays off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far one of the best horror movies this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title says it all. No other words best to describe this movie other than to say that this is the best horror/western movie this year and i would venture to say that this movie probably has taken the cup for being the best this year. If you are a fan of horror or western movies then you should definitely check it out. Kurt Russel, Patrick Williams give strong performances. All the four main characters describe one simple notion throughout the movie. Russell--A town sheriff who would do anything to fulfill his duty as a town sheriff and bring the criminals to justice. Williams--A loving husband who would do anything to bring his love back even in the face of immense odds.There are some scenes in this movie which will definitely shock you being so gory and violent and this is coming from me being a long time horror movie fan who is not easily shocked. To give you an idea how certain scenes will be imprinted in your mind for some time is like when you watched the movie Sinister and there were some scenes that you could not forget for a while.Finally do not take my word for it or someone else's and give this movie a try and then decide for yourself. You ll not be disappointed.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2015 where we are used to seeing none stop CGI, thin plot, endless action trash...here we have the opposite, a real movie gem. It's a classically crafted western that ended up as a brutal cannibal masterpiece.At first it does make the audience feel that theirs not much happening compared to general modern cinema but what we do have is quality acting, cinematography and script building up to the shocking and unpredictable end I can't recommend this enough, unlike most films of today it's not made for profit it's made for quality film making, something which I fear today is few and far betweenGo watch it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film very tired the other night and found myself sitting up alert immediately !Pleasantly surprised I found it an entertaining macabre mystery thriller horror with outstanding performances by a quality ensemble of veteran actors working with good dialogue from a competent script. Normally expect relative unknowns to do this type of film and end up with a B-Movie type of re-working of 'Hills with Eyes', but instead of the atomic bomb test in-bread cannibalistic mutants we are dealing with North American cannibalistic Indian savage troglodytes, That somehow have avoided being massacred by the U.S Union Calvary Army and take revenge on some trespassers on their Indian burial ground and follow one back to a small town, end up killing and kidnapping some locals including a young woman whose husband, town sheriff, deputy and local gun slinger go in hot pursuit.There is some elements from Ravenous 2001, Japanese horror film 'The Audition' with hints of blinding and limb amputations. A quality low budget movie with top notch acting from a first time director who wrote the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I took a punt on this and bought it on Blu Ray without seeing it first. I'd read the reviews warning of it being slow but didn't find it so. To me it was establishing characters in realistic ways.I like it's attention to real details, the importance of tending your horses, packing food, making sure to rest etc.I liked all of the 4 main characters but thought Matthew Fox was fabulous. Really enjoyed his performance and portrayal of the character.A most enjoyable film and people really shouldn't be put off by the warnings of it being slow. If you were okay with the pacing of The American with George Clooney, then you'll have no problems with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to give you guys a professional review. I'll give you an honest account of why I rate it so high. At least you know I'm not trying to sell it too much.The only reason I even gave this film was for a few reasons: - 1: It had an interesting title. Bone Tomahawk... It's intriguing isn't it? I like these kinds of titles because they give a hint of something different and innovative. Not going to rant about other films but titles like 'Sinister' and 'The Conjuring' just sound a bit normal to me I guess 2: The good rating on IMDb. Yes, I know it is not a good idea to do this but I gave it a go because it has the horror genre and is rated above 6. I think at the time I was planning on watching it the rating was at about 8 I think. 3: Lili Simmons is in it. I don't fancy her or wanted to see it to see her nude. I was just curious because I've been thoroughly enjoying the series Banshee and I'm checking out where the Banshee cast are also starring in.Onto the movie. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I thought it was going to be corny and similar to Hateful Eight. I guess the fact Kurt Russell looks exactly like he does in the Tarantino epic gave me this impression. The film had a very authentic feel to it in many ways. It comes down to the dialogue. The way the main characters chat to each other in a conversational tone (especially the old geezer who rambles on during their cross country walk) was a breath of fresh air in my humble opinion. I've been enjoying The Walking Dead TV series but the dialogue in that show can be very wooden and over;y dramatic. This can be annoying in American TV shows because it is not realistic for everybody to make powerful poignant lines of dialogue all the time.Another aspect I liked in this film was the lack of music. Films have this habit of spoon-feeding us how to feel at certain moments. The only time I even noticed the background sound was during the most disturbing scene (AND MY GOD IT SHOCKED ME!!) in which I think this weird low frequency sound started rumbling. I suppose the reason I really enjoyed this film is because I had no hype leading up to it nor did I check out reviews or spoilers. This is probably the best way to watch a movie really. Overall I highly recommend it. The film is quite long and maybe some might find it boring but I didn't. I just let the movie take me on the same journey as the four men.Best horror film I've seen since The Kill List....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising belated western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director and writer S. Craig Zahler offers us in this movie his debut as a film genre: a western.The starting point of argument is not new, kidnapping and attempted rescue, but how to develop it is original, blending genres western with terror. Structurally it is a "Road movie" half of the film is dedicated to show the four protagonists walk. The preamble is only a requirement, but interesting, is totally elegant and perfectly defines the characters. The final section, when the subject gives a more unexpected turn, brings great personality to the whole.The casting is superb. Russell is splendid in character sheriff. The actor and rest of the cast is working proficiently.The influences in the film are many: presents us with characters who resemble Ford (like Matthew Fox), others that seem taken from "Rio Bravo." It has situations and dialogues reminiscent of Tarantino and his "Django" and a surprising Paleolithic tribe of Indians, that has nothing to do with the Comanches Music is scarce, and only has a few little touches in some transitions between scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will delight fans of both genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although a few recent attempts to re-energise the genre for a modern audience have failed both critically and commercially (Wild Wild West (1999) and The Lone Ranger (2013) come immediately to mind), film-makers still find themselves irresistibly drawn to the western genre, which is so steeped in Hollywood history yet ripe for re- visioning. This year alone has seen Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's The Revenant tell a tale of America's rough fur-trapping forefathers, John Maclean spin a violent love story involving a cigar-chomping outlaw in Slow West, and Tarantino lock eight genre archetypes together in a room for The Hateful Eight.The most original, engaging and surely destined for cult success is Bone Tomahawk, a western told with a tip of the hat to the John Ford and Howard Hawks classics of the 1950's and 60's, yet with a heavy dose of horror inspired by the grimy inbred/cannibal films of the 70's brought to terrifying life by Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. It doesn't sound like a harmonious mix, but it certainly is (as long as you have the stomach for it). Opening with a particularly gruesome throat-slicing, author and first-time director S. Craig Zahler makes his love for the grotesque clear from the outset, but then settles down to set in motion a classical men-on-a-mission yarn, only with the knowledge that cave-dwelling monstrosities are the destination.After butchering and robbing a group of travellers, low-lives Buddy (Sig Haig) and Purvis (David Arquette) stumble upon some kind of sacred burial ground. The tribe responsible make their displeasure at the thieves' arrival immediately known, and only Purvis escapes with his life. Arriving in the town of Bright Hope, Purvis is quickly rumbled as a thief and shot in the leg by sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) who, assisted by his back-up deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and the town doctor Samantha (Lili Simmons), imprison him for the night. However, the next morning Purvis, Samantha and Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) have vanished, with a local stable boy disembowelled and some horses stolen.In The Seachers (1956) fashion, Hunt and Chicory set out to confront the cave-dwellers (dubbed 'troglodytes') along with Samantha's cowboy husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), heavily injured with a broken leg, and the bigoted yet brutally efficient gunslinger Brooder (Matthew Fox). At 132 minutes, Bone Tomahawk is mainly about the journey which will take days even if things go to plan, never mind the threat of bandits and whatever the creatures are awaiting them. Zahler's witty script and some great casting choices ensure that their odyssey is never slow. Russell is Russell but he is still great, while Wilson has by now perfected wounded masculinity. However, it's Jenkins and Fox who stand out. Jenkins is a great actor so it is to be expected, but Seth Rogen's sly dig at Fox in Knocked Up (2007) always rang true with me. Here, he carefully treads the line between despicable and cool, making us hate him yet still root for him. Despite being the most disposable of the leads, he is the most interesting character of the group.After much character-building and obstacles to overcome, the film doesn't hold back when we finally arrive at the end. Without venturing into torture-porn territory, Zahler delivers a series of brutal scenes and delights in exploring new ways to make you wince in horror. At one point, I feared that one male character was about to be raped, but then something even worse and unexpected happens, which is made all the more effective by the absence of CGI. It's enough to delight fans of both genres, and the blend of old- fashioned derring-do and no-nonsense horror makes for the kind of experience genre fans long for. While it may be slightly self- indulgent given the heavy running time, this is only slight criticism of a film that feels like it ends at just the right moment. Injecting new life into both genres, it will be interesting to see where Zahler goes from here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average cowboy action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know the movie had a low budget til I saw the IMDb page and I wouldn't have guessed. Granted for the scenery a lot money weren't needed but it looked way better then it was "payed for". It starts off with an action sequence and continues with relatively no action til the last 10 percent of the movie. But don't let that fool you, the dialogue builds very interesting characters and the comedy pops up here and there. The actors are amazing which makes the movie even more enjoyable even though the well made action is kept to the minimum. I wouldn't recommend this to watch with your friends on a late night to see some gory action but if you're not looking for that and actually want to enjoy the Western atmosphere, cowboys and some really well made action and gore. This movie is perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror or propaganda?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a band of inbred cannibals abducts his wife from a sleepy town on the Wild West frontier, an injured man joins a rag tag posse as it mounts a rescue mission in the wilderness.Hmmm. Very watchable, but so confused. Opening scene has a vicious slaughter that promises extreme horror. Then we're introduced to the townsfolk, but the dialogue is self-consciously formal - although without pompous speeches to slow the pace - and yet the characters are endearing and well played by the actors. But still there's an overall feel of prejudice and that what we're seeing is a cartoon story that doesn't bother with credible motivations. I dunno - guess I'll have to watch it again and see if it settles in for me.Huge run time, and it's obvious that although nobody talks at length many scenes could have been tightened up without losing the charm of the dialogue. Many implausibilities - why was the wife abducted, why is the journey five days, why is the hero carrying such a serious injury so impossibly, why is the cannibal chewing on an uncooked leg like a chicken drumstick? The big problem is there's hardly any myth created for the baddies, and when we get to them they're almost as simplistic as those mud people who used to emerge from the walls in the old Flash Gordon TV episodes. There's an interesting plot point to do with two pregnant women, but it passes by almost without comment. At that point the dialogue has lost its charm and the actors are having trouble finishing the story with conviction.Another oddity is the music. It plays over the intro credits, then ... nothing until a short burst of sorrowful violin at 45 mins, then ... nothing until the end credits. And what we get is a strange song written/performed by the director/writer that plainly presents a bit of propaganda for pre-enlightenment virtue v savagery. Add in the earnest nod to Christianity and the animal portrayal of the baddies (including the ancient slur about troglodytes), and it leaves a bad taste.At least the disembowelling is good, but that and the opening slaughter were the only bits of horror for me.Overall, interesting characters well performed, but needed to be clear about the threat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp meets Cannibal Holocaust!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get something out of the way first -- "Bone Tomahawk" (2015) isn't only a western. It's a genre-busting ... "horror-western," as other review sites have called it. It pits four protagonists against a tribe of monstrous "cave dwellers" who have kidnapped two people from their tiny frontier town of "Bright Hope." And the results at the movie's end are pretty damned horrifying.This was superb -- I'd give it a 9 out of 10. "Bone Tomahawk" succeeds in being scary and enjoyable simply because it's a quality film. The script is outstanding, with nuanced, occasionally funny, and ultimately quite likable characters. The four leads -- Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins -- play the diverse quartet perfectly. I could honestly watch another one or two movies about these guys, even without the horror-movie plot device that this flick employs -- and that is coming from a guy that doesn't like westerns. The directing and cinematography are perfect. And the end of the movie is nerve-shattering, smartly written and satisfying. (Although there is one violent sequence that might make your heart stop. Good lord.)My only criticisms are very subjective. For one, this movie sometimes felt slow. The exciting horror-movie element that drives the plot is introduced early, but briefly. It is then more than an hour before we arrive at it again, as we follow the four protagonists traveling to an uncharted valley just to reach the bad guys' lair. For another ... this movie got just a little too dour during its lengthy second act (the trek to the valley where the climax takes place). We see a few sad things, including the fates of innocent people and animals. These punctuate what is literally a painful journey for one of our heroes waging a doomed battle against a horribly wounded leg. Throughout its middle, "Bone Tomahawk" isn't so much of a "scary movie" as it is a slightly depressing movie.Still, this was fantastic. And if you see it and you really like it, as I did, then spread the word. This flick hasn't gotten the press it deserves.Quick postscript: watch for David Arquette and none other than Sid Haig in surprise supporting roles! And ... supposedly Sean Young was in this movie, but I'll be damned if I could spot her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies, good movies with great pacing that thrust you through the experience, I saw this with my girlfriend and all we were doing is looking at each other every 10-15 minutes with puzzled looks on our faces. It dragged on and on, nothing really linking the story and pushing it onwards.The first 10 minutes were interesting and enthralling. The shots were okay and locations were cool. I'm also someone that really likes the use of silence in films that I watch, it just seemed here often like it was being used without a reason. When the characters finally did talk it was just plain bland.Maybe its just me, but this film is in my opinion highly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns are one of my least favourite film genres, so when I enjoy one you know it has some quality about it. 'Bone Tomahawk' is an excellent film that combines a patient build-up with a memorable, brutal and compelling finale. The four main members of the cast are in outstanding form and have terrific chemistry. With a weak cast, the first 3/4 of this film could indeed have been very dull and uninspiring, but these fantastic performances not only carry this period - but make it utterly compelling.There is one scene in particular (that I was aware of before watching it - thus is its infamy) that has a lot of people talking and is considered especially vicious. I can confirm (as a big fan of these type of scenes) that it is a ferocious and tough scene to watch. It would have fit right in in the 'Saw' or 'Hostel' series and that is saying something.There is some exquisitely written dialogue in the early parts. S. Craig Zahler writes and directs with exceptional class that even Quentin Tarantino would have been proud of at times. I've read a few comments of people saying they found it too boring and didn't even finish it. I feel sorry for those people, for one reason because they clearly have ADD, and secondly because they missed a hell of a finale that they certainly would have enjoyed. Even if you're not interested in the western genre like myself, you'll find you're able to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah! THAT'S what I'm talking' 'bout! I had a hankerin' to see a scary movie tonight. Completely by accident I found Bone Tomahawk. And because I never read reviews or blurbs which will spoil things for me, and because all I do (mostly) is go by the IMDb rating-----and maybe skim a few user reviews once in a great while---- it never occurred to me that what I'd be getting myself into was a supernatural, downright heart- palpitating and rivetingly horrifying WESTERN. I figured it would be one of your regular shoot 'em up Wyatt Earp type flicks. Boy, was I wrong, wrong, wrong.Now we all know Kurt Russell can do suspense ("Break Down") and Patrick Wilson can be Mr. Super Scary ("Hard Candy") . . .but who knew they could both be so wonderfully bad ass and exceptionally watchable in a horror film set in the Old West? I can't begin to express how awesomely satisfying it was to see them act in this spooky, creepy, frightening film. I wanted to hug them both and thank them, over and over, for such terrific acting.The entire cast is delicious. Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins = awesome! You'll see what I mean. Sean Young being the only actor in this that seemed a bit out of place. Or maybe I just thought that because I recognized her right away and haven't really got over seeing some of her other terrible performances. Sorry, Sean. After Bladerunner, it was all downhill. (I guess you did o-kay in "No Way Out," but that was 1987.)Honestly. You have GOT to see this film. As the end credits were rolling, my hands were still tingling and my heart was thumping. Incredibly glorious to be so satisfyingly scared and entertained.Spoiler alert: Someone please explain to me what happened to the dynamite and all the horses?10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really different movie, and not just for the sake of being different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a horror western/weird western, that seems to be 2015's big sleeper hit. I was expecting not to like it or give up half way through due to my dislike of horror flicks, so the fact that I loved this really surprised me. Arthur O'Dwyer's (Patrick Wilson) wife Samantha (Lili Simmons) is kidnapped, which sets in motion a very fun western horror tracking down the kidnappers. Arthur, Kurt Russell's Franklin, Matthew Fox's Brooder, and Richard Jenkins's Chicory set out on this adventure.Matthew Fox's Brooder is surprisingly the highlight here. Kurt Russell is great as always. Richard Jenkins is of course brilliant as well, and plays great comedic relief. Even Patrick Wilson is really good, granted he is the weakest link of the 4, but you're up against 3 brilliant actors. Zahn McClarnon, who had the highlight of last year's Fargo playing Hanzee, and also steals the show in the deleted scenes of Awful Nice, shows up for a quick memorable scene here, and is just commanding. I really hope he continues to be in shows and movies, cause he's great to watch. Lili Simmons from Banshee and David Arquette from Ravenous! (among other things) do some of the best work here with their smaller supporting roles.I probably prefer Ravenous when it comes to cannibalistic westerns, but this was a fresh take and interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Much Too Late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through the majority of Bone Tomahawk, I found myself completely Enthralled. Many may mistake this film for something of a slow burn; and by just considering the plot, they would be right. On the surface, Bone Tomahawk is a linear and semi-predictable film that's not going to turn any heads (this may be why it has been largely overlooked), but it's when we stop looking for the climax that we begin to enjoy the ride.Perhaps more than anything, I believe it was the characters that made me give this film an above average rating. They're age old but new, fitting nicely into predetermined western clichés of the 60's. We have a bewildered husband, an anecdotal old timer, a flare obsessed desperado and of course the morally upright Sheriff. But what these cowboys lack in originality, they more than make up for in dialogue. At some point through the story, I began to enjoy them, perhaps even more than I should. Through sheer dialogue, these gritty cowpokes are able to make even the most boring scene not only memorable, but often enough quotable. My main gripe with bone tomahawk was it's erratic pacing towards the end of the film. In no way, shape or form did the humble and interesting journey seem like the pre-requisite to such a quick action packed ending. This is to say that although the ending was not bad in and of itself, it simply did not fit what I had come to expect from the film. In short: If you're in the mood for a throw-back western with some great dialogue, Bone Tomahawk just may be the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A posse pursues a cannibalistic tribe who has kidnapped three town-folk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one hell of a movie. This movie is definitely character-driven. This is not some mindless, gore-filled slasher flick. The dialog is terrific and the language, attitudes, and perspectives are genuine Old West. This movie makes the characters very sympathetic and you really feel for their suffering and determination. They are also distinctly individual and not Hollywood cookie-cutter stereotypes. This is a true iconoclastic western that breaks all the stereotypes, tropes, memes, and any other lazy writing tricks and develops a truly original product. I found myself holding my breath and sitting on the edge of my proverbial seat waiting to see what would happen next. This is not a movie to just vicariously satisfy 21st century blood-lust, but to tell a story about human endurance, determination, and courage. The first scene exemplifies the intensify when it shows a sleeping cowboy getting his throat cut in the first fifteen seconds after the initial credits. The center section in which the posse takes a few days to track the tribe to their home valley, may drag for some people, but it shows the posse's determination to suffer hardships and endure suffering in order to rescue their friends. There is not much gore for fans of gore, but that would not contribute significantly to the plot in any case. However, there is one scene in which the cannibals consume a captive (I won't say which) that will satisfy gore-fans desire for blood, torment, and intensity.I won't continue out of fear of giving away too much and because I could write about this movie in depth for some time. Let me conclude by just recommending this movie very highly not only for horror fans, but for anyone in seeing quality screen writing and movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's about 9:00 but it feels like next week" (dialog) This is a film that owes a debt to the 1956 classic The Searchers, a film as much about finding an abductee as it is about the people doing the search.The "horror" subtheme is merely a bonus, and a fun one at that.It is not merely an indie, but an "auteur" indie -- that's the classification your reviewer is giving to the large influx of films in the last 24 months where the writer and director are one and the same.In film history, auteurs by themselves are not a new concept; what IS new and interesting is that, as television in this decade is starting to leapfrog Hollywood in terms of quality and excellence, this new class of artist is taking up the slack by using the proved medium of film as a convenient mechanism to show their stuff and define their aspirations.Craig Zahler is defining his aspirations with Bone Tomahawk, and it is not a bad start. To make these idies work, you need to get maximum audience connection with the least amount of resources. Zahler achieves that with a tight cast, led by one of my faves, Kurt Russell. I have been watching Kurt since the 1950s - not a misprint -- and his work in Soldier was so good that, if you have not seen it, stop wasting time with this review and go find a copy - NOW. It is also ironic that another of Kurt's best roles was as Wyatt Earp, and here is he is replaying a Marshall but in a different context. Always a pro, never a bad performance.The direction is fully competent but the script itself is a joy, with many interesting bits of dialog for the discerning ear to discover and enjoy.Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically shoddy, but damn if it isn't brutal and straightforward!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to visit my elderly mom, and take some of the western movies I recently bought with me, because she and her man sometimes like those. "Bone Tomahawk" was one of the movies they saw. It might have been a mistake. This is almost a B-movie. Not a funny B-movie, that much is clear, but a B-movie nonetheless. There is little to no subtlety, the characters are as simple as they come and everything seems to be handled without great ambition, but it clumsily does what it's supposed to do. It knows where it wants to go, and somehow it gets there, like one of the crippled main characters. And when it gets there, it finds its comfort zone and finally breaks out its guns. Suddenly there's an atmosphere, there's tension. In the end it turns into a pure horror movie with some very disturbing gore, and if you didn't give up on the movie already, you'll be rewarded. If you like horror and gore, that is. My mother didn't!If you're looking for quality cinema, this is not it. The picture quality and camera work is unstable at best. It's not horrible, but this does look like a TV movie. While some shots, along with lighting and the works were pretty good, some were just flat, badly shot and irritating. But once you start paying attention (and you will) to the sound department, oh boy. It seems like every noise is a BOOM. If a horse gently walks in the wilderness, it's BOOM BOOM BOOM. It's like they had over 9000 mics and decided to mic absolutely everything. If someone walks on an apartment floor, every floor board seems to have a mic on it. Every conceivable audible sound is not only there, but it's also loud. This could have been corrected during the mixing phase, but nope. The TV and surround we used while watching this movie weren't the best, but I doubt they are to blame for all of this. It's a low-budget movie, so some of these shortcomings are understandable.Anyway, despite the technical clumsiness, "Bone Tomahawk" is a simple movie in a good way. It knows what it wants to be, and there isn't an ounce of pretentiousness or even cynicism to be found. When everything is set up, it's straightforward all the way. People need to be rescued and some other..."people" need to get killed. That's it.The cast is good and carries this film when needed. The characters are simple, and some of them are barely even characters, but the sheer presence of Kurt Russell certainly helps. He doesn't do anything special, but him just being there is an asset. Matthew Fox surprisingly was very entertaining, and Patrick Wilson is always likable. Richard Jenkins almost felt real, and if I didn't know better, I would have thought he ad-libbed most of his dialogue. Lili Simmons is certainly beautiful to look at, but she handles her role well enough otherwise too. David Arquette was a nice surprise. Nobody really steals the show, and there aren't many - if any - truly great moments of acting, but what we get is enough. Some of the writing for these people is good too; not too lofty or ambitious, but pretty mundane and at times sparse. For some this will come off as boring, but I welcomed it.I don't know what to say of Zahler, the writer/director of this film. I would have to see more of his works. His writing seems to be decent, and it certainly looks like he can handle simple, effective and shocking horror. It would be interesting to see what he could do with a bigger budget and a little more deeper story, who knows? At least the guy knew what he wanted to do, more or less accomplished it, and gave this film a satisfactory ending. Bonus points for ending the movie when the story ended, right that second. No aftermath, no hugs, no tears, just end. I always find it funny when that happens, because so many other movies don't know when to stop.Now, on to the real heroes of the film: the make-up department and practical special effects guys. The "enemies" in this movie (don't want to spoil it) are quite convincing at times, and in certain scenes very disturbing. There is one very gruesome scene in which the practical effects really shine. Sometimes it's easy to tell when it's just prosthetics, but nevertheless these things were handled very well. There's always a charm to practical effects. Thumbs up for these guys, they nailed it.To summarize, I found "Bone Tomahawk" to be somewhat poor on the surface, but it has a simple, charming heart resembling a really good B-movie. It seems to be aimed at a very specific audience. I went from almost giving up to actually liking it! If you want a quality western with amazing landscapes, terrific soundtrack, great shots and complex characters, look elsewhere. But if you like brutal, straightforward movies that pay off at the end, try this one. It might just be your weird cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet the most savage people of the American native.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the three western films I've watched back to back recently. The other two were 'The Salvation' and 'The Homesman'. They all were totally different from each other and I enjoyed them a lot. I did not know what this title means, but I learnt it before going for it which means some kind of axe used by the American Indians. So I have waited for that moment to know why the film's called that and then, omg, I was very shocked, totally uncomfortable to watch that part. I felt like it was a western version of 'The Hills Have Eyes'.This was a road movie. A group of peoples' journey to rescue those who were abducted by some mountain tribes. The rescue was the third act and the rest of the film was about how they make into that remote place. Obviously a slow pace, makes you sit whatever position you want, but after the 90 minutes you will be more focused than before as the narration gets tense. The best part of the film in any western the audience were looking for finally arrives. It was a simple, but very strong and disturbing.The cast was the plus point, everyone did their part best. Even the music and the locations were very nice and appropriate. One of the rare western films I've seen, with a mix of horror-terror. This is the cheapest film and shot within a month of time, but a fine production and completely unexpected film. Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.7/10</fullReview>

It's that part most viewers are talking about. Once the final starts the talking is over and the action comes in, and when the action comes in it's pure gore. What did kept me watching is the acting itself that is way above mediocre, Kurt Russell and his companions does deliver the goods. Not a flick for those who want action and violence, be honest, it's made in the era of The Hateful Eight and it shows.

		<shortDescription>It's the opinion of the backup deputy that this movie rocks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One night, a crazed "drifter", Purvis (David Arquette), comes to the small town of Bright Hope, and causes enough of a problem to be shot by Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) and taken to jail. While local doctor Samantha (Lili Simmons) tends to his gunshot wound, mysterious forces come by during the night and abduct *everybody* in the police station. The Sheriff forms a posse with three other men: his backup deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins), local character Brooder (Matthew Fox), and Samanthas' husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), who crippled himself in an accident. Their journey takes them a few days until they come upon the enemy: a strange, and especially savage, tribe of Indian so obscure that they don't even have a name.There's a fair bit here that's predictable, but obviously reinventing the horror and Western genres is not debuting writer / director S. Craig Zahlers' primary aim. It must be said that his film is not going to be for all tastes, as more timid viewers will be extremely put off by the violence and gore. But those with strong stomachs will find this to be a very robust entertainment, extremely well shot in widescreen by Benji Bakshi. Zahler is deliberate and definitely takes his time telling his story, which may cause him to lose some more viewers. However, "Bone Tomahawk" is remarkable for not only delivering in a very visceral way, but also truly caring about its characters. You want to stick with these people and see how their tale develops. Even Brooder, who comes off as a real prick for a while, does eventually emerge as a man you can understand.Zahler also composed the music score along with Jeff Herriott, and it perfectly supplements this film that takes us on a vivid journey, one that memorably captures a sense of real desolation.Kurt, sporting some awe inspiring facial hair, is solid as a rock as the lawman. Wilson is equally fine, and the supporting cast features familiar faces such as Sid Haig, Fred Melamed, James Tolkan, Kathryn Morris, Michael Pare, Sean Young, and Jamison Newlander. Even Fox isn't bad. But Jenkins offers the wonderful standout performance here. He is the heart and soul of this picture.Zahlers' script has some very good dialogue, and one memorable laugh when Samantha offers up her opinion on why frontier life is so difficult.Finally, the villains here are incredibly creepy once properly revealed. They barely qualify as human, and have a particular kind of vocalization that makes your skin crawl.Long in duration (at two hours and 12 minutes), but worth sticking with.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Savage Cannibal Western!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer &amp; director S. Craig Zahler's "Bone Tomahawk" doesn't rank as a great western, but it is certainly a solid but unsavory entry in the genre. Not only does this lumbering horse opera benefit from a top-notch cast, including Kurt Russell, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, David Arquette, Sid Haig, Sean Young, Michael Pare, and James Tolkan, but it also has some of the scariest adversaries. The Indians from any other western cannot possibly compare with these dastards. Indeed, "Bone Tomahawk" could be classified as a hybrid western with horror elements. Essentially, what takes place in this oater is combination of the John Ford movie "The Searchers" and any of Italian cannibal movies from the late 1970s and the 198os, such as "Cannibal Ferox," "Eaten Alive," "Jungle Holocaust. The plot concerns a group of cave dwelling Indians who go on the warpath about a couple of murderous thieves, Buddy (Sid Haig) and Purvis (David Arquette), after they stumble onto a secret Indian burial ground and desecrate it. Buddy suffers the wrath of these godless, heathen troglodytes who are as savage as they are ruthless. Later, you'll have muster your nerve to get through the scene where they kill one of Sheriff Hunt's deputies is slaughtered before their eyes and then split in two! After the troglodytes?think Indians covered in dried mud?kill the first thief, they slip into the western frontier town of Bright Hope, track down the second thief to Sheriff Hunt's jail where they kidnap a female nurse Samantha (Lili Simmons of "Fat Kid Rules the World"), Purvis, and Hunt's younger deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot") to their faraway cave in the mountains. Naturally, Samantha's husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson of "Watchmen") sets off in pursuit with Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell of "Big Trouble in Little China"), Hunt's deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), and one of Samantha's former suitors Brooder (Matthew Fox of "Emperor"). Poor Arthur has a game leg and spends part of his time limping through some of the worst terrain on a crutch with his torn up leg in danger of developing gangrene. The Indians wield arrows as well as jawbones of what appear to be horses. They devastate their victims. The suspense at time is unbearable, especially when they drag out Sheriff Hunt and slash his belly open. Things are really creepy toward the end when the survivors pass a couple of Indian pregnant Indian women whose legs have been chopped off and their eyes plugged with with sticks. Richard Jenkins has some amusing moments as Hunt's older deputy who learns about the truth behind flea circuses. The dialogue is strong but not quotable. Nothing about this grim western could be described as glamorous. Everybody goes through utter Hell to accomplish their goals. The scenes involving our heroes as they contend with the formidable hostiles are splendidly staged with the stunt guys doing a spectacular job of dying. You've never seen a western like "Bone Tomahawk."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm more a fan of psychological horror, movies along the lines of "The Shining", but I found this satisfying for all the standard reasons. In other words, there was mystery, the character development helped advancing the story to its gory conclusion and there was enough suspense. Even more, Kurt Russel delivers a great performance -- somewhat reminding me of his character in "Tombstone", from two decades ago.There is also some commentary hidden in the movie concerning people who believe women's main function in society should be breeding.For someone not accustomed to watching this type of horror, the blood and gore may be shocking.

		<fullReview>If there's such a movie genre as horror Western, this one might be at the top of the list. Released in 2015, I only became aware of the film by pulling up an internet site touting 'The Best 25 Westerns of the Last 25 Years'. ("Slow West" was on the same list, you might give that one a try too). The picture grabs you pretty quickly when Sid Haig's (didn't know he was still around either) character gets used for target practice in an opening sequence; from there on it becomes an intense journey in search of a woman and deputy sheriff kidnapped by a most unexpected tribe of cannibalistic cave dwelling troglodytes. Personally, I was thrown off guard by the use of the word 'troglodyte' in a Western, so that would have been hook number two. The eerie howling wind scream completed the trilogy.After it's over I think most viewers won't have any trouble realizing that the story doesn't stand up against the harsh daylight of reality. But while it's under way the picture grabs you in a visceral way and it's hard to let go. Some will complain that it's a slow picture with the amount of time spent on the trail with the four members that make up the posse, but this is where first time director S. Craig Zahler gets some of the best dialog from his characters. It's my official opinion that the backup deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) initiated one of the strangest, yet most comical conversations in the history of Westerns when he expounded on the difficulty of reading in a bathtub. Even weirder was Sheriff Hunt's (Kurt Russell) helpful suggestions on how to make the experience more palatable. I mean that was just classic.Now if you're watching with a critical eye, some things won't pass muster. Living as virtual scavengers, a couple of the cave dwellers didn't look exactly undernourished. The one that got the toe trim from the sheriff physically looked like a monster. The biggest strain on the story's credibility for me was the lack of emotion from Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons), the kidnapped wife we see imprisoned in the troglodyte cave once the sheriff and Chicory are captured. You would think she would have suffered some physical and emotional trauma by this time but it seemed like just another day in the park for her. She didn't even seem to be that much moved by the Hannibal Lechter job done on deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit), just prior to using him for a wishbone. God, that was the sickest thing I think, that I've ever seen in a movie, but then again, I intentionally stay away from chainsaw massacre and 'Saw' flicks for just that reason.Forty years ago a film came out called "The Missouri Breaks" with Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson, and I recall thinking to myself after watching it, that this was not your father's Western. Anyone of the current generation catching this one will more than likely be led to the same conclusion, although if any of my adult offspring run across this review, let it be known I watched it anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I wasn't expecting a lot from a modern horror-western, Bone Tomahawk got me quite by surprise. However, the movie is a mixture of great and not-so-great.The great thing about this movie is how compelling the story is. There are lots of tense and intriguing scenes that really got my attention and surprised me at times. Another great thing is the setting, it's been long since we've seen a good movie set in this time with a cowboys and Indians plot. No, The Revenant is a great "western", but this is more the type of westerns I'm looking for. The ensemble cast is good as well. Kurt Russell mainly plays Kurt Russell, he's a lot like his character in The Hateful Eight, nothing too special but very amusing and lots of charisma in his role. Patrick Wilson was a mixture of great and bad, the anger his character showed was very well done, but in a neutral state he just felt bland. The same goes for the rest of the cast: when they have to show emotions they're great, but when they don't they just seem very average. Except for Kurt's character. Speaking of which, the characters are not very memorable or relatable at all, but that's not not what the movie is about. So if you're expecting that, don't watch this. Simple as that.Now what are some actual flaws? The dialogue felt so unreal and unnatural at times, all characters except from Kurt Russell all have some cringe worthy dialogue or just very bland. Another flaw I have with this movie is the cinematography. For some reason, the cinematographer chose to put the focus on things that weren't the focus at all, such as the scene where Patrick Wilson's character is reading his 'poem'. The cinematography is my biggest complaint.Anyways, most people will probably overlook those flaws and they didn't bother me THAT much. Bone Tomahawk is a fresh idea converted into a good film. I'm very curious to see what the director will bring out in the next few years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally horror movies quite low rated due to lack of storyline with supernatural stuff. This movie turned out to be Tarantino type quite disturbing scenes... Not that kind of movie you could sleep while watching, full of adrenaline from the beginning. It's not that kind of movies you'd watch with your younglings, nor suitable for horror movie liking type emo teenagers :) I watch many movies and forget most of them but this one gets in your head with scenes that you won't be forgetting. If you are imagining wild west like in those gunslinger movies, this movie will change your mind about it. I don't wanna give out any spoiler so i will cut it short, just enjoy the movie.

		<shortDescription>Kurt Russell in heroic role in Western Horror Cult Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw The Hateful Eight, the latest Tarantino film, a western where Kurt Russell is one (of the 8). Browsing netflix, Kurt looking western again caught my eye, as did the title. Not really a fan of horror movies, I chose, Bone Tomahawk with some trepidation. However, knowing Kurt's filmography and reputation for quality films, I figured how graphic could it get.That said I was thrown somewhat off balance by several aspects of the film, but it's not a bad thing. First I noticed how quiet it was. There were no distracting soundtracks or sound effects other than natural sounds. This gives amplification to ordinary sounds. Kurt smacking his lips while sipping hot corn chowder. The bed creaking as a man has a lovemaking session with his wife. The piano player at his piano not playing. The clop clop of the horses walking. The quietness brings life to the dialogue. You listen to what is being said.Another thing I noticed is that there are no "red shirts" in this film. Everyone is important. At first, as the posse was headed out to rescue the hostages, the characters made comments that had me believing, OK this guy's going to be picked off first. Instead of the usual predictability of "the evil" picking people off one by one, the folks in the posse actually had conversation and got to know each other. For horror movies, this is highly unusual. It took a little shift in perspective to roll with it.One point of aggravation for me was the guy with the injured leg. I winced and grimaced right along with him. He did a good job of setting up dynamic tension under the general tension of wondering if their rescue would be successful and when evil would show its face.Another area where this film is non-formulaic is in its quantity and variety of gruesomeness. What it lacked in quantity it made up for in gruesomeness. I had to avert my eyes in a couple of places.Now to get to Kurt Russell's heroism. He's a small town sheriff but he's fearless every step of the way, from when the stranger who "buried something out under the tree" is confronted in the tavern, to the very end (no spoilers here). He's everyone's ideal of what a sheriff should be. He's fearless. He's fair. He's good to his wife. He's kind to his kinsmen. And he's not going to stop until he saves the imprisoned townsfolk.Bone Tomahawk is not your run of the mill film. It is extraordinary in several ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a very original and very well done horror/western starring one of my favorite tough guy actors, the very talented(and under rated) Kurt Russell. Kurt is the sheriff of small town Bright Hope and must rescue a woman that was kidnapped by a savage tribe of cannibals that inhabit the caves of the desolate south west. The film is quite gritty and violent. However, if you compare this to other cannibal films(Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox), the gore level is milder by comparison. What is more important is this is a very well crafted film with outstanding performances, excellent dialogue and good development of characters and story. Bone Tomahawk shows exactly how harsh the untamed American frontier can be. The film looks awesome with great cinematography and as much as this is a rugged western it also is a tale of terror, built on tension and suspense. The film is tough enough and has enough action to please western fans and is has enough brutality and terror for horror fans. Bone Tomahawk is written and directed by S. Craig Zahler who delivered a very good and unique film that is very entertaining and very well made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bone Tomahawk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film hybrids of horror and western aren't very common, but there are some brilliant samples of that fusion, such as The Burrowers, Dead Birds and Ravenous; and more recently, Bone Tomahawk can be added to that distinguished niche. To be honest, the terrifying elements of Bone Tomahawk occupy a very small portion of its 132 minutes, and I think its sober character and parsimonious narrative place it into a category closer to The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford or the remake of True Grit: an "existential western" focused on the mystic of the Old West and the difficulties of daily life in that time, complemented by solemn characters who possess a strong sense of honor and inflexible commitment to their duty, regardless the consequences or their personal safety. In other words, Bone Tomahawk leaves the horror and the violence in the background in order to focus on the personal experience of a chase through the plain... the classic "posse" in search of justice which might find something much more dangerous than simple outlaws or cattle thieves. I won't reveal the identity of the antagonists chased by the main characters in order to preserve the delicious tension of what exactly they are going to find. I will just say that the "evil ones" keep the purest spirit of the western genre, with the precise degree of exaggeration to make them genuinely frightening and almost invincible. And then, we have the fascinating four main characters; the "heroes" respect the archetypes of the Old West, but they have abundant personality transcending any generic descriptions. The detail and deepness with which those characters were built is gradually manifested thanks to the excellent performances from Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins and the clever screenplay written by S. Craig Zahler, who also made his debut as a director in here displaying absolute sureness behind the cameras and plunging us into an archaic period which seems fresh under his elegant vision. And, well, I haven't even mentioned the scenes of brutal violence, which are truly shocking not only because of their raw realism, but also the casual tone handled by them. There aren't any blood spurts or "cool" takes in slow motion; on the opposite, the conflicts in Bone Tomahawk start quick, and they end almost before comprehending what is going on. In conclusion, I loved Bone Tomahawk, even though it's difficult to give it a wide recommendation due to its paused rhythm and methodic development, which some people might consider "boring" (even though I never felt it like that at all). As I previously said, there isn't really "action" in Bone Tomahawk; most of the film consists on conversations, walks and long silences which allow us to reflect on the situation of the characters. That might be more appetizing to the fans of western cinema than the ones of horror; however, the good thing is that Bone Tomahawk works as a celebration of both genres, with enough technical and artistic quality to give new life to their respective clichés and bring us something different and unforgettable. In summary: an extraordinary debut from Zahler, and a clear confirmation that western isn't dead... even if it has to borrow from other genres to survive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The synopsis of this film rather put me off in the beginning, since I'm not a fan of the horror genre generally, although I have always loved westerns, and so I decided to give it a try. My decision was influenced by the cast, that included such excellent actors as Kurt Russell, and Richard Jenkins, surely one of the finest character actors working today, and in a change of pace for him, outstanding in this role. David Arquette lends able support, in what for him has become a somewhat signature character. The script is well focused, and literate, and no one blinks at the notion of cannibalistic foes as the malefactors here. It is slow at the outset, and picks up speed as it goes, altogether well paced. An adventure, and a character study. A good film, well acted by all. Very much recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a very atmospheric western/horror movie that pulls no punches whatsoever. It's the story of a team of gunslingers, led by Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) who set out to bring home a kidnap victim but their enemy is more ruthless than anyone could have imagined. I went into this without knowing anything about it and was really impressed with what I saw. There are some great performances from Kurt Russell , Matthew Fox and the underrated Patrick Wilson and they all help make this a nerve jangling ride full of blood curdling scenes from the very start. It starts of like a typical western but then turns into a cannibalistic horror where you never quite know who is going to survive. Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the decade so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My two favorite films of 2015 not only stand above the rest quite comfortably, but also happen to be extremely similar in both nature and quality. The fact that these two films share so many resemblances makes comparisons rather difficult to avoid. They are both unpredictable, dialogue-driven and occasionally brutal Westerns starring Kurt Russell, and edited by Fred Raskin. However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's larger-scale The Hateful Eight, a mere $1.8 million budget and three weeks of shooting were all it took to bring writer/director S. Craig Zahler's wonderfully refreshing feature film debut Bone Tomahawk to screens ? and not enough screens, at that.Along with being advertised as a "Horror Western", the budget may initially give the impression of a mildly entertaining B-movie at best. However, using mostly outdoor locations and a simple olden-time village for its set pieces, the low budget does not hurt the film to any grating degree. Although the small town ironically named Bright Hope may at times feel more like a tourist attraction recreating the 1800s than an actual piece of history, the film's limitations make its greater accomplishments even more impressive. It may somewhat live up to its advertised cross-genres on account of its riveting tension and shockingly gory violence, but rather than providing schlocky scares or excessive shootouts, it instead utilizes its lesser production value to tell an exciting story revolving around character above all else.The straightforward plot surrounds four brave men who set out on a mission to rescue some villagers kidnapped by evil Indian cave-dwelling cannibals. This does indeed become as gruesome as it sounds, but the effect is completely earned by thorough character development in the writing and strong lived-in performances bringing them to life. In order to be invested when we witness the savage acts of ripping body parts and flesh out of the protagonists, they first need to be fleshed out themselves. Zahler does a commendable job of detailing each one with their own individual quirks, values and motivations while maintaining a sense of mutual respect among the group, even when small conflicts arise between them.Russell is subtly captivating as a sheriff who, even amid deadly circumstances, never hesitates to carry on with his duties, because that is what he considers the job to be no matter what: his duty. Patrick Wilson sells the determination and agony of a crippled man who will stop at nothing to save his wife, and Matthew Fox is a sly delight as a cocky gunfighter who can stir the pot on occasion but still honors his allies at the end of the day. Best of all is a nearly unrecognizable Richard Jenkins as the simpleminded and talkative yet irresistibly funny and endearing old back-up deputy who completely abides by his title, providing total support for the sheriff at all times. The first two-thirds of the film mostly consist of conversations between this central quartet as they alternate from riding their horses to setting up camp, and eventually to walking on foot. These naturally paced exchanges are consistently engaging and often humorous, while demonstrating an uncommonly sophisticated precision of realistic language that would be used in this setting. Over the course of their journey, we become surprisingly attached to these characters which, in accompaniment with the overarching sense that anything could happen to them at any time, keeps us on the edge of our seats when danger inevitably emerges.Bone Tomahawk is a clear-cut example of the right way to create a suspenseful and thrilling cinematic experience without the need for expensive effects or consistent action. With well-rounded characters, deliberate pacing, practical makeup and the utilization of sound with hardly any musical score complementing the tension, it succeeds not only in emitting a threateningly unsettling atmosphere but also in establishing a connection to the viewer that results in pleasure at some moments and unforced emotion at others. Zahler's direction is unvarnished and unflinching, focusing no more attention on decapitations and ripped-in-half bodies than on casual ramblings about flea circuses or reading in the bathtub. He knows and trusts that the audience can identify the difference in narrative significance between campfire chats and bones being rammed down our heroes' throats without having to ram it down ours. He has made a gem of a film that should not be overlooked. "We'll make sure all this has value", the sheriff reassures. I feel I must echo the armed gentleman's response by imploring filmgoers: "Please do."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hopeful during the opening scene as it was very engaging and I'm a huge fan of Sid Haid. Sadly he's barely in this movie and the opening scene gave way to a much slower paced hour where not a lot happens outside of some pretty good dialogue here and there.The second hour really picks up though and is where the meat of the movie lies. The tribals were genuinely horrifying and I did feel worried for the characters which I haven't felt during a horror movie in a very long time. The movie did feel authentic due to some decent acting and setting. The most impressive thing about this movie is its 1.8 million dollar budget. This movie has more than its money's worth.I'd given a much higher score if the first hour wasn't so drawn out making multiple viewings a chore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the horror genre, really not enthralled with viewing excessive gore, torture, etc. so I wasn't sure if I would be interested in this. I am a huge western fan and Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was completely surprised that this turned out to be an intelligently written script, a story about a posse of 4 who set out to rescue a women and a young deputy who have been kidnapped by a cannibalistic Indian cave-dwellers. OK, the premise is a bit of a stretch in 1893-but the middle of the picture about the 4 on their rescue mission did somewhat remind me of "The Searchers." Kurt Russell is superb as the sheriff leading the posse, Richard Jenkins is Chicory, the other old and loyal deputy, Mathew Fox is Brooder, an experienced Indian fighter and Patrick Wilson is the badly wounded husband of the captured woman. It's a compelling story, the final .30 minutes does get exceptionally gory and horrifying. Some great dialogue in this script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like buses, westerns tend to be extinct until three pop up at once. Quentin Tarantino's big budget THE HATEFUL EIGHT along with the James Ransone economical vehicle THE TIMBER and now the more sinister events of BONE TOMAHAWK.Sharing the lead, Kurt Russell, with two of the three mentioned, BONE TOMAHAWK is a western that hides its horror extremely well, paying off with a viciously brutal closing chapter. Sent into the wilderness after his wife is kidnapped, Patrick Wilson (THE CONJURING, INSIDIOUS) takes the local sheriff (Russell) on a lengthy trek to retrieve not only his wife but to put peace to the natives who feed on the flesh of humanity.While Russell looks like he has just walked off the set of THE HATEFUL EIGHT and owns the screen, the rest of the cast play a supportive pillar in this unconventional film of two parts. The film's drama is played straight from the pages of a Clint Eastwood western. Slow pace, macho behaviour and a penchant for a good gun fight all here in check. In principle none of the central characters are initially likable but their motives relatable. Whether it is the ruthless deputy Brooder (Michael Fox) or the lovable charm of Chicory (Richard Jenkins), the supportive network the unlikely companions share builds stronger as the stakes raise higher. It is only when the tribe confront the captors that the true horror arrives and only the minds of Eli Roth and Neil Marshall could imagine something so blood worthy.Despite its nature, BONE TOMAHAWK is a more faithful western than this year's bigger film and while the score doesn't quite live up to the classic of Ennio Morricone's instantly classic score, there is an authenticity in S. Craig Zahler's film that extends further than its rivals. Whether it is the barren wastelands or the hateful characters, the costumes or sheer humanity that drives the cast through, this film lays waste to over scripted wordplay in favour of a slow build up to a very tense final chapter.If THE DESCENT was directed by CLINT EASTWOOD, this would be the end result. One scene in particular will be treasured as the most cringe worthy moment of 2016, and surprisingly, even with the surreal unfolding of events, the film never over plays the horror so much as to forget this is a western at heart, just don't forget to take a sick bag.&gt; Martyn Wakefield is writer and editor for BloodGuts UK Horror and has contributed over 250 reviews dedicated to the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's sure to be a bone of contention...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.Ah, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub- genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.Plot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...How splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not? So the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging "B" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...Intricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade "A" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is about a group of vicious uncivilized cannibals that take a man's wife hostage. The sheriff (Kurt Russell), gathers three other men including her husband and go on a rescue mission to save her. A simple plot, but not bad.The movie is mostly driven by conversations and it is a slow burn, because the main story doesn't even start until around a half an hour has passed, but still great dialogue keeps it interesting.I really don't feel that this is a horror movie like a lot of people say it is. There's really no suspense or creepy atmosphere, there's barely any music at all actually, but horror fans might still enjoy this because of the gore and cool kills.As acting goes, it's good, I think all of the actors did a great job, especially Kurt Russell. The only thing that sort of bothered me with this movie is, I felt like I was watching some sort of miniseries that's only 2 hours long. I don't know why, I think it may be something to do with the way it was filmed or the way some things looked, but you guys probably won't have this problem.Overall, if you like Kurt Russell, Westerns, awesome kills and a decent story, check out BONE TOMAHAWK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blending the ruggedness of westerns with unflinching brutality of horror, Bone Tomahawk is a dark, gritty &amp; sturdy piece of work that's crafted with patience, discipline &amp; determination, is narrated in a very controlled but effective manner, and benefits immensely from its strong cast to succeed as a distinguishing, refreshing &amp; thrilling entry in the weary world of the Old Wild West.Set at the turn of the 20th century in a small town called Bright Hope, Bone Tomahawk follows four gunslingers who form an unlikely alliance to take a dangerous journey into the dark abyss of the Wild West in order to rescue some people who were abducted by a group of cannibalistic cave dwellers. But as they near their destination, they become more n more aware of their enemy's savage nature.Written &amp; directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk marks his directional debut and it's a fabulous start in every manner. The film opens on a callous note after which all the relevant characters are calmly introduced. Zahler then allows the tense, menacing aura to set on its own by unfolding the plot at a relaxed pace without holding back the blood, gore &amp; violence. And the refinements in its technical aspects only enhances the whole experience.The set pieces, props &amp; deserted locations are very evocative of the timeline its story is set in. Cinematography makes fabulous use of its camera to capture all the action, the images have a sharp clarity to it &amp; lighting is a definite highlight. Editing is concisely carried out but its slow pace may not please everyone. Finally, the background score has a quite brooding vibe to it but it's present only when there is a need of it. But the biggest contribution comes from its cast.Coming to the performances, Bone Tomahawk features an extremely devoted cast in Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox &amp; Richard Jenkins. Russell is truly a delight to watch as the town's sheriff and saves his character's best moments for the last act. Wilson delivers a physically intense performance and is consistently good throughout its runtime. Fox gets his own moments while Jenkins does well with what he's given. However, what works best for the film is the interplay between these characters, which the four actors are able to pull off amazingly well.On an overall scale, Bone Tomahawk is an impressive slow-burning cinema that grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments, packs in a rugged set of characters that are outstandingly portrayed by its highly committed cast, is absolutely remorseless with all its content, is never in a hurry to head towards its action-packed finale, is very accomplished in production value, and becomes all the more admirable when taken into account the fact that it's a debut effort for its writer-director. A must for western &amp; horror film fanatics, Bone Tomahawk is a raw, beautiful &amp; barbaric example of genre filmmaking. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally, a blending two genres. Only here it is without an attempt to determine how they might weaken each other. Other films like "Apocalypto" and "The Revenant," make this attempt with greater success. It's about storytelling factors which prepare the audience for the places we are going.It looks and feels like a western - characters on the edge of civilization, good and evil motives laid bare, the struggle to establish civilized values in a hostile setting. The weird, albeit brief detour into gore that the film takes assumes certain horror qualities too. There is the focus on ghastly details which make us fearfully aware of our physical frailty, and "monsters" we encounter look like people, but also come very close to being portrayed as another species, which for me was a problem.The way these ideas are combined in Bone Tomahawk renders any theme incoherent or non-historic (problematic with westerns). The point the film might be making is that the natives occupying America when settlers moved west were more savage and inhuman that we could ever imagine or relate to. The reality is that ALL cultures have barbaric periods, almost disqualifying inclusion into humanity. Making native Americans appear monstrous without context automatically makes a point not supported by history, but which horror movies rely on and sharpen by contrast.Are we to believe that there were many such tribes? Is this a true story? Were these troglodyte cannibals typical, or a bizarre sociological anomaly? Ultimately the gore and graphic violence is shown without necessary context - horrific for it's own sake. It simply grabs the viewers' hair and forces them to witness a ghastly spectacle. We are left gazing at the equivalent of a graphic atrocity on the internet, without warning. Genre usually prepares us for the quality and tone of visual storytelling. I don't believe that the audience was prepared for what we were eventually led to see.This disconnect wrenched me out of the narrative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a movie that won't be for everyone. A classic western purist probably can't see how good the western elements are for the horror part. It's just as intended though so if you can "get on board" with the original slant, the unique horror, there's lots to like.The budget is said to be minimal, but the wild west is created expertly within whatever constraints that may entail. You never feel you're not in a forsaken 1800's situation in the unforgiving surroundings - in which the town of New Hope is carving a rough, but civilized, existence. This is important because it's the difference between the upright, the criminal elements, and the wholly mutant micro clan of pre-historics who make it so unusual. It's a fantastic conundrum of humanity played out with flair.Besides the left turn of cannibalistic horror there's a A-list cast with Kurt Russell hitting on all cylinders. Then there's Patrick Wilson who you may know from his Lou character on Fargo. He is side by side in the excellence department with Russell here. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the role of Chicory, the "backup" deputy, so wonderfully played by Richard Jenkins. Jenkins has been seen literally a hundred times, but never like this! I'd say the director/writer, Craig Zahler, hit a home run with his story as realized by this cast. No, it's not a classic western, but it is what it is meant to be which is quite an original horror flick, and highly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spread the word - the scariest, most exciting Western for years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This original and very scary Western has set new standards for the genre. The heroism is refreshingly traditional but the tension hasn't been seen before. A group of four men sets off to rescue those who are kidnapped from a cannibalistic tribe in unchartered territory.The story is very well written with a good balance of heroism, humor and horror. The reason it's so scary is you get to know and like the characters first and want them all to survive. And they are all played by leading actors who look just perfect in their Western get up and often play heroes. When the rescuers go into unchartered territory every minute is suspenseful. The ordeal with Patrick Wilson's injured leg is so effective you can almost cringe along with him in pain. Kurt Russell is in his best Western role since Tombstone - his wise gruff demeanor is just spot on as the sheriff. Matthew Fox is well cast as the elegant but ruthless man with a history with the Indians. Comic relief is provided deputy sheriff played by an unrecognizable Richard Jenkins. The humor throughout is original with some genuinely funny dialog. The supporting cast of women is good too, consisting of Kathryn Morris, Sean Young and Lili Simmons.The lack of music is unique and turns out to be more effective and gives a realistic feel to the movie compared to old Westerns where there were some overused themes.There are a few very violent parts but they are part of the story and are relevant to the story. The opening scene and in the cave. The ones in the cave - you know when they are coming so you can cover your eyes and still enjoy 99% of the movie. I haven't been scared in a movie for some time but I was quite terrified in this one. Watch out for anything from this excellent writer director S._Craig_Zahler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Blend of Western and Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a feeling this was going to be an awesome movie when I saw the previews but this ended up surpassing all my expectations. This film is obviously a western but I didn't realize how much the movie would remind me of a horror flick. The two genres go together much better than I thought they would. Bone Tomahawk has managed to be both one of the best westerns I've seen in a while and one of the best horror movies. It really is so unique that I'm kind of disappointed I didn't get the chance to see it in theaters. It's even more impressive considering this is the directorial debut for S. Craig Zahler. Let's get to the story.The plot revolves around a group of men setting out after a group of what one Native American fellow refers to as Troglodytes. They're so vicious that the Native Americans considered them uncivilized. These Troglodytes have come to town chasing a murderer for damaging their burial grounds. The man in question was taken into custody by the local sheriff, Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) and his back up deputy, Chicory (Richard Jenkins). The Troglodytes kidnap the murderer as well as one of the town's doctors and one of Hunt's deputies. Hunt gathers a posse including the doctor's husband (Patrick Wilson), a former Indian hunter (Matthew Fox), and Chicory to find and rescue the captives.I knew Kurt Russell and his glorious beard were going to be in this film but I didn't realize just how much talent was willing to come and participate in a smaller film like this one. Russell does an excellent job as Sheriff Hunt and brings his usual gruffness to the role. He's a no-nonsense character that sets out to do his job even though he knows he probably won't come back from it. The other lead in this film is Arthur O'Dwyer played by Patrick Wilson. Another gruff character that sets out to rescue his wife but with a bit of a twist. O'Dwyer is injured and has to keep up with everyone while on crutches. Wilson is fantastic at portraying the pain his character is feeling, both emotionally and physically. The posse is rounded off by Jenkins' Chicory and Fox's John Brooder. Chicory is a bit of a talker that seems a little dense but possesses many talents useful to the rest of the group, like taking care of O'Dwyer's leg. Brooder is a bit of a dandy but is also a stone cold killer with questionable morals when it comes to strangers but is willing to give his life for others without a second thought. All of these actors do a fantastic job and their personalities are just different enough to make their conversations truly entertaining and unique.The desert has always had a kind of rugged beauty about it that many people can't see right at first. This film manages to both show us the beauty of the Wild West one minute and then immediately show us how truly terrifying the wilderness can be. The Troglodytes are menacing enough but seeing Wilson's character dragging his broken leg over miles of wilderness is a different kind of terror. Speaking of the Troglodytes, or cannibals or whatever you want to call them. these guys are so monstrous that it's easy to forget that they're actually humans. Their skin and voices have been altered in order to make them even more ghastly. Zahler did a fantastic job making them unique from what we usually think Indians are supposed to look and act like.I should probably note that this film definitely isn't for everyone. There's a lot more conversation between characters than there is action. It's more of a slow-burning type of western but the interactions are so good that it's hard to notice. There is definitely some action in the movie but not portrayed romantically at all and is probably a bit brutal for many people. There's one scene in particular that made me cringe a bit when I saw it and I don't cringe much. Like I said before, the film has a lot of horror elements to it so don't be surprised if you see something horrible.I can't recommend this movie enough. Great acting, unique twist on a standard western trope, and phenomenal cinematography makes this a very easy recommendation. Western and horror fans should find something to like about this one but if you don't have a strong stomach for violence then you might want to try something a little more traditional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found the acting to be good, Kurt Russell did well as usual. The movie is a slow burn for the majority, with the third act stepping up a little with the violence.It did take itself as a serious type of Western, which at first I thought would not work, but ended up being pulled off well. The more time spent into the story, the more serious and horrific situation we actually find the characters are in.Probably not for everyone, but I found it refreshing, without all the fast paced, CGI induced coma styles that most movies try to impress us with these days. I think older folks of Westerns will appreciate this more than the young crowd.</fullReview>

I wished I had gone for my root canal instead. It would have at minimum made better use of my time. Any guy that can drag himself thru the desert with a broken leg deserves an academy award, if only this whole scene was half-way believable. It's not. Neither was baffing his wife missionary style like really bro? Aren't you putting some weight on that thing? The ridiculous sounds the troglodytes make is annoying and by the time they sliced the guy in half which was gross, I kept wondering how the heck the dude with the busted leg was going to save his kidnapped wife when everyone else was dead or captured. What a guy! Dumb dumber dumbest. And I still need a root canal. I'm almost looking forward to it. This movie sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, mull over that for 20 minutes and you'd have spared yourself the first 20 minutes of this calamity. Or just go outside and watch the clouds pass by instead, because pretty much anything else you can think of is more fun!We start off with some scum bags killing people in their sleep, which is pretty nasty, and then the film drags on for around TWO HOURS in which nothing really happens, or is completely devoid of entertainment if it does, and then the film has a couple of incredibly sick moments that will make the average person look away from the screen in disgust, and it ends.Wow, what a colossal waste of time.I actually wanted to turn this mess off 26 minutes in, and seeing how the film lasts around 140, it was a real test of endurance not to, but I'd heard so many great things about it... from people whose opinions on films I'll never listen to again.In short, there is absolutely nothing to redeem this film: it is insanely boring and then abhorrently violent. I guess the pointless sex scene was there to try to give it an extra star, but it was so out of place and nonsensical that, unless you've a fascination with the actress (who is very beautiful, I'll admit), just adds to the tedium.I only gave this film 2 stars because I didn't fast forward or turn it off... I did start playing on a 3DS though.Utter crapola.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers, hopefully warning you off this flick the way I'd wish I'd been*Spoiler* *Spoiler* *Spoiler* *Spoiler*I rather enjoyed the first 3/4s of the movie. Yes, it could have used some trimming (Note to film makers, walking and talking and riding and talking and lying down and talking is only soooo interesting for so long), but it was intriguing enough, the dialog was clever enough, the acting good enough, and kudos to the low-level lighting that was so successfully used.I saw that this was supposed to be a horror western and that there was gore. But truth be told, even the opening sequence that is violent and a little bloody isn't too bad. We've all seen worse. There are a few action scenes, all well shot and edited, very pro, but they do not dwell on the violence. It's quick and over. The camera does dwell on the one young man who gets killed and gutted early, but it's dark. The worst part was I couldn't help thinking, "Once again, the black guy gets it early." The movie also pays some positive nods to Christianity and the then changing notions of tolerance and acceptance of the "other." Then (SPOILERS) our heroes are captured and forced to watch the gory butchering of a live human being. He's scalped, something sharp is forced down his throat, his genitals are hammered, and he is split down the middle and torn into. That was it. Turned it off, not only disgusted, but angry.Think of watching the Sound of Music and the last third turns into the original Texas Chainsaw Masacre. Scratch that, TCM was a great movie and you know going in what it was all about. There was no lulling you into thinking it was going to be a western with a bit of a grizzly twist. Why didn't the bandits they ran into show up half eaten along the way; something to prepare you for the complete cold cock to come? I don't mind gory movies, but torture porn, or gorenography is never something I want to see. It's not edifying.But the gorenography did something more, it made me question the rest of the movie. Why did the Cannibaltrogs leave the black man behind? They didn't like dark meat? Why did they only take a few towns people since they got in and out so stealthily? Why not take a few dozen? Heck, why not just set up shop in town? There's a perfectly good jail there to warehouse dinner. Also, they have no fear of firearms. Why aren't they using them? They know how to split a man's head with a tomahawk at about 20 yards, I would think modern rifles and pistols would catch their interest.Finally, the reaction of the captured wife when the sheriff is brought into the Cannibaltrogs's lair. "I'm alive," said with about emotion as ordering dry toast. She's already seen what these things do to humans. She should be whimpering with fear, perhaps unable to say a word. This does not begin to ring true for actual human emotions.So, I'd give the first, longish part of the movie, the actual western, a 5, but the disgusting sucker punch dropped it to a solid 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice genre mixing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a rather special genre-mix of classic Western themes and gory, insane B-movie horror elements. I was interested in this film because of Kurt Russell, but also Patrick Wilson also has a decent role. Bone Tomahawk is about a small group of cowboys who set out in search of a group of cannibals who kidnapped some of their townspeople, including the wife of one of the riders. It may sound similar to a lot of other westerns in the sense that it's a rescue story, which is somewhat true in the beginning. First half of the movie is also a character drama, 4 cowboys walk through the desert. What really stands out right from the start is the writing: the precise dialog and never less than interesting characters are what really makes this film a nice one. The premise might not be very original - it's Western to the bone and very much in the tradition of great classics like The Searchers - but despite its dark themes, there is so much understated humour in Bone Tomahawk. It is also a brutal movie with the nice cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Western, Less of a Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, personally, did not enjoy the movie as much as I hoped I would and I think this mainly comes from slightly wrong expectations i had. I went to see the movie because i expected a horror movie mainly but as it turned out for me this is more of a western than anything else.I think the first part of the movie is its strongest. I very much enjoyed the characters of the four protagonists and i also think the actors gave a strong performance. I consider the second part from where the protagonists first encounter the cannibals. This was the part that should have made the movie a horror movie but for me it definitely didn't. I was almost surprised by how unscary the cannibals were presented. There are two torture scenes in this movie which i would have found excellent if they just weren't as gory as they were since that did not suit the style of the film at all. I was neither scared nor thrilled at any point of the movie. I was especially annoyed by the emotionless performances of everyone in the second part of the movie. The protagonists don't show any emotion whatsoever and barely seem to care that they are being hunted by cannibals. Also the cannibals seem lazy as hell. For example, during a fighting scene, while his opponent is reloading his revolver, the cannibal casually walks towards his bow and arrow. Also, when cannibals are investigating a suspicious noise it seems more like they are going for a walk than anything else.In conclusion, i think it comes down to what you want to see. If you want to see a western with more than usual gore, this is definitely a movie I would recommend. If, however, you want to see a horror movie with a creepy and scary atmosphere set in the wild west then I would suggest you don't watch this movie since I would barely consider this movie to be a horror movie.I rated this movie as a western, hence the high rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was the 1890s and innocent people were disappearing. What to do?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the DVD for this movie at my public library. I went into it knowing nothing except that it stars Kirk Russell and that was enough to draw me in.It is an old west town and Kurt Russell is Sheriff Hunt. A drifter shows up and being a suspicious character, trying to run after being questioned, Hunt shot him in the leg to immobilize him. Seems to be his usual approach. But this sets up the main story, late at night this prisoner and the woman doctor treating him, plus a deputy, disappear. The only clue is an arrow left behind, with a curious construction, and someone says it belongs to a dangerous group of Troglodytes living a few days away in some cliff caves.At this point is a good time to define Troglodyte, "a prehistoric cave dweller, a person of degraded, primitive, or brutal character, a person living in seclusion, a person unacquainted with affairs of the world, an animal living underground." When we eventually encounter these beings we find that they meet most of these descriptors. Plus they are cannibals.The lady doctor is the wife of Patrick Wilson as Arthur who happens to be recovering from a very serious leg injury, one that if not treated properly might result in amputation. But he loves his wife, he will not be deterred when a search party is formed to go look for the kidnapped townspeople.Much of the movie is about the several days traveling to the supposed site of the Troglodytes, parts of it on foot after their horses are stolen in the night. And of course the climax is in the caves. The title comes from the implement the heathens use, a tomahawk made from the half jawbone of an animal.Good characters are played by Matthew Fox as Indian-killer Brooder who had lost his wife and daughter to an Indian attack. Perhaps the best is Richard Jenkins almost unrecognized as assistant sheriff Chicory, a sort of dimwitted Gabby Hayes sort of character. The lady doctor is played by Lili Simmons as Samantha.This is a well-made and interesting movie, a fantasy of sorts because of the creatures, but not all will like it. My wife viewed the trailer and skipped the movie, it is not her type. It is gritty and interesting, I enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Hunt, Brooder, and Chicory arrive at the cave first, Brooder is killed, Hunt and Chicory are captured and put into a type of cell. Arthur being hobbled takes longer to get there and eventually saves the day but only after Hunt is mortally wounded. The movie ends with Arthur and his wife on foot headed back to civilization, along with Chicory. Hunt and Brooder in their wounded states did manage to shoot the rest of the Troglodytes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'BONE TOMAHAWK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A western-horror flick, from writer/director S. Craig Zahler (who previously wrote the 2011 horror movie 'ASYLUM BLACKOUT'). Zahler (who also co-composed the music for the film) makes his directorial debut; with this innovative genre-bender. The story revolves around four men, in the Old West, who set out to rescue captives from vicious troglodytes. The movie stars Kurt Russell (in his second western, of the year), Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, Lili Simmons, Evan Jonigkeit and David Arquette; it also features cameos by Sid Haig, Sean Young, Kathryn Morris, Fred Melamed, James Tolkan and Michael Pare. The movie is a very impressive debut film, from the first-time director!Russell stars as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, and Jenkins plays his backup deputy, Chicory. The two men are startled to discover that their small (and very peaceful) town, has been attacked by cave dwelling cannibals. The murderous clan took town residents with them, as captives; including another deputy, named Nick (Jonigkeit), and the town doctor's assistant, Samantha (Simmons). Hunt and Chicory set out to rescue the prisoners; with the help of Samantha's crippled husband, Arthur (Wilson), and a local womanizer, named Brooder (Fox). Brooder is also very educated, and extremely experienced in killing Native Americans (which he has a vengeance for).The movie is filled with very witty dialogue, and rich character development (in a somewhat Tarantinoesque style). A lot of the film plays out like a classic, good old fashioned, western. It also contains very strong (and extremely jarring) horror elements. The troglodyte clan makes for some very memorable (and classic) movie villains; and the film has some extremely brutal gore in it. It's pretty hard to watch at times (from the opening shot of the movie), and very hard to forget. The cast is all exceptional, as well; especially Jenkins, Fox and Russell (who's had a great comeback this year). The film is sure to be remembered as a popular cult classic; one of the year's best!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My partner and I have just finished watching this and we both agree it is a far superior film to Hateful 8 on just about every level. This is brilliantly written and beautifully shot, I would agree with another reviewer that this film is not for the faint hearted nor should kids be allowed to watch it.Three actors I think deserve mention: Kurt Russell is at his very best in this, it has been a very long time since I've seen him be this good in anything and that includes Hateful 8! Matthew Fox is brilliant, he has struggled to get anything decent under his belt since Lost, this really shows how good an actor he is and will hopefully be the launch pad for him to really get the recognition he deserves and the roles he is more than capable of acting in! Richard Jenkins, who I must confess I'd only really gotten to know from Cabin In The Woods is fantastic, he was Chicory it wasn't until I used IMDb that we realised who it was playing the part.There is a lot of comments about the gore, yes when it is on screen it is pretty shocking, my partner and I had to rewind, as we couldn't believe what we had actually seen! For such a long film at no point did we feel it was dragging on, in short, this is I feel one of the best hidden gems of 2015</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A western starring Kurt Russell called Bone Tomahawk? Take my money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns seem to fall in and out of favor every few years and right now we are in the midst of a high period. The more well known westerns available right now, The Hateful Eight and The Revenant both take the genre and do something different with it. Bone Tomahawk is straight down the line western. It is a scenic and terrifying world where the only things that shine are the six shooters and retribution is taken in blood.At the head of the cast is the one, the only Kurt Russell. He so perfectly is this character that I became lost in his performance. Everything from the facial hair ooze old west sheriff and while this may not end up being his most well known role it very well may be his best. Matthew Fox is pleasantly surprisingly really good. I never thought he could pull off the slightly arrogant but mysteriously tough guy as well as he does here. Almost a complete 180 from his role on Lost. Richard Jenkins also plays out of role as a playfully foolish but strongly loyal old man. The rest of the cast is either not all that impressive or not on screen enough to garner mention but the leading 3 will be all you need to get through this movie.The movie is written, directed and composed by S. Craig Zahler who before this I had never heard of. Zahler certainly knows how to shoot a western as this is a stunningly beautiful looking movie. The budget is obviously smaller than most but Zahler makes up for it with some fantastic sunsets and expansive wasteland shots. While the movie looks great the real gem here is the writing. The screenplay is sharp and witty with more than a few lines that I have repeated several times. There is a fluidity and understanding of western lingo that helps to add to the realism that the movie strides for. It's not quite Tarantino Pulp Fiction smart but Zahler is on the right track as this is one of the best written movies I have seen in 2015.Bone Tomahawk eventually will blend genres about two thirds of the way through into a fairly intense horror movie. Not so much a visual horror movie but more psychological and suspenseful type of horror which I believe is always better. While not an overly gory movie there are some real tremendous moments of extreme pain suffered by the characters and you will feel that pain if you are watching intently.while not the most exciting movie of the year or the movie with the most movie stars, Bone Tomahawk is an entertaining western depiction. There was without a doubt a lot of care and knowledge that went into making this movie as realistic and as well made as possible. If slow dialogue filled movies with a fair amount of gore don't light your fire then stay away, but for the rest of us this is a western you should not ignore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something great and different with great acting and writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start, this film is very different but you know what, I like different. The acting from all is great, and Richard Jenkins was un recognizable to me so to him bravo. The writing is great as well. Overall the film is perfect for those in search of different films. Beware for those with weak stomachs, this isn't tombstone what so ever.It's a rather simple story, so simple I don't need to give a synopsis. But what I can tell you is its a really slow burn. It isn't your typical western, instead of creating good shootouts they develop characters and put you through the film. The term slow burn is perfect to describe the film, the director uses a great technique by making it slower thus making the violence greatly amplified, one of these scenes is quite the stomach churner.If it looks like your cup of tea then drink it, it's nice to see a good independent film done originally and away from studios. As I mentioned before if you're in search of something different, and I can't emphasize different enough, then you should give it at least a viewing. I hope this provides use and you can enjoy this different but great movie. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THIS movie should have been called "True Grit"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unusually engrossing movie, well made, with all the actors well suited for their roles, though I'd pause before saying that about Lila Simmons. Very well directed too, although frankly no one had thus far heard of Craig Zahler. This is more or less his first direction and script since the Asylum Blackout, and for a cook - sorry chef - Tomahawk is seriously impressive. May he not slip into limbo. The dialogue also contributed to the over all authentic feel of the period as was the understated acting by Kurt Russell. It must have been a tough sell for Zahler, being more or less an unknown, but its surely paid off. There really isn't a boring moment, though the action is sporadic. It isn't about the action but about the endurance and pain bearing ability of those tough cowboys that built the West, America, I dare say, so fast and so well. True Grit, if any western was about it, its this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd but interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film is an unusual combination of Western and horror, with the heroes tangling with a macabre tribe of cannibalistic native Americans (a fictional creation).Writer/Director S. Craig Zahler is to be commended both for his unique story and the way he was able to interest some notable actors to star in it under his own direction. Certainly the result is a rather odd cup of tea, not necessarily to the tastes of a broad audience, but there is a lot here to like or at least admire. Zahler's dialogue is deliberately idiosyncratic, with its formal cadences and unusual vocabulary choices, but it's in service to a rather plodding 'quest' storyline that builds to a rushed (albeit gruesome) finale.Along the way there are a few false steps. It's not a very suspenseful trek that the heroes make to rescue the townspeople abducted by the cannibals; the riding scenes (then walking after their horses are stolen) and bivouacs play out one after the other with little sense of pacing. In fact, their main function seems to be to pad out the film's running time.By the time the cannibals' lair has been discovered, the ensuing violence happens in discrete bursts of action with no build-up to a climax. Little enlightenment about the tribe, its origin and intentions, including whether there are enough survivors to remain a threat, is provided either visually or verbally.Performances by the cast, especially Kurt Russell as the sheriff and Richard Jenkins as his deputy, are an asset. However, Matthew Fox's character proves somewhat enigmatic and wooden. And Patrick Wilson, as the injured husband seeking to rescue his kidnapped wife, is okay but has done much more compelling work elsewhere.A couple of other minuses are the flat cinematography of mundane Southern California desert locations, and Zahler's apparent disinterest in close-ups. But the cannibals are pretty scary, and there's one spectacular prosthetic makeup effect like nothing I've ever seen.Overall, Zahler shows considerable promise as an off-the-beaten-path type of filmmaker, and viewers will probably want to keep an eye out for his next project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destined to be a cult classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Bone Tomahawk' is one of the more odd films to release this year. The production alone had it's fair share of mishaps. Whether it's the fact that it has been in production since 2007 or that no American studios would back it. So, we have an American western, horror film that was ready to shoot nearly six years ago that isn't even backed by an American film studios. Mainly because the content wasn't deemed profitable. And, to make things more interesting, it's a two hour film shot on location in 21 days. All with a measly 2 million dollar budget. The fact that this film turned out so well is a testament to how great the screenplay actually is. OK now lets actually talk about the films content. 'Bone Tomahawk' is basically a western wherein a few men go and try to rescue a few of their townsfolk. Who were abducted by an unknown tribe of Indians. Or Troglodytes, as the film calls them. This is the very simplified version of the actually plot which, again, runs at just over two hours. With it's all star cast and high praise it's interesting how little attention this film is actually getting. Granted, it's an odd genre mashup but what results is incredibly original and highly entertaining. It's sure to become a cult classic that is fondly remember for it's brutal, out of nowhere violence. Numerous times during the film we would be watching these characters interact then, suddenly, someone would lose their fingers, or face, or chest. Each time it happened it caught me so off guard, I was forced rewind and watch the scene again. The film does such a great job of making itself feel spontaneous that even things you expect to happen may catch you off guard. It easily puts the brutality of the old west right in the forefront. One moment you could be riding your horse around and the next you could wind up in a ditch with your throat slashed. It also helps that its characters are the main focus here. The majority of its two hour run time is spent in quiet moments where the characters discuss morality. Because, how moral can you be living in a place like this? It makes for an engrossing watch and a compelling retread of its familiar plot. 'Bone Tomahawk' does a lot right but it isn't without its draw backs. For starters, the film is long. Very long. For how thin the plot is it's astounding that it didn't bore me to tears (close at some parts though). While these characters are making their trek you are making one also. The trek of, trying to stay awake long enough to get into the interesting stuff. The middle section is particularly bad. It seems to forget what exactly the end goal is. And instead turns it's whole focus on the crippled man of the group. Which creates a lot of unnecessary fat that the film doesn't get rid of. It makes the emotional payoff of the films final act noticeably dampened. This forces ones suspension of disbelief to also be dampened. So, when these Troglodytes finally make their screen debut, it's hard not to laugh. Specifically when they do any kind of war cry or signal call. Obviously, this film isn't for everyone. The western genre in particular is one that people seem to avoid. But now that this blacklisted genre is being mixed with ultra violence you better believe no one saw this. This is unfortunate because you are missing out on one of the better films to release this year. Its characters, performances, direction, and story help to propel it above some unintentionally hilarious and dull moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That film reminds a little the "13th Warrior" of 1999 with Antonio Banderas. But I watched both films in a couple of days and I think that the "Bone Tomahawk" is much better. Although both films are entertaining, the "Bone Tomahawk" is a little more thrilling.Some people might say is a slow movie. But why a slow movie should mean that the film is necessarily bad? Anyway was not for me, and slow can be also good. It would be too boring to see those cowboys killing and slaughtering Indians for the all 120 minutes... It is just much more interesting watching them talking, having their conflicts, shooting Mexicans, losing horses and legs, and stuff like that in their own pace...It is a violent and bloody Western adventure. And it is good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best western of 2015!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bone Tomahawk, four men set out in the Wild West to rescue a group of captives from cannibalistic cave dwellers. A creative script with well-drawn out characters who are all interesting in their own right. It's a slow burn story, but its original and it pays off in drama and shocks. The cave-dwellers, the antagonists of this piece aren't seen in their entirety until the third act and they certainly don't disappoint when the blood begins to run. Be warned, this movie is not for the squeamish and doesn't shy away from the gore once the frenzy begins. Patrick Wilson plays the determined Arthur O'Dwyer whose beautiful wife (played by the lovely Lili Simmons from the TV Series, Banshee) has been captured by the mysterious cave-dwellers. Nothing will stand in Mr. O'Dwyers way of him seeing his wife again, not even his broken leg.Matthew Fox plays John Brooder. A strange, well-spoken gentleman with a dark side --and a story as to how he got it while Richard Jenkins plays the sentimental and babbling old timer, Chicaro. A war veteran and widow who has lived through it all. Sympathetically it seems he has been given the job of deputy of the town of 'Bright Hope' while Kurt Russell masterfully plays his boss, the sheriff and honorable lawman, Franklin Hunt who feels obliged to help husband Arthur O'Dwyer get his wife back.I was completely shocked to realize that this was a low-budget indie movie (1.8 million) because it's one of the best movies of 2015, and Kurt Russell's best movie of the year. Yes, I said it - Bone Tomahawk is better than the much-hyped 'The Hateful Eight' movie. But being such a 'small movie' in comparison it hasn't gotten the attention it has deserved which is a real shame because this one has cult-following all over it.I can honestly say this because it doesn't happen often. I had no expectations or hype going into this one and was blown away by most, if not all of it. A great surprise and a great movie with a cast of interesting, well-developed and rounded out characters. Awesome movie and the best western of 2015!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning performances!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author Craig Zahler's directorial debut is a beautiful period piece set in the old west. I haven't enjoyed a western in quite a while... and this was an absolutely fantastic film!The story takes place in the town of Bright Hope, which for the most part is a small settlement not far from the Mexican border. Kurt Russell kicks the dust off his boots and returns as yet another western sheriff (not since he played Wyatt Earp in 'Tombstone'). Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, and Mathew Fox come together to form a posse of lawmen looking to rescue Wilson's wife, the local town doctor, after being kidnapped by a native tribes-people of mythical nature.What really drew me in were the performances from each of the actors. Everybody brought something fantastic to the screen, and I was always surprised when I realized I forgot the name of a certain actor, and when I completely believed that they were someone else entirely. Kurt Russell does a fine job of portraying the duty bound Sheriff, but the real surprise for me was Richard Jenkins as the elderly Deputy. The way he changed so much of himself to really represent the age of the character, and the somewhat simple nature of the aged, just completely blew me away. I was captivated by his performance alongside so many other great actors.There are some very shocking scenes in this film, and a grit that seems all too real at times. A few of the gorier scenes seemed a little over the top with violence, but that seems to be the trend these days with other modern western titles focusing on violence rather than story. However there weren't too many of them, and they balanced the storyline well. A few of the more disgusting moments are saved till the end, and it begins to touch briefly on the horror genre, as you learn more about the kind of evil these men are up against. But overall there were some pretty fantastic moments of shock, blended in well in order to make a deeply moving piece of cinema.A great story, even better acting, and just a touch of madness, 'Bone Tomahawk' is not a film you want to miss.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns in many years, and Kurt Russell is back to form in this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're here for a rescue, not a massacre." Arthur O'Dwyer is trying to make a living in a small western town with his wife. When a stranger comes into town something seems off, and when Arthur's wife is kidnapped there is only one suspect. He enlists the help of Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Russell) and they set off, but when the truth of the identity of the captors comes out things become more dangerous then imagined. The western genre lately has taken a dive. What was once the pinnacle with stars like John Wayne has turned into cheesy B-rate made for TV garbage that is hard to watch. This movie is an exception. This is one of the better westerns in a long time, and it does have some little horror aspects thrown in to spice it up. The movie is really just another hunt and chase film but it had something extra that made it seem exciting and kept me watching all the way to the end wanting to see what happens next. The only real downside of this movie is that it is a little slow moving, but the deliberate pacing actually adds to the tension and helps the movie out. Overall, one of the best westerns in many years, and Kurt Russell is back to form in this one. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, love Kurt Russell after all these years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The husband and I were looking for something to watch on a Saturday night and found this listed and thought the price was right and it has Kurt Russell. Actors Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox (where has he been?), and Richard Jenkins are an outstanding secondary cast to Kurt and we also appreciated Lilli Simmons (who I had never seen before) as the doctor who gets captured and sparks the posse to set out and rescue her. I loved her character's storyline and attitude, not your usual western where the woman just lets herself be taken care of or controlled. I'll have to check out BANSHEE on Amazon to catch more of her acting. We really liked the movie even though it started out a little slow, when they got on the trail it finally picked up. The brutal encounters with the cannibalistic Indians were crazy, very scary, and made for a thrilling finale. Won't say more, but I highly recommend this movie, great acting from all the actors, solid plot, and a more than satisfying finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What has Kurt Russel been up to lately?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****May contain spoilers****That was my question beginning my journey to look it up and found...hey...what's this.... Bone Tomahawk? Hmmm..... let's check this one out, as I love Kurt Russel as an actor.As the movie started I were falling into comfort and just embracing the feeling of the whole thing. Then suddenly...what?! Oh....it is a adventure, drama... and HORROR movie.This movie is....well....in my opinion and experience, the movie this year that has really shook me up (and chocked me). For me so far the movie of the year, and I see a lot of movies. It has giving' me nightmares, to be up close and personal. The dialogue, the pace, the "every day" feeling with intense moments are great. So great it is in my opinion a nod and a flick to Quentin Tarantino. Some straight forward "one-liners" makes the movie just kicking it up even more. Through some subtle and warm humour, and you got a nice little recipe for a movie. The moments of adventure, drama and "gore-to-the-core" horror plus the fact that the silence around the situations makes the whole movie come very close... so close that it creates a special emotion going down my spine.So....on the negative side, sometimes the movie becomes almost boring, in it's pace. At one time, I said to myself "Now, something has to happen..." And one minute later....boom! Another negative thing is that some things in the movie should have been more worked through, as there are moments that boggles the mind with; how...HOW could that be?" If it were shorter, it would have been closing up to a better review from me.All in all; Great acting, great producing, great directing........great...no, wait... awesome picture. I highly recommend it. And...as somebody else wrote... an instant cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, excellent dialogue, and impressive visuals on a budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between its "horror western" billing and barely detectable presence at the box office, Bone Tomahawk has "cult film" written all over it and that's a shame because it certainly deserves a wider audience. The 10 or so people I've asked about Bone Tomahawk had never heard of it and that lack of awareness, due to little or no promotion, is an unfortunate by-product of the film's independent nature (it cost less than $2 million to make). Kurt Russell, the film's star, turns in a first-rate performance as Frank Hunt, the sheriff of a frontier town in the American West in the 1800's. Russell hasn't acted much since starring in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof in 2007 and it's nice to see him back in 2015 with some high profile and meaty roles (this summer's Furious 7 and Tarantino's about-to-be-released The Hateful Eight). Here, he's surrounded by a talented cast that includes Patrick Wilson (Watchmen and the current season of TV's Fargo), Richard Jenkins (The Visitor and TV's Six Feet Under), and Matthew Fox (TV's Lost), with additional support from David Arquette, Lili Simmons, and Sean Young.First-time director S. Craig Zahler also wrote the character-driven screenplay, which Russell called "the best Western I've read since Tombstone". I was rather surprised to learn that 1993's Tombstone was the last western Russell had appeared in, considering how memorable he was in it as Wyatt Earp and how comfortable he seems in the genre (apparently he's making up for lost time - The Hateful Eight is also a Western). The gruff Hunt, sporting a lite version of the full-on Yosemite Sam-style facial hair Russell displays in Tarantino's upcoming film, heads up a four-man posse who represent the only hope for some locals kidnapped by a tribe of cannibalistic cave-dwellers. Also included in the foursome are Jenkins' bumbling deputy (the film's go-to source for comic relief), Fox's dandyish gunslinger, and Wilson as the broken-legged distraught husband of one of the kidnapped townsfolk. The physical limitations of Wilson's character impede the urgent nature of the group's quest, who need to make a five day journey in three days. That conveniently helps to extend the time available for the interplay between the four radically different characters and it's those lively exchanges that are Bone Tomahawk's core strength. Viewers looking for extended action sequences or buckets of blood will be sorely disappointed - this is a slowly paced and talk-heavy film. That being said, Bone Tomahawk does contain some occasionally brutal visuals; one particularly disturbing scene is likely to stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling.One of the few faults I can find with Bone Tomahawk is that it does feel a tad overstretched at 132 minutes. Otherwise, Zahler impresses mightily in a directorial debut that features excellent casting, sharp dialogue, and a beautiful look that shows no signs of the film's minuscule budget.mediaboymusings.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful portrayal of civilization versus savagery. Nobody seems to be noticing how civilized the good guys are in this movie. Husbands and wives who actually love and value each other, men who live by a code, men who stand up to be counted when needed, men who, just before they're literally cleft in two, take the time to sort out their mundane affairs.I would have rated this ten out of ten, if not for some minor flaws and inconsistencies. For instance, when you've just escaped being murdered by two marauding cannibals by the skin of your teeth, the first thing you should do is make sure there aren't any others around, before you start appropriating their body modifications. When you're at a dead end in the cannibals' cave, it would be a good idea to stand facing the entrance before having a little chit-chat. The reactions of the party after watching one of their own get butchered in a spectacularly brutal fashion are pretty much nonexistent. The woman lies down for a nap and the men go back to casual conversation as if nothing happened.But apart from these minor missteps, an absolute gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolutely Intense Western Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't quite what I expected. When I heard the name of the title I literally laughed in amusement at how ridiculous it sounded. With that being said I had seconds before checked out the cast listings and noticed some many great names such as Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, Patrick Wilson and my absolute favorite actor of all time Kurt Russell. I haven't seen Kurt Russell in a lot of movies recently and was quite excited and I was even more excited when I found out the premise of the movie. Cannibalistic Native Americans sounded like something that would destroy a movie right off the bat but I was wrong... Dead wrong. The movie is very well made and something I was pleasantly surprised at... However it is not a movie you walk away from with a huge smile on your face. It is very dark and very graphic but never over-the- top. In fact the movie has a slow-burn nature in that it gradually allows you to understand and connect with the characters before all hell breaks loose. The movie is very cold and very quaint and has a very ambient music score that draws you in with its intensity and emotional moments. The story may be simple but this is more of a character study and almost if not all the performances are fantastic. Everyone does a great job and I absolutely loved Kurt Russell in it. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you're a Kurt Russell or horror movie fan. But be warned cause it isn't a pleasant or milk-warm experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's Wild West Encounters Wes Craven's Horrors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsOn the list of things the world needs, a mash-up of "The Searchers" and "The Hills Have Eyes" is pretty far down there. But if there was going to be such a thing, the smartly cast and well-crafted "Bone Tomahawk" fits the bill nicely. A witty fusion of western, horror, and comedy that gallops to its own beat - "Bone Tomahawk's" peculiar genre- blend won't be for everyone, but its gripping performances and a slow- burning story should satisfy those in search of something different. The rewarding western elements transition smoothly into the world of horror, like the sun moving behind a cloud; and yeah, things get dark and startlingly violent.S. Craig Zahler's directorial debut is set in the frontier lands - not just between civilization and savagery some time after America's Civil War, but also between oater heroics (and antiheroics), Coen- esque clusterfuckery, and a pioneering form of horror. It's a western that's also a comedy until the good humor runs out and what's left turns into a grim horror film. And for all its grim, grotesque leanings, the film smartly steers away from despondency; the story and characterization genuinely fears for its protagonists' lives while still holding legitimate hope that they're smart enough and tough enough to emerge out the other side intact. Also, though its cult-movie desires often show, "Bone Tomahawk" is ultimately sold by its cast, who commit fully to Zahler's discursive indulgences.All in all, the movie is a strong directorial debut, and one of the year's most unique genre films - a neo-cannibalistic-western-horror with deliberately paced old-school cowboy elements paying homage to auteurs from John Ford to Howard Hawks.</fullReview>

But it all got very awkward and boring once the posse headed off to get the troglodytes. Did they really have to focus so much time on men travelling through the desert, with nothing much happening ? The scenes in the cave were gruesome enough, but the troglodytes didn't really seem scary...just bit extras dressed up in grey make-up. The film was definitely a half hour too long, and it never really got going. The ending was also a disappointment. Overall it was a waste of time.

The story is of a trek of four men, going to rescue people from their little town kidnapped by cave dweller troglodytes. It is not a happy movie.But what really shines is the acting, the carefully crafted characters in the script and the way each thing in the film has value. One of the best things in it for me is how the movie ignored Chekhov's Gun and the Red Herrings and just did a believable, historically accurate and gritty story, and did it well.Glad to see Kurt Russel return to form, Richard Jenkins is brilliant as ever, almost didn't recognized him in the film, Matthew Fox proves again that he is a good actor - too bad Lost ended any significant career he might have had until now, I hope that changes soon and Patrick Wilson again does a good job.There is no real closure to the film. It does hint of a finality, but in fact it is all about the journey. Watch it. It is brutal at times, but mostly it is wonderful to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk isn't a perfect movie but for those with a love of good character actors it's an obscure little treat that toes the line between The Twilight Zone and Quentin Tarantino.Don't wet your pants. I don't like Tarantino! There's a lot of talking. A lot. But the action, when it happens, is authentic and gruesome. It's classed as a horror western but it's just cowboys and Indians with conventional horror gore because it's about cannibals and on that front I wasn't disappointed.Kurt Russell is a natural as always and leads like the pro he is. His chemistry with Richard Jenkins was best, and Jenkins is barely recognisable but is solid as usual. Matthew Fox has impressed me lately with his character efforts and this tops it. He's right out of the frontier days. I can never fault Patrick Wilson either.The atmosphere seems to build on the fact that there's no music. None. Not even ambiance. It's like a constant sense of sinister awkwardness.That can also slow a movie down, though, especially when there's so much talking.My two main gripes are the beginning and the end.Stop giving David Arquette acting jobs. The first ten minutes sells the movie. You almost couldn't give this intro away. The cinematography was also lazy at times.The end is also too quick, so pointless, and ultimately sells the movie short. Some people like ambiguous endings. I used to, when the likes of John Carpenter could pull them off. I think everyone was eager to get home by the end, like the cast and crew.It's worth a watch. The leads do a great job, but I feel they were let down at times by the rest of the production!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film the other day and i have to say i was surprised how many positive reviews this very site has to offer for this production.Let's keep it short, some of the dialogue is hilarious and probably already the best thing about this film. Hats off to that.The editing sucks, shall mean almost every scene is way too long and drawn out. Now films with a slow build up do work when they are accompanied by atmospheric music and meaningful scenes. This film is not. The acting is stiff and lackluster. The camera is boring paint- by-numbers work. And throughout the film there are no real highlights. After the 90 minutes mark i was scratching my head because in all this time Bone Tomahawk had almost nothing accomplished.This film was a giant uninspired bore. Seen worse, but then again seen a lot of better movies this year. Bone Tomahawk is 2 out of 10. Better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swing and a miss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie, but it was a huge miss. These are some good actors and the movie has an interesting premise, but man oh man was that script bad. The dialogue is just so out of place and sterile that it had me cringing half the time and laughing the rest. I prefer a horror/thriller film to have a solid story, time to form characters, and a nice build to the climax, but the pace of this movie is all wrong. If you're going to spend so much time on conversations and so little time on action, there better be some progressing interest in the characters and a sense of involvement in the story. That just wasn't present with this film, despite the fact that well over half of it is spent in aimless talking and walking. The actors were held back by terrible writing and poor character development throughout the story, leaving us with sub-par acting and uninteresting characters. The general lack of a soundtrack contributes to the overall dullness and sterility of this film. As for scares, there really weren't any, although I will give points for the horror factor with those cave scenes towards the end (shivered and cringed during that stuff). Overall a solid idea with some great actors that just went straight to hell due to the awful writing, particularly the dialogue. Like I said, I really wanted to like this one and stuck with it even after the first 20 minutes made me realize how bad the writing was. But if you just have to find out like I did and find yourself doubting 20 minutes in, trust me, it doesn't get better and it's not worth waiting till the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B movie - boring and predictable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ponderous, predictable and so, so, so unworthy of it's 7.3 rating. I thought Russell was a good actor back in the time, but in this he is just OK - and that is about the measure of things. Reminds me of a 70's 'journey to the centre of the earth' type of film - no disrespect to that film, it was great in it's day, and sadly this would have been just as great back then as well. The story was just bad - corny and drawn out, as if the author/script writer ran out of ideas and then padded it out with completely irrelevant rubbish. In fact it was so boring I am finding it hard to fulfil the 10 line quota - oh I know, I sat willing the film to get better - but it didn't. My wife looked at me and shook her head as she got up from the sofa and said 'I do not believe you made me sit through that'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did we see the same movie?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How this movie holds a rating anything above a 4 is mind boggling. I stuck with this move HOPING that I would see what the hype was about. Sadly I wasted 2 precious hours of my time. Who went an passed around the Bone Tomahawk kool-aid?Dialogue/Characters: This seems to be the highlight for most reviewers. Seriously?! Did we see the same movie?.. These characters couldn't be any more 1-dimensional. The dialogue was excruciatingly forced, falling flat. There was literally no character development. No arc. Really? This entire category felt totally uninspired. Kurt Russell was fine, hard for him to be "bad" in anything. Matthew Fox was particularly stale. The rest of the cast was present. Directing/Cinematography/Editing: A previous reviewer mentioned that this was a "paint by numbers" film, and the director "must hate close-ups". Completely agree. This had b-movie written all over it. Long takes where they didn't need to be. Lack of camera adjustments. Poorly composed shots.Creativity: For the most part I find it lacking. Just because you jam multiple genres together, doesn't mean you've done something special. I will however give the director kudos on the gruesome kills; though few and far between.If you want to see a western with good dialogue, starring Kurt Russell, go watch The Hateful Eight.Want to see a slow western, with actual character development and trekking across the American west? Check out Slow WestWant to see a gruesome horror? Check out something by Eli Roth. At least that man knows how to handle a camera and compose a shot.I do have to admit, the film I saw just previous to this was True Grit (2010). Which is one of the best westerns ever made, imo. So maybe my standards are high. Want to call me bitter, or a film snob? Go ahead.This money stinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good western for those in the right mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that "Bone Tomahawk" is a movie that will really divide viewers. People will either love it or hate it, with no one in the middle ground. Personally, I really enjoyed it. That is not to say that the movie is without flaws. The low budget of the enterprise (less than $2 million) is evident at times, though I credit writer/director S. Craig Zahler for working hard so the movie never looks extremely cheap. And yes, the movie is both long (over two hours in length) and for the most part slow moving; the movie would almost certainly have been better had the pacing been somewhat quicker. Despite these flaws, the movie does have a lot of power. The dialogue is pretty good, being colorful but not too much; you can believe these characters would say what they say. The acting is also professional; the cast manages to sell their characters. When it comes to action and violence, you do have to wait a long time for the serious stuff to come, but it's worth the wait, being very hard hitting and seriously bloody. And while the movie is overlong and slow, I personally wasn't bored at any moment; there is always something of interest going on. But despite my enjoyment of the movie, as I said, it's not for everyone. But if you like westerns and possess a good amount of patience, you'll probably enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Average Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A unique concept where Western meets Horror was enough to pique my interest. Bone Tomahawk contains some brutal scenes and a strong build- up but overall wasn't as suspenseful as I hoped it to be. The movie's style could be somewhat be compared to that of the Coen Brothers. It felt like a mix between The Hatefull Eight and The Descent, which sounds quite exciting if we're being honest.I really enjoyed following Sheriff Franklin (Kurt Russel) and John Brooder (Mathew Fox). Not only did they played the coolest characters, they also had the best performances. At least, that's my opinion. It's nice to see Kurt Russel back and I still believe that Matthew Fox is underrated. That being said I couldn't care less about the other main characters. I feel like their should've been more chemistry between Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons) and Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson ).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where did all the good directors go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been wasting my money on a whole lot of bad movies lately. This one has to be in the bottom 10. Nothing on location, all filmed at Paramount studios, but...who cares? The movie dragged out. It was full of clichés, and the script was horrible, when you could hear the lines. The sound mix was so bad that you could clearly hear one person in a conversation, and not be able to discern a word the other person was saying.So, I cranked up the sound, and in the next scene it was BLARING! Much of the dialog and situations were stolen from other films. ugh. This film was so boring, that I can only rate it a "C", and that's being generous. I wonder where all the good directors in Hollywood went. This movie is proof positive that a name can sell a ticket. Kurt Russell at his very WORST! For those who gave it a high ranking, they must be missing out on the good stuff.My closing statement? Don't waste your time. (Or money)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Sure What to Make of This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 90% of this by not watching it...I was surfing the net on another tab whilst listening. And that just about sums this experience up for me. There is clever dialogue. It's authentic and beautifully acted. But, boy, is it slow and boring. Seriously, four guys tracking someone. And then they lose their horses so it gets even slower as they have to walk. Oh, and then one becomes seriously crippled so even the walking was remembered with fondness (okay, I admit, I was dipping back to watch it every half hour or so). 90% was tedious and arty, but then the remaining 10%... wtf? ... I'm not sure I want some of those scenes in my head. Sort of wish I could un-see them. The Green Inferno (another cannibal story) did absolutely nothing on the horror front for me. It was daft. But one or two of these scenes were so out of context of the rest of the movie that they stand out like horror glimpsed in strobe lighting. So I guess the movie worked in a way, despite seeming to be a slow, boring film about nothing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except those who like extreme, visceral horror. And that statement makes me shake my head in wonder, as I could have sat my grandmother down to watch most of it and she'd probably have thought she was watching The Searchers. Actually, that's an interesting point when I think about it. If you've seen that remarkable movie with John Wayne, you'll recall when he crawls to the lip of the rocks and witnesses what the Indians are doing to the women they've captured. We, the audience, get nothing more than his expression and a shake of his head as he refuses to divulge what he's seen. And I can recall that scene decades later. It terrified me as a child. The not knowing, the less is more theory, worked to perfection. I'd have preferred less is more for this one, too. Or what there was spread out a bit so the whole movie shifted with a nice pace. No, didn't enjoy this one. Don't recommend it. Like finding a razor blade in rice pudding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless "Horror Western" gore-fest is guaranteed to offend most members of the Native American community</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is the creation of one S. Craig Zahler who is listed in Wikipedia as a jack of all trades: "author, screenwriter, songwriter, musician, director and cinematographer." Zahler's concoction fits into a literary sub-genre known as "weird west"?again thanks to Wikipedia we learn that this sub-genre "combines elements of the Western with another literary genre, usually horror, occult, or fantasy."Zahler is content to promulgate the myth of a violent, wild west, replete with cowboys armed with six-shooters and rapacious Indians bent on scalping the first settler they see. Unfortunately, the reality is that the so-called wild west was far less violent than what we see today regarding criminal activity. You can find late 19th century photos on the internet from places like Dodge City, sporting billboards that read "the carrying of firearms is strictly forbidden." Zahler's chief desire appears to be out-dueling Tarantino for the coveted most in love with violence writer/director award in American cinema today. Indeed, he begins his magnum opus with Tweedledum and Tweedledee killers, Purvis and Buddy, who murder innocent travelers off the beaten path. Buddy, as you may already know, falls victim to a bunch of Indians who I guarantee did not exist in the 1890s when the film takes place (nor ever existed), and Purvis then makes his way to the town of Bright Hope, which was filmed at the Paramount Ranch.This location has been used for years as a stand-in for a small, wild western town. Unfortunately, Zahler's low budget prevented his crew from making enough alterations so that the town appears lived in. Zahler trots out a few stock characters including the sheriff Franklin Hunt (decently played by Kurt Russell), his old codger backup deputy, Chicory, and John Brooder, a more intellectual "ladies man," who attempts to summon the town doctor after Hunt shoots bad guy Purvis who can't keep himself from acting up at the local saloon. With the doctor drunk, Brooder finds the doctor's assistant, Samantha, who has just finished a steady bout of lovemaking with her husband Arthur O'Dwyer, a foreman who's laid up in bed with a nasty leg injury.While Hunt, Chicory and Brooder investigate the murder of a stable hand (the usual "dispensable" black guy), Samantha, Hunt's regular deputy Nick and Purvis are found to be missing back at the jail. Instead of summoning help (perhaps in the form of military personnel), Hunt forms an unlikely posse including Chicory and Brooder and is talked into allowing O'Dwyer (who can barely walk with his injured leg) to trek through the wilderness, hoping to locate their missing compatriots. O'Dwyer's love (or should I say lust?) is so great that he's willing to crawl through the desert to find his lost Samantha.Before they depart, an arrow found at the jail is examined by a local Native American wise man who links it to a place called "Valley of the Starving Men," where a group of troglodytes (cave-dwellers) is probably to blame for the kidnapping of Samantha and the deputy. The wise man (who sounds more like a professor at a local college), advises that the troglodytes are shunned by normal Native Americans and in fact are cannibalistic savages.The next sequence (which is quite long) involves the posse heading for hostile territory. Along the way, Brooder kills two Mexican scouts and later the group's horses are stolen by rustlers. O'Dwyer re-injures his leg after fighting with Brooder and is left by the rest of the group to recuperate (before insanely trying to rejoin them, again basically crawling through the desert).I will not detail how exactly the posse ends up imprisoned in the troglodytes' cave but suffice it to say Brooder is the first casualty. While Zahler perhaps technically cannot be accused of racism because he makes it clear that his troglodytes are an ostracized group of Native Americans, the introduction of these characters into the narrative, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. First of all, these type of "savages" were never known to exist in the "wild west," but are still associated here with Native American culture. All disclaimers aside, the mere image of Native Americans perpetrating ghastly acts of savagery on "white people" should be enough to upset any Native American when he ponders such "untruths" in a darkened movie theater. Of course the reality is that acts of savagery occurred the other way around?it was the US military of course which was responsible for the great numbers of heinous crimes against the Native American population during the 19th century.The pointlessness of Zahler's tale reaches its apotheosis when the audience is forced to witness the scalping of Nick the deputy and his dismemberment at the hands of the zombie-like troglodytes. If we must witness such cheap thrills, why doesn't Zahler turn his zombies into a bunch of aliens so that the perpetuation of the myth of the savage "Indian," is repudiated?Perhaps with the dismemberment scene Zahler has gone toe to toe with Tarantino, and won. In addition to Zahler's apparent victory over the master of gore himself, I am also forced to conclude that Bone Tomahawk defies its internal logic (how does O'Dwyer manage to get himself up into the cave with his injured leg? And why does Samantha remain apparently untouched by the savage troglodytes?) Is there a more pointless film than Bone Tomahawk among the selection of Spirit Award hopefuls? I don't think so. Not only is it pointless but offensive to boot. See it at your peril!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, but problematic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember westerns? No, no I wasn't born during their heyday either, but the story of cowboys and (vs) indians has become ubiquitous in Hollywood, and you could argue has even shaped our understanding of the history of the formation of both Canada and the United States. You could say that people aren't informed by film, but when you don't have a firm concept of history, why wouldn't you pull some influence from the pop culture around you? The portrayal of First Nations people in film as savages, and the constant referral to them as such, is something that we are all aware of, even if we don't particularly like western movies. The issue with this kind of story, in 2015, is that it always feel a bit uncomfortable and dated. The idealized version of the wild west is something that has absolutely not aged well, especially as more and more is learned about the treatment of First Nations people by Europeans during the colonization of North America, and more of that knowledge is fed into the mainstream. It's because of this that Bone Tomahawk made me pretty uncomfortable from start to finish, because it wasn't released years ago, but this year.Now, I know that many of you are thinking "ITS AN HOMAGE TO CLASSIC WESTERRRRRNNNNNS GAAWWWDDDDD DON'T BE SUCH A PC SJW DBAG GODDDDDDDDDDD", but the fact is, homage or not, the ideas and characterizations in this movie are pretty dated and bizarre to watch in a contemporary movie. Hell, the movie is even full of actors that I like, giving really solid performances, but you can't just ignore the parts about the movie that are uncomfortable, because doing that gives the green light to continue. As well, it's not as though this movie is doing anything new or interesting with the archetypes of a Western. It's a pretty standard story of "good guys vs bad guys" and the bad guys are "savages". There is an aboriginal character who is portrayed as pretty assimilated, and he is the "good Indian" in the movie, which is an uncomfortable character as well. They also introduce one black character, only to have him immediately shot and killed about 30 seconds after he is introduced, leaving us with a mostly white-male cast for the rest of the film.I mentioned actors that I liked, and I stand by that. The movie stars Kurt Russel (Death Proof) with a stunningly beautiful beard, and giving a dynamite performance as he always does, as well as Patrick Wilson (Insidious), who I generally enjoy as an actor. You also have Richard Jenkins (Cabin in the Woods), Matthew Fox (Lost), Sid Haig (The Devil's Rejects) and David Arquette (Scream). When it comes to the casting of the Native American characters, there is a casual nature to the way that they are cast, I found two actors in the credited cast who were Native American, or at least that I could find out were, but it seemed that casting them wasn't terribly important here, which is unfortunately pretty common for movies like this.As well as a pretty solid cast, you have a pretty good directorial effort by S. Craig Zahler, in his debut. He is also responsible for writing this, and previously wrote Asylum Blackout, which is one that I've heard good things about. It's clear that Zahler likes westerns, and has an understanding of how they work and what elements need to be included to make them work. He also works quite well with cinematographer Benji Bakshi (Comedy Bang Bang) and there's simply no denying that the movie is well shot, and competently made. With the exception of being substantially longer than it has any business being. At over 2 hours, it's really unclear as to why this needed to go on as long as it did. It could have worked a bit better with a trim of 40 or so minutes, because the time spent developing the characters isn't especially interesting. They are the stock characters of most westerns, and it's another thing that shows this isn't really trying anything new. With the exception of some weird and super obvious reused shots, the movie does work on a technical level.What I've seen in a lot of reviews is the praise given to the violence and intensity of the end of the film, while I'm not sure that the violence is anything more than we might be used to in any other horror movie, where this movie sets itself apart is in the lack of a soundtrack. With no soundtrack to punctuate EVERY SINGLE ACTION EVER, the violence is presented in a way that feels very matter-of-factly. Kind of like whenever someone dies in the wire, there's no ceremony about it, it's just done. There is some pretty brutal violence in the last act of the movie, though its nothing you won't be able to see if you got through Eli Roth's latest pile of sh*t.Ultimately what you have here is an overlong, outdated horror movie where the white guys win over the evil "savages" that has some gory or disturbing moments in the last 20 minutes. It's not a bad film, but it's also one that feels weird in 2015. It's competently made, but I have to wonder ? why? Anyways, I had a lot more to say about this than I expected, so let me know what you though.WWW.BARLEYDOESHORROR.COM</fullReview>

I think it deserves a theatrical release. It was true to the western genre but it wasn't much of a horror genre, it had some gory moments and I would let the misleading genre slide because of the fantastic plot, great dialogues and unpredictable turn of events.

		<fullReview>When a group of cannibal savages kidnaps settlers from the small town of Bright Hope, an unlikely team of gunslingers, led by Sheriff Franklin Hunt, sets out to bring them home. But their enemy is more ruthless than anyone could have imagined, putting their mission, and survival itself ? in serious jeopardy........For face value, this looks like just another western Kurt Russell made after The Hateful Eight, because he had the time and the facial hair. Add an impressive cast and Sean Young, and again, on face value alone, you'd expect some slow burning, but well acted old fashioned western.Ha ha to you if you are thinking of avoiding this because of the above beliefs, because this is so etching else. Even though the opening five minutes teases the viewer with things to come, Bone Tomahawk doesn't just work because of its stranger than thou final forty minutes, it's the camaraderie of the four main characters during their long arduous journey to the unknown.Russell is wonderful as expected, like Jeff Bridges in True Grit but coherent. Wilson plays the walking wounded, and for the most part he does grate a little, but surprises toward the end. But Jenkins is absolutely wonderful as Chicory, and it took me a good hour before I realised that it was him, as he's almost unrecognisable and plays his character down throughout the film.Fox is good, but he looks a little out of place in his white suit and a permanent look on his face as if he's saying 'mmmmmmmmmm'.So for about ninety minutes, give or take a couple of scenes, it's a slow burner, the four men bonding, and coming to blows as their little traits start to aggrieved each other. And although this sounds like a bit of a slog, it's the first five minutes with Arquette and Haig that keep you entranced, because you know that there is a different film here somewhere, and the four protagonists are slowly making their way toward it.And then the film goes in another direction, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it has one of the most disturbing scenes you will see on screen this year. And then it just gets all the more bizarre, and kudos for the film for doing this.The four leads have so much chemistry that the running time just seems to go by so quickly, and there are times among the stark brutality, that there shades of wonderful humour.Heaven knows why this won't get a wide release, twenty years ago it would have been one of the years big releases, but hey, studios don't like taking chances on originality.Catch it as soon as you can, it's one of the best westerns of the last twenty years.</fullReview>

I was further startled to see the low budget; proving again that actors, acting, script, location and a determined team can surmount a low budget.See this movie, while it becomes suddenly gory, is also well done.</fullReview>

Craig Zahler. Told at an extremely measured pace and primarily driven by characterisation, Bone Tomahawk might prove an arduous journey for those who demand constant action and thrills, especially with the film clocking in at a whopping 132 minutes; others, however, should find that the engaging performances from the male leads, Zahler's wry dialogue and the occasional moment of extreme violence compensate adequately for the languorous approach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what an amazing film. I had no expectations when I started watching this. for most of the film. the pace will deliver a high degree of realism and honoring to the western era. acting was mesmerizing and I was so happy to see Mr. Russell back. I salute the producers and director for this experience. in the midst of overflow of based on games and comics movies, they were adventurous and may I even say courageous enough to give us a movie with solid story, meticulously selected cast put in a hyper realistic environment which is truthful to the time of events, all wrapped in a professional filmmaking (with no meaningless nor unnecessary edits, visual effects or even music score) Well, there were some visual effects, but were executed very professionally along with sound design to deliver some of the most gruesome and disturbing scenes. a must see for bleak western genre lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an exceptionally good movie. I am not sure that it should be called a western since it only happens to be set in such an environment. It could equally well be situated in the rain forests of Borneo, Sumatra or any remote place, really.Anyhow: Good acting, good dialogue, good camera. Really good suspense and quite gory.Jeeez, I wish they made more movies like this one.Curt Russell rules but I must say that Richard Jenkins does the most enjoyable fellow in this flick.So if you want to see a good and gory horror flick, totally devoid of any moral lessons or deeper thougths: Look no further!.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Western horrors are few and far between. They really don't come along often, and it's such a pleasurable meshing of genres when they do that nailing it only serves to heighten the experience. This one was a real curve-ball of a surprise, I have to admit. Starts out with a brief but creepy introduction to our lethally predatory antagonists before ruggedly commencing into a sawdust-on- the-floor-western, which gradually descends into gruesome horror towards the final act. Patrick Wilson pulls out all the stops as the crippled hubby looking to rescue his wife, whose stubborn determination to locate and recover his beloved, and keep up with the more able-bodied rescue party despite his afflictions is heart- rendingly portrayed, utilising a nifty twist towards the end to give him an unexpected and much needed upper hand. Kurt Russell is as ever is on form as the sheriff leading the search and rescue mission, with the almost useless but loyal assistance of a nearly unrecognisable Richard Jenkins as his doddery old deputy. As I mentioned earlier, the horror takes a while to turn up, but the journey there is a real authentically period treat of character acting, and when the darkness does arrive it brings with it a particularly gruesome death, and without giving too much away, there's an astoundingly well written heroic final line that almost brings tears to your eyes, if not at least an approving air-punch. Each person cast is a joy to watch, bringing their own eccentricities, pretensions, and reliability to the table. Hell even Sean Young holds her own in her brief appearance. I thoroughly enjoyed this. It does what films are ultimately meant to do: Tell a cracker of a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. It is long (over 2 hours) but the pace is not slow. The pace is just right for the story. Even with this long run there is really not any back story on the heroes or the villains but it did not matter. The writing and acting were so stellar and even unconventional that I felt drawn into this western town. I could actually watch these characters just sit at the saloon and talk, especially Chicory. The humor worked, and when it got scary it really got scary. I did not want anything to happen to these people. I really felt for them. This was not an art film or a message film. There is no mention of global warming, evil businesses, corrupt governments, etc. Even the villains were not portrayed as innocent victims abused by others. The stereotypical heroic female did not save the day, the token minority who sacrifices themselves was absent. There was not even the brave reporter or newsperson who risks all for the story. Just an entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting down to watch 'Bone Tomahawk' I was excited, the concept was clever, unique. The opening scene immediately sets the tone for the rest of the film, it's graphic, brutal and relies on realism for its shocks. It is not, however, the only thing that is given to us in this movie. The ironically named small western town of Bright Hope that is presented to us shows us the humanity in the characters we are introduced to, with 3 people on the police force it's clear bright hope doesn't have much trouble makers, which makes what's to follow all the more shocking. The 'troglodytes' are portrayed masterfully, they behave like wild animals, everything they do is so astronomically different from the people of Bright Hope that it makes them seem almost supernatural, those blood curdling howls will stay in your mind for a few nights to come. Bone Tomahawk's real success does come from its realism, it's shocking brutality and managing to avoid the all out killing spree we've become so accustomed to in horror films, this is what leads me to give this film an 8/10. It is definitely worthy of fitting in to the horror genre, some of the deaths will haunt your nightmares, but there is undeniably good character arcs, an entertaining story and great acting performances amongst all the insanity, Bone Tomahawk is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just back from watching this movie in the local cinema. From start to finish this film works. The dialog is consistently good. The acting is a very high quality. This film works at a number of different levels. It evokes the spirit and feeling of a classic western like the searchers but also has a sinister undertow which hints at a greater menace lurking in the background. The characters are really well drawn and as the film progresses, the bond between them grows naturally. There is genuine horror in this movie also and the protagonists are scary on a human level. Kurt Russell is superb in this film as is his sidekick Richard Jenkins. It almost seems unfair to single out anyone as there are no weak performances in this piece of work. I happened to watch Slow West last week. It is a good film and a different type of movie. But if you are looking for an entertaining evening, go see this instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western meets horror and earns an A!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that may turn people off, it has a slower feel with less action than some may hope. Other than that BRAVO! Kurt Russell won our hearts as Wyatt Earp and to see him in another leading Western movie role was great. His acting was spot on and believable as always. Patrick Wilson continues to shine as one of Hollywood's best male actors. His role as a cowboy with a fractured shin makes you feel his pain. His desire to find his wife is also believable and passionate. Mathew Fox was seriously amazing as a well to do, former soldier turned gun slinger. Truly captured his role better than anyone. Richard Jenkins puts a performance as Deputy Sheriff together that is not only funny, but lovable, innocent and honest. The banter between the above mentioned parties was spot on and their connection together as actors was simply stellar.What you'll find is a true Western movie that has some very graphic and well done scenes in the first two thirds of the movie. What happens at the final third is disturbing and brilliant horror. Like Dusk til Dawn the movie switches speed at the end with surprises you may not be prepared for. Unlike Dusk Til Dawn, you wont find the quips in humor to lighten up the mood, keeping a serious and brutal tone.I refuse to give away one death scene to anyone who has yet to see the movie. All I can say is it's unlike anything you'll see and it leaves you speechless!An amazing and strange movie made possible by fantastic acting, chemistry, and shock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wasn't sure what I was getting into when I decided to check this movie out. I was just in the mood for a good western, which is the reason I wanted to check this movie out. So yeah, this is a part western and a part graphic horror movie. I heard that it's a pretty brutal and violent flick. Although I have seen worst, this is a pretty brutal movie, especially near the end. This film combines pretty decent western style elements, especially because of the characterization of the characters and their dynamic approach to situations. I thought all the actors did a fairly decent job with this, it isn't anything all that new when it comes to western characters. But they brought there own character into this, which includes a dutiful and collective Sheriff played by Kurt Russell. His sidekick, a wannabe gentleman played by Matthew Fox and a dutiful husband cowboy played by Patrick Wilson. The plot is a western rescue mission, that deals with looters, bandits and the most savage and psychotic Indian tribe that are of a special breed. Overall, I thought it was a okay flick that is watchable if your in the mood for a western horror.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made very Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie an hour ago and still feel uneasy. The movie starts with a violent scene of a man's throat graphically being cut. You almost feel the force put on the knife. Very nu-necessary. Then the movie pace and posture changes and about hour and 20 minutes is rather slow, very slow. However the acting and dialogue, is good, and unlike Hollywood movies the characters are realistic and likable, (except for one, i get to that later). Then action starts and the movie changes its pace and character, dramatically. There are hands chopped. A man scalped and cut in half, all clearly and savagely shown in detail on the screen. I have seen my share of gore but this did bother me. If the director had refrained from such blatant graphic violence on the screen and just implied, this movie would be much better.As usual the female character in this movie is depicted as humorless, feeling less, rude, and two dimensional personality. God forbid if females show any signs of emotion in movies. The movie is about rescuing her. And when the rescue party meets her after they have been through hell for her, what do they get? Insults. No gratefulness, no thank you! I don't know why Hollywood shows females like this. Very unrealistic and unlikable. I give this movie 3 out of 10. if the violence was not there I would give it 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was that? Not a western, a drama, a comedy or even real SciFi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a western, Bone Tomahawk couldn't decide whether it was a drama or comedy but eventually got around to what it wanted to be, a cheesy horror movie. I tried to get past the lack or development and the implausibility of the story line. Even after the movie was over, it left me scratching my head. Dialogue was extremely slow, the characters were flat, foley over-rode everything and at points the pounding horse hooves drowned out the background music. I know it wasn't meant to be an "authentic" western, but if I wanted a great fantasy western, I'd put in "Cowboys &amp; Aliens". At least that one knows what it wants to be! For those that want an off-beat western done well, check out Jarmusch's Dead Man. Depp, Farmer, Thorton and Iggy Pop performances shine. There's a well written plot, smart dialog and plenty of character development, all things lacking in Bone Tomahawk. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/?ref_=nv_sr_2</fullReview>

With the ridiculously high rating of 7.1 I'm sure it will trap more users - as it did me. For shame.

		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead.I am not sure why this movie was made. I could see the actors making a lot of effort to save it, but in places it was just too cheesy. By the end of the film, some of the cast started overacting, while others did the opposite. The characters are quite "cartoonish".The funniest moment is when Kurt Russel's character, with a flask sticking out of his rib, convinces everyone he can't come with them and is staying behind. The expression on the girl's face is priceless: "Oh, you are staying behind? With a bunch of excited cannibals? OK! Have fun! Thanks very much for doing it, mate!"The whole part where Kurt Russell, his deputy and the girl sit behind the wood bars, which they could have broken, waiting to be chopped in half and eaten is a failed rip-off of some other movies and books. The juxtaposition of the imminent and horrible death and the calm trivial conversations among the doomed characters did not work and did not have the desired effect. The whole part felt unnatural as if the director wasn't really sure where he was going with this. It felt more like a scene from a Charlie Chaplin's movie.The girl's husband crawling across the desert on his four and battling healthy ferocious cannibals is quite comical and unnatural too. The rest of the movie gives off the scent of some mild racist propaganda mixed with some slasher horror movie element to spice things up.I could not help but notice a cheeky smile on the girl's face as they were passing a bunch of grotesquely mutilated (synchronously pregnant) cannibal wives. This girl is the most fake character of them all.I would not call watching this movie a complete waste of time. It has its value as a bad example of cinematography. It also shows how good Kurt Russel really is - despite an absolutely dumb premise and horrible directing, he obviously did his best.</fullReview>

I mean, we get the idea, why go into the ugly details? Also, when the cannibals decided to eat the deputy, was it really necessary to show how they cut him? The scene is really really disturbing. I even looked away in the middle of it. Why show all this violence and disturbing scenes? Is it the trend now? I wish I have never seen this movie, it will be stuck in my head for a long time.

		<fullReview>Here's one. Bone Tomahawk is an adventure story, a horror story, a character-driven western, a dark comedy, a rescue story and an edge of the seat thriller all in one. Need more? Its a love story too. A very well-written script by S. Craig Zahler, who directed and a cast of superb actors headed by Kurt Russell who is the next most unsung Hollywood actor after acknowledgment of Jeff Bridges. Richard Jenkins, one of my favorite actors, gives the "stand-by deputy" role of Chicory such depth and truth that it stands as one of the best performances I've seen this year. Matthew Fox as an off-beat foppish gunfighter with a soul is charismatic. Patrick Wilson, who continues his career of interesting choices is rather heart-breaking as a man so in love with his wife, Lili Simmons, that he suffers mightily in his determination to rescue her. Ms. Simmons plays an unusual combination of a liberated woman and caustic commentator on the "stupidity" of the frontiersmen she lives around in the ironically titled town of 'Bright Hope'. David Arquette and Sid Haig channeling Slim Pickens set the stage at the beginning and from the first scene you know this is not 'My Darling Clementine'. Sure there is some gore of a type I've never quite seen before. Its minimal, but strong enough to unsettle anyone's nerves. As for the savages, well they're definitely savage and scary to boot. Not everyone's tincture of morphine and whiskey, but it's some journey. Fred Melamed serves homemade whiskey in The Learned Goat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. In an effort to be helpful to potential viewers, it's customary to provide a synopsis that allows for a quick determination on whether this "type" of movie will hold appeal. The problem is that this debut from writer/director (and novelist) S. Craig Zahler can be encapsulated with a simple: four local men from a small, dusty old West town head out on a rescue mission to face a tribe of cannibal cave-dwellers. Unfortunately, that analysis doesn't cover the originality and genre-twisting of this Western-Horror film featuring crisp and funny dialogue, plus some of the most extreme brutality ever witnessed on screen.A very deep and talented cast milks the script for every possible chuckle, moan, shock of pain, and queasy squirm. Kurt Russell stars as Franklin Hunt, the sheriff of the ironically named town Bright Hope. Though a long-time fan of Mr. Russell, I've often been critical of his career-limiting role choices, and here he proves yet again that he has always been capable of taking on a challenging lead and delivering a nuanced performance. He is joined in the rescue posse by his "back-up deputy" Chicory (Richard Jenkins), the abducted woman's injured husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), and a nattily attired gunman (Matthew Fox).The opening sequence featuring outlaws Purvis (David Arquette) and Buddy (horror vet Sid Haig doing his best Slim Pickins imitation) sets the stage for the brutal violence to come in the third act, as well as the film's crackling dialogue that's clearly influenced by The Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Elmore Leonard. There are also brief but memorable supporting roles from Kathryn Morris (as the Sheriff's wife), Michael Pare' (as a self-centered stable owner), James Tolkan (as an uninspired piano player), and Fred Melamed (as the barkeeper). Lili Simmons ("Banshee") has a key role as the abducted Samantha O'Dwyer.An odd blending of John Ford's The Searchers and Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, a substantial portion of the (long) run-time is dedicated to the slow trail ride/walk of the four men as they track the "troglodyte" tribe in hopes of rescuing the captured folks. The focus on these four men: the duty-bound Sheriff, the overly loyal deputy, the emotionally-driven husband, and the vengeful gunslinger, is an old West character study dressed up with some fancy oration. In fact, the excessively-perfect English sits in stark contrast to the other-worldly tribal wailings of the cave-dwellers who seem to have no real language at all.It's an unusual film that defies a simple synopsis, and certainly won't appeal to all movie goers. A viewer must enjoy the prolonged journey and the interaction between the distinctive personality types (Jenkins is a particular standout in a Walter Brennan-type role), and also have an affinity (or at least a constitution) for gruesome brutality. The film is only receiving a very limited theatrical release, but should find an audience via VOD.</fullReview>

When you think about it they have a 2hr period in which they have to bring you into there world and make you feel the way they do. This movie does that better than most high budget movies. By taking out the music you hear things that you normally wouldn't so you become focused on every sound (foot steps, cutting with a knife. Remember real life has no music and because of that your eyes become the main sensory organ so the movie burns into memory. And anyone who says there should have been screaming when the deputy meets his end then you have never been truly scared. You become silent or agessive and both were played perfectly in that scene.

		<shortDescription>Haunting, dark, brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some time back I saw film of an unfolding maritime disaster. A huge freighter loaded down with some mineral ore had miscalculated its approach to the pier and though it was only moving a few feet per minute its unimaginable momentum was sufficient to utterly destroy the pier and other infrastructure. It crept slowly forward, an irresistible force meeting the immovable shoreline. That image came back to me as I finished this film. It moves slowly, resolutely forward, quietly gathering momentum, until it plows to its conclusion in a dark, horrifyingly violent collision. It's a simple story. Members of a clan of primitives have taken a handful of frontier citizens and the lawman leads a ragged posse to go rescue them. Once they reach the camp of the primitives, as one would expect, there is much killing. But it is not a simple film. It is distinguished by its pace and its characters. It starts its journey in familiar territory, a small western town with a rough- hewn lawman (Kurt Russell). There is a killing, a stable boy is eviscerated, and a couple of townsfolk are abducted. The lawman and the townsfolk consider their options. To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, you go with the posse you've got, not the posse you wish you had. The lawman and three others set out to do what needs doing. Though, it is a long trip, the film uses this time to its quiet gain, slowly bringing the characters to life and also slowly grinding them down with its sun-scorched terrain and relentless bad luck. These characters are worth getting to know, but some may be tempted to whine from the back seat, "Are we there yet?" Trust me, we will get there in time. This is no simple character study, however. The marvelous characters draw you in to their lives and you'd be forgiven for feeling affection for them. The posse slogs inexorably forward. To count up the minutes, there is actually not a lot of violence, but what violence there is is brutal, horrible. It is not splashy Tarantino violence; it reminded me more of John Hillcoat's film, The Proposition. It is dark, gruesome, vividly real. It spills viscera. Bodies drop leadenly. There are no gymnastic escapes. When flesh is torn, you hear it. But what really sets it apart is that after the long trek to get there, you feel you have friends in the fight. The violence feels as close as the pounding in your own chest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have used a serious shave.If you aren't blinded by the promise of blood-thirsty troglodytes, you should have your first hint that it's a snooze-fest when you notice the 2.25 HOUR running time. What good cannibal flick plays longer than like 1:40? And at first, it seems like all the right elements are in place for a true successor to Ravenous (in the frontier-time mountain cannibal film genre, of course). Strong opening, too - you can practically smell the human flesh cooking already! But then the exposition takes like five times as long as it needs to, and we are almost an hour into the film by the time we are actually on the road to hunt down some troglodytes. And then it still takes forever, with lots of well- written but ultimately needless dialogue to fill the space.To be fair, the trogs are worth the wait. The gore-hounds will be happy to feast (their eyes) on the goings-on in the cannibal cave. And in general, the dialogue and the acting are consistently solid, even in scenes where nothing happens at all. It's also shot in the wild west, so it's hard to screw up the scenery.But the film is ultimately ruined by the pacing and the editing, which is too bad, because it shows great promise and has a fun concept. If it was 45 minutes shorter, it would be a definite winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is one of the truest genre mashups horror has seen since From Dusk Till Dawn. As with that movie, the first half of this film is completely and unapologetically not a horror film.It begins as a true, unironically classic Western. It opens with David Arquette (Scream 1-4, Ravenous) and Sid Haig (The Devil's Rejects) as a pair of violent thieves that stumble across a murderous native tribe. Arquette's character escapes and makes his way to the frontier town of Bright Hope. Once there, he is promptly wounded and imprisoned by the Sheriff (Kurt Russell).Overnight, the tribe hunts him and abducts him along with a deputy and the pretty doctor (Lili Simmons, Banshee, True Detective) that was tending him. The Sheriff responds by raising the few men willing to hunt down these Troglodytes, cave dwelling subhumans that even other Native Americans consider undeveloped and monstrous, and hunting them down. The first half is a Western adventure story as the Sheriff, his over-the-hill Deputy (Richard Jenkins, Let Me In), the woman's injured husband (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen), and a bigoted retired soldier (Matthew Fox, Lost) track the Trogs across uncharted territory.In the second half, the s--t hits the fan and our heroes learn just how brutally violent this tribe really is. It includes one sequence of murder that is as graphic and hard to watch as anything in any recent horror film I can think of.I'll also say that the effects are outstanding and the movie's production values, while small in scale, are generally impressive and way above what you would expect given the movie's well publicized micro-budget (1.8 million). With the exception of Lili Simmons, who is badly out of her depth, the cast is great and first time director S. Craig Zahn shoots his own material with careful composition out of the John Ford school of filmmaking.What I like so much about this movie is it really gives a sense of what would happen if regular people just stumbled into a horror movie. The Sheriff and his posse are prepared for a gunfight, not to have to deal with a level of savagery right out The Hills Have Eyes. The movie is a little slow in the first half, as is the case with most westerns, but the payoff is worth it. Horror and Western fans should consider this movie a must. Film fans in general should at least give it a shot, as I would honestly say this is one of the best I've seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced, poorly written western with a few interesting idea never fully developed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Zahler must be very beloved person. How he was able to get a bunch of good actors Kurt Russel, Mathew Fox, Richard Jenkins,Patrick Wilson, Lili Wilson involved in this poorly written and directed movie and even get cameos of cameos from David Arquette, Sid Haig, Sean Young, Michael Pare and others; is perhaps almost as difficult to answer as the meaning of life. Do you think could it be for money ?. Well; I hope not; for the sake of some of those actors. There is no character development in the movie; unless you count on monologue by each actor talking about his demons. Only Jenkins is able to create a one; and unbearable non stop chatting old man that after you few minutes is missed when is not on screen. The rest is just part of the scenery.What Zahler was trying to achieve is beyond my understanding. Leone is not; there is little wide angle and backgrounds are poorly lightened. Neither Tarantino; dialog between characters is almost non-existent (aside for Jenkins who never stop talking). Ford; not even close; his techniques were far more advanced (and risky) than anything showing here. Perhaps a couple of hints from Deodato (on the gore part) but Cannibal Holocaust is not.A brief talk about the story. For reasons not clearly explained (perhaps planning a big barbecue); a bunch of Cannibal (antropophagy) natives attack a small Far West town kidnapping two men and a women and killing a an African American kid ("Indians do not eat Black people " explain one character; "are they poisonous ?" ask another character ).The sheriff; his very old deputy; the woman's husband and another guy that has nothing better to do but likes to kill indians; march for about five days (one hour in the movie that feels more or less the same) to rescue and take the opportunity to show their souls via monologues or some forced questions. Finally we get to expected confrontation which has a few moments is really disappointing.There is a few things somewhat unexpected; for example none of the four heroes seems to ever been in the dessert in a long trip. They say a lot of important things but facts shows their are really inept.A few gory scenes; one of them beyond what you usually see in this days; a killing and later chopping of one of the characters that will require a strong stomach to bear. If you are into that; that scene will not disappoint. The previous 105 minutes will, but you can take a nap; as I said almost nobody talks too much here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The acting was good, but the story just dragged on and on.. Then toward the end the scalping scene was totally unnecessary for the boredom you have to sit through. You watch these guys struggle throughout the desert the whole time. There was killing but its pretty traditional focus the camera away to suggest there was something violent going on. There was no other type of violence like that in this movie and they go right to this one unrelated and unmatched scene. Then they drag the movie on for another 15 minutes with a pretty crappy ending. I never write reviews and signed up just to show my shocking disapproval for this. Its really a waste of time. Just don't see what they were trying to accomplish. If you want to be gory and horrific, you should do it throughout the movie. Only reason I gave it a three was because I liked the actors.</fullReview>

Its actually so bad, it's funny for most of it's length. Not really horror, just gratuitous gore for gore's sake. Great premise spoiled by gender politics. Maybe the director secretly wants all men to apologize for having a penis. Not even Kurt Russell's talent can save this one. In the end though, I hope the director hones his skills and keeps trying, we need more movies that push the boundaries of traditional genres. Just with a better script.Spoiler alert...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death coming from nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although no evidence that American Indians in the lower 48 has ever been involved with cannibalism has ever been offered that didn't stop the making of this horror/western. Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell a little older and grayer than he was when he was starring as Wyatt Earp in Tombstone brought a little of that character to this role of a small town sheriff who leads a rescue posse for Lili Simmons who's been abducted by a tribe of cannibal Indians who dwell in the rock caves of the American Southwest.Maybe back in the days they could have been considered a tribe, but they seem to have been reduced to a cult of some kind. There also doesn't seem to be any women among these Indians so I'm sure that Simmons was not abducted to be a main course. They are a frightening bunch painted white as they are with death from their arrows and knives coming out of nowhere.I'm still at a loss why Kurt Russell didn't send for the cavalry as this was their thing, but instead takes Patrick Wilson who is Lili's husband, his deputy Richard Jenkins, and Matthew Fox a most civilized sort of gentleman who gets some peculiar jollies. Wounded and decimated as they are and drugged with a peculiar anesthetic that allows the Indians to snack on live victims the guys give it their best shot.Bone Tomahawk seems to have acquired a cult status judging by the other commentary here. It's certainly not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disappointing. Its biggest flaw is that it's incredibly lethargic - this is a fairly straightforward Western and there's absolutely no reason that it lasted two and a quarter hours. Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox and Patrick Wilson are tracking a tribe of cannibalistic, troglodyte Indians who have kidnapped Wilson's wife and a couple of others from a small Western town. Russell is best in show by far. Between this and The Hateful Eight, Westerns really seem to be in his wheelhouse, particularly if he grows some impressive facial hair. The other three stars are mostly weak (Lili Simmons, who plays the wife, is decent). The other great part of the film are the monstrous troglodytes, who are legitimately freaky. The dialogue is often bad and the direction is often poor. The whole climax lands with a thud, and it ends abruptly. Despite its flaws, I thought it had some worth and I certainly don't regret watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances by the cast were good considering the weakness of the script. It seems Kurt Russell has found his niche in these westerns. His character in this film was similar to his role in "Tombstone" and his more recent performance is Quinten Tarentino's film "Hateful Eight".I found Mathew Foxes performance as Brooder to be done well, but the costuming was inconsistent; a debonair Indian fighter?Richard Jenkins character of Chicory was well done and in some ways provided comic relief.And although Lili Simons character was the catalyst for the main storyline, I felt that she was almost a through away character because the story didn't explain why she came into the story. Maybe she was the token woman for the film? The problem with this movie is the story. It dragged at times and did little to develop the characters or tie ends together. It seems that it traded in script for unnecessary gore although the basic storyline had a lot of potential.</fullReview>

This tribe kill people after fighting yet leave the bodies to either rot or get eaten by wild life but kill there captives after struggling to get them into the cave, This tribe live in a small cave in the side of a mountain which can only be accessed by a couple of ropes ? This tribe we are again to believe can do throat surgery and implant some sought of device into each others necks to make them sound more vocal ? We are also expected to believe that they have stayed hidden for hundreds of years yet the tribe only has a few members ?, Next we are expected to believe that the lead characters can be injured yet seem to show no pain even though one has a whiskey hipflask which has been made white hot inserted into his body BUT he only makes a whimper? It makes me wonder If the directors, producers and editors ever sit back and actually watch these films with logical eyes before releasing them to the viewing public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone should have used a tomahawk to chop an hour off this film, it's that long. Somehow without any of its citizens realizing it, a group of subhumans breezes into a small town and kidnaps three people, all without making a sound. One wonders what the subhumans have been eating all this time, since they've never been a problem with the town before, but this is never explained. After the initial ruckus, the film devolves into a lethargic, plodding character study as the rescuers head into the wilderness to retrieve the victims. What follows is an hour of bickering in the desert, exactly like a bunch of catty homosexuals on holiday, punctuated by Patrick Wilson's bad acting.Despite the stultifying character development, there is one bright spot: the opening scene with Sid Haig and David Arquette is delightful in its ghastly simplicity; these two characters should get their own film.The film's apparently limited budget shows in the unrealistic-looking walls of the cave, as well as the fire pit, which looks like a prop from a stage play. I couldn't figure out how the hobbled man climbed the side of the mountain or how he instinctively knew about the whistle-bone in the Indian's throat. More than that, a film has to mean something or convey a message, and the message here is concealed under layers and layers of meaningless character development. The ending hints at what should be an equally tiresome sequel. I can tell from the witty dialogue that this must have been an entertaining book, but some books don't translate very well to film. I used to believe that people in general were hard to please, but some reviews labeling this film a "masterpiece" have certainly proved me wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think IMDb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to reviews. Lately though I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just not seeing good things in movies that others are or if its just coincidence. Either way I didn't agree with most on this film. It was decent, not horrible but just decent in my opinion. The movie felt a bit low budget but that's not were the criticism is. The acting was good, I wasn't really blown away by anyone's performance but the names involved certainly gave it some credit going in. They all did adequate jobs in this film, and to be fair there wasn't a whole lot to work with necessarily so that wasn't the issue either. I just thought this film lacked inspiration. People keep saying it's fresh and revolutionary or something along those lines but I gotta say I just don't see it. This movie had a few decent parts, a few brutal parts and that's essentially it. It was basically the Hills Have Eyes with cannibal Indians in the place of cannibal mutants. Bigger named actors and less action on a rehashed idea doesn't make a good film in my opinion. That's my thoughts anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely odd film... An excellent premise that, sadly, was criminally wasted... Blu-ray: Good A:8 V:8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this, not least because I REALLY like Kurt Russell, and he is NOT in very many films these days (BTW, I frigg'n loved 'THE ART OF THE STEAL'!)Believe me, I don't mind 'Slow', I don't mind 'Weird', I don't mind ambiguous, BUT... this film was just SO oddly paced and shot that I suppose that it just wasn't really what I expected or what I was hoping for. I really DID like the premise very much because it sounded like it was going to be a nice blend of Western and Horror which I really like. Even some of the REALLY Cheeeeezy films in that Genre, like Full Moon's 'OBLIVION' or 'GHOST TOWN' can be lots of fun. But, somehow I guess I was expecting more 'Style' or something. I truly didn't mind the 'Slow Burn' aspect at all, but to me anyway there just didn't seem to be much of an effort at ANY true mood or style what so ever. It's like everything that happened was just done in a matter-of-fact way in a steady, plodding style. In my lowly and wretched opinion, for most films to be entertaining or involving at all, regardless of Genre, it bloody HAS to have some frigg'n MOOD to it. And, this film ESPECIALLY if you are blending a Western with the genuinely weird potential Horror aspects of this creepy 'Lost primitive tribe' thing. I mean, GEEZ people! If this isn't absolutely ***THE*** perfect premise and setting to create a visceral, creepy mood through some bloody STYLE for God's sake, I sure don't know what is... But no... everything just plods along with this bland 'Sameness', that with the exception of some scattered sudden, brutal violence, there was absolutely NO variance in mood or pacing or tension. Nothing... I mean, yeah, there was SOME suspense as to whether these 'Things' would find and kill them, but not much else.I will admit that the odd touches of humour seemingly thrown in randomly throughout the film DID work to some degree. I liked that. But quite honestly, that and the rather creative premise were just about the ONLY things really going for this movie. I mean, everyone acted fine I guess; it's not like the director didn't bring out decent performances (which MANY times is the case) but, it's just that to me personally, he did absolutely NOTHING with it. Again, in my opinion, if he had taken the exact same premise and the exact same setting and just given the film some bloody STYLE... now THAT would have probably made it a GREAT film, if he had TRULY utilized the full potential of the good idea he had to work with. Actually, he did indeed throw in just two VERY brief things that I thought were great! And this is precisely what I am talking about that the film desperately needed more of. I won't give anything away, but there is a VERY neat touch that has to do with how this tribe communicates. The other really creepy and imaginative thing had to do with their women. These two touches were indeed frigg'n BRILLIANT! But, we are talking about a total of like maybe 2 minutes. Damn! The dude should have created a whole mesmerizing mythology for these people instead of spending 3/4 of the damn movie sitting around talking about bloody nothing!To me it adds up to what seems like a genuinely excellent premise, very good actors, a great idea, and then, BOOM... totally wasting the opportunity...THAT, my friends, is what I feel where the real crime is here...</fullReview>

It seems that whoever did this just took a bunch of ideas, threw them in a blender and simply made a story. While the acting is for the most, decent, the story itself and the entire idea of cannibalistic troglodytes (did someone see Cannibal Feroux too many times?) living in the west is at best silly, at worst stupid. Adding to the misery of sitting through this, much of it was filmed in the dark! How I sat through this without turning it off is beyond me.

		<fullReview>Kurt Russell is the man, you could place him in any role and he'd be awesome. But what the in the world did I just watch? This was just weird. People have been boasting a gritty horror western but all I saw was cheesy and not to mention gross. There was no suspense, they tried but it was very predictable. Characters were great; there was a nice diversity between them all and I think the actors were perfect for their parts. My biggest confusion though, is the purpose of this film. There was no story here at all, no moral at the end or thought provoking moment. An event does not count as a story; you need to go a little deeper. These villains were seriously large cavemen that ate people. When a character died I never felt bad for them, I felt bad for myself once because I watched someone get cut in half like a hog in a butcher shop. Being gross doesn't count as horror. Everyone can have a dark mind and come up with horrible deaths; the question is if you can make the audience clinch the arms of their chairs in suspense and them scared. The cinematography was okay, nothing crazy but certainly not bad. The town and terrain were very cool and believable. I just don't understand why they made this film. I felt like I went to a fancy restaurant and all they served was grilled cheese.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can,t see what all the fuss is about this movie. Yeah a western that really isn't a western, And is applauded by other reviewers because it has a bit of horror in it. Cave dwelling cannibal Indians, is a pretty stupid idea, as far as I'm concerned. Better if this theme was set in Middle Ages Europe rather than the Wild West. So these cannibal Indians sneak into a town, kill an unsuspecting negro stable hand And abduct a prisoner, deputy and female doctor treating the prisoner, And a bit like true grit, the sheriff, other deputy, husband and an Indian hater go out after them, not knowing how many they will find,, What makes it really absurd, is the husband has a broken leg, that gets worse every day, because he doesn't rest it as he should. So 2/3 of the movie is about the journey and the last 1/3 is the confrontation, with the usual predictable ending. There are some graphic scenes of a man being scalped and cut in two by the cannibals, but the abducted wife's role and character is pathetically written and acted, especially as she's already witnessed this happening to the prisoner. And true to Hollywood style a gratuitous sex scene early on in the movie. Overall a ridiculous setting for an interesting idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The slow pacing of this movie is unbearable. You'd have more fun just closing your eyes and taking a nap to dream about three-titted supermodels or something.Let me now talk about the musical score for the movie. It's almost non-existent. Some scenes are so boringly silent you may as well eat some spicy food and fart as loudly as you can to liven up the atmosphere in this movie while you watch it.Sure, there are films that intentionally have slow build-ups after an exciting opening, e.g. Nolan movies, The Hateful Eight, etc... but this was excruciating.Almost every single scene in the movie lingers on for about 2-3 seconds too long. You'd think it was edited by some first-year film school students. Those extra seconds in every scene add up. If you got rid of those unnecessary seconds, you could easily chop off 10-15 minutes off the running time.I know this movie is low-budget, but couldn't they afford some more extras and better sets? I wonder how much Sean Young got paid for the one minute that she's in this? Whatever it was, it was a waste of money.The only redeeming aspects of this was some of the dialogue: "Say goodbye to my wife. I'll say hello to yours." - That was the best line in the movie. Simple and moving.The other great part is the gore. It's graphic and gruesome. I've seen a lot of messed up stuff in my life but the gore in this was very surprising.I still don't understand why so many critics were so kind to this movie. It's actually baffling.</fullReview>

What i like about this film is that the story is given time to breed not rushed and you get into the characters although i would have like to see Matthew's fox's characters fleshed out a bit more. I'd say 90% of this movie is a western and 10% horror, the scenes of which (particulary one) are gruesome but not long drawn out scenes that you see in some movies just for shock value. this is 9 out of ten for me well worth at watch using a good old style western with a little twist</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent,Thrilling And Intense Western-Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is an excellent,thrilling and intense Western-Horror film that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a great script and a fine score. All of those elements make Bone Tomahawk a solid movie that is genre film making at it's best.Set in the 1800s,Bone Tomahawk tells the story of four men,Sheriff Franklin Hunt(Kurt Russell),Arthur O'Dwyer(Patrick Wilson),John Brooder(Matthew Fox)and Chicory(Richard Jenkins)who are trying to tracking down people who were kidnapped and held captive by a group of Cannibal cave dwellers. Now,the four men are on a quest to get the kidnapped persons back at all costs on a journey none of them will forget.Bone Tomahawk is a terrific and memorable film that combines two genres that I love in the Western and Horror genres giving us the best of both worlds in a creative way that is fresh and thrilling. The movie also sees one of my all-time favorite actors the amazing and talented Kurt Russell in his first Western movie since the classic Tombstone in 1993 and it is a outstanding return to the Western genre. And while Bone Tomahawk has a style that won't appeal to everyone the movie it has enough gripping power that will keep audiences entertained and seems like a movie that will have Cult status. What writer-director S. Craig Zahler has done in his directorial debut is taking the genres the Western and Horror film and given Bone Tomahawk a novel approach that is very interesting,different and will keep audiences glued to the screen. With Bone Tomahawk we are taken on a journey through the Wild Wild West with Action,Adventure and style that is almost like a re-working of the brilliant John Wayne-John Ford Western classic The Searchers(1956)but is more violent and brutal as well as very intense and powerful never letting go of viewers from beginning to end. One of the main reasons that Bone Tomahawk is so great is that it's like two movies in one with the first 90 minutes being a slow build but compelling character driven story with getting us to know the four main characters whether it's the tough Sheriff Franklin Hunt,the injured but determined Arthur O'Dwyer,the charming and dandy John Brooder and the old but dependable Deputy Sheriff Chicory. All four of the main characters all have different personalities and are at each others throats most of the time but they are likable and have that one common goal of rescuing people who were kidnapped. When they go on their journey we as the viewer we are with each of them on their journey and relate to them well. The screenplay by S. Craig Zahler is fantastic,with Zahler giving the four main characters incredible dialog and some humorous moments that are funny,subtle and add to the film. While not Action packed the movie has a few good Western movie shootouts that are short but effective. I also like the photography by Benji Bakshi which makes the Western landscape look beautiful and visual stunning whether it's during the day or at night. So while the first half is character and dialog driven you will not be bored. It's the second half of the movie where the genre switches from Western to Horror and when the Horror aspect comes in the last 30-40 minutes of the film and it is dark,gruesome and vicious with scenes of blood and gore that is not for the weak at heart with one scene featuring one of the most brutal and cringe inducing kills I have ever seen on film and when you see it you will never forget it. I think it's because of the tone and genre of the first half that will make the switch more powerful and gripping. The ending of Bone Tomahawk is outstanding with Action and thrills and that will leave you excited and with a bittersweet feeling. A wonderful ending.The cast is great. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Franklin Hunt,with Russell being tough and gritty. Patrick Wilson is terrific as Arthur O'Dwyer,an injured man. Matthew Fox is wonderful as John Brooder,a charismatic gunman. Richard Jenkins is fantastic as always as Chicory,the deputy sheriff. Lili Simmons is great and beautiful as Samantha O'Dwyer,Arthur's wife. Also,lookout for cameo appearances by David Arquette(Purvis),Sid Haig(Buddy),Kathryn Morris(Lorna Hunt)and Sean Young(Mrs. Porter)who give good performances as well.The direction by S. Craig Zahler is amazing,with Zahler always keeping the camera moving with a stylish and stunning look while keeping the film moving at a nice pace. Great direction,Zahler.The score by Jeff Herriott and S. Craig Zahler is impressive and effective and matches the tone of the film. Nice score,Herriott and Zahler.In final word,if you love Westerns and Horror films,I highly suggest you see Bone Tomahawk,an excellent,thrilling and intense Western-Horror film that you wont soon forget.

		<fullReview>I cannot for the life of me understand the high ratings for this movie. In general I am quite satisfied with the reviews that I see on IMDb so we figured how could we go wrong with a movie rated in the high 70's and high 80's. My wife and I have a very low bar for movies. We thoroughly enjoy some really crazy B movies (think Rene Perez) but this movie was awful. When it was done, we looked at each other and said "C-". Except for the occasional funny lines by the assistant deputy, the acting, including that of Kurt Russell, was terrible. The story was terrible. All day I have been thinking that these reviews are a prank or we watched different movies. I suppose to be fair, the cinematography was good. I guess I can recommend that you watch the movie so you can experience it's atrociousness. It is my belief that at the end your jaw will be dragging on the ground in disbelief. In the meantime, I will continue to ponder the high ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST MOVIE EVER!!! Possible spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read reviews of this it sounded like a movie I would love ! I don't know what's wrong with all the people that rated this movie so high. It was the most boring waste of two hours I have ever spent! It was an agonizing hour and a half at least of them trudging across the plains looking for the kidnapped victims. It was only at the end it got exciting and it was just pure grotesque savagery for no reason whatsoever. There wasn't even any good kick butt revenge!! Just grotesque violence. I love a good western and I love a good horror movie but this was neither. Blood and guts don't bother me but this was way over-the-top and completely unnecessary. I feel dirty and unsatisfied and icky!! No real plot.... Just savage violence!</fullReview>

Kurt Russell Got Nominated for this movie not Tombstone ? Tombstone never get's a Award or Nominated got high rates as well oh well for this movie it's good and half way very good but eh all film i don't want to spoil all of it story line follows that (Kurt Russell)Sheriff Franklin Hunt is going to find Arthur O'Dwyer wife (Patrick Wilson) Arthur O'Dwyer wife got missing midnight, (Matthew Fox)John Brooder, (Richard Jenkins) Chicory were on group finding wife (Lili Simmons) Samantha O'Dwyer Arthur wife with his right leg injury can't walk fast four men were on mission, found out cannibal eating savages in men cave. cast is great Kurt Russell in my opinion gives good performance but not best so as Matthew fox same goes with Patrick Wilson is good not fan of Wilson. he had good performance in this movie but i think he is comfortable great in conjuring, Matthew Fox is good sometime he looks bored not fan but only thing is good is Kurt Russell fanthe story is well smart written very short idea for S.

I got up and left the room, thank goodness my 16 year old also had the sense to leave. It's not enough to see real people be butchered on the news. So someone thought "hey, let's make a movie where we make it look like real people are butchered in the most horrific way possible!!" My husband likes to watch horror films but even this was way over the top for him. Agreeing with other reviews that this movie was sickening and almost pornographic. Why decent actor keep acting in filthy movies like this is beyond me.(but the again I'm not an actor, so who can say.)Remember Michael Rockefeller??? He was a real man butchered by the tribes in Papua New Guinea, his body desecrated , and consumed . It was vile , like the persons that created this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English is not my first language, so you might find the way I express myself a bit plain.I had high expectations when I went to see this movie and left the theater very disappointed. I expected a gritty, atmospheric, dark Western like "True Grit". The movie had a promising start and also the cast seemed promising. The last third of this flick is so ridiculous, though, that it reminded me more of a B horror movie than a Western.The "cave dwellers" are depicted so unrealistically and over the top that I was sorry I had to sit through 1,5 hours to arrive at this ridiculous scenario.If you'd like to watch a Western with a great, dark, gritty atmosphere with bad-ass characters, suspense and a rewarding ending, avoid this movie and re-watch "True Grit" (the new version).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bone Tomahawk 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With little marketing towards this odd niche movie, a low-budget throwaway was all but really expected. However, the film Bone Tomahawk was stylish, fresh and had great character development, something along the lines of a Quentin Tarantino cult hit. S Craig Zahler wrote and directed this film though, striking gold on his first piece of work in the industry. Even with his debut film, it's easy to see the script was fantastic by the number of prevalent actors committing to this hard film to sell. There wasn't a single bad performance by the cast, which includes the likes of Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox and David Arquette. All the actors displayed their character perfect, having extremely defined characteristics and their own personality.Bone Tomahawk will never get the credit it deserves since it's difficult to find a sizable audience into a western horror flick. That's a shame because the film is incredibly tactful and tense with all the pieces needed to be great. Some may say the run-time is too long or the watch was a slow-burn, that's arguably true, but definitely shouldn't be a deal breaker on a review. The only complaint is a questionable ending, which could have been tied up better. Other than that, it really felt like the viewers were in the time period and a part of the savagery provided by Bone Tomahawk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not much of a western movie fan and I'm very particular about what horror movies I'll watch. I do not care for violence just for the sake of gore. The blending of western with horror kind of put me off. I will however watch anything with Kurt Russell so after reading a review here about this movie, I gave it a try.I enjoyed this movie very much. The pace might seem slow to some but I found it perfect. There is violence and a few scenes are quite gross but they are appropriate for the story being told and I didn't have to cover my face. Since I don't watch many horror movies, I can't comment on how unique the scenes in this movie are but they seemed much different to me than the typical slasher type stuff I have gotten stuck watching a few times.Kurt Russell, as always, is a pure pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurt Russell stars in a wild WILD Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the poster of the movie, I was thinking it was going to be a slow western. Most of it is.But what a cool story! Kurt Russell is a sheriff who gathers a posse to rescue three citizens from a tribe of savage cannibals! And I do mean savage. The horror elements in the film had me worming in my seat. They were not playing around with the concept of wild frontier in this film. Some of it was really, really hard to watch(which is so cool!)A lot of the movie is very slow, but luckily, Russell accompanied with Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox played characters that were really fun and interesting on the screen.Fun being a key word, as the film goes from gritty to grim to humorous, and it blends so well.Plus the gun play is really good, done to show effectiveness versus dramatics.This was truly a great western, worth becoming a classic in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Blend of Horror and Country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I was excited about this film when I saw the trailer on facebook about three weeks ago. I tempered my optimism by telling myself the mash-ups of genres often fall flat on their face when it comes to movies. So when it came it out I waited a day, didn't read any reviews but saw a quick clip of Gemmi Galactic interviewing Mathew Fox and I thought I better just buckle down and watch the movie already. I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.This film is the perfect blend of country and horror, it does both well. If you are into a tense thriller that ends with a ton of action this movie is for you. It's long for a horror flick almost two full hours, but I never felt restless. The script moved you seamless through the story and the acting was spot on. The Indian cannibals was a really interesting twist and something I enjoyed immensely. The action had the perfect amount of gore, not the over the top kind where blood shots all over the place. The lack of over the top theatrics added a sense of realism to the entire film. It felt as if you were watching something that could have actually taken place. Without the presence of a real supernatural threat this movie did more than hold it's own.Cabalism movies are something that don't catch my interest too often, normally the entire flick rests on the writer trying to use the taboo to make you sick. Often with the director or special effects crews trying to constantly show you people eating other people and pushing you into the boundary between being scared and wanting to turn it off because it isn't scary but is just flat out revolting. You won't find that in Bone Tomahawk, the story and the acting carry the movie, and the brutal violence adds to the realism of the times and the situation they find themselves in.If you are looking for something to watch during this Halloween season you should check this movie out. I would give the movie five out of five stars, or a nine out of ten. It was that good. I think you won't be disappointed with the cost of a rental or the purchase of this movie. Seriously set some time aside and check it out. You will find as a horror fan you recognize more actors than you would have thought for a straight to video movie. I hope we see more of this trend in the future I personally detest the theater and love watching movies in the comfy surroundings of my home.As a side note you know it is good when my wife hides her eyes more than once. I call it the eye test LoL. Next cannibal movie on the list The Green Inferno, let's hope it comes out on video soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will linger in your mind long after you have seen this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never posted a movie review online. At 49 years old, that should really tell you something about Bone Tomahawk. I saw the movie about 4 days ago and I am still thinking about it. Having read multiple other reviews about this movie both professional and viewer, I am not sure any one in particular has really nailed what it is about this movie that makes it so fascinating. There have been lots of reviews claiming it is a Western Horror movie, something like The Searchers meets the Hills Have Eyes. But I really think that does it an injustice. This was a straight up Western in my opinion. Yes, there are some extremely violent scenes, but that in and of itself does not make it horror.Bone Tomahawk is very simple in its story. Four rugged men, all substantially different characteristically, travel cross the western terrain to save a deputy and a wife/doctor who have been kidnapped by a barbaristic cannibal tribe. Their journey makes up three quarters of this movie. The dialogue between the men is exceptionally well written in that it almost seems to be too proper for its time, but it has the effect of drawing you in. With the subtle lack of background music or noise and rather drab cinematography, the viewer is somewhat forced to listen to the conversations between these men. As a result, it all feels very natural and was easy and interesting to watch.The last quarter of this movie is odd. Yes, it is brutally violent and the scene everyone has been talking about is almost unbearable to watch. Another reviewer commented that the image of that scene is burned in his brain and it is impossible to un-see it although like him, I have tried. When the cannibals first attack our travelers, it almost seems slapstick, with an odd looking arrow that knicks Richard Jenkins in the head and other cannibals jumping out from the bushes only to be shot in very clumsy ways. What makes the violence so unnerving is the reaction of our characters to it. When the young deputy in the cave is meeting his demise, he is carrying on a conversation with Kurt Russell. No one is screaming in fear and when the kill takes place, the natural instinct of the viewer (me) was OMFG!!!! But Kurt Russell and the other characters did not appear uncomfortable or surprised at all. With the lack of background music, the kill becomes all the more realistic. Later on, Patrick Wilson is graphically digging something out of one of the cannibals throats. We are not just given a brief glimpse of this, but a prolonged shot with no background noise other than the sound of fingers penetrating flesh and blood. Again, it is difficult to watch. But Patrick Wilson's character does not seem disgusted by it at all. It is just something he needs to do.Bone Tomahawk is in reality a pure Western. The violence is always there in Westerns, just not as graphic. Scalping has been talked about in many a western before this, just not shown as graphically as it is here. After reflecting on the movie, I am certain that the laid back nature of the dialogue and lack of emotional outbursts by any of the characters, made the movie that much more impactful. Lots of movies can make you cry or laugh or scream. Bone Tomahawk will do much more; it will make you remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark, brutally unflinching western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a film that takes your expectations, stabs them in the face and hacks out its own uniquely paced narrative that ducks clichés, clings to authentic realism and knows how to both get you invested in character, and put your hairs on end when these people you've come to love get put through unimaginable horrors in the third act. When a movie with a running time of two hours and fifteen minutes has me wishing it was longer, it's gotta be doing something right. This one does pretty much everything right. Starting with the script as it's the first thing you notice, there's a faithful dedication to the actual old west vernacular on display, resulting in shakespearian exchanges that call to mind David Milch's iconic Deadwood. Then there's the writing itself; characters interact about mundane things and gradually through idle talk and restless banter we grow attached to these wildly different people. Then there's the frank brutality of the harrowing third act, much anticipated, and as a result of the film taking its time getting there, we get all the more horrified when the bloodshed hits us in measured, stark quality. Kurt Russell can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, and he makes a stout hearted protagonist here as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, his rule of law abiding in a small southern community. When local girl Mrs. O Dwyer (Lilli Simmons) and several others are kidnapped by a clan of cannibalistic cave dwelling troglodytes, Hunt forms a four man posse to set out into the wild and rescue them. Along with him is Mr. O Dwyer, played by Patrick Wilson, another actor who doesn't ever miss a beat for me, making fascinating work of an awkward role. Richard Jenkins, always stellar, plays childlike Deputy Chicory, an amiable, talkative dude with a kind disposition that shines forth even in the most hopeless of situations. Matthew Fox surprised me by shedding his clean cut nice guy image for a clean cut badass image, as dapper, no nonsense pistol packer John Brooder, sporting a fancy suit and a lack of moral high ground. David Arquette and horror vet Sid Haig play lowlife bandits, and there's a juicy supporting cast including Michael Paré, Sean Young, Kathryn Morris, Eddie Spears and Fred Melamed. What floored me and made the film stuck in my mind so much is the sheer lack of phoning it in or cutting corners by anyone involved. When I heard about this project I was stoked, but had worries that it would get mired in genre convention and cheap schlocky thrills. Boy was I wrong. The cave dwelling natives are absolutely terrifying, chalky white brutes that come stomping around a corner to bury a crude bone made weapon in your skull before you even realize they're there. There's a particular scene, and you'll know what I'm talking about, that's just about as disturbing as horror gets, in it's unflinching refusal to do anything by the book or show anything offscreen. When I hear 'horror western' I get a certain picture in my head, a heightened sense of style, jump scares, etc. But this one subverts that expected route and in forging it's own special aesthetic, becomes all the more horrifying and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, given 2 stars only for some of the dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very unpleasant film and I would not recommend it to anyone. From the sordid opening of watching two murderous bushwhackers at work the film hardly improves and some of it frankly ridiculous. The supposedly smart sheriff allows a badly injured husband to accompany a rescue mission that is destined to last at least 4 days on horseback ?never going to happen. Then there is the question of how the troglodytes got to the town and back with three captives as they seem to lack horses ? daft. Of course you then have to have some unidentified Mexican baddies to steal the rescuers horses forcing the crippled husband to hobble for miles ? unbelievable ? and surprise, surprise he lags behind but still heroically presses on despite aggravating his injury more than once ? even more unbelievable. The three leading rescuers get to the troglodyte hideout and promptly get attacked and one is killed and the other two caught and hauled up to their cave. Oh, I forgot to mention that the troglodytes cannot talk only make a completely weird call which of course they do repeatedly to alert all and sundry to their presence. The two remaining rescuers find that the gimp's wife and other deputy are still alive (after what 5/6 days) and of course their presence brings about the near instant and horrible butchery of the other deputy. But at last the cavalry arrives as gimpy the husband finally gets to the cave area. He manages to kill two troglodytes and immediately realises that they have something in their throats so he cuts this device out of one of the troglodytes and uses it to make those weird calls so more troglodytes come running towards him so he can shoot them. The last and final idiocy has gimpy arriving in the cave crawling having climbed up to the cave (which, by the way looked pretty inaccessible) unseen and unheard and effects a rescue. Utter tosh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its fantastic to see Kurt Russell back on the silver screen. Russell has a well weathered charm and personal presence that fits beautifully into Bone Tomahawk, a survivalist horror, in a Western setting. Indeed, the full cast of Bone Tomahawk hand in above average performances, that make this film work. This is in spite of the films rather constrained storyline which see's most of the horror aspects, squeezed into the last quarter of the film. This is a shame too, as there is, on balance, so much to like about this film. Looking beyond the quality acting, the sets are good, the premise sound and the horror elements quite shocking. Its worth noting, for some people, the last of these, the horror elements, may also be a negative. Some of the horror scenes are graphic and at times, rather cruel. For myself I liked this film but did feel a little let down by the storyline and, yes, I did feel the violence could have been taken down a notch or two, without reducing the films impact. That said, this film is by no means a slouch and is worth your attention if you like horror films that are a little different. Seven out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique and Worth Seeing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is unique, not often do you see a movie labeled as a "western horror" and even less often is a horror movie actually of any value or scary. I like how this film takes an Alfred Hitchcock approach to its horror, IE: very little music, a lot of silent moments, and an ever growing sense of dread throughout. Its scares, while sudden are never jump scares. For example one moment our characters could be walking around and the next an arrow flies out with the attackers soon to follow. Now one can consider this picture a "gross-out film" now I've seen some people really exaggerate the amount of gore in this, don't listen to them they are lying. The violence in this film is very far and between but when it is present it is graphic. But I would call this film more brutal than it is gory. I also like how this film gets us to like its characters. I'm not saying you'll flip your s**t if someone dies but you will root for them significantly. This is a movie that relies on suspense as well so expecting some form of action or scare every other second is not going to get you anywhere, this film uses build up to its advantage so keep that in mind. If your faint of heart then give this a pass but if you like some gore mixed with your cowboys then you've come to the right place. Its freakier beyond all h**l and will make you jump a few times.Bone Tomahawk isn't the greatest western ever made and isn't the greatest horror movie ever made, but it takes advantage of what it has and gives you a satisfying result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Russell, Fox and Jenkins give realistic, believable portrayals in their roles. Facing danger and death with the stoicism and dry wit historically attributed to many European settlers, as well as the historic though understated bigotry towards any non-whites one character voiced. Russell was on-point, his expressions and reactions excellent as Sheriff Hunt, and his "back-up" deputy Chicory played by Richard Jenkins and he had personal dynamics that really made the film.Deaths were very, very graphic both visually and audibly in a stark brutally simplistic way. There is nothing of comedic horror in this film, of absurdity or "bloodshed for fun". The setting, the "reality" of their situation were harsh and horrific in the exact sense of that word, and though tagged as "horror" in genre, it's not one I would personally apply. While I didn't care for the typical "settler heroes" vs. "savages" theme, the comment by a Native American in the film, "Those are not MY people!" provided some relevant clarity and truth that all indigenous are not homogeneous, in past or present.The only irritating part I found was Lili Simmons' "Mrs. O'Dwyer": a naturally young, very beautiful and highly skilled doctor who has lived in the west with her husband but still has to ask, "Are those gunshots?" Along with the end song, after setting such a gritty, touching western of determined courage in the face the unknown, those two aspects lessened the film from a higher rating for me. For those not used to or cannot handle such graphic visuals, the story itself is compelling enough to close your eyes at those points, because you don't want to miss this unforgettable tale.</fullReview>

The film successfully joins the western and the horror genres into one. Kurt Russell provides a masterful portrayal of Sheriff Hunt, an in-charge Sheriff looking to rescue his deputy and other residents of the town. While Russell provides the audience with a great portrayal of Sheriff Hunt, Richard Jenkins portrayal of Chicory, was my favorite character. Chicory is a good natured backup Deputy that provides some of the best delivered lines. The storyline moves along at a good pace with enough tension and exciting moments to keep you watching and wishing for more. This film is definitely worth the time investment to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful combination of realistic western and horror cannibal movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just see yesterday night the movie at the Sitges Fantastic Film Festival of Catalunya, and I only can praise the insight of his director and writer. As a great fan of both, dirty &amp; twilight westerns of the seventies and horror splatter movies, I found very natural that combination, as we see a couple of times before. But I have to say that the fine drawing of characters, a little bit a la "Unforgiven", in combination with the slow but atmospheric and realistic pace of the timing, plus the brutal and gory explosion of final violence and crude action, works absolutely superbly, better than I expected. As personal variation on the classic cannibal Italian movies of the 80s, I think its a lot more honest and stylish than, by the way, Eli Roth's "The Green Inferno", and as twilight western with tragic and violent overtones, it remind me the best western ever made about the confrontation between white men and native Americans in the last Frontier times: Robert Aldrich's "Ulzana's Raid". If you like splatter survival from the 70s and 80s, and melancholic, demystifying, sad and violent westerns, if you read books like Jack Ketchum's "The Crossings" (wich is very much alike) and appreciate weird westerns as Mulligan's "The Stalking Moon", this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wife picked up this Movie from red box and wow what a mistake! Being Unrated was suspicious to say the least! Should have looked at reviews first before letting the family watch it, ended up turning it off and not finishing it. First of all the period correct attire was all wrong, The story-line was loosely put together and went on and on. The acting in this movie was mediocre no real talent. This showed up in the western category which was very misleading. If you expect this to be a typical western style movie it's not. I'm not going into the gruesome details of this crappy movie. It was a waste of time and money. DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH THIS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the reviews, but the last act made it worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film was 30 minutes too long and had some inexplicable - and pointless - plot developments. First 90 minutes was difficult to endure. But the last act - complete with that horrendously compelling execution/butchering, was superbly done.&nbsp;Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson were very good and the concept of the trogs - and their customs/self-mutilations - was top shelf. Sadly, the rest of the cast wavered between amateurish to downright annoying. Hack off 20-30 minutes of the filler, tidy up the combat scenes and have the girl in a state of raped when found, and this film approaches classic level. As it is, well I can't give it more than a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Most Over-hyped Horror Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, I am not a professional writer and no one pays me for reviews. Were I a professional writer there are certain things I would avoid avidly in my criticism, such as referring to myself in the review or referring to other reviews. I am not pretending to be a pro, so I have no problem with addressing these things. I am a huge horror fan and watch hundreds of independent horror films each year. I am a fan of westerns and have been since watching John Wayne movies with my dad during childhood. I have a fan of "arty" cinema and have a high tolerance for experimentation, slow burn films, and character development. Why is all of this important? Because I want to establish, early on, that I am not writing from the perspective of someone who came into this movie looking for TOMBSTONE meets THE CONJURING. I am an explorer of dark cinema and was looking for a great indie horror/ western mashup that so many reviews seems to prop up as the greatest horror film of the year. I left the movie, not so much disappointed, as underwhelmed.There isn't much plot exposition necessary. A thief on the run desecrates the burial ground of a group of pseudo-natives called Troglodytes. They chase him to a small, quiet town where they kidnap him, along with a pretty young nurse and a sheriff's deputy. The majority of this film constitutes four men on a rescue mission to save them. That "mission" is about 85% of the run time. This is most definitely not a movie about intros and climaxes, but about the journey to get there. That's where all of my issues with this movie lie. The movie runs about 2 hours and 15. I would guess that about 90 minutes of that run time is just the journey to get to their destination. I am not an impatient teenage horror noob. I do not expect constant action to keep my attention. In fact, if you go through my more than 100 reviews on this site I am usually a defender of the "slow burn", but there are certain things that I require. First is development and a well-defined introduction of character. The four main characters here are given a ton of space to breath in during this journey and this is, most definitely, an "actor's movie" where the actors get to inject full dimension into these characters. The problem is that we never get to know them in the first place. They could be anyone, anywhere. Kurt Russell was my main drawing point and ends up every generic sheriff in every western movie. Who is he? Why is he sheriff in this little town? We get a "gentleman" with no notion of what sort of business he run, only that he killed a lot of "indians". Why? How? Where? Nothing is ever developed enough. We spend so much time with these characters, but never really get to know them. The one exception is the Sheriff's backup deputy, who is a great character, with a the most backstory, but also probably the most cliché of the stock western characters here.Okay, so I've seen plenty of horror films that never develop character. I can get over that. Where does it lead me, then? To quality as "slow burn" should be slowly amping up the tension and drama until we reach a boiling point in the movie, a final crescendo to release that tension. In short, if I'm going to watch nothing happen for almost two hours, then it damn sure better lead to an awesome finale. There is no big payoff here, though. We get to a cave, we shoot some natives, we get one gory kill and we fizzle out with a few more natives killed in rapid succession. This is what I waited all this time for? I can't believe how many reviews are enamored of that one kill scene. Sure, it's pretty gruesome, but don't these people watch horror beyond THE PURGE or SINISTER? I see worse than that, or equal, every week in tons of other indie horror films. Maybe I'm just de-sensitized, but it takes more than that to impress me.If you really want a great movie about prehistoric creatures living in a cave, go watch THE DESCENT. It's a far better film that knows how to build tension and horror. I keep waiting for a truly great mashup of western and horror, as there are great examples in literature, but for some reason cinema hasn't seemed to figure out how to pull it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is a disaster. The actors are good, but the script and action are desperate. Very slow action makes the viewer indifferent, as not to get things moving. Scene of killing Nik is totally unnecessary and I do not understand why so enthusiastically showing of such a hard scene. The first scene of the film is also raw and I do not see the point. The film lacks a depth and vibrancy of action and dialogue. I think that most of the dialogue is shallow. I hope to be more cautious when it comes to movies of Mr. Zahler and that this gentlemen will not get in the future too much funds to direct similar projects. Predicting that the rating of the film to the next year will fall below 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things a man can't ride around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few good things here.It gives us familiar faces in costume and prosy dialogue but always pulls back from letting it become Tarantino, about how clever it is.It's about men traipsing through rocky desert in search of cannibals but never goes off in hijinks or caricature, it just keeps going.It has clear, strong characters and writing, understated wit. It elicits memorable performances from people we can't help but know as actors as we watch, Jenkins in particular pulling a Walter Brennan.On the other hand the camera is plain, the desert more a backdrop for characters than its own ritual. I miss here a particularly physical sense of place that will pervade our eyes and nostrils. Most importantly I miss abstraction, a way for this to permeate deeper than just a story about four people setting out to rescue a woman. It's not sloppy Tarantino, it's not the Coens either, or Sayles, or Altman, who all made their way West at one point. It's a story well told in the pulp tradition, a writer's creation.But to finish on a positive note, I can appreciate what it musters on screen and the balancing act of making it happen. And it used to be that filmmakers in old Hollywood could crank out a film every year, sometimes more. It seems that you needed little more to work in the industry than decide to go West and apprentice, learn by doing it. Ford was 23 years old when he got his start, unusual now. So for a first-timer to deliver competent work on a budget, he should be celebrating. I hope his phone is ringing and that he gets to ride around the things he can't now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Bone Tomahawk" (2015) is a horror western like i never seen it before. It is bloody, with some gore and shocking scenes. This movie is also very brutal. If you don't like to watching these things, you might be offended by "Bone Tomahawk". The story is very simple, yet very good for this kind of movie. Directing was amazing. Action scenes are brutal and realistic and i haven't seen scenes directed and staged in this way before - they are simply shocking. Can't also remember when i was last time rooting so much for main character at the end to succeed. Overall, i highly enjoyed "Bone Tomahawk", but it not like Eli Roth's type of horror flick. While it is bloody and sometimes shockingly gore, it is also wonderfully acted especially by Richard Jenkins and the whole cast here is just superb, so many familiar faces in one low budget flick, but "Bone Tomahawk" is more then your usual genre flick, this is a superb motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This right here probably was intended to be more of a movie than a horror, with great actors, dialogue, surroundings, all western, all old and respectful to those times.But this is not the reason I downloaded it and decided to give it a go. I wanted to see a horror, like I've seen some good western ones, "Dead Birds" and "The burrowers" being a few examples that worked just fine for me. Bone Tomahawk is more related to "Ravenous", cause it does have that classic look all over it. It just takes so much for something to happen, that at times, you do lose your patience.So, if you're into a horror mood, this will probably disappoint, unless you are seriously mind opened about the genre, and you adopt its any form. If you want to see a good movie that slips into the horror type, this will do the trick.Cheers!</fullReview>

I have NEVER seen anything as gross in all the movies I have watched over the last 30 years. I am an avid horror film follower and have watched many movies where victims were brutalized. I believe this movie should come with significant warnings as to the brutality and gore depicted in this particular scene. I would never have watched this film had I known how this one victim would meet his demise. Please DO NOT watch this film unless you are fully prepared to see some of the most disgusting and incomprehensible killings as you will ever see in this movie!!

We like Kurt and it had a seven out of ten rating so we thought what the heck. There are too many unanswered questions because the ending stops like a pony dropping of into a canyon. It's horrible but you cannot help but look. The husband and wife don't seem believable as a couple and the wife survived days with cannibals but it doesn't explain any of what happened to her or why. Men with no injuries don't survive but the one really hurt and out of water kills the most? The eating of humans and violence surpassed the capabilities of my mind-it was over the top and distracted from what had the potential to be a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad whatever the director's intention.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is admirable for being an indie production, especially a Western/horror with an unusual sub-genre (a lost tribe of 'people').That said, I don't know what the director was trying to do, and I think it's bad regardless. Was he trying to make pulpy, tongue-in-cheek fare? It fails at the sort of humorous winks that would make that work. Was he trying to play it gritty and straight-ahead? It's ham-fisted. Was he trying for a weird mix of these two things? ...probably, but that isn't what jars me.What jars me is that every element in the movie is a mix of sometimes good, sometimes competently shrug-able, and sometimes incompetent. I will say that the lighting is generally good (with some conspicuously forced lighting here and there), and that the flat characterization is acceptable in a film of this genre.BUT, the story logic, the dialogue, the acting, the shot/edit/sequence decisions, the sound design-- they're often sub-par or terrible. If these were all good to great, the weird tone of the picture wouldn't bother me. As it is, the tone is just another semi-competent choice at best.I believe that the fan support for the film exists because the fans of the genre are starved for content. For this, and for executing an indie Western at all for $1.8M, I will give the director credit. But on its own merits, this is not a good or even fully competent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New LOW in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We must have been watching two different movies. This director and the actors that saw this sad film released as is have sunk to a new low. The movie industry is screwing with us in ways that only they could to push an agenda. We are being systematically desensitized. The movie rating business would not have released this poison in the past- even with an "X" rating.I'd like to say that the movie was good up to a point, but when I spend hard-earned money and have to leave part way through it FOR ANY REASON the movie has let me, the audience, down.The sadistic, graphic violence in the scene near the end of this otherwise boring film was uncalled for. To think that my girls and their kids will one day get to the point in this film when gratuitous horror spoils an otherwise decent "B" movie makes my stomach hurt again.Director S. Craig Zahler really dumped in the bed here. I hope he never gets another producer to take a call from him again. Standards in Hollywood have really dropped off of the charts when the paying public is promised a great thriller and given this crap! The movie must have had a small budget to attract such poor direction, but the other tip off here is that they not only billed Kurt Russell, but also Sean Young. The phone rarely rings in either household as it is, so they must have needed the dough to take part in such a horror-bal film.The craft of acting and movies in general is always touted as an ART FORM. Not this time, baby. What happened to the people that used to make real movies and left the gore out in place of audience imagination? Oh, but there are no more Hitchcocks around for a reason. The proverbial $#it going to hit the fan in this country, and the very people that control the film industry and all of the popular media are desensitizing us to get used to seeing all out violence.The rest of the planet has seen uncensored news for years. Many countries witness this kind of brutality every day. In America we have been getting a sanitized version of all the evil around us. A few years ago horror movies begin tipping the scales. We can opt out of such movies, but when we get a western that promises thrills and get graphic violence like this, you are better taking your $12 bucks and getting a real enjoyable conversation with friends around a table instead. Save your money unless you like to see a man clearly hatcheted in half. Only the lowest, saddest individuals would enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bone Tomahawk doesn't really capture the essence that causes horror or western audiences to swoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A western-horror hybrid film made on an independent film budget is next to unheard of until now. Bone Tomahawk is a chill inducing film.Paying homage to the old westerns of the 1950's and 1960's, Bone Tomahawk is about an honest law abiding sheriff who embarks on a mission with his deputy, an injured cowboy and a gunslinger to rescue three people kidnapped, one of which is the town doctor and the cowboy's wife. What ensues is a journey akin to a John Ford epic, focused on the gore and savagery of that time.There is a scene in The Searchers that still strikes and petrifies me to this day. It is in the near beginning when Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns to his family's home and must inspect the damage done by the invading Comanches. Outside of the blazing home there is a shrouded hut, in it he discovers the fate of his beloved Martha, the horror of which beyond anything we can imagine. The camera stays outside the door, not daring to pass the threshold. His nephew clamors to see what is inside, using all his might to get past Ethan. Bone Tomahawk uses that moment, but instead lets you push past Ethan and bathe yourself in all the grotesque viciousness unleashed.Writer and director S. Craig Zahler uses much more than this moment to imitate a classic John Ford western. First there is the medley of characters, all of which have been clearly marked out by Ford films in the past. Then there is the way in which this motley group of characters band together, against horrible odds, to save their friends and loved ones from unspeakable evil. While on paper, Bone Tomahawk seems to fit the western bill, it misses the heart and soul we as an audience discovered along the journey with these characters and jumps right to a brutal conclusion.And what a barbaric conclusion it is. I am a horror buff who relishes in fictional carnage and I was squirming with all my might to not look away at the severity of the scenes. Most of the gore is contained within the final third of the film, and is highly advised against for the faint of heart, a warning I rarely make.As a hybrid film, it certainly fits in both milieus. It is also that which prevents it from shining in either. People watch westerns not for the gunslinging shoot-outs but because they yearn for the simpler time when there were strong sheriffs and gruff bad guys and a search for right or wrong. The characters were fully formed and interesting, a beacon of truth in self. People watch horrors because they want to be scared, they want to face that which terrifies them to their bones and feel the catharsis of surviving. Bone Tomahawk doesn't really do or have either of these things, but is daring nonetheless.As a first film, it is a commendable undertaking and accomplishment for S. Craig Zahler, especially on a budget of near minuscule size at $1.8 million. I wish the film had more of a core to it in regards to the characters and the group dynamic ? and at 132 minutes, it had the time, just not the meritorious material.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you like Tanantino, you'll love this unique Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The landscapes and clear division between good and evil in Westerns seduced me to love cinema. I am thus comforted by the recent revival of the genre that Quentin Tarantino most notably supports with Django Unchained and coming soon, The Hateful Eight.Newbie director S. Craig Zahler's Bone Tomahawk is even more eccentric than Tarantino's oaters. It may even be more enjoyable given its fusion of Western and horror with humor and amusing Victorian-like dialogue. Musician, novelist Zahler uses his skills best with this unique language.Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) assembles a posse to track down cave-dwelling, Indian-like cannibals called "troglodytes," who have abducted horses and townies, including the doctor, Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons). Her recently hobbled husband, Arthur (Patrick Wilson) joins the posse, which also includes Gabby Hayes-Walter Brennan type Deputy Chicary (Richard Jenkins) and slick gunslinger, Indian-hater John Brooder (Matthew Fox).Arthur best exemplifies the crippled nature of the search (think a ramped-down The Searchers) and the almost tarot-card doom.Along this macabre journey is plenty of time for dialogue, stylized and unusually witty. For example, early on before the trip, a bartender calls out a depressive customer: "It's like a tree fell on you. A Redwood." The dialogue is amusingly delivered in a slow, high style, with literate words contrasting the gritty horror story.I was reminded by this remarkable adventure of Odysseus's struggles with, say, the Cyclops and Sirens (the throaty cannibal howl is not exactly lurid; it just can be heard from far away and demands exploration). Likewise did I think of John Huston's ragged morality play, The Treasure of The Sierra Madre (1948). Zahler rivals in look, mood, and dialogue the work of the master.Right to the end, words count. After the posse meets and fights the mute, ghastly white kidnappers, the credits roll to a fetching background parody of a Western ditty by Zahler and Jeff Herriott. These are the most civilized moments in an unusually odd film, the likes of which you'll not see again. Given its highly disturbing images, maybe that's for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Boring movie you will ever waste time watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bone Tomahawk is a horribly boring movie and a waste of a good 2 hours of life. I watched this movie in good faith, due to a promising cast and many good reviews that I read prior to watching. Unfortunately, although this movie is advertised as horror, it is really, really not. Nothing happens for about 90% of the movie. A movie can be slow paced, yet still interesting, but this movie captures no interest at all and holds no suspense whatsoever. If you value your sanity, don't bother with this movie. Unless you enjoy watching people walking aimlessly and doing absolutely nothing else, nor saying anything interesting either.I gave this movie two stars: 1 for the 10% of the movie where something actually happened, and 1 for coming up with a kind of interesting plot (which was executed horribly.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First a western than a horror but certainly delivers as a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both these genres and some added drama are worked out well and are very impressive as an indie production.It takes some time for character development but keeps enough tension to keep you involved with a group of people who go into the unknown to save the wife of one of them from a clan of cannibals.The actors were well casted,Kurt Russel did a great job but I was especially surprised by Michael Pare's play because I didn't even recognize him.The rest of the cast also got memorable roles and especially the old man that talked to much was really funny.The wife is portrayed as being a strong woman and because she is a doctor can deal better with blood and the panic it causes by any non medical person. Also because of that she becomes more important for the plot and therefor the story.At the end the horror is pretty brutal and there is enough blood but it never feels over the top and fits the tone of this movie.It's the wild west but than a little wilder(which could have been a slogan for this)I recommend this,it's solid entertainment.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleeper Western/horror hybrid; a must see on the big screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BONE TOMAHAWK (2015) ***1/2 Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, Lili Simmons, David Arquette, Sean Young, Kathryn Morris, Sid Haig, Zahn McClarnon, James Tolkan, Michael Pare. Sleeper Western/horror hybrid about a small town besieged by a violent tribe of Native Americans (referred to as troglodytes; cannibalistic cavemen basically) who abduct a female physician and a deputy which enables a quartet posse of lawman Russell (low-key and affective), the woman's injured husband (Wilson in one of his best roles to date), a Jim Dandy obnoxious sharpshooter (barely recognizable Fox also acquitting himself nicely) and the elderly back-up deputy (Jenkins providing much needed ballast and comic relief) as they are led into a journey of fear. Newbie filmmaker S. Craig Zahler creates a deliberately paced scary oater with some fun tics and genuine jolts of graphic carnage (yes it gets bloody) and a crackerjack cast of 'can-you-spot-who-that-Was in blink/miss cameos). Fine filmmaking overall with handsome cinematography by Benji Bakshi; a must see on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic cartoon story on a Saturday afternoon at the bijou.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>great cast. good dialogue. funny as in dumb joke moments. cartoon script as in the ones Hollywood mass produce like a pancake machine for 2d characters. note. don't let the facts get in a way of a good story script. another words anyone who grew up reading the sandman or watch the movie 13 warriors will want to watch this cartoon/comic book western. by the way. i put john ford as a comic book movie director with better taste in directing then this movie, not politically correct but fun if you don't mind too much white folks 1d in development, in your picture. i label character development in 1d, 2d and 3d. because all the dull moments in the movie add up to some gory moments not for kids or young adult....not sure ladies in the audience can put up with this either.. but hey if the boys want to gross out their date. by all means. all and all it's a b movie, low budget feel with very good acting. worth watching once. but leaves a bad taste in your mouth afterwords if you think too long about it. like someone's spit in your corn soup. one other note. IMDb is china. they don't what honesty. they have a whole list of authoritarian rules that block honest opinion. and one other thing. reviews are opinion. just like hairs in your private. everyone got some somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice concept, but poorly paced and not as fulfilling as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that seems to have been written around one key idea - in this case towards the climax, involving some horrific cannibals. The whole pre-amble is a drawn out excuse to lead the audience to those far more engaging scenes. Its watchable enough, fairly well directed, and some nice moments, but on the whole it plods along like one of those less progressive episodes in a TV season. The middle act involving a horseback journey reminded me of 3:10 to Yuma but a little more boring. The last act is by far the best (it feels like the film actually begins at this point), but even that isn't done anywhere near as well and as gripping as it could have been. There are two gory moments, and the overall conclusion is still pretty unsatisfying. It feels like the writer/director didn't quite have the balls (or budget) to do justice to the idea, so dragged it out in to something duller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What if "Tremors" Married "Tombstone"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't get into details about plots or the director's former wife's sister's cousin's role in its production or any of that over-the-top "geek" talk. I'm just an average guy who likes movies, so don't expect any major techno-babble in this review.Kurt Russell always puts on a solid performance in his movies, and you can expect the same here. The rest of the cast also play their roles out well. The one cast member that had me floored though was Richard Jenkins. His character stole the show as Chicory. I've only and always known him as playing the same straight-laced, proper semi-neutral-good- bad-guy supporting character in every movie I've seen him in (Jack Reacher, Cabin in the Woods, etc.). Believe it or not, though, he actually played this totally out of the ordinary role extremely well and provided much of the comic relief as an old, balding, widower deputy sheriff who rambles on about the oddest things for hours on end.Outside of the acting, the dialog in the movie is quite entertaining. There's lots of "natural" humor that just flows with the conversation and events; nothing feels forced, nor should it in a horror/thriller. The dialog has the same feel and is much like the first and the latest "Tremors" movies.The downside of this movie, however, is its pacing. It clocks in at over 2 hours and it does a good job at establishing back plots and characters... but it drags at times. There are some scenes that could be condensed into one line of "And some days later..." that we're dragged through, coughing up ever dusty rock and tumbleweed as we go along for the ride.It feels like a 90 minute movie that they needed to make longer, so they kept pasting southwestern scenes together until they hit the 2 hour mark.The ending, without ruining anything for all of you, also falls flat. It's a freshman mistake and one that any decent writer/director/screenwriter should know to avoid. But the end left me with the feeling of "Huh? Is that it?" and then the credits rolled.Definitely worth 6.5 stars. Could have been closer to an 8 if it didn't drag for so long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About two hours too long...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb, I just had to register to warn people away from this movie. Don't be fooled by the list of great actors who seemingly signed on for this disaster just for the paycheck. Don't get me wrong, they tried their best with what they had to work with, which wasn't much. Clearly most of this movie's budget went to pay for the cast, probably 10% went towards the set pieces, 0% towards the musical score, as there isn't any, and whatever was left over was used to pay off some movie critics over at RT. This turd got 86% at RT, they should be ashamed for telling such a lie. With the exception of when the heroes are riding and then walking across the desert to rescue some kidnapped town folk, the entire movie is shot in small, indoor dwellings that look like the sets from either the old Star Trek or Batman TV shows. Honestly, this is the first western I have ever watched where you don't get to see the town, I guess that wasn't in the budget, nor were the extras it would take to make it look lived in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had much greater potential than it delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to exactly nail this one down, because it has a lot of good points, which are obvious, but a some serious deficiencies which are more abstract. The good points are all front and centre from the start: a good cast, headed by the ever-excellent Kurt Russell, an interesting high-concept of "The Searchers meets Hills Have Eyes", and witty dialogue. It's just as the film passes I realised I wasn't enjoying it as much as I would have liked to. A key weak point is an uneventful script. The characters have a long journey to make, so they chat a lot, and it's not unpleasant to hear because the dialogue is good, it's just that not much else of interest occurs. Also there isn't much depth to the film: the characters have simple motivations, and the plot plays out as expected and doesn't have much of a climax. I kept expecting there was going to be a shocking revelation, but nothing ever happened. In a Q&amp;A with the producers, they mentioned that they filmed the first version of the script and how unusual that was, and I think it does show. The best thing about the film is the amazing gruesome violence. That's what I was hoping to see, and towards the end it really delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You gotta see Bone Tomahawk. I know it sounds like the name of a porn star, but it's actually a western, horror, comedy. Kurt Russel and Richard Jenkins are in it, so you know it's gonna be good. The first image is of someone getting their throat sliced...literally the FIRST image. There's lots of witty and wry banter among the characters as they embark on a mission to save people being held captive by cannibalistic troglodytes. Yes, that's what I said. The first two acts play like a fairly conventional western, but holy crap, the third act is like Sam Raimi and John Capenter on overload as it becomes more and more over the top. It has some Tarantino-esque vibes and some cheesy sets (particularly a cave with primitive prison cells) that help make the movie fun. Richard Jenkins is unrecognizable; I was shocked to find out it was him. He was totally transformed- great actor. I was very pleased by this film, and I think it could achieve cult status if people give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a refreshing take on the modern western. I say modern western but to me it was a return and an evolution of those I used to watch with my grandfather when I was younger. It had to me aspects of "There Will Be Blood" and one of my all time favorite movies that also starred Mr. Kurt Russell "Tombstone".The graphic nature of this film was realistic, and the attitudes of the characters were indicative of this time and place. It is definitely not a film for those weak of heart or who are easily offended by true accounts of how things were in our collective history. That aside the story had some points when it dragged but never to a place where you lose interest. The performances of the actors were of high quality and believable.It is my opinion that if you have a craving for a good western along the lines of "Tombstone" or "3:10 to Yuma" and like realistic portrayals of rugged characters you should watch this diamond in the ruff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western with horror-anthropological drive?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a piece! Nothing better than a nice surprise that begins, aside from a bit mystical intro, and goes some time coated in a typical "saw the type many times" appear-to-be a cliché western. Even than, the authentic setting is slowly established, which soon enough starts to unveil the dramatic ride of rather unusual and unsettling characters. Than ? "the second" part of the movie builds up the tension in the story-line that breaks even the oddest expectations! And there it is - rather crazy anthropological element in the midst of usual Western motives, that serves as a realistic horror drive in the latter part of the movie. Even the (so to say) "sarcastic music" plays a part in surreal movie odor that culminates great. So it has peculiar atmosphere. Honestly, I was a bit sleepy in the beginning, but than it shook me all-time well-awake! Enjoying more and more to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next Generation Western that blazes a trail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Bone Tomahawk and not expecting too much from a new director (but great writer) I was more than surprised at how well the movie turned out. Acting was understated but matched the mood of the movie perfectly. Kurt Russell is back in a huge way. All the cast were perfect for their roles. The violence was gruesome but rarely over the top. The troglodytes were menacing. The story and writing however is what carries the movie. Its basic "Searchers" material with a modern twist. I would in no way consider this a horror movie. Its a western but with very dark overtones. Cinematography is good and again matches the tone of the movie. The only reason this receives an 8 and not higher is I feel that at 132 minutes it runs a little long and that 10 minutes of the search could have been edited.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should be paid to write 10 lines about this piece of garbage. The dialogue is mostly meaningless, and most of the time, consist of and old man rambling about things you really don't care about.Nor is essential to the plot. The acting is fairly okay. It's what you can expect of a kurt russell movie. You sort of know what you can expect, when you see they have David Arquette and Matthew Fox on the payroll. You don't really care for any of the characters,they are one dimensional anyway. The movie is way too long 2 hour and fifteen min,a B movie of this kind,shouldn't last longer than 90min 100 at the most. Lili simmons look Amazing as always,which is probably why the director saw fit to have a nude scene with her,that there really wasn't any need for. Oh yeah,and by the way,who the h*ll decide to have sex missionary style with a broken leg?</fullReview>
