		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson unleashes hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love it when Mel Gibson is in his Mad Max Lethal Weapon Braveheart Patriot mode. The character and the performance you see in BLOOD FATHER is something that Gibson often returns to from time to time. The tortured soul, protective of his loved one, willing to unleash hell when necessary. BLOOD FATHER is hardcore. A merciless story of retribution.Directed by Peter Craig, Mel Gibson plays an ex-convict and former alcoholic named John Link who's trying his best to keep it together . Until one day when his estranged daughter comes back into his life but with a big secret, turns out, the drug cartel is hunting her down, a situation that forces Link to use his past connections and his skills to keep his daughter alive.Much of the film is set in the desert, so one can't help but make a stretched comparison to Mel Gibson's old days as Mad Max. The best way to describe BLOOD FATHER in a way that today's audiences would understand is that Gibson's character, John Link, is more or less kinda like Liam Neeson's character in "Taken" franchise, but with less resources and Link is more rough around the edges. But both characters would go above and beyond for their respective daughters.BLOOD FATHER is a very straightforward film, it has that father-daughter drama, though not as strong or as powerful as such films as "The Wrestler," for example, but some of the lines do hit home, and the action is more about firepower and gunfights, very brute, very basic, but it gets the job done. Some might say BLOOD FATHER is predictable and I don't blame them, it is after all just one of those movies for us Charles Bronson fans who just want to see the bad guys ultimately get what they deserve, a satisfying punishment.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things to know going in.The is a Hollywood "resurrection" role -- when an A-list big-name star disappears for a while and then comes back in a role you might not expect.(They can be fun. Costner did a few and they were all interesting. In Fargo Season 2 Jean Smart came back playing a grandmother in a crime family -- and aced it. Gibson, formerly the "sexiest man on the planet" according to polls, nails his cranky, old, character is this one.)Second it is not a A-film. The running time (about 90 mins) is the tip-off. So going into it, you expect something different.Which is what you get.It is not really an actioner, even though it stars one of the biggest action stars in the biz. And does have a lot of action in it. It is more of a road movie. And it is just quirky enough to keep interest.If Gibson is good, Erin Moriarty is a revelation. This is her breakout role. You will be seeing her again soon. The script, which is razor sharp, requires her to have play both young/stupid and smart/strong at the same time. A contradictory role that would be be a challenge for an A-list pro. She takes command of the role and becomes unforgettable by her third scene.Great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson Is Back And Better Than Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie completely blind. I did not see a single advertisement for the film, in fact I didn't even know of its existence up until the day before seeing it. I haven't seen Mel Gibson do anything for awhile so the movie definitely caught my interest. I expected it to be a fun B- movie turn your brain off type of thing.But actually I think that this is one of the better films of the year. It was fast paced, fun, and brutal. The acting was well done all the way around. It was emotional, dramatic, and thrilling. Mel Gibson put on one of his greatest performances, and caught me completely off guard. His character was very fun to watch, reminiscent of Joel from "The Last Of Us". William H. Macy was fantastic as well. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves any genre. It has a little something for everybody. Really great film and I hope it ends up receiving a lot more recognition than its getting right now. I highly recommend you go see this film, you won't regret it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken meets Sicario meets Sons of Anarchy in the new action thriller; Blood Father, which reminds us once again why you don't mess with Mel Gibson's family.Oh Mel Gibson, you amazing, charismatic, volatile, genius, we freaking missed you. It's been 6 years since we had a good reason to be excited about a Mel Gibson movie and he's back with a bang and more than a few growls in Blood Father. Watching this film I found myself with a big smile on my face and saying things like "Hell yeah", "that's right", and "let's go" throughout the duration of this incredibly enjoyable action thrill ride. Mel plays a formerly violent ex convict trying to live a quiet life as a tattoo artist when he is dragged into a war with a violent gang in order to protect his estranged daughter (played by Erin Moriarity) who suddenly comes back into his life. All hell breaks loose as Mel and his daughter go on the run through the California desert dodging (and spraying) bullets, gang bangers, Sicarios, and vengeful bikers left and right all while both trying to stay sober. "Don't worry I'm not dying, I'm just in El Centro" is just one of the many quotable lines from this tense, gritty, violent, and surprisingly funny action thriller from director Jean-Francois Richet. The best part about Blood Father is that it's exactly the film you think it's going to be. If you've seen the trailer you know this movie, and in this case that's not a bad thing. The film never once deviates from its plot and tone over the course of its perfectly taut 88-minute run time. There's no fluff, no unnecessary dialogue or characters, just hard-hitting action and thrills. It's unapologetic in its simple reasoning to have Mel Gibson doing what he does best; playing a father and busting heads. Blood Father is essentially a modern day western with motorcycles instead of horses and Mel absolutely killing it as the not-to-be-messed-with man with a troubled past. His character John Link has done far more bad in his life than good and sees protecting his daughter as the last chance he may ever have to atone for his sins, even if it means doing those bad things again. The world of Blood Father is a world filled with gangs, killers, drugs and criminals, a world that John Link is all to familiar with and not that far removed from. Gibson is at this best in years playing the hardened ex con Link with that same simmering intensity and wild-eyed look that he's been perfecting since Mad Max. The film contains some gorgeous cinematography reminiscent of old Sergio Leone westerns and more recent desert thrillers like No Country for Old Men. The supporting cast around Gibson and Moriarity is fantastic as well. William H. Macy steals his few scenes as Gibson's sponsor/best friend, Diego Luna is great as the main villain, and Michael Parks is extremely entertaining as a sociopathic ex Nazi and former colleague of Link's. The biggest problem with Blood Father is the extremely limited release the studio slapped it with (no doubt a lingering middle finger to Mel I'm sure). If you can catch it on the big screen you absolutely have to see it but if not definitely watch it on VOD. Blood Father is the kind of lurid, pulpy, vengeance flick that was so popular in the 80's and 90's, which in a summer filled with bloated CGI filled blockbusters is a welcome sight. It's a simple action thriller about a guy with a damaged past just looking for a little redemption. Is it art-imitating life? Possibly, either way it's an awesome time that's not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Mel's back to settle the score.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we first meet John Link, Mel Gibson's grizzled ex-con anti-hero in his latest thriller Blood Father, he's in the midst of an impassioned soliloquy at an AA meeting. A self-proclaimed "real success story," Link is a recovering alky two years out of the slammer, whose wife left him and whose daughter is in the wind, leaving him with no one in his corner and with no one to blame but himself. It's a fitting noir-esque introduction to Link, but also?perhaps more appropriately, especially as he's talking straight at the camera when he says it?it seems to be coming from Gibson himself.Directed by Jean-François Richet, who helmed 2008's gripping gangster diptych Mesrine, Blood Father seems at first glance to be another addition to the tried-and-true Gibson formula: a brutal guy on the wrong side of the tracks takes on those who wronged him, often in typically gruesome fashion. Certainly, John Link could be blood brothers with Porter and Driver, Gibson's violent protagonists from Payback and Get the Gringo. Living on the fringe of society while scratching out a living as a tattoo artist from his grungy desert trailer, Link is as blunt and terse as his monosyllabic name would suggest. The difference is that Blood Father feels like Gibson confronting the demons that put him and his career on the skids over the last decade. His performance feels like penance, and not in a negative way. Gibson's mainstay has always been passion?in both definitions of the word?and here he bares himself to the bone.Link's efforts to stay on the straight and narrow are complicated by the cataclysmic arrival of his wayward daughter Lydia (Erin Moriarty). Strung-out and on the run from a bunch of bad customers, Lydia's presence puts her father on an inexorable course towards violence?which, of course, he excels at dishing out. And true to form for a Mel Gibson joint, there is no shortage of it: once the blood starts flowing and the bullets start flying, it's hard to stop.Gibson's trademark wild-man intensity is in full froth here, and it's always a welcome sight to behold, even if it's been in otherwise subpar productions or against lesser actors. For the most part, fortunately, Blood Father isn't pigeonholed in either category. While some of the dialogue sounds more than a little ponderous (Lydia spends much of the film spitting out sheaves of insight with such precision that you'd think she were a Sorkinian heroine instead of, well, someone who snorts heroin), the rest of it is balanced in taut, punchy lines that would make Hemingway proud. And unlike Get the Gringo, which featured Gibson at the top of his game making his co-stars look downright amateurish, he's bolstered by some reliable names this go-around: among them, William H. Macy as Link's good-natured AA sponsor and Michael Parks as a seedy old contact from his past. In fact, the only real weak link of the cast is Moriarty, whose erratic performance is far too self-conscious and unconvincing for us to really care about her plight. It's only through Gibson that we care (and to his credit, he does and we do).Much of Blood Father is a foregone conclusion, all the way up to its bullet-riddled finale. And while the film rarely evinces an inspired note, it's still a good potboiler, and there's nothing wrong with a well-worn story if it's well-told. But with an actor like Gibson at the fore, it becomes something more personal. Blood Father's about a man facing old sins and the grim reckoning that comes with them. And every single one of Mad Mel's is on full display here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film may not have the Michael Bay's explosive extravaganza, it may not have the same intensity as Triple 9, and it's not much of a tearjerker as you might expect but it is a good film that aspires to give something new to the action films.Fast pacing dialogue that aren't feeble and corny matches very well with its theme which is fleeing persecution from authorities, cartel, and personal guilt.This is also a good film to see actors such as Diego Luna(Star Wars: Rogue One) and Erin Moriarty who played her part admirably.And Of course we get to see again the unparalleled Mel Gibson. He may not be Mad Max no more but watch this film and you'll know why he used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"An ex-con reunites with his estranged wayward 16-year old daughter to protect her from drug dealers who are trying to kill her." Honestly, Mel Gibson steals the show in playing Link, a man who's had a huge history of making mistakes and became an alcoholic. Mel Gibson just keeps on proving more and more that he's not only a great actor, but a total badass! Erin Moriarty who plays Lydia (the daughter) is also really good She comes across as annoying, but I think that's kind of the point. We see a huge change in her character as the film progresses. William H. Macy was also really good in this role, and to be honest there needed to be more done with him. Same with Diego Luna. He plays a great villain, but with very little screen time.While the movie focuses more on the drama side of things, the movie does have its great moments of suspense and action. The whole movie felt like it had a 90's feel to it, and not a bad thing! All in all, is worth your money and worth seeing Gibson in action..yet again. Let's forgive Mel for what he did in the past and let him be the greatest actor that ever lived! 4/5 stars, 8/10. The Autistic Reviewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Return for Mel.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. The story was a little convenient (that's all I can say without spoiling), but I was pleasantly surprised. Mel seemed at the top of his game or very close to it. William H Macy was perfect and would have liked to see more of him. He is always a plus to the cast no matter what the movie. He really is a pleasure to watch. Erin Moriarty showed a good emotional range. The Villains were menacing enough and posed a valid threat. I appreciated the fact that this movie wasn't using nudity and a lot of sleazy humor. (one naked mannequin, or blowup doll in the background) Its nice to see a classic action/drama movie reminiscent of the 80s/90s. If you were ever a fan of Mel Gibson's, Definitely Check this one out. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When runaway teenager Lydia (Erin Moriarity) accidentally shoots her drugs cartel boyfriend, she makes a desperate run for it, asking for help from her estranged father Link (Mel Gibson), a tough ex-con still on parole. Together, father and daughter go into hiding, pursued by vicious killers.I know that Mad Mel doesn't think very highly of the English (or anyone who is not an Australian/American Catholic, for that matter), but I'm still a fan, and Blood Father proves that he still has what it takes, the star putting in a moving performance as a caring father who will do anything to protect his daughter.This isn't an all-out action-fest, which might disappoint some viewers (although there are some great action scenes to be had)?it's a tale of redemption, with a flawed character doing his best to make up for past mistakes, which seems very apt: perhaps Hollywood should learn something from this film and give its troubled star one more chance.Best moments: the opening bit of satire?16 year-old Lydia buys countless packs of bullets at a store without a problem, but is carded when it comes to cigarettes; the motorbike chase scene (nice to see Mel toting a shotgun once again); and what's that? Mel making fun of himself in a scene in which he spews hatred of minorities? I had to laugh.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately this is a Politically correct movie. Nazis and confederate lovers show up to be the "evil" cartoon characters and will betray their loyalties for money. Men are responsible for women's behavior. The movie features the world's dumbest, sluttiest, ugliest daughter.She hurts everyone, her father, her boyfriend, and where are the consequences for her?! Nope, its men's fault for her behavior. Mel is awesome but the somehow spoiled and trashy daughter seems to be who we as the audience are supposed to care about. I didn't and I don't.So stereotype Nazis (and also somehow confederates) show up to be clowns, the female value is greater than any man's, and the daughter makes mistake after mistake with 0 consequences to herself- like a feminist dream.I guess Mel after being abused globally for getting drunk and running his mouth, has to do this PC stuff to earn his way back to Zionist Hollywood.Cut out the PC garbage and its a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fascinating, action with a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is great in this movie. He portrays a grizzled ex con who is hell bent on helping his wayward teenage daughter who is up to the seat of her hotpants in hot water. Yeah, there is a ton of action, and very well staged action, but there is also a very powerful underlying narrative about the power of love. Gibson pretty much nails the role and you can't help but admire the character, a very flawed but helplessly hopeful individual who carries a certain nobility despite it all. He is a world weary survivor who has seen it all and finally realizes that the only things that really matter are self value and the people you should be close to. The daughter is just as flawed and beat up as the dad but together they form a bond that transcends all, even the grave. This is first and foremost a blast away action thriller but one theme runs through all the pyrotechnics...we all got to help each other and finally it will all start making sense and maybe even end well for a change. Wow, how the heck did Mel get those guns...Arnold and Stallone must be bright freaking green with envy. Man, those things look computer enhanced but I bet they aren't. Impressive!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson Mixes Mad Max With Taken To Great Success!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Minor/Vague SpoilersMel Gibson's return to charismatic form in Blood Father is nothing short of a great success. His character is a recovering alcoholic which is interesting to watch considering how it parallels his current state in life. Although he has done some terrible things in the past I can look past it and when it comes to anyone in Hollywood I can separate their real life from the character they're portraying in the film. It has never been a factor and most likely never will so if this is something that gives you pause I would still recommend everyone see this film and judge Gibson based on the character he plays in the film and not the craziness that is Mel Gibson in real life. The film reminded me of Taken just when it comes down to the basic plot of main character's daughter needs protecting and he will stop at nothing to do so. Lydia Link, portrayed by Erin Moriarty, is estranged from her father and finds herself in trouble with a gang of drug dealers so she goes to her father, Gibson, for help. The relationship between these two is nothing short of amazing. The film really captures how Gibson wants to be a better father and the journey that this 90 minute film takes them on; just from a character development standpoint is very impressive. Gibson's character has great interactions with his neighbour/sponsor, played by William H. Macy, who isn't in the movie a lot but when he is he brings the comic relief for the other characters to play off. Most people would call this an action movie and while I would kind of agree I would also say that it comes across as more of a drama with action elements throughout, to propel the characters and the plot forward. Going into the third act Mel Gibson really digs his teeth into this role where he taps into his Mad Max past and shows that he still has it when it comes to an action based film. This is where the film picks up entirely from a little lull in the middle and makes this film even more fun. Which is a word I don't really like using because it makes it seem like it is a bit mediocre but that is not the case at all.The way the film is shot and edited makes it seem like it is low budget but that doesn't take anything away from the film. Instead it feels much more isolated and gritty which also makes the intensity and tension of the film much higher. Sometimes I need more so it isn't just a simple paint-by-numbers big blockbuster summer action movie e.g. The Avengers or Batman V Superman. It is much more realistic which makes it even better that most superhero movies I have seen. Sure, it can be said that it has a pretty predictable plot but it is the characters takes this film above the other action movies. All in all the film is extremely enjoyable and a surprise that sneaked up on me this year and I do hope this leads to more great movies from Mel Gibson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gibson is back........and then some....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gibson may have messed up a few times in his personal life, but I don't know the man, whatever he's said or done hasn't really bothered me like it's bothered people who have gone so far to boycott his movies and ensure that he never makes the big time again (hello Hollywood).But one thing that will never change is the fact that he's a marvellous screen presence, a bona fide movie star, and here he's the Mel Gibson that we remember from the late eighties/early nineties, albeit with a few more lines..An ex-con tattoo artist, John Link, fights to protect his estranged teenage daughter, who is being hunted by a Mexican drug cartel, after getting mixed up in her boyfriend's criminal schemes.Josh goes back to the past he was trying to forget in order to protect him, and his daughter...Even though this is easily one of the films of the year, and Gibson's best performance in nearly fifteen years, don't expect it to be paying at a cinema near you anytime soon, unless you live in the capital, because of what he's done in the past, he's been subliminally blacklisted.And he knows this, hence the choice of role he's taken for this. This is his metaphorical redemption film, Link has done very bad things in the past, and he's trying to change his ways, but as life imitates art, as soon as he shows his face, the bad times come a rolling back, and here it's in the shape of her daughter.But she's not the problem, it's the entourage of rage that is following her to expel their wrath, and only daddy can help. The paternal chemistry between Gibson and Moriarty here is the foundation of as to why to film is so brilliant. The first time they meet after so many years just feels so real, the joy and at the same time despair of meeting his daughter again, but in a terrible situation just shows how good of an actor he is.This is Gibson as you remember him in Lethal Weapon, Payback, and even a little Mad Max. A total bada$$ with a twinkle in his eye and always time for a pun, even in the middle of gunfight.So the majority of the film is Link trying to make up,for years of not being there in a very short time, whilst on the run from some very nasty people. Link tries to get help from some of his old 'Links', but they prove to cause more harm than good, especially Michael Parks, who proves here that he is the go to guy for the bizarre.Gibson is seriously back to his best here, it's quick moving, funny at times (though it's not going for the buddy buddy film, it's a totally serious film with a few witty asides) and Link is probably more anti-hero than Porter in Payback.If the old adage, 'they must have one last great performance in them', is anything to go by,then this must be the most relevant film for that.If Gibson never makes another film, he's finished on a wonderfully perfect note.I urge you to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson in the prime of his life!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>no serious spoilers ahead, i promise. but i can see how it could be viewed otherwise. my 1st post here so i'm cautious.i just saw the best movie of the year... for me... so far..."Blood Father." Mel Gibson. 'nuff sed.it's a shoot 'em up. not my usual cup of tea. i prefer films with older women sitting around reminiscing the past... the man that got away, that sort of thing.Horse Hockey!!!plenty of cussing, but at least it felt real &amp; not gratuitous. countering that was the occasional "meaning of life" gabfest.going in i thought it was going to be a another "Taken." that would have been okay... with Mel Gibson. sure, why not? a bit of that, but no, not really. grittier, involving a common man with less than Liam Neeson's "special set of skills." not to give anything away, but Mel channels the Road Warrior in him!like you weren't expecting that while you were standing in line to buy tickets, popcorn &amp; a coke? but don't expect Road Warrior redux. Mel is playing a completely different character. &amp; happily so.it was never cheesy. you won't laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat. NO sleepy parts at all.they packed a lot of movie in 90 minutes! with 30 minutes to go i was wondering how they were going to resolve all this? the last 30 minutes is not the time to go the lobby for any reason. you didn't buy a movie ticket, you bought a ticket to a carnival ride!i promise you... you'll fall in love with Erin Moriarty, she's a future name that everyone will know.&amp; Mel Gibson will get an Oscar nod. it didn't take long for me to forget it was Mel... he was John Link trying to save his long lost daughter.missing for 4 years since she was 14... $30K reward for any information... &amp; she calls him out of the clear blue. "Dad, i'm in serious trouble." "You're knocked up?" "No, much worse. The entire Mexican Cartel is looking for me. They want me dead." not exactly, but you get the idea. i'm not giving anything away you won't surmise in the 1st 5 minutes.&amp; i love the bullets vs cigs moment at the very beginning. point well made.i'd rank this with 2015's "Run All Night" (Liam Neeson). another fave! 2 other films to recommend from 2015 that may have passed under your radar. (Star Wars i loved, but it's not like you didn't hear about it)"The Age of Adaline." the less you know about it the better cuz you run the risk of someone giving it away... like Rosebud. this is a "trust me."i lied. 2014. "Miss Meadows." Katie Holmes plays her oddball character perfectly. destined to be a cult classic.like i said, under the radar. as for the biggies, i loved both "The Revenant" &amp; "The Martian" last year. between the 2, i preferred "The Martian." but then i'm a mechanical engineer. duh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense action meets Intense Parental Bonds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is fantastic and cuts to the heart strings quickly in this film. His portrayal of an ex-biker con and now tattoo artist motivated in life to live his dying day in a shanty end of the road trailer park till he finds his only daughter; a wayward 17 year old, is incredible. Upon his daughter contacting him out of the blue one night, due to a very precarious situation she had put herself in; the staggered action and daughter and father bonding never stops. The depth of this deep rooted narrative in the soul sacrificing love Gibson has for his daughter drives your admiration for his character despite his extremely flawed and criminal past. You find yourself hopeful that he will succeed as he carries you through a chivalrous journey that one could only equate to unquestionable love. Gibson is the pinnacle of a survivor, having experienced it all, and whose relationship with his daughter transcends anything. Mel must have also worked out hard for this movie and it shows. Mel made this film shine and I hope to see more of him. Simply an amazing actor and incredible talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gives it His All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson gives it his all in Blood Father as John Link (sort of sounds like John Wick, eh?), the gristly ex-con living in a trailer and struggling to stay on the wagon. Erin Moriarty also gives a good performance as the young Lydia, John's estranged daughter, who looks him up because she needs help when some real baddies are after her. It's not fair to compare this film to Taken, because John Link is no indestructible super-hero who can kung-fu his way out of any situation. He's just a regular guy who happens to be a bad ass. If you wanted to compare this to a Liam Neesum action film, probably Run All Night would be more appropriate; but in reality, this is sort of a throw back to the low budget action films of the 70s, and it reminded me in tone to films such as Race With the Devil. On the other hand, this isn't pure over the top action either. There's a lot of time spent on the rekindling of the relationship between father and daughter, and all the action is presented within a somewhat realistic text. I thought a little bit more extreme action couldn't have hurt, and that was what I was prepared for early on during the siege of John's trailer, but other than the grand finale at the end, all the action in the middle was quite subdued. But that's okay, because this isn't a John Woo film. It's a film where Mel Gibson gets to remind us why he's a great actor and it's a film that delivers a couple of good life lessons, and, hey, William H. Macy is even thrown in for good measure. I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There should be a sort of action-type story and father-daughter thing... well I dare anyone to spoil the plot of Blood Father in a review. There is nothing to spoil. Characters are put together nearly randomly from tired stereotypes bunched together in non- development story that flows almost irrationally with no consequence worth screen time. Gibson does what he can but he's tired and clueless as you will be by watching his lead role going nowhere. He is supposed to have a back story but there's really not much there or in front of him. They even paid William H. Macy to help him with a support role only to waste that too.Eryn Moriarty has an annoyingly useless character and maybe that is the last nail in the coffin for this product. She over acts in the hope of meaning something but the result is dust in the wind and possibly in the eyes of the viewers. Again there is no personal development and the sheer dumbness of her lines and actions is embarrassing.Direction is mediocre and by the book, below average on actors and tone. Photography is decent, editing unimpressive. This movie is not evil, it's just tired and grumpy. So yeah... pick it up when it's in that large bin at *,99 at your local superstore, you know there is far worse in there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel will take you on a thrill ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7.5/10. When an ex-con, Mel Gibson, gets a phone call from his lost daughter asking for help, things get crazy pretty fast. It is good to see Mel back again, and I hope he keeps doing these little films. The last one, which I loved was Get the Gringo, I would really recommend checking that out. His daughter played by Erin Moriarty is believable and does a good job portraying the rebellious daughter. But the film is all about Mel, who does a powerful and moving job. The action in the film is good and well paced, it takes you on a real thrill ride. Although the plot was a little lacking, this didn't impede the grittiness and fun that I had watching this film. If you are a fan of Mel then you will like this, and I would recommend checking it out. Blood Father #bloodfather</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It looks like Mel Gibson is getting back into it with the upcoming Hacksaw Ridge and Blood Father here.This role is Gibson, through and through. If you have enjoyed his revenge movies of the past like Payback then you'll love this movie. He plays the typical ex-con role and much of this film is paint by numbers, but its done right and with Gibson performance crushing the role, you can't look away for one second of the under 90 minute run time. Did I mention that 90 minutes is the perfect length for an action movie?End of the day, if you like classic Mel in a classic Mel role, just watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong some of the best films I have ever seen are with Mel in it or behind the camera, and this is not one of them. Sure it's OK, but take the draw card Mel Gibson out of this film and you are left with a middle of the road nothing special seen it all before film.Some of the reviews on here must have not seen many films as their over the top score of 9 and higher is a joke! And the 666 times votes that voted 10 are even a bigger joke!Mel must have friends in high places when I saw those 666 10 votes!Back to the film, like I said it's OK, nothing special, easy enough to see where this very thin story line goes to, but no way are the amount of 10 scores/ratings true to this film, just check who has a review on here and check how long the have been a member, or if they are prolific reviewers on here or not.I gave it a very generous 6 out of 10, for old time sake, as I am still a fan of Mel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson's new film Blood Father came out of left field, for me. I had heard nothing of its production nor seen any previews. I watched it today, and was so very pleasantly surprised.The movie follows a pretty basic action movie premise, but tackles some themes you usually don't find in these types of movies. Everything from teen runaways, substance abuse addiction and recovery, suicidal thoughts, and so much more was covered; and despite the wide range of serious issues covered; it never felt bogged down or full of itself.I'd recommend this to any Mel Gibson for sure; as he does a great job in his portrayal of this character. My only real complaints was with the Sicario, it seems idiotic to have a guy with a face tattoo as a Sicario. They are supposed to be ghosts not someone with a feature that anyone would remember if they ever laid eyes on him. But that's of course very minor, and in no way took away from the overall enjoyment of the film.9/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A compact gritty thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Straight forward dialogue, relaxed atmosphere mixed with bullets, Mexican cartel, stone cold truth and dirty survivors. The chemistry between Link (Mel Gibson) and Lydia (Erin Moriarty) is magnificent. Great sense of humour and well written both script and communication. Kirby (William H. Macy) acting as Links sponsor and they work so well together. Always a pleasure watching William H. Macy. He should have gotten more time in this picture.I expected an non-stop shoot 'em up movie. I got a compact and rugged thriller with an authentic feeling running through.¨ One of Mel Gibsons best movies in a long time.Wonderful and a little sad ending. Cut to black, and; "Thank you"... and the gentle music starts. Really good.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Great delivered feeling of the dry, dirty and hot desert environments. Good writing, good acting, good directing. Nice sound (especially with the motorcycles) and a soundtrack that fits. - The actors : The most of us knows that Mel Gibson can act, if pushed and helped with a director. Here, he sets the mood for his character excellent! Rest of the actors is putting themselves into character, very good! Especially Michael Parks (in the role of Preacher) who really digs deep to deliver an original of man and character, and gets that through the screen perfectly. - Entertainment : Oh, yes. An little innovative kind of thriller with the theme of the cartel, drugs, guns and relationships. The dialogue is so very well written and keeps the story and the movie on edge all the time. A relief (and a kind of liberation) to hear and watch how the writer has grasped the talk between prisoners and also people struggles with drugs and alcohol. The length of the movie just thrust itself forward to be even better. Almost the perfect length. - Age : 15. Explicit language, cruelty, blood and violence7,5 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense emotional drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was emotionally intense pretty much from the beginning. But Mel..........Mel is damn awesome!!!! Honestly, the movie is not made by the story, in my opinion. Although there is an intensity to the plot, which is maintained throughout the movie, the real highlight as far as I perceive it is in the passionate, intense acting by Mel Gibson. Drug lords savagery galore, Mel does not let you down. See this movie, and see it in the Cinema. I would have to give the story line a 9 of 10, and the supporting actors are terrific; however, the film gets star rating primarily by the intensity of the characters - Mel has done it again!!! I highly recommend this film for viewers who enjoy the intense drama of drug cartels violence, with Mel playing the hero!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mel Gibson taking up a Taken (Liam Neeson) father role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson has not been starring in major blockbuster hits lately, with his last attempt on a large screen is with ensemble cast in Expendables 3 (2014). Here in this under the table movie, which I can bet many would not have heard of is Blood Father, based on a book of the same name by Peter Craig. The movie has many elements which reminds you of Taken (2008), and some which reminds you of Gibson himself in Lethal Weapon.The Taken (2008) aspect of this movie has Gibson's character Link (an ex-convict tattoo artist) willing to do anything he can based on his skills as a biker gang member and links in prison to protect his daughter. The Lethal Weapon part in this movie has Gibson's character pull out crazy stunts and do crazy things, putting his life in danger.Not dripping down with much of a cast, the movie makes the best of the cast it has, and Gibson's weird beard and weird view of the world were an awesome side attraction when he and his daughter were not trying to get out of the way of flying bullets to get to safety.The movie plot isn't solid, but the directing by Jean-Francois Richet (who was the man behind the camera in the action thriller Assault of Precinct 13 (2005)) was well done and captured my interest as the movie glides gently, to a climatic end.The movie starts with a girl, Lydia buying bullets. She gives the bullets to her boyfriend who leads a crew of men to a house in an attempt to kill the inhabitants. Lydia was asked to prove her loyalty by killing a lady who lived in the house in a panic frenzy she shoots her boyfriend unintentionally and ran away while being chased by his crew.Link was an ex-con now tattoo artist, who has been looking everywhere for his daughter Lydia. She finally contacts him and ask for help to get away from the men trying to kill her.Link gets to her before the men does and tries to help her by keeping her away from the men who she claims are her friends. When the crew storms Link's place and a shoot-out begins which only ended because Link's neighbours came to save his ass, Link and his daughter are now on the run from the goons after them.With Link contacting his own crew to be able to bring this chase to an end without involving the cops.This is a movie I will advise you get the time to see and enjoy.www.lagsreview.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two thumbs up! Mel Gibson (Link) a reforming alcoholic and parolee who loved his daughter Lydia more than his life, gives up everything he worked for to reform just to save Lydia ( Erin Moriarty) from crazy drug leader Jonah's (Diego Luna) wrath. Performance is exceptional as always when we talk about Mel Gibson. He does not need over the top cars exploding and gun fighting to make the movie exciting. Newcomers Erin Moriarty and Diego Luna also did justice to the role performed. William H Macy's short appearance still leaves a good impression just the same. He could have done more. We need movies like this - action pact, fast paced, emotion and drama driven. You will get your money's worth and 10X over seeing the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty simple movie, and a straightforward plot. The film starts with Erin, the daughter, shown pretty much screwed up and she gets herself intertwined with some nasty people, which eventually puts her life in danger. Then we see her father, Mel Gibson, a recovering ex-con and addict, living a wayward and isolated life in the middle of nowhere. So anyway, the troubled daughter shows up, and what wouldn't a father do to help a daughter out, specially when he has not seen her for a long time, and he is a pro in badarsery. Lots of F words, random shootings and deaths, and then the end. Pretty much forgettable movie, but okay for one time watch. Erin was fine as the screwed up daughter. Rated 6/10 just because I love Mel, and seen him after quite a while. Was a treat to see him in action after Lethal Weapon and Get the Gringo.Don't expect anything epic, or even like Taken. Just your out of the box father-daughter action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is essentially Gibson's Taken. It has a very similar plot, but I think this is a superior film. While Taken probably has better action, it's a pretty shallow film in terms of an emotional core or character development. Blood Father works first as a drama rather than an action movie. At the center of the film is a broken man trying to fix his life, and trying to reconnect with his daughter whom he has hurt through his own poor decisions. And that maintains as the film's core throughout the action beats. Director Jean-Francois Richet does a great job pacing the movie, allowing for enough character development in the beginning of the movie so that you can become attached to these characters...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson is still somewhat of a bankable actor but he is now showing his age and also his temper. this was a good idea that was either rushed into production or was poorly directed. the wealth of talented actors like Gibson and W.H Macy are wasted on poor delivery of what could have been solid action scenes. these scenes were wasted on trying to back fill the relationship between Gibson and his mystery daughter, who for the matter suddenly turns up after being unfindable for so many years. the relationship between these two is slightly creepy and untrustworthy. I found the lack of little development of these key characters and also anyone else for that matter left me not really caring about the film or the outcomes. I could not feel any sense of malice from the protagonists of the film who really were just out to kill the daughter but in the end wanted to play some Mexican standoff with Gibson's character. the whole thing I am sorry to say let me a little under whelmed and ripped off. if this is Mel Gibson's comeback movie its going t be a short comeback. I would recommend watching it, its not horrible but Mel maybe should have borrowed that beaver puppet from the movie the beaver, could have used it to communicate his repressed feelings to his gangster daughter. also in closing I would question the time length of this film as I felt it was too short and I wonder how much of this film was left on the cutting room floor. the director should not be afraid to make a longer film is the result is more action, more development of the key characters as people will still hop on the ride and enjoy it far more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a long time since we don't see a good performance by Mel Gibson (The Beaver?? let's not get into that)The movie is very solid, it's a combination between taken and a more psychopathic Edge of Darkness. He really gets me to believe that he loves his daughter, and the chemistry between him and Erin Moriarty, who plays Lydia, it's truly remarkable. Not saying that they deserve an A for the acting, but close enough. Now let's get into the action business, SHALL WE? this guy can still throw a punch and shoot a gun like a bad ass, when he does it, i can't tell how old is he, he still does it like that Martin Riggs in Lethal Weapon ONE, and come on, building up and with the beard and tattoes: THE ULTIMATE BAD ASS. Look out Stallone and Arnie, there's a new old action star back in business (Mr. Bruce "McClane" Willis, you really need a good comeback).Highly recommended, great Mel, Veeery Bloody that Father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A taut thriller with nothing new except Mel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When fathers save daughters (think Liam Neeson thrillers), there will always be blood. In Blood Father, there's more lamenting mistakes that left a 16 year-old Lydia (Erin Moriarity) to drop out of sight for a year while father, Link (Mel Gibson) is miserable over the loss. Meanwhile he keeps in contact with his parole officer.The strength of this film, a modern Western-like fable, is certainly not the plot, which has been told before?she got involved with some bad dealers, and he did some bad things while hooked up with a motorcycle gang (Michael Parks, ever near bikes in movies, is Link's surrogate dad). The real interest is seeing Mel Gibson playing a Mad Max dad with dexterity to remind us of his salad days as an actor.Link is hard and soft, a rounded character Gibson plays well enough for us to care what happens to him. Whatever charm Gibson has seems present in this distraught father who won't let his daughter go once he finds her again.The stereotypes are present such as the very bad, tattooed Mexican drug dealers, and the shoot out that requires hero dad to out fox even the most seasoned outlaw.Hardly a liberal idea anywhere except maybe dad and daughter riding in the back of a truck and wondering if the Mexicans aboard are legal. Beyond ideology, Blood Father is a taut little thriller returning Mel Gibson to front and center.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply not a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does a Mel Gibson movie that is essentially an homage to old Mel Gibson movies end up being as unsatisfying as "Blood Father"? I mean this movie features references to the mad max series and a crazy Mel Gibson performance (think Riggs but less funny). The movie is also pretty well shot. The action scenes are good, and the only really poor moments camera wise are two horribly distracting hand-held "talking" scenes. This all sounds great right?! Well unfortunately between this movies fun scenes are moments that make you want to claw your eyes out. Like Mel Gibson's character's daughter.This "16 year old" who is really probably close to 23 is so fu%*ing stupid she makes my girlfriend look smart, and trust me she isn't. In fact I don't even have a girlfriend, so thanks for reminding me of how lonely I am "Blood Father". Anyways, in the last third of this movie Mel's daughter makes a decision so stupid that it made me completely hate her character and stop caring about her at all. It doesn't help that her actress isn't that great. For most of the movie the father/daughter relationship just feels like an older actor/ younger actress relationship, which is bad to say the least. Don't worry though, this movie still throws in two clichéd " I'm sorry I was there for you" scenes filled with dramatic music just in case the director wasn't sure if you noticed how sad he wanted you to feel.Other problems in this movie include really weak editing, especially in the beginning. This movie makes some really awkward cuts and transitions, and even a 1 second scene where Mel is obviously sped up. This, plus the fact that the stereotypical "b@d@ss" antagonist is probably the worst hit-man in the world who can't shoot the broadside of the barn and who has a shotgun that only leaves a single bullet hole whenever it is shot really really make me dislike this film. This plus the bad CGI blood and really horrible sound mixing all culminate together for a weak and bad 5/10 wouldn't recommend movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always liked Mel Gibson even though the PC police hung him out to dry a few years back. So I was looking forward to this movie. It was okay, but it is no Lethal Weapon, nor Taken (as some have described it). Not that I wanted Blood Father to be copies of those films, but it could have borrowed some better cues from both. To me, the sappiness of Gibson's character subtracts too much from what is supposed to be his grittier side. There's too much of a roller coaster ride between his character's emotions and whining to, "okay, now I'm a badass!" Pick one side or the other, gritty or sappy, but attempting to mix the two is tough. We know titles that have done it well...Lethal Weapon, Taken, The Outlaw Josey Wales, etc. But this film fails at it, much like the writers of TWD's last season attempting to make Rick Grimes this romantic with Michonne while maintaining his near sociopathic edge. Mel still makes a great movie and people, like me, will go to see this because they're fans. But overall there's nothing refreshing nor original about this film. It was good to see Mel back in action, but overall I thought it was run of the mill.</fullReview>

The story was at times full of massive holes that couldn't be overlooked and was mostly formulaic and predictable - it couldn't even be saved by William H Macy in his supporting role although I enjoyed his 5 minutes of camera time . I can only imagine those that gave this movie rave reviews are somehow tied up with it as it is nothing special - Keep your cash and at best, have a look on Netflix or similar.</fullReview>

For 3/4 of the movie, I kept waiting for something really kick in saying to myself hang in there this is a movie with Mel Gibson in it. Its going to happen. You just wait and I waited and waited and for my commitment got very little in return. This movie could have been reduced to a good 20 minutes and at least people would have only criticized how short it was. Instead, the plot, acting and directing just would not come together. In fact, you sort of hope that it just stumbles into making sense and it wont even do that. What is it about wealthy famous powerful people that makes them do these type of things? The only plausible explanation is that Mel wanted to help everyone in this movie make a buck and when they said what about you Mel? Mel responded don't worry, I don't have to do anything here and I come out just fine. If you want to watch a movie, where you keep waiting for something to happen, to kick in and take off so you can say to yourself I am glad I spent this time watching a movie well you wont get that here. What you will get is this review. For those that rated this special or otherwise, If this is what makes you smile, your life will be one long happy journey to be sure as there are quite a bit of these type of movies out there to go around. What is shocking is that Mel did this. Mel, don't do this again and retire like a man. If you want to help others get a start in the movies or make a living, loan them some of the interest from your over 700,000,000 million to a billion dollars. You owe me one more movie here Mel for old time sake....Make it a good one please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess Mel Gibson is broke or something for taking a part in this BS.Actually I stopped watching this BS after a couple of minutes into the movie right after the girl shoots her boyfriend in the beginning..That's when I said.. oh typical BS.. typical "women are innocent.. it's all men's fault" BSthe scene was fake.. after this the whole premise seemed fake and anything after this scene would feel fake as well.. so WHY should i watch it?? no reasoni turned it offI am really tired of all these movies where they can't show women doing "bad" stuff to other women.. but it's always women doing bad stuff to men and it seems that all women in all movies these days are portrayed in some very positive manner.. as if there is no dark side to themi really miss movies like Natural Born Killers or Wild Things or even Wanda Nevada where you could actually see nice really nice female charactersNow days it's all gone... all women characters are fake as hell, completely cheesed out and unreal... even repulsive due to the idiotic characters. The same with men.. actually.. most male character now days are fake as hell as well.. but it's usually only because the male character has to suit the dumb ass story line which has a dumb ass fake female character..You know like this piece of sh-t Mr.Right with Sam Rockwell.. which is completely wasted material suited for 12 year old girls.. but it could have been an actual cool comedy with good dark humor and action. But they pinked it out and it just looks ultra gay and super lame.And they use good actors too.. to lure you in.. Mel Gibson.. Sam Rockwell.. come on.. what??? were they made an offer they couldn't refuse??It's like now days even EVIL female characters are not even evil anymore.. look at that BS Maleficent.. what a pile of trash. Why?? Why are they wasting all the great possibility for women to play cool evil characters?? Is it forbidden for women to be evil in the movies or something?? Why?? Why was it OK for women to play nice evil characters in the 80s or 90s??Remember that hot Evil-Lyn from Masters of the Universe??? What a character or even Alicia Silverstone in Crush or Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct or that masterpiece by Cathy Bates in Misery. There were so many but now days its seems there are none left.It seems that now we have only evil male character all over the place.. but they are not even evil.. they are rather dumb.Where is our Hannibal Lecter after 2000?? There are no evil geniuses on screen any more. Look at all the evil characters.. they are childishly dumb and naive. Take for instance last X-Men Apocalypse. This Apocalypse is more like Ridiculypse with some perversion for a death wish by a few puny half-wits who don't even try. They just kill the strongest Anti-hero in the Universe in like 3 easy steps as if they've just read "How to kill Apocalypse for Dummies"Seriously... this is just pathetic. Stop glorifying women. There should be evil female leads as well as good female leads.. and stop making male "bad guys" look dumb to the point of uncontrollable laughter.Making all these fake ass stories with fake female characters is growing old already. Look at how much money Hollywood is wasting with all these Marry Sue characters and gutless BS. Star Wars 7. Kick-Ass 2. Just to name a few which really blew Major Dick.And stop making all these "ex-bad-ass father comes to save his dumb ass daughter BS".. After Taken(part 1) with Liam Neeson it's just not getting any better.</fullReview>
