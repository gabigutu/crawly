		<shortDescription>Intelligent, witty and biting dark satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film about a teenage beauty pageant. As you might expect; it features plenty of young girls in skimpy outfits, dancing, singing and all that crap. However, unlike a lot of films of the same ilk; here, hidden behind a facade of teen beauty and all the other trademarks of the teen comedy genre, is an intelligently written, witty and very dark satire on the consumer society.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a filmed in the style of a documentary, a la 'This is Spinal Tap' and follows the escapades of a group of contenders in the annual beauty pageant. The contenders are introduced via a very amusing sequence, which sees them tell the audience about themselves. It's very MTV in the way it's done, with all the girls introducing themselves as shallow, fussy, typical teenage girls. After that, the film starts to set its dark tone, with one of the girls being blown up, and is the tone that will be carried throughout the rest of the movie. Some of the humour in this movie is so dark that even I, a fan of very black comedy, couldn't decide whether to laugh at or not; a woman that gets a beer can melted to her hand, an anorexic previous winner, and the pageant winner being blown up on a huge float are all included in this movie. It's lighter and more tongue in cheek moments are also done very well, such as the part in which one of the judge's brothers gets caught in the car door, or a hilarious 'home video' of an explosion.The characters in Drop Dead Gorgeous are all, with the exception of Amber Atkins, disagreeable, shallow and overblown stereotypes. This is one of this movie's main assets; it has the parodying of stereotypical people spot on; we've got an "I'm not a pervert" pervert judge, an insensitive, egotistical head of the richest family in town, the overenthusiastic boyfriend and many other colourful and amusing characters. Some of the lines said by these characters are priceless; stupid, but not overly stupid and you really could imagine people like these saying things like the characters in this film do.The entire cast of this movie excels; it features a lot of small characters and each one plays their part to perfection. The main acting plaudits come for Kirsten Dunst in the starring role of Amber Atkins. Kirsten has the ability to act, and act well and she's also extremely good looking. Many actresses look good and can't act, or vice versa but Kirsten has both abilities, which makes her a very good lady to have in your film. With a few more hits under her belt; Kirsten may well be remembered as the finest actress of her generation. Two other stand out performances come from Kirstie Alley as the former winner of the pageant and mother of one of the contestants; and Ellen Barkin, who brings the characters of Amber's mother to life brilliantly.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film that will be overlooked by many because it's a teen comedy. This is a great injustice; here we have a film that is extremely funny, well acted and actually has something to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never expected to enjoy this movie. In fact, I thought I was going to hate it. "Beauty pageant themed, chick-flick comedy", right? Stupid jokes about hair, dresses, and stuff I couldn't care less about, right? Wrong. It's presented in that faux-documentary (or mockumentary) style that Christopher Guest has perfected. It pokes fun at middle America, small towns, that sort of "redneckish patriotism" we see so often, and of course the way these contestants (and their parents) take themselves WAY too seriously. It also shines as a mostly female comedic sandbox where Allison Janney, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst, Brittany Murphy, and Kirstie Allie can show off their comedic skills (I had no idea that some of them had it in them). All I can say is that it's hilarious. Will Sasso is the greatest "handi-capable" character ever put on film. His "cheerleading" as Kirsten Dunst spells every state in alphabetical order is comedy gold. If you don't laugh...you're dead inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outrageous, deliciously bad-taste classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment front-runner Tammy Curry (Brooke Bushman) is blown to pieces on her sabotaged tractor, it's clear this beauty pageant will be fought tooth and nail. And it ain't gonna be pretty.In the small Midwest community of Mount Rose, Minnesota, the Sarah Rose Miss Teen Princess contest is into the final furlong. But for all the sugar-coated spoutings of world peace and harmony hairspray, it's a question of victory by any means necessary - as a roving documentary film crew discovers.In the Blue Ribbon rhubarb pie corner is Becky Leeman (Richards, rich kid daughter of former winner and rabidly proud officiating beauty pageant President Gladys (Alley). And in the red, trailer-trash corner is morgue make-up artist Amber Atkins (Dunst), championed by her boozy mother Annette (Barkin) and her mother's morally suspect best friend Loretta (Janney).Casting wise it's spot on, as Alley launches with smiley, viper spitefulness into a beacon of single-minded hypocrisy, and is well matched by Richards, even if she looks the least convincing high school teenager since Stockard Channing's Rizzo enrolled in Rydell High. Dunst meanwhile blossoms into a very accomplished actress, and - together with Barkin and Janney - claims most of the prize lines.If there's a weakness it's that the mockumentary approach doesn't always work, and the film drags on a little too long after a seemingly natural conclusion. Still, the dark laughs are consistent, and the parody of middle America's bizarre beauty contest fixation is spiked with some jolting shock tactics - from the nurse-assisted wheelchair dance by the reigning anorexic crown holder to Richards' hilarious (not to mention blasphemous) love song for Jesus - but such blackness never obstructs rooting for Dunst's likable teen. An outrageous, deliciously bad-taste classic.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite bluntly, this film is stupid. However, it's a rare breed, one of those "good" "stupid movies". I've read some reviews criticizing this film for not accurately portraying Minnesota. Some viewers simply don't get it. This movie is supposed to be "stupid". It is not supposed to be some supremely accurate social depiction of small town Minnesota. It is a mockumentary and an intentionally absurd exaggeration. And it works like a charm. If you "get it", this will be one of the funniest movies you'll ever view. The actors are almost, top to bottom, perfect... especially the portrayals of Amber Atkins' mother and aunt, and the Vilmes father and son. I can see how certain viewers would absolutely abhor this seemingly inane, ridiculous film. But it is, truly, a phenomenally clever spoof on a competition many treat as life and death. In fact, it's almost frightening that there's a little more realism in this farce than most would like to admit. This film is simply a fabulous little spectacle.Best line: "You are a good person. Good things happen to good people." "Really?" "No, it's pure bull____, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Wonderful Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen Barkin is the trailer trash mother of Amber (Kirsten Dunst), Kirstie Alley is the homicidally ambitious mother of Becky (Denise Richards) a spoilt rich bitch. They will stop at nothing to make sure their daughters win the Mount Rose beauty pageant, and i mean nothing.The whole movie is made in incredibly bad taste and for that reason alone, a lot of people will hate it; but i found it was very refreshing to see a black comedy of this quality for a change. It's wonderfully scripted and directed, and the cast is simply perfect; everyone in it appears to be relishing the humour in the movie and it shows in their performances.If you like this kind of humour, you will love this, if you don't warm to black comedy then it's best left alone.8/10 Personally i think its great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most smartest and funniest American film since The Producers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a seriously funny film, deeply subversive and a great piece of work. What it's not is a satire on the vacuousness of beauty pageants.DDG aims at the emptiness of our whole materialistic culture and the way we have traded in the more valuable things in life for the pursuit of a perfect self image and will even cash in that perverted, limited objective for a few minutes of fame on TV. Life is a house of cards with hidden truths under every shiny surface.The humour is so dense and the jokes are so profligately thrown around that it occasionally feels like an incarnation of The Simpsons, 54 episodes of which benefited from the efforts of DDG scriptwriter Lona Williams. She may have written your favourite. The performances are no less praiseworthy with outstanding leads and fabulous and memorable minor characters. Look out for the Sheriff. Amongst them all, I'll single out two which I think are pitch perfect, Sam McMurray as the ruthless father in thrall to his wife and daughter and Nora Dunn as the drunken 'has it come to this?' State Pageant organiser. There are lots of others to choose from.Every you time you watch you get something new, enabling you to rejoice further in the fact that half the people who watch it don't get any of it at all. In fact it's so sharp that even people who like this type of thing can get cut to pieces by it. We are, after all, watching ourselves. Mind your fingers . . .Most smartest and funniest American film since The Producers? Yes, it's THAT good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not exactly the most subtle satire, but it works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beauty contests are of all times and for people of all ages. There are all kinds of contests, but they don't always have a very good status (just to give you a few examples: We have Miss Belgium, but also Miss Egg, Miss Grape, Miss Strawberry...) But one thing they all have in common. The girls that participate in it all believe that they are the only ones that deserve to win and their supporters, with their parents on top, are convinced that their girl is the next miracle on two legs. And there aren't too many differences between the different countries. This movie was clearly intended to make fun of the American beauty contests, but it all felt very familiar."Drop Dead Gorgeous" isn't exactly what I would call a subtle satire. They use some standard situations, magnify them by a factor of 1000 and then aim at them with a large cannon so they certainly will not miss their target. Does that mean that the humor isn't any good? No, certainly not. It's sometimes so over-the-top that you will almost certainly have to laugh with it, but it's just not the kind of movie for the people who only like very 'intelligent' comedies. And even though the idea of a 'mockumentary' isn't new, it is done quite well in this movie and in a more or less original way. They make fun of the contestants and their fans in this movie, but don't really spare the TV-crews either. They make for instance fun of their eternal drift to sensation and spectacular news items.In the end this is a nice comedy that may perhaps not be liked by everybody, but that certainly offered some good performances by all the actors. They made the many funny characters look even more ridiculous as what they are in real life (and that's certainly not always easy). The story was good and the entire movie really could have been a lot worse. I liked what I saw and I give this movie a 7/10, maybe even a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film for anyone who hates beauty pageants, and enjoys dark humor. The "mockumentary" aspect was done greatly, and the performances were also great, especially by (the very hot) Kirsten Dunst. I really like films that poke fun at serious topics (like death and mourning), and this one did a great job of it without being completely tasteless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Subversive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a weird blend of "This Is Spinal Tap" and "Fargo" and you will have a fairly good read on 1999's "Drop Dead Gorgeous. There is definitely a Coen Brothers feel to the film, which is done in "mockumentary" style and told from the point of view of a film crew investigating the world of local beauty pageants; specifically the Miss Teen Princess contest in Mount Rose, Minnesota.But it would be a mistake to think that this is just a satire of the beauty pageant world or of folks from Minnesota. The film has much bigger targets, as it pretty much takes on every excess to be found in the competitive culture of modern American. Making it the most subversive comedy since "Dr. Strangelove". It may not have the consistency of Kubrick's masterpiece, but it has a slightly higher comic hit to miss ratio than "Airplane".Former Miss Teen Princess Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) is in charge of the Mount Rose preliminary, a conflict of interest because her daughter Becky (Denise Richards) (a younger version of her mercenary mother) is a leading contender. After murdering her daughter's only real competition, Gladys targets trailer-park girl Amber (Kirsten Dunst), who hopes to use the contest as a means to follow in the footsteps of her idol Diane Sawyer.There are so many different types of humor in "Drop Dead Gorgeous" that almost any viewer will find something amusing. But the degree of amusement will be in direct proportion to your degree of irreverence and "nothing sacred" attitudes. So if you are easily offended or are sense of humor challenged you would do well to stay away from this film. I particularly liked the contestant's dramatic reading from "Soylent Green", and Britney Murphy's line about being conceived because her parents wanted someone who could donate a kidney to her older brother. Although she only has a small part, Murphy pretty much steals every scene in which she appears. The three big parts (Alley, Richards, and Dunst) are played straight (or with parodied straightness) so most of the comedy comes from the supporting cast; most notably Allison Janney as a trailer park neighbor, Will Sasso as a mentally challenged small businessman, Seiko Matsudo as the resentful biological daughter of an Asian couple who dotes on their adopted Caucasian daughter, and Matt Malloy as a contest judge with a not so secret agenda.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really found Drop Dead Gorgeous great!! I've seen it on TV and I found it really hilarious. Humour is very dark and second degree, mocking as much beauty pageants and deep America and the decision ways in small towns as well as the fake values so often praised by mainstream television. Several scenes are incredibly funny (but cannot be described here in order to avoid spoilers).The cast is great (and includes the marvelous Denise Richards as well as a bunch of Young great actresses)and the scenario follows its dark humor to the end of the movie.Definitively a movie to watch, especially if you are open minded and like deep irony and subtle but strong messages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a semi-hilarious mock documentary about a teen beauty contest in Minnesota. Anywhere from hilarious to ridiculous and all points in between. The only thing redeeming is Kirsten Dunst. She knows how to get your pity, concern and loyalty. Ellen Barkin is hardly recognized as Kirsten's drunken mother. Kirstie Alley is pretty darn good as the dirty dealing former beauty queen and mother of the obvious next winner(Denise Richards). Miss Richards' character is beautiful; but spoiled, pampered and a bitch. Not exactly an expose, because the behind the scenes back stabbing is assumed to be part of a beauty pageant. Tongue-in-cheek humor. Nevertheless another vehicle for the talented Miss Dunst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent - A Gem of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). As a mockumentary, it actually deserves an 11 ...Bought it on DVD - can watch it again and again and my admiration for the perfection with which it has been made only grows. Every detail is right on the spot, the actors are fantastic, the script is amazing, and the director hits just the right note ...A biting social commentary if there ever was one, it shows a side of America which people pretend doesn't exist, and that without any exaggeration - it only condenses a lot of things into one story which in reality you probably would not find that close together. One can see that the author knows exactly what she is writing about. I can understand that many people don't like this film - it hits too close to home ... though they'll never admit that this is the reason and cite bad taste or whatever. The miracle for me is that this picture got made at all.Hard-hitting as it is, the film never gets mean - it always stays human and in a detached way almost compassionate towards all its characters. The author is a woman, and I noticed one thing about women as artists: if the're bad, they're bad as any male artist who's bad, but when they're good, they tend to be *exceptionally* good, and often they bring up angles which a man would have never thought of.One thing - I do not think the critique in this film concerns only America: exchange just a few minor cultural details for their continental counterparts and you'll see that here in Europe we have the same types of people who recognize themselves in this movie and consequently hate it, like their cousins overseas ... so finally I think its valid worldwide, wherever people live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is a classic with it's witty and just laugh out loud dialog, it never ceases to impress. this movie is just hilarious all around, and if you ever need a pick-me-up, watch this movie! just thinking about this movie makes me laugh, and i could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. just think about the plot, a small town beauty contest where mysterious things are happening to the contestants. it is t he making for a dark comedy. but then it surprises you, because although it is witty, there are the classic comedy moments that make it a "fall on the floor laughing and crying" movie, that all of us know and love. you have Kirsten Dunst as a trailer trash, diane sawyer loving, tap dancer, who just lights up the screen with her amazing comedic timing. Then you have Ellen Barkins playing her mom, along with Alison Janney, and the two of them work so well together. Brittany Murphy is classic in this movie, it is definitely one of her best. There is never a dull moment in this star-studded parody. I highly recommend it to everyone. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again, and still laugh at it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is a movie worth seeing if you like the twisted black comedy genre at all. Great characters and spot-on acting by Dunst are just two reasons this movie works so well.The story revolves around two young women, their mothers, and their participation in a local beauty contest, and is told in a fake-documentary style that fits surprisingly well.Kirsten Dunst is, as always, perfect for the role, delivering the over-the-top goody-two-shoes behaviour and dialogue with a conviction that's sometimes cause for laughs all on it's own. That's not to say there's not a lot of other sources of fun, I suffered from stomach aches quite a few times, and it was certainly not from something I ate. To give credit where credit is due, I cannot neglect mentioning Ellen Barkin as the mother, she plays her part with great competence. Especially after a certain encounter with a fire-bomb and a beverage can.While I'm not a fan of either Denise Richards or Kirstie Alley, they do an adequate performance in their roles as the rival and her slightly insane mother.In conclusion, I can only tell you to see this movie if you enjoy some good laughs and a quite unique twist on the beauty contest theme.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beauty queen pageants are now an integral part of 20th century vanity, and DDG manages, via a mock documentary, to send them up in the most vicious, yet hysterical way. Ultimately a tale of rich/evil against poor/good, the black humour and satire against white-trash American culture serve to make this one of the funniest films of the year so far. All the main roles are superbly played, most notably perhaps by Ellen Barkin, cast out-of-type as the aging, drunken mother of Kirsten Dunst. My only criticism is that the last 15 minutes of the film was perhaps too laboured and needless. However, this is a minor quibble against a film that is a very unpleasant pleasant surprise!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From my Australian perspective, this movie offered an interesting insight, if somewhat satirical, into the American pagent industry. But it has a good message at the same time - cheating doesn't always get you what you want; and when your dremas seem to disappear, there will always be another way for things to work out. Sure, it was cliche, but at the same time it was so poignant. All the cast members performed well in their roles. But I have to say the shining light was ALLISON JANNEY!!!!! She stole every single scene she was in, she had all the best lines AND she pulled it off with a certain style at the same time, although she was cast as trailer trash.Anyway, highly recommended, a great, fun watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As more than one person has said, this movie definitely divides the viewing public. I come down very firmly on the 'pro' side. This is without doubt one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.Undoubtedly VERY DARK, but if human cruelty, vanity, stupidity and naivety is what makes you laugh, DDG will make you laugh out loud. I've been scratching my head to think of the last time I've laughed out loud at a movie,in vain. This one had me doubled up with laughter. As so often it's the throw away lines which are the best. "They sent my dog to live with a nice family on a farm." "This is the best day since Hanky got acquitted." "My mom had Mrs Lopez sew it." I only discovered DDG by accident on late-night TV, but had to get the DVD the next day. Achingly funny stuff....I only hope middle-America gets the joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was hilarious. Many seem to be put off by the openly stereotypical nature of the movie. Yes, this movie is very politically incorrect. I personally think the writer actually set out to boldly include in her movie as many stereotypes as possible in an effort to so exceed the boundaries of social acceptability that everyone would realize that such is the intention. The movie takes these to such extremes that it is clearly aware of the outrageousness thereof. The thing about this movie is that it doesn't exhibit prejudice against one group...it pretty much targets them all. Poor Caucasians, rich Caucasians, Asians, handicapped, Mexicans, rural Americans, and homosexuals are all stereotyped in this movie (did I leave any out)? I hope that realizing this helps you to see this movie without letting its potentially offensive nature ruin it for you, and instead view it as an opportunity to laugh at a superbly funny satire of everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but too heavy handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have avoided this movie until now, put off by the title, so was pleasantly surprised when I finally watched it. This film has some very funny moments, which could have been funnier had they not been handled in such a heavy handed fashion.Well cast and well acted the psuedo documentary style did tend to pall after a while, but in many ways it was a more telling indictment on American values than the much feted American Beauty. Of the excellent cast, Ellen Barkin stands out as the often zonked out mother of our heroine, who has us rooting for her right from the early scenes.What spoils the movie somewhat is its tendency to drag out some of the funny scenes and to really stretch the imagination that ANYONE could be as bad as some of the "talent show" acts were. The Denise Richards "Jesus" act was ridiculous, not funny (and I don't make this comment from religious bias)and I have to agree with other comments on the totally unnecessary scenes with the anorexic "reigning queen", once again not funny.Apart from these carps, I would recommend this movie as being much deeper in some ways than its subject matter suggests. It is a slightly "sick" but very funny comment on all beauty queen parades and on the burning urge some people have to win at all costs</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the summer 0f 1999, New Line released a slew of movies that failed in the Box Office, but have since become cult classics, Drop Dead Gorgeous, along with Detroit Rock City, and Blast from the Past, are examples of this craze. This movie will have you laughing your head off if you saw the recent movie Juno, simply because this movie while being guiltily satirical, has the feel of an independent film. Alison Janney and Kirstie Alley make this film a real gem to watch, and the budding careers of Kirsten Dunst and Amy Adams will also have you feeling nostalgic, with the Midwest Fargo-like accents in Minessoootaaaaa, you will not be bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop Dead Hilarious!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like a do over, LOL...an extremely hilarious black comedy. This parody on one of America's favorite pastimes, Beauty Pageants, is simply drop dead funny. I laughed so hard I cried, I mean the out loud, knee-slapping, kind of laughing, not the silent chuckle kind. If you enjoyed "Drowning Mona" you will absolutely adore this film. In fact, it is probably even funnier, but I have such a strong affinity for "Drowning..." it's hard for me to say which one I enjoyed more. I can't honestly tell you which character is the funniest, because one laugh is followed by an even bigger one, and it doesn't abate, it keeps on building and building to a raucously hilarious crescendo, like a beautifully constructed piece of classical music. The talent part of the competition is indescribably farcical, so don't miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop dead gorgeous has got to be my favourite mockumentary of all time. This sweet little gem tells the story of a small town in mount rose, Minnesotta. Where Amber Atkins, a lower class girl who lives with her mum in a trailer park, aspires to become like Diane Sawyer and get out of Mount Rose and the Local Teen beauty pageant is "her only ticket outta here" But the rich Gladys Leeman has entered this year and she'll do anything to win.Drop dead gorgeous takes a stab at pretty much anything it comes across and it does it all well. With great performances from everyone involved, this hilarious, dark, yet ultimately heartwarming mockumentary succeeds . go and get this movie out! NOW!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is the little things about this movie that make it so great. It has an unbelievable cast and the little nuances (such as the Upper Midwestern accent} really give this movie its style and humor...the little things like how one of the contestants enjoys a cigarette after a ride on her tractor. If you liked "Fargo" or "Heathers", you are sure to enjoy this one. Each contestant has her own quirk from the one who loves dogs, to the one who wants to bring Sign Language to the entire world. My favorite has got to be the girl adopted by Asian parents. This seems to flash a big spot light on our own social practices, and only their biological daughter seems to see outside the whole pageantry mania. Every other girl in town seems to be under this spell to be in the pageant because it is just what you do if you are from there. Although it is another movie that satires this interesting cultural phenomenon, it does it in a very creative way.</fullReview>

Not your ordinary comedy, much more akin to the humor in Very Bad Things.As good as the whole cast is, Ellen Barkin really steals the show in this movie playing a beer guzzling, trailer park, hairdressing single mother with faults aplenty-but a heart of gold. I own this one, and every time I watch it I find something else that makes me laugh.

Much of the humor actually surprised me, didn't think you could still get away with it: "Tim! Carla, you two don't Jew me down too much on that dinette set, and I'll throw in a hutch for free..."

		<fullReview>If you like 'mocumentaries' this is one of the funniest around. The writing is excellent and just as important, the timing of the jokes really work. In one of the early scenes at the trailer park, the documentary makers are filming the mom and her friend (done hilariously by Allison Janney) and when they notice the cameras, she says, 'Are we on Cops again ?'To me it passes an important test when I can watch this film a numbers of times and still laugh at the girl talking about her 'lucky bolt' and the creepy rival talking about solving world hunger with her mom's apple pie. It really is chock full of hilarious lines that are still quite funny after watching the film a few times over the years.If you liked movies like Best in Show, you will like this a lot. I cant believe this guy hasn't got money to do more projects! Really great comic directing. Compared to some of the telegraphed boring pap that gets made, this is so well done. Similarly, I was disappointed to not find more things written by Lona Williams. Its superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Janney Steals The Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" is an vicious movie that spoofs reality television and beauty contests. Mount Rose, MN is having the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Teen American Beauty Pageant. Among the top contests is rich girl Rebecca Ann Leeman (Denise Richards), whose mother (Wicked Kirstie Alley)is in charge of the pageant, as well as a former winner of the title. On the other side is Amber Atkins (Sweet Kirsten Dunst), whose mother (Ellen Barkin, who is very, VERY funny)wants her daughter to escape small town life. Unfortunately, someone is trying to bump off the competition (Literally!). When you actually find out who is responsible, it comes as no real surprise. The moment takes a twisted turn when a crew from "Cops" comes up on the scene, while the documentary crew is filming!The film is very funny, but it's Allison Janney as Barkin's friend, Loretta, that steals the film ("Do you think a nice cool mint would help if I shoved your head up your ass?!" she screams at a cheery nurse.). Everyone is very funny (Will Sasso screaming "Are we on 'Cops?' is priceless...wish I knew more about his character!) and the film has a pretty good ending to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999): Dir: Michael Patrick Jann / Cast: Kirstie Alley, Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Allison Janney: Hilarious satire of beauty pageants and the deadly act of pride as beautiful faces conceal fuming hatred. The girls assemble in front of cameras and discuss their dreams then go through the pains and gains of preparations. Directed by Michael Patrick Jann who has an eye for comic timing and details the film with colourful sets. Kirstie Alley plays a past winner whose motives that are less than honorable. She represents the mother who pushes her daughter into where she once shined in order to relive the memory but her greed leads to downfall. Her daughter is played by Denise Richards who was given a gun and "aims to win" at the pageant. Kirsten Dunst lives in a trailer park with her mother and works at the local morgue. Dunst and Richards are not just at odds within the competition but also competing for the affections of the same male. Ellen Barkin is hilarious as Dunst's mother with a beer can burned into her hand after their trailer suffers an explosion. Allison Janney is also in top comic form as a friend of Barkin's who helps Dunst get preparation. Even the judges are out to lunch in their total lack of knowledge or experience in these events. It presents the false galore of judging physical beauty resulting in a comedy that is drop dead hilarious. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, this is a "mockumentary" style film. Kirstin is the protagonist, living with her mother (Ellen) in a mobile home. When the documentary team approaches a neighbor asks if they're on "Cops," again. It just gets better and better. It just has layers and layers of crazy, and stupid, and hick, and silly, small-town nonsense wrapped in more and more of the same. Denise Richards is priceless as is Brittany Murphy. From start to finish, it giggle, after chuckle, after out-right guffaws. The mix of small town realities with the desire to escape the anonymity of small town life is what leads all the characters to engage in every part of the "beauty pageant." The pageant has almost nothing to do with the movie plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is filmed in a documentary style (no, thankfully not like the Blair Witch Project, or any of its many imitators) and charts a beauty pageant in small town America.If you're expecting just some simply bitchiness between catty teenage queens, you're probably thinking too low. Kirsty Alley plays the mother of one of the contestants who's determined to do whatever it takes for her daughter (Denise Richards) to win. This, of course, means murdering anyone who she sees as competition.Drop Dead Gorgeous is the epitome of black comedy. There are no jokes - as such - in this film. All the laughter comes from subtle situations and performances which leaves you cringing into your cushion. Also, all the characters are perfect. It's like an ensemble cast of actors and actresses that you probably don't know that well, who all just so happen to play their respected parts perfectly. Special credit must go to Denise Richards who is truly brilliant when she comes to visit the former beauty queen winner in hospital (I'll say no more about that - just classic).Perhaps Drop Dead Gorgeous didn't set the box office alight at its time of release because of its dark subject matter. It does poke fun of America's obsession with parades, self image and all things beautiful. It may even have been a little ahead of its time. Back in 1999 at the film's release, documentary (or should I say 'mockumentary' films?) were not as common as they are today.If you like your films deeply dark, with plenty of subtle humour and great performances then this is the one for you. However, if you're looking for comedy that's a little more 'in your face' (ala American Pie) then Drop Dead Gorgeous is a very different beast indeed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and dark mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were a lot of really good films in the late 90s that came and went un noticed, some found an audience on VHS and others simply slipped away into the weekly rental section and stayed there until DVDs took over, resulting in such films being all but forgotten. It's a shame such a fate befell Drop Dead Gorgeous, a dark, funny and genuinely clever lampooning of the beauty queen pageant done as mockumentary.Drop Dead Gorgeous focuses on a film crew who are making a documentary about a local beauty pageant, interviewing all of the contestants and event organizer Gladys (Kirstie Alley) a former pageant winner who's daughter Rebecca (Denise Richards) is entering this year's pageant. Two things quickly become obvious: that ill fortune is befalling many of the entrants and the only serious contenders and Rebecca and girl-next-door Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst). Amber comes from a trailer trash family (Ellen Barkin plays her mother), and works making up dead bodies at the local funeral home. A young Brittany Murphy and Amy Adams also star.The film is well written, finding a good blend of darkness and humour and always keeping a light tone, which is the key to the film's charm. Some scenes verge on being brilliant and the performances, particularly Kirstie Alley, are all first rate.While the film can be enjoyed on multiple viewings, it's not really the type you watch over and over, which also would have counted against it as an appealing VHS purchase.Fun, dark and well made, Drop Dead Gorgeous is well worth tracking down.</fullReview>

From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The kind of film that successfully proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $10, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated according to my personal tastes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Spoiler flag relates to the politics of the second half of this comment. I find that I have several DVDs about beauty contests and this 1999 is the earliest and also the one with the lowest quality. Except I still find it rather watchable. An empty 'Gracie Lou Freebush' story (Miss Congeniality) that is very easy to watch. But there is more to it than that. The other stories I have are Miss Congeniality (2000) and Little Miss Sunshine (2006) and episode 2-29 of iCarly disk sets, iWas A Pageant Girl (2010). They all have bits of detail in common with DDG, I found it easy to get the impression that they were all looking to this particular story, but the common factor is likely to be elsewhere. These three also have a certain quality. This also has Brittany Murphy in one of the supporting roles, a contestant, and some will want to watch this just because of that. The cast list can please fans of some others, too. It is still an empty story, but that is not because of the cast and not because of lack of fun detail in the script. * The scrambled nature of the people who populate the world of Drop Dead Gorgeous. It reminds me of what is implied by the story of Donnie Darko, my title of Jim Fixed It comes partly from that. There is not a straight parallel between these stories, but they do have common links. The Chumscrubber (2005) talks about the USA. England has some of that disorder, too. October 2012, the UK has been inundated with horror revelations about another Jim. To write anything to support that particular Jim is to risk life and limb, but the bits that I have noticed make me consider him to be a victim, just as much as any of the characters in Donnie or this feature. Some bits I have read are just simple statements of UK Jim's actions, without actual detail of the actions, and these read like horror, the actions of a really bad guy. When if goes into detail, though, I am reminded of the cures that Tony Blair Witch equivalents have always pointed at the weak. The actions of UK Jim remind me of some of the side effects of this sort of popular field sport. Other actions of UK Jim tell me that he used to be considered as deserving, he got kicked in a way that the deserving grade of inept big babies get kicked, hard knock life. The October 2012 stories are people noticing these side effects and now considering him as meriting being kicked in the way that the undeserving get kicked. The UK Jim should be grateful that he is now physically dead. Drop Dead Gorgeous, if it is an empty 'Gracie Lou Freebush' story, I find it to be about the real world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quaint tales from Lake Wobegon have nothing on this pitch black fable from Mt Rose's, Miss Teen Princess Pageant. Captured by a supposed documentary film crew over a course of a few weeks, "Drop Dead Gorgeous's" biting satire and gallows humor hits you like a malfunctioning stage light to the head.Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst) is a modest teenager with the modest goal of performing her dance routine in front of her mother (Ellen Barkin) who was a former beauty queen. Amber's other idol, Dianne Sawyer was also a beauty pageant winner so it only makes sense she's in it to win it. Her chances of taking home the prize however are dimmed at every turn by town rich girl Becky Leeman (Denise Richards) and her overbearing, duplicitous mother, (Kristie Alley) who is also the pageant organizer. As "accidents" start to occur and bodies start to pile up around town it is clear something's rotten in the State of Minnesota.You might gleam that this film pokes a lot of fun at beauty pageants. Well, you'd be right but small town America gets by far the largest skewering as evidenced not only with the exaggerated Midwestern accents and trailer park foolishness but the corruption of the pageant itself. Each character, even the background ones leave an indelible mark, showcasing a parade of farcical character traits and neurosis topped only by their particular "talents". They are of course oblivious to their own faults allowing the film crew to edit their doc with levels upon levels of delicious irony.People who deride this film because it doesn't rise to the level of "Waiting for Guffman" are making a false comparison. "Guffman" uses the mockumentary style as its own genre. The humor stems not from anarchic comedy or exaggerated satire but from the human elements captured' on film. Christopher Guest's characters are more three-dimensional and as a result the satire culminates in warm lighthearted jabs. "Drop Dead Gorgeous" on the other hand is a dark comedy with the mockumentary style serving only as a gimmick. The style isn't fundamentally important to the themes like in "Guffman" yet important to amplify a few key gags.And boy are these gags effective! Nearly every joke hits it mark. Due credit should be given to scribe Lona Williams who also penned and story edited much of the Drew Carrey Show. But I reserve my largest accolades to the cast. Not only do Dunst, Barkin, and Alley deliver but so does the supporting cast which includes Allison Janney Brittany Murphy, Amy Adams, Mindy Sterling and even walk-ons by Adam West and the always funny Nora Dunn.In conclusion, for those who like their satire cold and black, and those who can appreciate a largely female cast "Drop Dead Gorgeous" maybe just the shot in the arm you need.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

The film works as a documentary and explores many social town's aspects, making some funny jokes involving irony and sarcasm that really works. Sometimes the characters seem to be unintentionally funny, but of course that's the purpose of the writers-- make them look as if they weren't trying to be funny. "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is apparently a good choice for all ages, since anyone can understand the simple jokes and critics they make throughout the fast 97 minutes. It's just a shame that this film didn't make it to the mainstream and ended up being forgotten right after it's release... I believe it could have had a better publicity.

		<shortDescription>A satire about beauty pageants even straight guys can enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is an incorrigible satire that overcomes the doomed reputation of its genre to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time. Even when it's well done, satire tends to be more clever than comedic?and it usually isn't that well done in the first place. This movie spectacularly succeeds by not only offering up sharp takes on fairly obvious and easy targets, but also delivering delightful bits of lunacy that will make you laugh at everything from horrific eating disorders to physical mutilation.The story is about a documentary film crew that goes to the small Minnesota town of Mount Rose to cover the local qualifying pageant for the America's Teen Princess competition. They film and interview the pageant organizers, young contestants and their friends and family. The crew is also around to record the deaths and maimings that surround the pageant and always seem to benefit Becky Leeman (Denise Richards), the jaded and two-faced daughter of Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), the pageant organizer, a former pageant winner and a stage mom desperate to relive her past glory. The only real competitor to Becky, at least the only one that luckily remains unharmed, is Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst). She's the good hearted trailer park girl who squeezes in tap dancing practice during her two jobs, one in the school cafeteria and the other putting make up on stiffs in the town funeral parlor.As you might expect, a lot of the satire of Drop Dead Gorgeous is aimed at the natives of Minnesota and the classic tropes of small town life. It's reflected best in some of the pageant contestants. There's the slutty cheerleader (Amy Adams), the drama club chick (Laurie Sinclair), the tomboy of ambiguous sexuality (Brooke Bushman) and the fat girl who loves her dog a little too much (Shannon Nelson). But these filmmakers then compliment those fairly obvious characters with some wonderfully off kilter contestants. One young woman is a future fag hag (Brittany Murphy), another lives her life as a tribute to her deaf mother (Sarah Stewart) and another is a white girl adopted and raised by Japanese parents that are pathetically desperate to assimilate into the good ol' U S of A.By adding bizarre and outrageous bits that are only trying to make you laugh, it makes the satiric and darker outlook of the film go down a lot smoother. Many satires fall into the trap of being self righteous or exploitative but because there's a different and separate layer of comedy running through the story, Drop Dead Gorgeous is just plain hilarious. As you react to the crazy, non-satiric jokes, it becomes easier to appreciate the humor underlying the satire. And since the non-satiric comedy is more over-the-top and potentially offensive than the satiric moments, it never feels like the film is being judgmental about these characters or their dreams.Helping things out is a cast that's as good as the material they're given to work with. Kirsten Dunst and Amy Adams are the highlights, both absolutely adorable and just close enough to being realistic to give their characters that extra oomph. Ellen Barkin is also great as Amber's "rode hard and put away wet" mother and Allison Janney almost steals the show as her outspoken and cougarish trailer park neighbor. The other actors are also very funny and screenwriter Lona Williams gives one of the best performances in the movie without saying a word. Denise Richards is?well, she's Denise Richards. If you've seen her in other films, you know what to expect. She's good looking and makes an effort, but there's just not a lot going on.Drop Dead Gorgeous is a movie about teenage beauty pageants that's so funny and bold, even a lot of high school boys could enjoy it?and I'm talking about heterosexual high school boys. I'm not sure there's any higher praise that I can give.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Equal Opportunity Mocking Well Done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie always makes me laugh until I'm in tears. My favorite comedy of all time The jokes don't spare anybody in this film. It's an equal opportunity mock fest.The mid-west accents, religious lifestyle one ups man-ship, small town politics, class warfare pettiness, the mundane social life highlights of the VFW, hunting season, funeral buffets, town parades where even the clowns are smoking on the job, are hilarious.This movie has well done comedic timing and the jokes keep rolling along whether seeing the previous queen wheelchair dance with help from her anorexia hospital ward nurse, dog barking talent segments, bizarre monologue interpretations to Soylent Green, sign language dance numbers, back stabbing stage moms, to creepy judges, all facets of pageant life is shown. For those who despise warped humor this film is not for you but for viewers who love to never take life too seriously this movie is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally Wicked And Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this again for the first time in a few years. And it is even more hilarious than I remembered. The script is wicked, creating satire that assaults the senses like a baseball bat to the gut. The cast is perfect. Just about everyone delivers an inspired performance, and there are too many to talk about all of them. But the least likely is worth mentioning. Denise Richards is brilliant as a born-to-be beauty queen, the daughter of the local pageant manager, played by Kirstie Alley. Her "talent" performance is the dark highlight of the movie, so ridiculously over-the-top that that you may feel the need to wince. Try not to. If you close your eyes for even a moment, you'll miss something.Brittany Murphy also deserves a special mention. She plays a goofy, good-natured contestant in what would be a throw-away role for many actors. But Murphy brings a charm and commitment that makes it work. And she is rewarded with what I think is the best line in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best mockumentary ever. EVER!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this flick on TV back in 2000, I kind of wandered into it during the first act. At first, I wasn't sure what it was, but as the movie moved forward, I was pulled in and was thoroughly entertained. With the over the top accents, the over the top performances, and the over the top story, it all makes for one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Another killer cast including Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy, a pre-Fat Actress Kirstie Alley, scene stealing Allison Janney, and side-splittingly hilarious Will Sasso. Every time Will Sasso shows up, I just crack up laughing. It works on so many levels, especially as a mockumentary. Where Spinal Tap, probably regarded as the first and best of the genre, is dry and bordering on boring, Drop Dead Gorgeous is fast talking and full of exciting visual gags. And, like The One and The Faculty, it has found a second life on television, which makes it super accessible for everyone. It always makes me laugh no matter how many time I see it.</fullReview>

That aside, I can't tell you how much i enjoyed this movie. It has the bottle to mock the afflicted in a way that I never thought a mainstream US movie could, yet it doesn't seem cruel or malicious. Some great performances from all the leads - I particularly loved Denise Richards as the bitchy a list type who needs to get what she wants. Too many classic moments to list but the dazed and disgusted sound guy's appearance on the local news in the aftermath of the pukefest has to rate pretty highly. One observation though: the character listed as Fry Girl and credited as being Ashley Dylan Bullard - is she actually Denise Richards?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, if you're one of those easily offended people who can't enjoy anything, then I suggest a different movie. You go watch some Meg Ryan romantic comedy, and we'll be over here enjoying ourselves if anyone needs us.This film was pretty funny, if a bit caught up in the mockumentary craze of a couple years ago. Most of the performances were dead on, from the teenage girl crazed pharmacist to Kirstie Alley's "devout Lutheran" mother with her own demons. I particularly enjoyed Mo Gaffney and Nora Dunn (perhaps better known for being on Absolutely Fabulous and SNL, respectively); I wished they'd had more on screen time.For a film that attempted to parody so much: the Midwest, beauty pageants, well-off Christians, middle American small towns, white trash, overachieving teenagers, and all around general BS-ers... I'd say it succeeded.The script was spectacular... the movie is drenched with irony that many people (i.e. Americans) are bound to misunderstand. I understand that if farting or kicks to the nuts aren't involved, it isn't funny, but try to understand situational-verbal humor. You might get it.Cinematically, this movie isn't spectacular, but it isn't meant to be. While this isn't the best movie I've ever seen, nor is it in the top 20, it is one of the movies I've most enjoyed watching.</fullReview>

I especially enjoyed the dance numbers. Kirstie Alley was hilarious in the end when she showed her true character. The last few scenes where she was determined to get revenge were her best throughout the movie, in my opinion. I liked the music also. Altogether, it was an enjoyable flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a surprise. It had "straight to video" loser written on the box (well, not literally), and instead, it proved to be one of my favorites, which I now force all my friends to see (proving that I am a loser -- not the movie). This movie is totally tasteless, wacky, and merciless; in short, totally hysterical. A lot of people thought it was a "Waiting for Guffman" rip-off, but I thought it really used the mockumentary form to its greatest potential and showed originality. Kirsten Dunst is so talented and shows off her comic dead-pan; really enjoyable performances from Brittany Murphy (who already showed off her comic stylings in "Clueless"), Kirsty Alley (who seems to be channelling this role in her new scary PierOne commercials), and even Denise Richards (who knew she could be funny?). Allison Janney can be dry and sarcastic with the best of them and transforms utterly with every role she takes; it's impossible not to love her in this one. A fun ensemble with an excellent script. Definitely an underrated and worth-seeing comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lutherans, Minnesota, and the Quest for Teen Glamour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened upon this film when it was aired on television recently. Having never seen it in the theatre, I watched. I was surprised at how bitingly funny it was, and how there were very few bad performances in the entire film. I don't know why I hadn't watched it earlier, especially living in Minnesota as I do.In the small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota, there is an annual beauty contest: the Sarah Rose Cosmetics American Teen Princess Pageant. The film follows, in a kind-of mockumentary fashion, the nine girls competing in the contest. The two main competitors are Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), an honest trailer-park denizen with dreams of being the next Diane Sawyer, and Rebcca Leeman (Denise Richards), a spoiled brat of a teenager with only the most technical definition of talent. The contest is made that much more complicated by the fact that Rebecca's mother (Kirstie Alley) is the head of the pageant committee and was once crowned Mount Rose Teen Princess herself. There are deaths and explosions and a catfight or two, as well as your daily recommended dose of self-righteous Lutherans, Minnesota accents, and pedophiles.Much of the comedy in the film is dark, and some of it could easily be construed as mean-spirited, especially if you're a Lutheran (there is no shortage of jibes at the prevalence of the conservative Lutheran mindset so commonplace in small-town Minnesota). Kirsten Dunst is always fantastic, and Ellen Barkin is winningly low-brow as her mother. Kirstie Alley is even funnier here than in her psychotic Pier 1 Imports commercials, and Denise Richards is perfectly cast as the marginally-beautiful and personality-deprived princess of Mount Rose (this girl doesn't get acting jobs based on talent). Brittany Murphy, as a fellow contestant, and Allison Janey, as the best friend of Amber's mother, are also hilarious. Watch for great cameo appearances by Mo Gaffney and Nora Dunn, as well.While the mockumentary approach falls apart about half-way through the film and some of the jokes are obvious two minutes before they happen, the film is very funny, with great comedic performances from many actresses not know for comedic roles. If you're from Minnesota, the movie is even funnier and harsher, but that just adds to its charm. An often-overlooked film that deserves a wider audience. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dragged my friends to the theatre when this movie premiered. I don't think many of them understood it, although they laughed at some of the obvious gags. I loved it and watched it over and over again when it aired on the movie channels. That's when my family started watching it too, and also loved it. Finally, they sent it to me for Christmas this year. It's satire, which is not a terribly popular form of humor, unfortunately. Thus this movie isn't for everyone. A lot of people will think this movie is playing political incorrectness for laughs a la There's Something About Mary. It is, but it does it so much better. If you liked Dick, Wag the Dog, or Election, this movie is along the same lines and one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a thing called subtle humor. There's a thing called dark comedy. There's a thing called comedic irony. Drop Dead Gorgeous makes brilliant use of all three of these things. Unfortunately, many people are unable to comprehend or appreciate those comedic devices, and assume this is a dull, unfunny movie. (You know who you are.) They are sadly mistaken.I LOVE the mockumentary format, and I also love noticing the differences between different mockumentary films. The Rutles was meant as more of a direct, obvious spoof, whereas this film is more subtle and intentionally understated. So boo ya to the fools comparing this to the Rutles, because they are VERY different movies.Kirsten Dunst. Kirsten Dunst. Kirsten Dunst. I could say that name over &amp; over again forever. She's one of the best actresses to arise in the last 15 years, she's hotter than anyone YOU know, and she is able to handle any role she takes superbly. This being one of her few comedies, she does a great job with both her comic timing and Minnesotan accent.This is Kristie Alley's best part since "Cheers". (In fact, it very well may be her ONLY good part since "Cheers". The Pier 1 commercials sure ain't gems!) She does great with every aspect of her character here.Denise Richards was either too old for this movie or too young for 'Undercover Brother'. Either way, she's not a very good actress, and it's lucky that her part here was MEANT to look stiff &amp; personality-less. She also can't sing, but that fit in with the character, too. It's surprising that someone that untalented could be the only person qualified for that part.Ellen Barkin plays her role to perfection, overcoming her lack of screen time. I don't know much else about her, so this'll be it for her.Adam West. I'm pleasantly surprised he hasn't gone insane yet from all his appearances as "TV's Batman" or "Classic Batman". His Shatner-esque style has always been more entertaining than the real Shatner, and even though it's just a cameo, he still livens up the screen here. (He also rocked twice on Pete &amp; Pete and once on NewsRadio.)In summation, see this movie, buy this movie, rent this movie, love this movie. Thank you, &amp; have a nice day.</fullReview>

It has a great cast. All the girls were great (esp. Brittany Murphy), and the judges were my favorite-- especially the pervert one and I also like that the writer was one of the judges (though she never said one thing). My only complaint is that the trip to nationals and state dropped off a bit--I wish it would it ended after the local pageant--, but even they were pretty funny. The filmmakers weren't trying to change the world with this one, just provide a few laugh, and I think they succeeded. If your looking for a few laughs give it a look.</fullReview>

The acting is first rate (Alley, Richards and Dunst are brilliant) with great accents. The problems are that a good number of the 'filler' jokes fall flat, too many for it to be the classic it should be and this makes the film start to feel too long towards the end. But throughout the mayhem you can't help but feel sorry for Amber(Dunst) and you really want her to win. Overall a good movie that should have been a classic. 6/10</fullReview>

These people are jealous that they don't possess the creative talent to make a good movie themselves so they channel this anger into writing pernicious reviews. You should watch this movie, if for no other reason than because somewhere there is a malformed little dweeb with a smug, self-satisfied grin writing a negative review of this enjoyable film.The other half of the negative reviews are from people who didn't get the jokes. I actually once saw this movie with two people who did not understand the movie, 90% of it was over their heads. So if you have no sense of humor, don't bother with this film.This is a well-done mockumentary with good acting, good casting, and good writing. i don't need to go into the particulars because the movie will speak for itself when you watch it.For those that want to compare it to every other mockumentary ever made, fine. This Is Spinal Tap is clearly the top of this genre, so to say it's not as good as that is just pointless, what is? The bottom line is it is funny, not that it doesn't stack up to Spinal Tap.Bottom Line: Ignore the naysayers and give this movie a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, is this the best dark comedy ever filmed? YES!!! It is genius for its use of mock-documentary styling and biting social commentary. It opens and exploits the idea that women have to use their beauty to get where they are going. I love the twist ending that allows our heroine to live a dream on accident (and fateful talent). Allison Janney is amazing as always. I really think that she may be the most underappreciated actress living. And I think the greatest testimant to this movie is I own three copies, I quote it constantly, and I have seen it well over 50 times and I still laugh uncontrollably. It is sick. It is twisted. It demands that you "Don't Cry Out Loud". Instead, you laugh out loud. And I can't stop.</fullReview>

It's actually brilliant satire, from the Japanese Family to the Anorexic reigning teen princess, it's all uncomfortable to make a point, in the same vein as The Simpsons. There are also gags which are just plain hilarious, such as Denise Richards' character's talent spot. It's true that the film is about 15 mins too long, although I wouldn't necessarily say that's the last 15, but having said that it bears repeated viewing. The judges interviews in particular are much funnier when you understand more about each contestant. Watch it!!!! If enough people do we might get a decent DVD.</fullReview>

You really have to like this style of movie in order to appreciate it, either that or just have a strong sense of loathing for any sort of beauty pagent. The amazing capacity for all of these actors and actresses to make fun of themselves is just amazing. I think it would be safe to say that one has not truly experienced humility until they have been in a movie like this. Of course Eugene Ley has been making a living out of these sorts of roles since Splash. If you liked this and want to see more, check out Spinal Tap, Best in Show, and Waiting for Guffman. Unfortunately the cast doesn't change much from picture to picture but the characters change enough for it not to get boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure there are the classics such as Airplane, and Hot Shots, and then there is this. A great combination of hot chicks and hilarious jokes. This movie is filled with role on the floor laughter. Put aside the boring plot and predictability and concentrate on the humor. This movie is so funny that you have to watch it twice because you laugh through half of the jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a surprise to me, because it was funny. It went straight to video in the country where I live. This movie should have had theatre premiere. Maybe it went straight to video, because this movie is quite small movie. But anyway the film had black comedy influences and it wasn't jusst your ordinary comedy. The movie was told in documentary style and it worked well. The performances were good and all the cast enjoyed playing their strange characters. Drop Dead Gorgeus isn't perfect movie and it has flaws, especially after when the first pageant in the movie is over; the movie becomes quite boring. (*** stars out of *****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that makes DDG such a pleasant surprise is the *range* of the comedy. As others have pointed out, there's a lot of broad and tasteless humor. Much of that I could take or leave. But there's also a lot of very clever stuff, lines that you have to stop and think about for a second (example: the contestant who's met Greg Louganis). There are some *huge* laughs in this flick, and it never fails to entertain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a pleasure to watch, with a delightful performance from Dunst, and indeed good acting from all of the cast, this is a refreshing change from the crude American Pie's of this world. If you are prepared to appreciate the fantastic, subtle, yet strangely mad comedy that D.D.G excells at, then you should completely satisfied with the permenent warm smile, and constant chuckles that this unique film will provide you with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic! I loved everything about this movie and i dare anyone to tell me that it wasn't just plain funny!It was really kewl to see Kirstie Alley play the overbearing mother determined to make sure that her daughter (Denise Richards) gets the crown in order to get some of her glory... This is done VERY well and i personally think that the characters are excellent in this movie, and Kirsten Durst is incredible in this movie as she usually is...This movie is basically a fun and VERY dark comedy all about popularity and the depths in which some people will sink in order to win a prize. I would like to think as well that it shows that beauty isn't everything also, having a mother prepared to kill for you also helps! Its a very well made and thought out movie, i only wish that other movies would be just as good as this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb satire of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like cynical humor and bitter satire, this is a must-see! The fact that the movie respects no taboo is highly refreshing in today's obsessively 'politically correct' world.This is not a silly comedy. In fact, if you are expecting obvious slapstick humor, you will be very disappointed. It's the absurdity of situations and the brilliant dialogues that distinguish this movie.If you enjoyed 'American Beauty' and the way that movie made clever fun of the American way of life, you will love 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. However, if you do not understand the use of irony and satire, you will not like either movie. The fact that 'Drop Dead Gorgeous' provokes so many angry responses is proof that this is a satire which actually deserves to be called a satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be afraid! Be VERY afraid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Afraid of what? Afraid that there are real people just like the characters portrayed in this movie. And you KNOW that there are!DDG is a complete sendup of beauty pageants. Another "Miss Congeniality" or "Smile" it is NOT! It assails the institution of beauty pageants and after this movie has its way with that institution, one can never again watch any beauty pageant at all without a non-jaundiced eye rooted in DDG.In DDG, the pageant in question is the fictional Miss Teen Princess America and most of the movie revolves around the local qualifier in the made-up town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. Mount Rose: that's also the home (as proclaimed on a billboard entering town) of Freda Hegstrom, Minnesota's oldest living Lutheran. Except that, as we quickly find out, poor Freda has been dead for years. And it's all downhill from there!If one takes the time to read all 192 (or so) of IMDb's "User Comments" on this movie, as I have, one quickly finds that the one thing upon which we can all agree about DDG is that none of us can agree on DDG. You either love it or you hate it with hardly anyone in between on it. The same goes for all the major critics. Why is this? Why do so many people see this movie in so many different lights and from so many different points of view?My answer, which is certainly open to challenge, is that DDG takes no prisoners. None at all. It is an equal opportunity insulter of all things human, no matter how cherished or deeply felt some of those things might happen to be (to some or to many people). DDG's roster of insultees: Minnesotans, Japanese, Christians (generally), Lutherans (specifically), Jews, gun lovers, the overweight, the mentally challenged, Mexicans, anorectics, the rich, trailer trash, alcoholics, African-Americans, male-voyeurs-of-nubile-young-females, hospital candy stripers, beauty pageant contestants (AND the judges AND the pageant organizers AND the contestants' families, ESPECIALLY their moms).....and on and on. And those are just the categories of insultees in this movie that I can remember! If any category of insultable humanity has been omitted from this movie, it is only because there is just so much one can squeeze into any one movie. Is it any wonder that so many people hate this movie?But I'm not one of them. I LOVE this movie! And I say that as a member of more than one of the aforementioned categories of insultees. I consider Lona Williams' screenplay to be brilliant. Ms. Williams does not spare even herself. Not only is she a former beauty pageant contestant, she also has a prominent role in the movie, appearing in many scenes, as one of the pageant's judges. Yet, knowing her own acting ability (apparently), she has given herself not one word of dialogue! And Michael Patrick Jann was the perfect choice for a director to put every word of her ingenious script on the screen in countless subtly-nuanced scenes exactly as Ms. Williams intended them.Just HOW divided are people on DDG? My best friend in the world is a woman who lives in California. She has not seen this movie. But if she WERE to see it, she would hate every minute of it from beginning to end. This is a movie which, once you've seen it, you can't help but have a one-sided opinion of it. And my-sided opinion of it is....."10."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A brilliant spoof-documentary about contestants (and their parents) getting ready for a beauty pageant in a tiny town, which somebody is trying to fix - by killing off the competition. Every character is larger than life, and all played beautifully.It could have been played outright for laughs, but there are some real gems in a fantastic script poking fun at men, women, beauty, the media and the public at large. It's rare to see an American film with such a sophisticated streak of comedy under the surface. Very highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie absolutely rules! One of my all time favorite comedies! The humor and jokes were right on and the cast was terrific! The plot deals with teenage girls (Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy, etc.) competing in a high school beauty pageant in a small Minnesota town. What follows are hilarious situations! Ellen Barkin was sooo funny ("If they ask ya to take your top off, get the money first") and so was Allison Janney! Brittany Murphy also made me laugh, she was soo good in this ("Dad, Peter is gay. GAY!!!"). The character Tess in this movie was pretty funny, the one whose talent was making dog noises. Kirsten plays Amber, the main character, whom you very much want to win. Denise Richards is the ultimate enemy who also wants first place. Kirstie Alley plays her mom ("Your not going to find a back room in our video store!"). My advice: if you like black comedies and semi-gross humor you should see this movie. It is one of my favorites, I must have watched it 50 times!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the crazy accents...the outlandish characters...it all makes "drop dead gorgeous" stand out as cooky fun. At the surface it may look like a 'teen flick' of sorts..as i thought when i first say the trailers...that maybe its geared toward young teen girls...well if you came to these assumptions before seeing the movie...think again, and if you realized upon seeing it that it is actualy clever, satirical, and downright entertaining...give yourself a cookie!Ok but what seriously stuck out about this movie to me? probably the fact that it dosn't need to even tell a joke to make me laugh..the characters..geez..the actors and actresses did a marvelous job of displaying a bizzare over the edge small town usa cast, with the clashing of the rich and the vain, and the trailer park trash ::chuckles:: like the loveable Amber Atkins....this movie is quite funny. Its a good way to spend an hour and a half if you want wacky yet intelligent humour in a movie that dosnt make you think much, just tickles your funny bone with great performances and crazy situation, check it out.As far as all the critical stuff i have heard on this movie, like its too dark or offensive...blah...just...blah. true you may get offended if you are particularly upright...but never does this movie resort to shocking material just for laughs...everything is thought out, and dare i say it again..FUNNY...oh sure the dancing with Jesus scene may offend some of the more deeply religious viewers...but there is nothing derogitory there at all...in fact its my funniest scene in the movie..classic..peace out:)</fullReview>

My wife and friends finally insisted upon renting it one night and let me tell you...So Funny! I cannot begin to tell you that this was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. Kirsten Dunst is excellent in her role as Amber Atkins, a girl who despite a humble and hilarious upbringing wants bigger and better things. Everyone in the cast must have had a ball making this movie! Ellen Barkin as Amber's long-suffering mother is a standout as well as Allison Janney as Loretta, the neighbor you know you would love to have around. Denise Richards does her usual look-at-my-great-body-and-try-not-to-notice-my-hideous-face routine. Does she ever play anything but a bitch? It is called "range". Anyway, guys there is enough flesh and laughs to keep you more than interested, and ladies, it is just soo funny. Run out and rent it now or better yet...buy a copy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I basically chose this in the video store because it was that or let my brother rent another "South Park" video. I like Kirsten Dunst, and I thought "Ah, what the hell", I heard it was "bad" from my friends, and considering they said the same thing about 'American Beauty', I thought it would be terrific.There were a bunch of great lines in the movie and, yes, the accents got on my nerves, but hell, who didn't get annoyed by the accents in 'Fargo' or by Susan's in 'Survivor I'. Allison Janney was terrific in the film, I thought she was great, as well as Dunst. The documentary crew was hilarious, I almost choked on my drink when the doc. crew was slapping palms with the 'COPS' crew.A bunch of people seem to hate this movie with a vengence, and to them I say "Get a life... and a sense of humor". It wasn't meant to be serious, it was meant to make you laugh. Congratulations to the writers, this is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.</fullReview>

Kirsten Dunst really does shine out in this movie and I think she has so much potential to be a big star if she gets a role in a blockbuster movie. The humour in this movie is great and I love the scenes where we see how the cast die and especially my favourite scene where Denise Richards dances with the Jesus doll and you people who thought that was blasphemy, get a life it was just harmless fun.

		<shortDescription>Almost very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ill make it clear straight away, I enjoyed this film a lot. Its a good attempt at making a very black comedy in a Spinal Tap stlye documentary style, and nearly succeeds.There are loads of very funny and often surprisingly subtle moments, and the depiction of the town as a whole has an almost Kurt Vonnegut feel to it. Many of the supporting characters are hilarious, for instance "John Dough", who isnt interested in looking at young girls, honest.However, it neither succeeds in either its mockumentary or black comedy form, too often defaulting to an ordianry teen comedy movie style. The actors, especially Alley, overact far too much to carry it off succesfully. What made Spinal Tap and its ilk so successful was the deadpan way in which it was played.And now my real problem with the film. Theres not much I find distasteful, the Jesus dance was a highlight of the film for me, but I thought the way the anorexic former winner was shown was just sick and offensive. Whoever wrote it clearly has no understanding of anorexia or its effects (or causes) at all. It really is quite pathetic and spoils the whole movie.</fullReview>

Waiting for Gufman, Spinal Tap, Real Life, all hilarious films, so I was a little interested, but 45 seconds in I knew that I had been robbed. It had neither the Docu feel nor the candid effect that occurs in a documentary, or a mockumentary for that matter. It was flat out ACTED! There were some clever lines, trailer parks and life are amusing, no doubt. The script was a little silly, not funny, silly.I don't know, maybe I'm a little picky, but if your gonna say your a "mockumentary", MOCK! If your advertise as a horror film, SCARE!

		<fullReview>I personally didn't know what this movie was about before I watched it so it was a pleasant surprise to see Kirsten Dunst as the lead character. The only flaw in this movie is that Denise Richards is just way too old to play a teenage girl... and after playing Christmas Jones on 007, yeah that sure makes sense. But this movie is a refreshing film. Not typical slapstick comedy. Would it be appropriate to call it intelligent comedy. I mean, every scene is full so subtle comedy that one has to have a pretty good understanding of things to get it anyway. If you are sick of all of that middle America "bad taste" comedy then go for this comedy because it is not that boring old standard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly well-made film...with a stellar cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the first, and last, time you'll ever hear the words "stellar cast" to describe a feature film starring Kristie Alley. There. Now that I got the Kristie Alley cheap shot out of the way, I can accurately review this film.Without a doubt, the best kept secret of 1999. It came out with little hype, and to my recollection, made little noise at the box office. Still, the film is witty, post-modern, truthful, and full of satire. The director takes you behind the scenes of Nowhere, USA beauty pageants, and the jealousy contained therein. One of the most beautiful and unique aspects of the film is that it's shot documentary style. We are given the "honest" opinion of the director, and what he sees. And what he sees very well may be the truth...magnified to the tenth degree.Kristen Dunst is wonderfully cast as the sweet innocent girl (like most other Dunst roles) who comes from a poor family, and aspires to be the greatest of all beauty queens. On the other end of the spectrum, we have Denise Richards thrown in as a wealthy snob who feels threatened by the innocent girl, and along with her mom (Kristie Alley) tries to off her any way she can. I couldn't think of two Hollywood sex bombs better suited to play these opposites. Throw in Ellen Barkin as Dunst's mom (who gets a beer can fused to her hand after a nasty explosion) and it makes up the incredible core cast for the film.Something about this movie just draws me to it. Could be anything from the colourful sets, to the music by Mark Mothersbaugh (from DEVO!), or the creative mock-u-mentary style. But in all honesty, it's the casting. Everyone played superior roles, and special mention should be given to Mike McShane and Will Sasso, who played the large father and son team of Harold and Hank Vilmes. Incredibly hilarious stuff. See this film to discover a fairly well kept secret of Hollywood.</fullReview>

Denise Richards is the "satan" of the movie along with her mom "Kirstie Alley"- a hilarious dance with jesus defies the funniest scene in a low-budget comedy i've seen for awhile- there are many scenes like that.

		<fullReview>Very enjoyable, if you have any taste for satire. The target is teen beauty pageants, and beyond that, small-town life, where such pageants are a BIG DEAL.This was an ensemble piece, with all hands performing admirably. Everyone seemed to have the Minnesota Swedish accent down. Especially noteworthy in this regard were Kirstie Alley and Kirsten Dunst. (After seeing THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, I can say that Ms Dunst is very talented) The satire is somewhat broad but effective. There are several laugh-out-loud scenes, but others more subtle. And some are EXPLOSIVE.The movie should be watched at least twice to catch everything. In some scenes, the stuff going on in the background is hilarious. And Ellen Birkin reveals a real comic gift, as does Allison Janney. And Kirstie Alley is outstanding as the mother trying to recreate her past in her daughter.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous looked like a clone of She's All That - which I didn't enjoy at all. But, it was not a clone of any movie, this film is extremely original and unique.Welcome to the annual Mount Rose America Teen Princess Pageant. Tonight, Ladies and Gentleman, you will witness that best that America has to offer in young women: a backstabbing bitch, a sweet, young girl and a bunch of talentless wonders with only thing on their minds - and that isn't fair play! Yes, its all-out war on the streets of Mount Rose, and unlike some of the girls, it ain't pretty! This is one wild competition, complete with slander, murder, theft, bribery and arson. The cast all enjoy themselves alot - Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards are particularly watchable as the two prettiest girls in the pageant, battling for the gold. Kirstie Alley and Ellen Barkin steal the show part-time as the two witchy mothers who desperately want their daughters to succeed. The screenplay, written respectively by Lona Williams, really takes a swipe at beauty pageants, which needed to be done desperately in the film industry. The only place where Drop Dead Gorgeous falls apart is the fact that it takes to long to get to the pageant, and when it does, it is rushed, making the last 25 minutes quite disappointing. Still, you'll be laughing at the continous side-splittingly funny jokes.An enjoyable film for a Friday night.I rate Drop Dead Gorgeous 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really good. At first I didn't want to see it, I thought it was just a comedy about a girl who we wants to win a beauty pageant, succeeds, and falls in love. You know, the usual. But I found out it was darker than that, and eventually got around to watching it, and I loved it.It's a mockumentary about a beauty pageant in a fictional small town in Minnesota laced with murder, bribery and blackmail. Hilarity ensues! Hilarious one liners, great performances all around, especially by Allison Janney. Denise Richards, Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin and even though I usually don't like her, Kirstey Alley was great too. Minor roles are also played well, one of my favourites being the woman from Austin Powers.I can see how some people are offended by this, as it tackles some tough issues, so if you're easily offended don't see this. Also, I don't think this movie is anti-Minnesota. It's set in a fictional small town, and not all characters are looked down on anyway.My only gripe about this movie, is that it doesn't always feel like a documentary, as it is supposed to be. Watch especially in Amber's tap performance, the crew would have needed about 5 cameras to film this sequence, when it seems they only have one or maybe two.But that's only a minor concern in what is a hilarious film.</fullReview>

The performances were terrific, Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, Kirsten Dunst and Mindy Sterling is one impressive cast, and the smaller roles are also played extremely well. The story line was silly, but funny and Kirstie Alley's role was hilarious, as was Ellen Barkin's. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. And remember girls, play nice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I misjudged this film at first, being taken offguard by it's offbeat and strange humour. Subsequent viewings revealed a very John Waters like sick humour, uneven, sometimes offensive, sometimes brilliant. I love the scene of Kirsten Dunst tapdancing among the cadavers at the morgue.This film also features another young beauty, Denise Richards. She reminds me of the character Amber von Tussle in "Hairspray" who was also coached by her parents (Debbie Harry and Sonny Bono).</fullReview>

I rented it, but to tell you the plain truth I didn't really like it all that much the first time but then I decided to give it another go and I'm extremely glad I decided to do that! I thought this film was amazing. It had the comedy and the drama and the darkness that makes a film great! I definitely thought that Allison Janney did an awesome job as Loretta! She cracked me up with her one-liners and her sense of humor, especially her slutty, white-trash appeal she was going for! I was amazed that Kirsten Dunst actually did a good job portraying Amber Atkins, she was a lovable, and sweet teenage girl who can relate to everyone at some point in our lives. She always looked on the bright side of everything, I loved it! Well maybe her next character could be a good one! I think you will also enjoy the whole mock-documentary thing they have going in the film! I also think you'll get a kick out of Kirsten Dunst, Kirstie Alley, Allison Janney, and Ellen Barkin's northern accent! It's a trip! I definitely give this movie 10/10 stars!!! You must see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kirstie Alley is utterly hysterical in this satire about beauty pageants. Alley plays Gladys Leeman a beauty pagent has-been that is running the 1995 Sara Rose American Teen Princess Beauty Pagent for Mount Rose, Minnesota. Alley's phony daughter, Rebecca (Denise Richards [hysterical]) is competing in the pagent along with Amber Atkins (Kristen Dunst) and other girls. Dunst definitely has more talent than Richards and the movie is absolutely hysterical on showing what is happening up to the pagent night. Many hysterical scenes are within this movie and by far this was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Watch for the funniest scene where Richards dances with Jesus on a crucifix.Alley is hysterical as the Mount Rose Beauty Pageant commander with her country accents. Ellen Barkin is hysterical as Kirsten Dunst's mother and the melted beer can attached to her hand. Denise Richards is hysterical as Alley's daughter playing the phony, Christian girl. Allison Janney (my god she can act...she was awesome in "American Beauty" as Ricky's mother too) plays Barkin's hysterical friend with her great one-liners, and Kirsten Dunst was hysterical as the intelligent, Beauty Pageant, "trailer trash" tenant. The movie was hysterical! SEE IT!!!!!!!!My Score...****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous, a movie about Beauty Pageants, is drop dead hilarious. DDG is not for the weak of heart, and not for the politcally correct. DDG manages to fixate its humor on white trash, disabled (the mentally handicapped, people with eating disorders), and Minnesotan's in general. The cast hit a high note with their uncanny accents. Especially good were Allison Janney, and Ellen Barkin. A great black comedy, with a few faults, DDG is truly funny. Let go of your inhibitions and soon you will be laughing at trailer park trash, anorexia and retards, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comedy with (Vaseline-Coated) Teeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Election or Spinal Tap, chances are you'll enjoy this dark comedy about a small town's third rate beauty pageant, which has virtually no redeeming characteristics except for a biting, straight-faced humor that spares no targets and takes no prisoners. Kirsten Dunbst and Denise Richards play the two top contenders for thew crown, the first a trailer trash near-Pollyanna and the second an amoral predator whose only saving grace is that she's not quite as bad as her mother, played with gusto by Kirstie Alley.I had seen previews for the film which did not do it justice, making it seem like just another riff on She's All That or Cruel Intentions, but it is so much more. If you ever saw Michael Ritchie's Smile, this is its bastard child. I was hooting and chuckling uneasily throughout, as the filmmakers take a jaundiced view of a small Minnesota town and its inhabitants' obsession with winning a prize that is virtually worthless. Filmed in a pseudo-documentary style, it is full of surprises and telling details. Having just made its cable debut, it will now get a shot at the audience it never got in theatres.If you don't have the right sense of humor, Drop Dead Gorgeous will doubtless offend you somewhere along the line, especially if you're from Minnesota (although the Fargo-style accents are far more muted here), or if you're gay, deaf, Jewish. Japanese or suffering from Down's Syndrome. And this is not a good movie to see if you're trying to quit smoking 00 the nicotine consumption in this film is enough to make Jeffrey Wigand pick up the habit again. But if you're the kind of movie fan who thinks "This is sick, twisted and wrong" with a smile on your lips, then by all means check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, a comic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those may be somewhat strong words with which to describe this movie, nevertheless "Drop Dead Gorgeous" struck me as one of the best-produced comedies of the decade.Why? With all the "American Pie" and "Road Trip"-style movies that have become popular again, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is a step in another direction. It combines the irreverent simplicity of "American Beauty" with the exact documentary style of "Hearts and Minds." It doesn't bombard you with multiple sexual overtones, although that's what you might expect. It also benefits from extremely strong performances.There are "holes" in the script (for example, Gladys Leeman, Kirstie Alley's character, would have been thirty-four through the movie), but I see these flaws in reality as really excellent messages. Watching it a second time, the script shows out and uncovers its very deep messages--and they aren't just about the good vs. evil, white trash theme that recurs at several points.Despite all my comments on the structure of the movie, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is still a funny picture to watch, without relying too much on sex, and is every bit the smart satire I hoped it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh-out-loud Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps not being an American myself, I can find it easier to laugh at the image of 'stupid foreigners' more than Americans might themselves; certainly, Americans are not particularly known for their self-deprecating nature. Therefore, I found this black comedy very amusing indeed and well worth an hour and three-quarters of my time.The humour works very well, and is extreme in its parodies of the lengths that people will go to to win, even in such a pathetic contest as a beauty pageant. Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) is the super-bitch mother of Becky (Denise Richards), her perfect sugar-princess daughter. The richest family in a small town, Gladys is desperate that her daughter should win the beauty contest as she had done herself years before. However, one other competitor stands in Becky's way: Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), a poor but talented trailer-park resident, stands a chance of beating her to the title. A series of bizarre deaths follows, and so foul play becomes a possibility.That anyone could really find this offensive or even blasphemous surprises me enormously - perverse gun laws, invocation of religion for personal gain, greed and superficiality are all surely legitimate targets, and the film hits them right on the head. It is moral hypocrisy which is satirised, not beliefs themselves.The mock-umentary style works well, with shaky hand-held camera effects, and allows the back-chat and scheming to be shown clearly, rather than just the outwardly positive image the subjects would wish to otherwise portray.While some might (with good reason) criticise the ending as rushed and unnecessary, it does at least tie up the story properly with the result the audience hopes for, and doesn't spoil the effect too much.All in all, good fun, and don't be offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politically incorrect and proud of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one line summary essentially says it all. The movie is a great satire of rural American life. Does it make a good comparison? I can't say for sure since I am not American and I am not from a small town. I'm guessing that it's personification of rural Americans is definitely over-the-top. Nevertheless, isn't that what a satire is?This movie is essentially a mock documentary about the mother of a beauty pageant contestant in small town America going a little, and that's an understatement, overboard in making her daughter win the pageant over the other contestants. This movie is politically incorrect. Many jokes are wrong. But this mockumentary would be boring if it was politically correct. I do not consider myself to have a dark sense of humor. However, I couldn't help but laugh when the movie pointed fingers at religion, anorexia and gun-control. It is wrong to laugh, but in many ways, they are not completely imagining. Some of those things are true. Yes, they did exaggerate, but it is the intention, it is a caricature. This movie is very funny and it's open mindedness is it's virtue. Strong acting by most of the actors, including Ellen Barkin and Kirsten Dunst, who is simply adorable. I still cannot however stand Denise Richards' acting abilities, though I admit her limited-scope is perfect in this movie.I noticed many people were offended by this movie. That's too bad. If the world is unable to stand back and laugh at themselves, the world would never evolve. It seems to be the problem in many offended peoples' comments. Being a Canadian, the American cinema industry (Hollywood) has taken many cheap shots at Canada (e.g. South Park's Blame Canada? Eh? :) ). But, at the place of getting all piped up and screaming "Oh My God!?!", most of us think it's quite funny. They are very exaggerated, but often true. And since I'm on the subject, this movie does not denigrate religion. It merely points outshow the ones who claim to be religious are often contradictory. How could so many consider themselves religion-abiding citizens when America is a country that lacks practically any form of gun-control, where the NRA forms a POWERFUL lobby group and has a LOT of support, and where intolerance (racism(admit it still exists!), homophobia) is still often seen and worse, often accepted? Don't the citizens form the country, or is it the other way around?Watch this movie if you are ready to laugh at yourself and other people's misfortunes. It is light and funny, and not to be taken too seriously. A definite sleeper hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. So it's not "Waiting For Guffman." No movie will ever be Guffman and I also doubt than any director will ever make a better mockumentary than Christopher Guest can. So leave that at the door when you see this movie. "Drop Dead Gorgeous," while its documentary-style is not as authentic as Guffman's, is probably just as funny (but in a different way). I saw it in theaters (there were 6 people there) and my friends and I LOVED IT. We laughed out loud on many occasions. Sure, the humor is offensive to many, but that's the point. Too many movies want to be cutting edge and risky, but are afraid to go all the way. "Drop Dead Gorgeous," makes no apologies for anything, and doesn't sugarcoat the material. That's what makes it so wonderful.Of course, there are also some amazing performances, most notably by Kirstie Alley (who is so over-the-top, especially near the end), Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Brittany Murphy, Nora Dunn (in a brief role towards the end), Matt Malloy (he was the nerdy one in "In The Company of Men") and the endlessly versatile Allison Janney: she's been loud and humorous in this and "The Object of My Affection," a key supporting character in "The Ice Storm," (she hosted the key party), and was devastatingly quiet as Col. Fitts's wife in "American Beauty." Keep giving her good material!Back to this film - there is no need to be offended if you truly think about how silly everything is. I usually love black comedies, but for the darkness (I normally don't find much true humor in them). Here, though, I laughed more than usual. I won't reveal too much, but the scene involving the lip-synched "Don't Cry Out Loud," had me rolling on the floor. As did many other scenes. If you enjoy a good black comedy (and agree that many Americans are quite hypocritical), then you will LOVE this movie. It's a groundbreaking masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop Dead Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first started watching Drop Dead Gorgeous, I was unsure if I was going to see a hidden gem or a terrible movie. I ended up finding what I consider to be the funniest movie of 1999. Every time I go back and watch it I notice a little something extra in the background or a line that may fly right by you the first time you see the movie. For me I found these lines the second time I saw the movie and I have loved it since then. Using shock, dark humor, and political incorrectness, the movie stuns you while making you chuckle inside, afraid that if your laugh might offend someone who took the movie seriously. This movie is in no way for the easily offended, but if you look past the crude jokes, you see a superb movie with some hilarious lines (watch Will Sasso as "Hank" for some very funny moments). I strongly recommend Drop Dead Gorgeous.</fullReview>

And you know the truth? Drop Dead Gorgeous was 10 times better. I have to be honest, I didn't expect much from this film, which maybe explains the surprise. I don't like Kirstie Alley, or Ellen Barkin. But the younger cast makes this film worth while. Kirstin Dunst is great! Denise Richards is hot as always. And the remainder of young contestants are perfect. Many of the supporting cast is hilarious as well. Drop Dead Gorgeous is great for a laugh. I also can't help compare it to more successful dark comedies like Rushmore and Election, and believe it or not, this is darker, and funnier. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drop-Dead Great!:)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who boycotts this film, writing it off as an attack on Christianity, is missing the most obvious reason for the movie: entertainment. And that's exactly what it delivered. It's a satirical parody of today's obsession with teen beauty, perfection, and the quest to win at all costs.Kirsten Dunst delivers an exquisite performance as Amber - the sweet, all-american, good-girl who has to put up with ongoing threats, insults, and steely glares from Denise Richards character, Becky Leeman. Kirstie Alley plays the part of a slightly deranged, psychotic mother, to par. Add in performances from Ellen Barkin, as Amber's mother, and supporting characters like Brittany Murphy - and you have a hilarious menagerie of off the wall, slightly exaggerated characters. It's worth seeing just to hear Kirsten Dunst talk in that stereotypical accent. I highly recommend it for those who don't get offended by dark humor. Great satire of the 'American Dream.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat funny, weird movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess if I had to say if I liked or disliked this movie, I'd say I liked it. I don't really have an opinion one way or the other. I mean, it was about 45 minutes too long, but Kirstie Alley is always a treat. I really liked Kirsten Dunst, too. I don't think men would enjoy it at all. It is basically a mockumentary of a teen beauty pageant. The funniest moment is when the town idiot is behind his brother (a pageant judge) asking repeatedly, "Are we on COPS? Are we on COPS?" Ellen Barkin is also very good in it. If there's nothing else to rent and nothing on TV, give it a try. It's a good one to watch while playing a board game or folding laundry. You don't have to really WATCH it to get it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a moral but is otherwise STUPID</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, I believed from the previews, was supposed to be about pushy, competitive mothers and their equally competitive daughters who participate in beauty pageants. (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) Drop Dead Gorgeous looked like it had potential, but it didn't live up to it. Kirstie Alley's character Gladys Leeman goes to such extreme lengths to ensure that her daughter Becky (Denise Richards - beauty queen of all beauties) wins their hometown Miss Teen American Princess pageant, a fraudulent, crooked pageant sponsored by a cosmetics company that would begin with a local town pageant, lead to a state pageant and end with the national pageant. I will spoil it here, so don't read on if you want to see it. It's the part that makes the film unfunny. Gladys Leeman goes so far as to even kill contestants off to limit the competition for her snotty, shallow daughter Becky. Her most hated object is, of course, the sweet, kind, considerate girl who grew up in a trailer park - Amber Atkins, who dreams of being an anchorwoman and is the only character in the entire picture with a good head on her shoulders. The one moral that Gladys' hatred of Amber (and murder of the other girls) teaches is how damaging envy can be and how it makes people do evil things. Okay, that's the only good part. The bad part is that the humor just wasn't funny, and in some parts the plot was beginning to stray from its main point. There would be too much emphasis on one joke. And, the ending (SPOILER AHEAD) was downright offensive. Yes, Denise Richards' character was a super bitch, but it wasn't funny the way they killed her off (an accidental flame set to the gasoline that filled the float on which she was standing). I just didn't think it was funny to see someone die, both Becky and the girls her mother killed. And what is worse is that Amber doesn't turn out to be that sweet after all. When she gets to the state pageant, she does something not deadly but nonetheless dishonorable to get the crown. She pulls a nasty prank on all the other contestants. No sympathetic characters, but a lot of stereotypes! No wonder my local paper gave it the worst review they could give.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor attempt at a mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie last week on the strength of the mockumentary theme. What a disappointment.With the likes of This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman to contend with, Drop Dead Gorgeous brings nothing new to the table. It's very difficult to like any of the characters, (although Kirsten Dunst is respectable) and the acting - or whatever you want to call it - makes you feel sorry for those involved. I cringed my way through the attempted humor.Leave mockumentaries in the hands of those who are capable - namely Christopher Guest. If he didn't invent the genre, he certainly perfected it. Watch Waiting for Guffman, then follow it up with Drop Dead Gorgeous. You'll see what I mean.(Okay, I'm a Christopher Guest fan...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say I was pleasantly surprised is a massive understatement. I found myself frequently laughing out loud, and the few sections I could have done without passed quickly. It was worth the price of a rental just to hear Kirsten Dunst explain her acceptance of her father's disappearance. To those who feel the movie was an attack on Christianity, think again. In my mind, the movie was making fun of those who would cynically claim to be religious in order to get ahead, while all the time, their actions clearly demonstrate their lack of sincerity. These characters were NOT meant to portray religious people, but rather pretenders using religion for their own purposes. All in all, Drop Dead Gorgeous is a fun way to spend an hour and half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an attack on Christianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was not an attack on Christianity, it was an attack on good taste. There were jokes which were purposely off-color, and that's fine in small doses, but they kept milking them to the point it wasn't funny anymore. For example, the past beauty queen winner being annorexic. If they stopped after showing her in the hospital the first time, it would have been funny, but no they had to constantly parade the sick and weak looking girl around through the rest of the movie thereby "making fun" of people with eating disorders. I didn't find that funny at all, and quite distasteful.My biggest problem with the movie was that most of the jokes were just not very funny. The idea for the movie was pretty good though, just didn't deliver very well.</fullReview>

With no indication in the movie to the former, I guess the latter. Otherwise, I love over-the-top satire, and this was one of them.

		<shortDescription>Wicked Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You remember satire, don't you? Beauty pageants may be too easy to satirize, but this still drop dead hilarious! I do agree with Roger Ebert (Who gave this wicked comedy **) on one thing: This story perhaps would be funnier as a novel, considering some of the gags are funnier as concepts rather than images, but I won't fuss over something like that. Perhaps one thing that won me over was the black humor that handles beauty contests the same way DR STRANGELOVE handled nuclear war. I must compliment the director: The idea of making it a mocu-mentary made it twice as funny as it would have been otherwise. The plot considers the 50th anniversary of the Sarah Rose Cosmetics and it is documented. In Mount Rose, Minnesota, a number of girls vie for role of Miss Mt. Rose. Among these are Denise Richards (A large cut above her role in TWINE!) and Kirsten Dunst (Dig her!). Beauty pageants are murder, literally! As the contest approaches, some people turn up dead. Don't worry, this isn't graphic like in IDLE HANDS. Rather, it's campy. The jokes and everything are right on target and the target is given the jabs it deserves. Plus, acting on everyone's behalf is top-notch! Kudos!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully wicked - fall in love to Kirsten Dunst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another true masterpiece with Kirsten Dunst. Her last one, Strike, is still my absolute favorite of 1999 (but for americans, its a movie of 1998).Unlike almost any other movie, this one isn't filmed using an absolute standpoint, but is designed as if it's a "real" documentation of a camera team, plus some material filmed by other camera teams, and by the police. I liked this style very much, it added magic and realism to the movie, including the fact that the camera people became actors when they interviewed the actors or talked with another camera team, and the actors, if they recognize the camera, interact with it.It's basic story is about a beauty competition where some girls are too ambitious and use every weapon they could get, including murder. This sounded boring in my ears, I only watched the movie because of the stars (I simply trust people which made good movies in the past), and was of course very happy about that afterwards, because, as I already stated, this is an absolute masterpiece, with perfect acting, one wonderful scene after the other, full of black humor, full of parodies about the typical craziness of americans (for example, their love to weapons), full of especially crazy americans and last not least - prepare to watch the ugliest, most abnormal, kinkiest, most one-dimensional Denise Richards you're ever seen, and also the most intelligent, most gorgeous angel called Kirsten Dunst you can imagine. Or even can't. In complete harmony with their roles. Whow ! That's art, that's acting ! During the later movie, you would take any oath that Miss Dunst is the most beautiful woman of the world, even if you're not one of those people which would swear that at any time (I wouldn't).If you hated movies such as "There's something about Mary" or "The opposite of sex", don't watch this one. Its also full of deep, nay deepest black humor, especially in the scenes where someone dies. But I would recommend this wonderful little movie for everyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Better Way to Spend a Friday Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say right off the bat that this post includes a SPOILER: there are (sigh!) no catfights between Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards that turn into make-out fests in "Drop Dead Gorgeous", even though the action comes precipitously close at one point. (C'mon, Denise! You kissed Neve Campbell, why not KD?!?) Other than that major disappointment, DDG is well worth an hour and a half of your precious time, especially if you're a young couple trying to conceive. DDG is a fun movie. It's a sexy movie. In fact, it's WAY too steamy for teenage girls, the purported audience for the film (although we all know, New Line--wink, wink--that the film was REALLY aimed at teenage boys, thus all the shots of Kirsten Dunst advertising her need for a sports bra). Yes, as many people have noted, this is a crude film--there are plenty of jokes about Jews, gays, and the mentally handicapped, and a number of rather sweet actresses end up being portrayed as ugly dogs simply because they aren't big-busted blondes. However, one has to consider the whole package, and when that package includes sexy Denise Richards preening for the camera, and Kirsten being her usual ever-so-endearing little self, you know you've got a winner. Besides, what better way to spend a Friday night than sitting in a theatre, watching KD's boobs bounce up and down as she jogs down the highway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully tasteless and intelligent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was always going to be difficult to top the Mel Brooks classic 'Springtime for Hitler', but Michael Jann has done it with his dancing crucifixion in 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. This is the sort of film which sneaks out of the back door of the Hollywood Film Factory and makes the indisputable statement that there is intelligent life in the American Film Industry.European films (and particularly those rare beasts recognised as British films) often pride themselves on being purveyors of wit, irony and satire while those on the other side of the Atlantic merely pander to the plebs with special effects, sex, more special effects and gratuitous violence. How wrong this view is and how worrying it is for those of us on the European side of 'the pond' to see Hollywood exercising its brains rather than its brawn.'Drop Dead Gorgeous' is a delight from beginning to end. Setting itself up as a documentary (with much more success than 'The Blair Witch Project') it explores the machinations, double dealing and murderous outcomes of a small-town America beauty pageant. Although these events are alien phenomena to us Europeans, Michael Jann and Lorna Williams explore the idiosyncracies of stunted egoism and frustrated ambition with a clarity and perception which make the subject matter a universal satire on human neurosis and paranoia.The whole cast turn in fine performances and the humour comes thick and fast without the usual lull in the middle where so many many writers and directors seem to lose interest. My only quibble with the film is that the ending seems a little too abrupt and a little too convenient. Given what has gone before, the finale could have been of outrageous proportions. Instead, it is amusingly plausible and, as a result, pedestrian.Despite this, make every effort to see 'Drop Dead Gorgeous'. I am sure it will become a landmark in the careers of both Michael Jann and Lorna Williams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to the town of Mount Rose, Minnesota ("Home of the oldest living Lutheran"). The folks there are just about ready to crown the 50th Annual American Teen Princess. And since this is such an auspicious occasion, a documentary crew has been dispatched to film the whole thing! The crew interview last year's winner (from the Eating Disorders wing of the local hospital) and some of the judges ("Yep, I'm just here watching the young girls - er - contestants - and - yeah - I brought a video camera. What are you suggesting? Did you hear something about me???") This year's theme is "Proud to Be an American" (previous themes include "USA - A-OK!" and "Amer-I-CAN!") and is organised by Gladys Leeman. So it seems her daughter Becky has a pretty good chance of walking away with the title. Especially since her rivals consist of girls like the one who's mad about dogs ("My last dog is on a farm now, with a nice family, after he attacked me") and the girl who sees the competition as a means of escape from the town. ("Boys have so many more ways of getting out. Like hockey school. Or prison"). But wait! Here comes Amber Atkins, the white-trash, tap-dancing funeral parlour assistant. Maybe Becky doesn't have this thing sewn up after all... However, rivals to Becky have a nasty habit of meeting with accidents, and Amber begins to fear for her life... This is one of the most mean-spirited, nasty, evil and bitchy films I've seen in a while - full of girly infighting and exploding teens. So it sums up the whole spirit of beauty pageants quite well. It's the sort of film John Waters used to make before he lost it completely. It's like Heathers meets South Park. The last 10 minutes feel a bit tacked-on, but apart from that it's all good bad taste fun.</fullReview>

We meet the plucky, goodhearted girl (Kirsten Dunst) who practices her tap dancing as she performs her night job - applying make up to the corpses in the morgue. We also meet the beautiful, soulless, evil, Kathy Lee Gifford wannabe (Denise Richards,) whose enemies seem to meet with unfortunate ends. This film skewers everything, from beauty pageants to cheerleaders, from trailer trash to the gun culture. It is quite funny, but also merciless. Frequently, as when Denise Richards performs her talent number with a statue of Jesus on the cross, you may find yourself cringing as you laugh. Unfortunately, the film is a shade too hyperbolic. It takes too much glee in poking fun at its subjects as it leaves reality far behind. One character, for instance, suffers physical mutilation played for laughs.The performances are strong. Kirsten Dunst is outstanding as the intelligent and charming lead character. Judging by this film, she will not join the long, sad list of child actors who lose all of their talent and charm when they turn fourteen. Denise Richards is well cast as the beautiful villain, because she is not a very good actress, and here she is playing the part of a vain, soulless mannequin. Ellen Barkin, cast against type as Dunst's trashy mom, is always entertaining. The film is directed and scored well, but I was dismayed by one thing: It did not make the best use of it's mock documentary format. The camera was too stable, the angles too well-planned.My only other complaint is structural in nature: The film simply goes on too long. When the pageant is over and a winner is named, the movie continues for what seems an eternity, following the town's representative in the state and national competitions. Did we really need to see this? The answer is no. When the first pageant ends, so does the drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Offensive. Dark. Well Done. I really was surprised at how well this film was done. I expected going in to have seen all the funny parts in the various trailers I had seen. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a sleeper for 99. This is the kind of film that cynical, sarcastic, intellectual b***ards like myself cannot wait to buy on digital. The actors were great, wallowing in the insensitivity their roles afforded them. Do you not like it when people say "bad things" about others? Go see Tarzan. If you can take a joke about anything, and are waiting for a film that isn't cookie cutter summer fare, pay the admission. We are allowed to enjoy a film that lampoons anorexia, trailer trash, Lutheran religion, teen pregnancies, mental retardation, guiltless murder, pedophiles, the recently deceased, gay stereotypes, stage moms, female athletes, drama students, business men's racism, and promiscuity. I noticed the comments were liked it or hated it, so I had to include my 9 vote. I'm sorry we all aren't as open minded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard not to laugh when the exploits of the teenage life are mocked. As a former highschool student, I remember the cliques, the cheerleaders, smoking in the bathroom and most of all, the clothing. What makes DDG so funny is the fact that the characters hit so close to home, and you might even see a bit of yourself in them. Mount Rose might as well be your own hometown, and Miss Teen American Princess the crown they all coveted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could have sworn the Coen brothers meet Mr. Tarentino and came up with this brilliant film. I loved this film as a dark comedy about the world of competition, capitalism, and christianity. It is a hilarious warped approach to the perverted world of beauty pagents. The plot is simple enough, a 'survival of the fittest' predator trying to dominate through intimidation and dirty tricks, succumbs to good and wholesome virtue, and general good character.In reality the far right will get their panties in a bunch by this film since their spokesmodel loses. The general good nature of the K. Dunst's character prevails overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with a movie like "Waking Ned Devine," "Drop Dead Gorgeous" is NOT going to please all the people. Therefore, I recommend those who are easily offended to stay away. I also recommend those who only want gross humor for the sake of gross humor (as in "Something About Mary" and "American Pie") to stay away as well, because a lot of this humor is not gross. And if you need a goofy lead character actor (like Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler or Jerry Lewis), you should not bother, either, because the backbone of this humor is subtle. Finally, if you expect everyone in a movie to be normal, don't bother, because a lot of humor involves eccentricites.OK, that narrows the field down to a handful. The rest of you, particularly those who are amused by tangental monologues about Lake Woebegon and wouldn't mind it getting dark, may want to check this out. My wife and I loved it.</fullReview>

However, it was a revealing documentary format film with a edge. The film is slightly disturbing, I found myself cringing sometimes. I do not recommend you take young children to see this film. Overall DDG is a good movie, I'll buy the video. If you're expecting "American Pie" however, you may be disappointed. If you like dark humor you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The satire in this film is as blunt as the crayon used to write the screenplay. Only the most obvious and worn-out cliches of beauty pageants make it to the screen, coupled with irritating, overused stabs at smalltown life in Minnesota and terrifically unfunny attempts at bathroom humor. While other films have used bad-taste to comedic affect, the writer of this film employs such humor for no obvious purpose except filling time. Positive alternatives to viewing this film: (1) View top-notch mockumentaries such as "Spinal Tap" or "Waiting For Guffman," (2) View the still sharp pageant satire of "Smile," (3) Watch paint dry.</fullReview>

There was one part in this movie that I could not stop laughing and my companion (who, by the way, thought this movie was only mediocre) just looked at me in amazement. About a rinky-dink beauty pageant for teenage girls, this film can be stupid in parts, but what I liked was the satirization of the different "types" that you might find in a small town in middle America. Kirsten Dunn was very appealing as the wholesome girl to root for. All in all, I would recommend this movie, if you just want to go out for an evening and laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" is not generally a knee-slapper type of comedy, but that is not its approach, either. It's filled with wry twists of satire and swats of darkly malicious humor that'll make one gasp (or gag) at the blatant way it's served up. Sure, there's good occasional slapstick like the teaming of Michael McShane and Will Sasso as father-and-son hardware-store owners who become judges of the town's beauty pageant; their interaction is gut-bustingly funny. The casting works VERY well throughout the movie: Kirstie Alley as the civic-fascist mother of her pageant-hopeful snob daughter, and Ellen Barkin as the beer-swilling trailer-trash mama of the squeaky-clean good girl beauty contestant. The documentary concept of the movie, while distancing the characters from the viewer in a certain way, ALSO makes it that much MORE hilarious when they "forget the camera" and spout obscenities or smack a loved one. Thumbs-up for the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, i have to say that i think my favorite part of this movie was Allison Janney's character, Loretta, who was so freakin funny the whole time!!! Heck, she could get an award for all that. The movie follows Amber Atkins, a poor, nice girl who deserves to win the local beauty pageant, and her feircest competition is Becky, a totally fake snob determined to win, and she's funny because you know that everything she says is fake and rehearsed! I thought the part where Amber is talking to her mom in the hospital about quitting was very touching. The movie as a whole is just plain crazy and entertaining, taking turns left and right, and always funny. The psudo-documentary style allowed for tons of laughs that wouldn't be possible in standard form of filming, because it seems more real that way, everything is a bit more funny and a bit more moving, and then the cinematography seems a lot better too. It does have some black humor in there, such the deaths, Becky's performance at the pageant, and the stuff with the retard may offend some peopleBut all in all, it was a great movie, the performances were all good (Dunst may seem a bit overly sweet, but that's okay), and I don't know why any critic would give it thumbs down, because it's just so hilarious!!! Also, when you see it, pay attention to what's going on in the backgrounds, because a lot of it's very very funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Patrick Jann's mock documentary look at small-town America and its take on beauty pageants leads us on a wicked journey back to Minnesota. After this zinger and the sharp, but brilliant "Fargo," residents there may not let film crews back into the state.The movie is stingingly satirical and hits home with painful precision. Though you recognize some of the characters from your own experiences, Lona Williams' script takes you on an unpredictable roller-coaster ride via the lives of the contestants and their loved ones.Ellen Barkin surprises and scores with her off-beat version of the trailer-trash girl's mom, Annette. Kirsten Dunst continues to improve with refreshingly upbeat turn as her daughter, Amber. Denise Richards draws a believable caricature as Becky, the rich girl every commoner hated growing up. Kirstie Alley, as her mom and pageant director Gladys, is adequate, but seems a bit miscast.Expecting nothing, I was given a gift because it was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I saw the preview of this movie, I thought it was going to be a hilarious movie that was to-die-for. When I saw the first half and still could just not be able to laugh until my stomach ached terribly, I thought to myself, "Maybe the funny part's coming anytime now.....or maybe it's near the end." I kept telling myself that throughout the rest of the movie. But when it ended, I was deeply disappointed. I thought I was bound to see something my friends and I could talk and laugh about all week long, or even longer. But I was terribly wrong. It wasn't one bit funny. Maybe here or there they'd strike you right on your funny nerve, but it wasn't hard enough to make you laugh until the whole movie theatre told you to shut up because they were trying to watch the hilarious film.I DO NOT recommend this film at all.-TommyGrl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting for this movie for over a year. That is because the movie was filmed at my middle school. When they were filming I would commonly bike up to the school, and check out the filming on the set (Careful not to get in the way of anyone) I was curious as to what parts of the school they'd use, and how the school would appear on screen... I also think Denise and Kirsten are REALLY hot, so I wanted to see it. On the good side, the school got some good play, the entire second act took place in my school, and parts of the first act. The scenes in the gym, in the hallway (where the catfight took place) and the lunchroom were all my school. I also felt that the acting was pretty good. But I couldn't help shaking the feeling that this was just a bad version of Fargo. Deep down in their cores, Fargo and Drop Dead Gorgeous are Dark Comedies with exagerated Minnesotan accents. However some of the jokes in the latter movie were to heartless, or downright disgusting. The third and final act really dragged along, and seemed like everything was falling into place to easily.Overall I'd give a 2 out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie that I have now seen two times already. It is a dark comedy that makes fun of beauty pageants. It reminded me of my cousin's Miss California Pageant that took place a couple years ago. A lot of things that I made fun of then, are in this movie now. I laughed a lot, and thought that Ellen Barkin (Annette Atkins) and Allison Janney (Loretta) played great trailer trash queens. Kirsten Dunst was also pretty good, but her "Fargo-like" accent needed to be more consistent throughout the movie, it kind of comes and goes. And Denise Richards was as sickeningly perfect and pretty as ever. The rest of the cast was also fun to watch. All around, I gave it a 9. I took my boyfriend to see it tonight and I think that he would give it a 6, because for some reason he wasn't laughing as much. I don't expect everyone to like it, especially any Lutheran's, they might find the ever present jokes to get old REAL fast. See it for yourself...and decide if you like it.</fullReview>

The joy of this movie isn't in the "who wins?" aspect, but in the side "business" dealing with the judges and the other contestants. Any movie that starts with the line "No, cow manure can't hurt you" is aces in my book. Besides, the writer, Lona Williams, writes for the Drew Carey Show and was herself a Minnesota beauty queen. Look for some very funny scenes with Nora Dunn, Mo Gaffney, Brittany Murphy, and Allison Janney. And Kirstie Alley does her damnedest with a pretty thin character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick humor at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some viewers will no doubt regard Drop Dead Gorgeous as utterly tasteless and morally objectionable. (Think Weekend at Bernie's meets the Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom told in "mockumentary" style.) But for those who love sick/black humor with a touch of social satire the film is a must see. Combining the absurdities of a small town beauty pageant with the dialect humor of post-Fargo Minnesota, the film is filled with gut-splitting (not to mention gut-spilling) scenes, a wonderful assortment of oddball characters (especially the pageant judges), some great sight gags, and raunchy one-liners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest mockumentary since Spinal Tap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Americans watched young Jon Benet Ramsey prancing around in her thousand dollar evening gowns, people began to question the logic and meaning of child beauty pageants and what they stood for. I know I did.And I knew it would only be a matter of time before someone would make a film that captures essence of the screwed-up world that justifies these parades of pre-teen and teen princesses and pageant mothers.In the spirit of 'This is Spinal Tap' and 'Waiting for Guffman', this mockumentary about a teen beauty pageant in small town Minnesota is a hilarious satire of a slice of America that many find demeaning and downright ridiculous.Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards are the focal characters, competing for the crown. Coming from complete opposite backgrounds, Dunst is "trailer park trash" who aspires to be like her mother and idol Diane Sawyer and win the pageant; and Richards comes from the wealthiest family in town and seems destined to follow her mother (Kirstie Alley) to the crown.Like the frightening true story of the Texas cheerleader murder, contestants are maimed or murdered so that one contestant can capture the crown.Dunst is absolutely charming as Amber, and Ellen Barkin is wonderful as her mother. Alley and Richards are equally good on the opposing side, with Alley portraying everything that's worthy of despisal in the freakshow of teen beauty pageants, as both organizer and as a pageant mom. Richards plays the second-generation beauty queen brilliantly as she waltzes through her interviews and talent competition with such rehearsed presentation.There are some "dark" themes that some people may find objectionable -- murdering/maiming of contestants, anorexic beauty queens, a creepy pageant judge who fantasizes about the young contestants, a mentally retarded man who sniffs paint fumes from a paper bag, and so on.But anyone who can set aside political correctness for a couple of hours will find this film absolutely hilarious.The story is absolutely brilliant, with no down time whatsoever. Every level of the screenplay is chocked full of laugh out loud dialog, not to mention everything that goes on in the background or appears on signs.It's easily the funniest comedy of the year, and one of the smartest films of the year. A satire that pulls no punches in giving us a biting glimpse at what goes on, or what we fear might actually go on, in thousands of these little freakshows in small towns across America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often use this movie as a radar when I meet someone new. If they can't find a movie like this or Death to Smoochy remotely funny then we're probably going to make it as long time friends. To appreciate it, you definitely have to find amusement in 'so wrong its funny' type of situations. Great performances by Ellen Barken, Allison Janey, Kirstie Allie &amp; the late Brittany Murphey. Kirsten Dunst's performance is very similar to her one from Bring it On but that's a type of humor not all performers can do. Blink and you'll miss Amy Adams in one of her first roles.Check it out!

All the stereotypes you'd expect are there, but it doesn't keep them from being amusing at every turn. The talking heads in this movie are consistently excellent, as are the performances. Kirsten Dunst, Allison Janey, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy and the rest of the cast do a wonderful job handling their consistently silly, but familiar characters. The film drags a bit towards its predictable (but not unsatisfying) ending, but the laughs it accumulates along the way give it the momentum required to push through. I'd recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Outstanding Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Minnesota accent is fantastic and the details to humor is just brilliant. Granted not everyone in Minnesota sounds like that, but it is a far more of an accurate accent than the strong one in Fargo. It's fair to say this because I actually live 30 minutes from Minnesota. There's just so much going on in the background and as silly as everything is, you are really rooting for Dunst's character, even though the tone is so "Strictly Ballroom" (outrageous and sweet). The documentary style is perfect for this it brings out the charm and ugliness of the whole story.Honestly, I'm just surprised that this movie wasn't and isn't more popular. Or at least some sort of cult classic. I miss humor like this. I'd trade awkward silence to sweet satire any day. *Also I love Amy Adams in this film, from a Stripper to Enchanted princess... a girl can really dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better as it goes along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a while to get warm with this film. At first, the gags seem to be too obvious as does the main target of the comedy (small-town people, beauty pageants). But by the second half things improve, while the last 20 minutes or so are quite good. Probably a movie that improves on additional viewing. While this docu-comedy shtick has been done before - and to perfection - as in "Spinal Tap" and "Waiting For Guffman", this movie isn't bad at all, and although a number of gags don't have the desired effect, there are some good ideas, and although rarely truly funny, the movie does manage to be interesting. The older female cast is rather ugly (Barkin, Alley, and especially the tall one) while the young female cast is to the most part quite good-looking, or at least likable. Kirsten Dunst easily runs off with the movie; she is utterly charming - not to mention very funny in a couple of scenes. The rest of the cast is solid, with Sasso as the stand-out as a retard. Lively soundtrack.</fullReview>

If you like dry humor, you will absolutely love this movie. Impossible to predict the ending although you will be tempted to think that you know just where it is going.

		<fullReview>I have a hard time enjoying most comedies as many current actors don't fit the roles they're casted for. A renowned critic I'm not, but it's rare for me to laugh at a movie. With that said, I love Drop Dead Gorgeous. As a north country native, I'm convinced of Kirsten's role as a dingy Minnesotan hoping to break free from the restraints of her hometown, Mount Rose. Amber Atkins is hysterical. I can't help but laugh when she is dancing music-video style as she makes her way home. Ellen Barkin is excellent as Annette Atkins and helps the script with a few classic one-liners. "Well, I sat down to have a beer, and kablooey, next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window, and I'm ass-up in somebody's flower bed!" Denise Richards is definitely a weaker member of the cast and is sometimes painful to watch, but the rest really make the movie shine (Allison Janney as "GOT SOME!" Loretta, Brittany Murphy, and the disturbingly anorexic former-pageant-winner included). It's worth watching this movie just to see the wheelchair rendition of Melissa Manchester's "Don't Cry Out Loud". Like I said, I'm from Minnesota so my comment may be biased. Who cares though. I'd give this movie a 10 if the ending was funnier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie!!! The first time I saw it I was confused and thought it was a documentary about pageants. Then I realized it was a comedy. I laughed so hard during most of it that I missed things and had to go back and watch it. My favorite character is Hank, the paint huffer. Will Sasso played that so well. I love during the Camera interview when we first meet the judges and Hank is all like "Are we on Cops?" Harold tells him to go away and Hank continues leading to a slapping fight and then right after he is back to huffing. Then he ends up with the store in the end and covered in FOIL. I just thought it was so funny. And when he is taking his pants off during the interviews. I also loved the Accents, I thought they did a very good job on those. All in all this film is very entertaining and I recommend anyone who needs a good laugh at something most people make fun of anyways (PAgents) should watch this at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very good and shows how overrated beauty pageants are. The accents of Minnesotans are mocked, but not to a point where anyone should be upset or feel offended. The movie is a fake documentary kind of like the Blair Witch Project, but there is actually acting to it, and the camera work doesn't make you sick. Kirsten Dunst is very cute in this movie and you are rooting for her the whole time. You get to know all of the contestants in the pageant, and by the time the movie is over, you really feel like you know their personalities. Some people probably won't like this movie, but it seems very inexpensive...in a good way. Cleary the cast and crew did a lot with a little.</fullReview>

When the film crew arrives at Amber's trailer, peeking though the windows Allison Janney sees them and comments "Oh, are we on "COPS" again?" perfectly deadpan.

		<shortDescription>Much Funnier than it was Given Credit For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Drop Dead Gorgeous is a fictitious, sarcastic documentary about a beauty pageant that is intentionally un-politically correct and sprinkled with dark comedy. While it admittedly doesn't follow the Mockumentary format as well as the Christopher Guest films, there is one reason why it didn't do well at the box office: It doesn't come right out and hit you over the head with the jokes. Mainstream Hollywood movies like to set up the joke, tell the joke, then explain why the joke was funny to make sure everyone got it. Much of this movie requires you to pay attention, watch the background, remember what happened in previous scenes, and sometimes even figure out what happened off-camera or else the jokes fly right by. You really have to see it a few times before you can truly appreciate all the thought that went into the script. Drop Dead Gorgeous shows that there are movies made with subtle (yet really funny) jokes that require thought, and some comedies are worth seeing again and again. Unfortunately, the fact that it's always on the $4.99 rack at the store shows that most people aren't ready for them. If want a movie that's a real hidden gem, pick it up.</fullReview>

Pick out some good wine, all the fattening snacks everyone loves, sit back, watch, and laugh you booties off.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good black comedy spoofing teen beauty contests</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first sat down to watch this, I was quick to judge it as a dud. About ten or twenty minutes into it, I suddenly started to love pretty much every second of it. It doesn't last every single second of the movie, but most of it is really funny. If you're into black humor you should definitely check it out. All of the main characters have a very distinct dialect for the entire movie, which at first seems annoying, but eventually you grow to love it, and laugh at it. The acting is mostly acceptable, as most the characters are laughable stereotypes. The movie is very black, one of the most pitch black I've ever seen, so if you don't think you can stand extreme black humor, or you're easily offended, you should definitely avoid this film. It isn't for everybody's taste, and most people probably won't like it. It's gold for any fan of black humor though, if you like a movie like One night at McCools, you'll probably like this one too. It's made in the style of a documentary, I think the genre is called "mockumentary". Once again, not for everyones taste, but worth watching for fans of black humor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely one of the best mockumentaries of all time. Like one of the first beauty pageant spoofs "Smile", "Drop Dead Gorgeous" plays up the obvious humor in the beauty pageant circuit.It documents the competition of 8 contestants in the Mount Rose Beauty Pageant. But this is no average beauty pageant. Murder and mayhem characterize this particular beauty fest.Ellen Barkin is at her best as the trailer-park beer-chugging mother of contestant Amber Atkins (played wonderfully by Kirsten Dunst). While Kirstie Alley plays the rich, pushy, competitive mother of contestant Becky Leeman (portrayed to bitchy perfection by Denise Richards). This movie's all-star cast is part of what makes it so great.It has all of the elements a good comedy needs: a variety of quirky and fun characters, witty dialogue, and above all it keeps you interested. The Minnesota accents alone cause a laugh.5 stars</fullReview>

Easy, Allison Janney ("Most smartest...") steals the show in this movie.

		<fullReview>Funny in a brutish kind of way, with a little more polish, this film could have been every bit as good as, say, an Andrew Dice Clay stage performance.I agree with the previous commenter that this film is not worth a rental, however, if you do happen to catch it on TV, try to record it and see it twice. At first viewing there is little or no subtlety in the movie, but I happened to have recorded it off of prime time TV, which gave me the advantage of being able to play it back. Believe it or not, it actually has a bit more depth and character the second time you watch it. (The first time around the jokes seem to be driven in to you with a 300-pound baseball bat, but on second viewing you catch some of the double entendres and "facial-expressions-worth-a-thousand-words" you might have missed the first time.)Unlike many other commenters, who apparently don't like Denise Richards or her acting in the film, I like her probably the best. She does a great job of depicting the shallow, conniving beauty-queen-from-hell that we all love to hiss. Her "exit" from the picture, while not at all pretty, is perhaps nonetheless befitting to such a person. This also resulted in what, to me anyway, was the funniest line in the entire movie, "Maybe this is God's way of telling us to 'Buy American'."Kirsten Dunst is excellent in this film as well, and for those who want to see a "double shot" of Ms. Dunst in a similarly themed movie, then you should also watch the campy cheerleader flick "Bring it On" (2000), which IS worth a rental.My final thought: I suspect that if you watch this movie more than a few times, you will be able to meet your average beauty queen anywhere, anytime, look her squarely in the eyes and tell her with complete confidence, "Drop dead, gorgeous!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" attempts to be a humorous satire of beauty pageants. It ends up being a weak attempt at the same territory that "Texas Cheerleader Murdering Mom" did so well. While the movie does have some VERY funny scenes and lines, you find yourself (at least I did) checking your watch every so often. This is truly the longest hour and a half movie I have ever sat through.Kirsten Dunst is the highlight of this movie, and carries her role with the zest that some of the other characters severely lacked. Denise Richards continues to play the snobby rich girl and I continue to dislike her. She plays the role very well, but is now being severly typecast as the snooty little pretty rich girl....too bad, she could have some talent buried under all the lip gloss.Kirsty Alley follows up the weak (and should have been cancelled)"Veronica's Closet" with a pathetic turn at playing the stage mom who is willing to kill in order for her daughter to be everything mom wants her to be. Holly Hunter did it much better in "Cheerleader-Murdering" and Kirsty really should have given that movie a watch before filming began.All in all, this movie would have to rate a star and a half, just because the few funny bits in it are very funny. See it at the bargain show or the dollar theater, you wont feel as cheated that way......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terry Southern Lives!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought they broke the mold when Terry Southern died. Satire was never as raw as Dr. Strangelove. When Reiner and Guest brought the mockumentary into life, I thought that they were funny but I felt that they were written for the effete end of the cultural elite. The comedy was underplayed so often you had to be in the elite to "get it". Then I saw Williams' Drop Dead Gorgeous. Terry Southern lives.Drop Dead Gorgeous is my favorite mockumentary. Williams' satire is manna for those of us amongst the great unwashed who, like Williams, had to break out of jerkwater towns and their caste systems. Where I came from the royal wedding was when the heir to the local sheep company married the gal whose dad, just like in DDG, owned the furniture store.My empathic side just writhes in pleasure in watching this dark little film as I imagine Williams savoring an iced dish of revenge.I was curious to note that the reviews in the regular press found this little gem to be mean-spirited and crude. The index on Rotten Tomatoes, a metric that I am usually compatible with was oddly low. Judging from the comments I imply that the caste that now serves us in journalism is skewed toward the effete end of the group I alluded to in the opening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best underground comedies of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my headline I said, 'underground' comedy. Obviously it was well-publicized when it first came out, but it was sort of hit and miss at the theater, and only a select group of people did and still do like it.It's the sort of movie most people will either love or hate, and I for one love it! It's a stupid comedy, that has just enough stupidity, but certainly enough actual humor in it, to make it funny. The entire film is well filmed, as if it were a documentary. There are several jokes that you will either get or not get, and if you don't get them, then the movie will only get worse for you. Denise Richards is someone that I don't particularly care for, simply because I don't really think of her as much of an actress. She's really good at playing the conceded beauty Queen, which is what she plays in this as well. However, she does do it believably, and that's what her character was. Kirsten Dunst is my favorite in the film, and I love her accent! Everyone who actually tried to do the Minnesotan accent was excellent, very believable and very funny. Kirsty Ally was exceptionally good in the role, and the best actress in the whole movie, was Ellen Barkin, who played Kirsten Dunst's mom. She was outstanding, but then, we are talking about Ellen Barkin, who is one of the most underrated actress of our time, and one of the most talented.I give it a ten, because it is one of my all time favorites, and I can't believe more people don't love it just as much. Like I said, though if you do decide to watch it, be prepare that it might not be your cup of tea. It's not a film for everyone, and I only know a few other people, other than me, who loved it. Most people didn't, and it's a shame, 'cause it's a really great film.Check it out though, you might be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Gets the Mop and Bucket?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedic acting comes in two flavors -- intuitive and selfaware. Most actors are intuitives who stumble upon some device that works, then they exploit it -- or find projects that match it. The other kind is rare: someone who thinks about comedy, has enough insight to understand the effect desired and has enough self-control to create that effect. Dunst is young yet, but she shows signs of being the second type.Much of her work is merely competent portrayals of dizzy but charming teens. This is particularly easy to play because all teens are acting some role, usually insecurely. But 'Dick' made me sit up and notice where she was coming from. Its a rather difficult and unstable perch to maintain when simultaneously being something genuine, not a genuine character but an icon of a cultural domain, and poking fun at it on our behalf. Not just making us laugh at the character (as, say the Farrellys), but of something in ourselves as a culture. More like a sophisticated standup by charades. Julia Stiles is also tentatively in this same category in my mind.After 'Virgin Suicides,' I'm going to be watching what she does with her career. Will she do a Winona? a Drew? a Roberts? or if we are lucky, something else.So far as the film, it consists of episodic skits that make fun of enough that most people will find something funny. The dancing crucifix and obsequious patriotism did it for me. This collage approach covers a lot of film-making inadequacies, and the whole affair would have collapsed if Kirsten wasn't doing her thing, presumably behind the director's back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a great movie. It's not even a good movie but it is enjoyable. It's a spoof documentary about a bueaty pagent that seems to make fun of itself the whole way through. The accents that the actors use to the way extreme of the small town beauty pagent let you know that this movie knows that it's not something that will be remembered as a cinematic achievment.However, if you don't expect too much, you'll have a good time. It's fuuny in its stupidity. It looks like a movie that might be fun to make. You get the sense that that actors are probably enjoying this more than you are. Though not believable in any way, Drop Dead Gorgeous is worth watching.**/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I guess I "didn't get it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps knowing Minnesota better would make this a more enjoyable film. I don't know much at all about it, and I found myself cringing more than laughing. There were some good moments, but they sank under the weight of too many ham-handed "laugh at this stereotype" ones. This person loves Jesus! Ha! Ha! How funny! Wait, she's using Jesus' name as a swear word! She's a hypocrite! What a knee-slapper! Hey, this guy is a pervert! Ha! Haha! Oh that's hilarious! The problem is that most of these things aren't funny at all, at least on their own. Again, maybe knowing Minnesota better would bring out the humor, but if that's the case then this is a giant "in joke", and I'll provide the warning for those who aren't "in" to probably just skip this movie.The last 15 minutes didn't feel like they fit; the story felt like it should end with the contest we were following for all of the first 4/5 of the movie. After that I wasn't sure where we were going, or why. The movie's focus seemed to change from the original contest to the contest winner. Either redo the first 4/5 of the movie to make it focus on her, or else lose the last bit so the focus stays on the contest.Also, why did Kirstie Alley's character do what she did in the parade? Her comments both before and after indicate that she knew what was going to happen when she did it, so...!?! That bit just made no sense.I did really like Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney. They did a lot with the material they were given. Most of the other characters... again, I guess I just didn't get it.3/10: 1 for a few laughs, 1 for Ellen &amp; Allison, and 1 for the eye candy, Amy Adams and Denise Richards in particular -- and am I getting old or can I throw Ellen in there too? (I love Brittany Murphy but I didn't like her that much here, which I blame on this movie just not being very good; she plays a similarly goofy character in 1997's "Drive" which I absolutely loved, so if you like her energy here, check out that one.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could have been really awesome, but in the end, Drop Dead Gorgeous is the kind of movie that happens when people who don't really know anything about a subject decide to make a satire about it. Given that the focus of the movie, beauty pageants, is so deserving of ridicule, the script for this film is woefully unfunny or interesting. Further, the writers do a poor imitation of Fargo by casting every character as an imbecile with a Minnesota accent -- it just doesn't work. I've seen worse films -- but not too many more. I laughed out loud maybe twice, giggled on six occasions, and looked at my watch over two dozen times, especially in the last 30 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yeah yeah, drop dead gorgeous; literally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is directed by Michael Patrick Jann and stars Kirstie Alley, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy and Kirsten Dunst. Written and produced by Lona Williams it's shot in a mockumentary format and follows the contestants in a beauty pageant called the Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant, held in the small town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. It seems that some parents, and some girls, will stop at nothing to win this particular contest.It's pretty evident quite early on in Jann's film that this is no ordinary look at Middle America. This is biting satire that pokes the soft underbelly of those so fascinated by beauty pageants out there in the good old U.S. of A. The roll call of gags, both visually and orally, reads like one of Lucifer's best of lists; featuring anorexia, amputees, burns victims, perversion and Jesus gets a kicking too. Yet it's not shock tactics that are the order of the day, the writing from Williams (notably once a Minnesota pageant queen herself) is very aware and steers safely away from charges of crudeness. Sure, some things may offend, but the film is structured in such a way (the docu team angle is excellently realised) it's all very hard to take seriously: and rightly so.The cast perhaps unsurprisingly are mostly female, what guys are involved are either perverts, dunces, weirdos or dead! In the Mother corners we have Kirstie Alley &amp; Ellen Barkin, with both ladies wonderfully rising to the tongue in cheek occasion, and representing the daughters are trailer trash Kirsten Dunst and spoiled rich kid beauty Denise Richards. Allison Janney provides wise cracking-man hungry-comic relief, while the petite line of contestants contains the likes of Brittany Murphy and Amy Adams. All do good work for the spiky script, where the film falls down, however, is with it's rather pointless last 20 to 30 minutes. Possibly it's down to inexperience on the part of the makers that the film loses its way? We have the big contest shenanigans and a kicker of a twist to boot, but then have to suffer a number of convo's and time fillers that aren't really needed. We can accept Richards looking about 5 years too old for this particular contest, but half hour of film speaking to god knows who? We can not.Still, it's a fun in a sickly kind of way movie, one that is bold and lit up by some very rewarding acting performances. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am flabbergasted too this is no way my thing a teen pageant comedy is not my thing but when it melds together with this I like it. It really boggles my mind how the hell Kirsten Dunst ever became in a Crow movie it's not that she's not a good actress she is a talented actress.SPOILERS IN PLOT the basic plot is that someone running a teen pageant who her daughter is in so she rigs it and not in a legal way she starts killing the competition and Amber Atkins (Dunst) is next but in all of her attempts it doesn't work. so what do we have in the talent show that the runner kills all the competition. the daughter sings "your just to good to be true" a horrible song and sings it badly I might add and dancing with Jesus on the cross. do you believe that the mother actually left some people over? I think your answer is "yes" but eventually Kirsten performs after a costume fiasco and she still gave the winner out to the daughter but Atkins' thing that she was better than her performance but the thing is that she blew up her daughter on a swan in a parade to make Dunst the winner.You may think it's not my thing but I laughed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks can kill you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world of the teen beauty pageants is at center stage in this satire that is set in Mount Rose, Minnesota, a town where Lutherans appear to be a majority. The 50th anniversary of Miss Teen Princess America attracts a lot of the young women in town. The message in the film appears to be that being beautiful can kill you, sometimes.Gladys Leeman, a former winner, is one of the organizers. Her own daughter, Becky, is competing. She is a prominent citizen of Mount Rose, with her own agenda. The competing girls come from different social backgrounds. One of the most talented ones is Amber, a girl that lives in a trailer park with her alcoholic mother.Mysterious things begin happening to different participants in the contest, the most serious one occurs to Annette Atkins, Amber's mother, whose trailer catches fire and her hand gets attached to the beer can she was drinking. Amber, who is clearly the most talented girl in the contest, loses to Becky, something one knew was coming from the start of the competition.There are funny moments in this film, which was directed by Michael Patrick Jann, and written by Lona Williams who seems to know a great deal about these beauty contests. Somehow, the film must have seem funnier to its creators. There are good moments like Becky's selection for the talent portion of the show. Also, the way most of the girls competing in the state portion of the competition get sick after eating sea food.Kirsten Dunst makes an appealing Amber, the nice girl from the wrong side of town. Kirstie Alley is the force behind the contest and the woman who dominates everything in Mount Rose. Ellen Barkin has some good moments as Annette, but what happens to her is not as funny as it must have looked to the creators of the film. Allison Janney is seen as Loretta, Annette's trailer park neighbor. Denise Richards adds her beauty to the film. Amy Adams, an uncommon talented actress, has a small part as Leslie, a girl that loves boys and ends up having quite a career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leonard Maltin hated this movie and instead he recommended watching the movie SMILE (1975). Well, I would say the exact opposite--DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is hilarious (though not exactly subtle) and SMILE is a not particularly good comedy (though it was original).As I said above, the movie wasn't subtle but a very silly and completely over-the-top look at Junior Miss-type pageants.Ellen Barkin does a great job of playing "trailer trash" and Kirstie Alley plays the rich broad who feels she IS the pageant. Both actresses were not particular favorites of mine, but this movie helped changed my opinion as they did great jobs and really stayed in character.Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards headlined the small cast of girls competing for the local Minnesota pageant--the winner of which will go to the state championship. What happens along the way has got to be seen to be believed! If I told you in this review, it would reveal too much.This movie is strongly recommended if you just want a good laugh. If you want cerebral comedy, this is not it! The only negative is the very strong language, so parents are recommended to consider this before showing it to younger kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had seen trailers for this movie since last November. It looked hilarious. Small town beauty pageants, rival teens from opposite sides of the tracks, stage mothers, fire bombings, Minnesota accent...what could be funnier?Obviously the trailer. That's what could be funnier.The movie is a "mockumentary" of a local teen beauty pageant in small town Minnesota. Kirstie Alley is the organizer and former winning contestant, pushing her own daughter (Denise Nichols) to wear the tiara. Kristen Dunst plays a poor girl with a heart of gold and tap-dancing feet. Her mother and their next door neighbor (Ellen Barkyn and Allison Janney) define the true meaning of trailer trash. Unfortunately, the stereotypes are as overdone as Miss Alley's Fargo-esque accent. We get it, Miss Alley is a pushy, manipulative stage mother. Miss Nichols is a bitch queen. Miss Barkin is such an alcoholic she grasps a beer can even when near death. Stop hitting me over the head with it. If you have to try that hard, it isn't funny.I have to admit that several of the "middle of the country" jokes really made me laugh --- although I was the only one in the theater doing so.A waste of talent with good cast but shocking writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The laughs come too cheap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most forms of entertainment render themselves liable to satire when performances are made into a competition. The music world satirises itself with the annual Eurovision Song Contest, an event which has achieved almost cult status through its sheer awfulness. Competitive ballroom dancing was beautifully targeted in "Strictly Ballroom" and the teen beauty pageant has been dealt with in Michael Ritchie's "Smile"."Drop Dead Gorgeous", in attempting a further shy at the teen pageant business, goes for an in-your-face, sledgehammer approach. It's a mix of slapstick and odd characters, most of whom suffer from problems such as anorexia, obesity, paranoia and mental retardation. Given this line-up the laughs are inevitably bought at very low cost. That's not to say that there aren't some really funny moments (Becky Leeman's grotesque performance with a stuffed Christ attached to the Cross is but one). But such genuine comedy moments occur only in patches. Once a couple of the "bad" characters are dealt with about two-thirds of the way through the rest of the film becomes a desperate search for the inevitable ending in which good must prevail over bad. Throughout all this the performance of Allison Janney shines out. She steals every scene she's in, portraying a character not a thousand miles removed from that of Joanna Lumley in TV's "Absolutely Fabulous".The laughs are there, but often only because the targets are so soft. By the benchmarks of "Smile" or "Strictly Ballroom" this falls short.</fullReview>

It also has a lot of the behind the scenes on what goes on in the pagentry, and the life of many of the people who enters it. The film seems to be written by someone who is an insider and is writing a script to get back or poke fun at the whole pagent business.As a whole, it is a no holds barred satirical/black comedy mockumentry, albeit slightly crude and obtuse sometimes.</fullReview>

I also enjoyed seeing Brittany Murphy in the film as well as Amanda Detmer (very small role). Some other highlights in the film are Adam West (the original Batman) and Will Sasso (from "Mad TV"). The rest of the cast was quite good as well.If you're a heterosexual male, then you'll probably want to see this film, there are a great deal of beautiful women in this film. The film has also got some really good comedy in it, but the story seems to lag quite a bit at times. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but if your into beautiful women and/or dark comedy, then you might want to check out this film. Thank for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is a documentary style movie about the world of beauty pageants and the title all the girls just want to get. Most of them will stop at nothing to get it, including previous winner mother Gladys Leeman who desperately wants her daughter, Becky to follow into her footsteps and win. Becky has a rival though in the name of Amber Atkins, who could just end up winning. It's a big race to the top! Drop Dead Gorgeous stars Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards, Brittany Murphy, Ellen Barkin and Kirstie Alley, who all give quite good and kooky performances here.I would describe Drop Dead Gorgeous as a grown up teen movie. It was okay, but nothing special and got boring after a while. The movie did have it's moments, some which were entertaining. I thought the movie would be better though. I also didn't really like the documentary style of it, especially as there was so much of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie last night on television. These days, beauty pageants seem to be the most frequent target of parodists - yet I haven't seen one as insightful and funny as "Smile" thirty years ago. This one has its moments - merely having the now very fat Kristie Alley as the ex-beauty queen provided some (perhaps uninentional) humor.This is awfully broad - e.g., if you think dozens of beauty queens vomiting from balconies in a hotel atrium, or the continuing grossness of a fat mentally retarded man, are terribly funny, this movie may be for you. I just thought these scenes stupid and waited for them to end.The superiority of the Guest/McKean mockumentaries is obvious - Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show and This is Spinal Tap are all far funnier.Barkin, Dunst and Janney are good as mother, daughter and mother's best friend. The others are unmemorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny Movie; Its Critics Miss The Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of this movie. I went to see it in 1999 because I like looking at Kirsten Dunst and Denise Richards, but I was stunned when it turned out to be a sharp, smart, dark satire of not only beauty pageants, but also small-town American life. The movie is filled with bright performances and clever one-liners and scenes. I'll confess: not everything works. But it has more laughs than just about any other movie I've seen in the last two or three years. I'm baffled by the hatred some people have for this movie. And I'm amused by the criticisms of the performances. Some of the people who've criticized the Minnesota accents aren't from the Midwest. I'm from the South. I'll criticize bad Southern accents when I hear them, but I'm not an expert on a good Minnesota dialect. Are DDG's critics? If a real, authentic, bona fide Minnesotan tells me the movie's accents are lousy, I'll believe it.  I am a Christian person. Many critics of DDG, including some who have commented here, seem to think this is an anti-Christian movie. I don't see it that way. I disagree with their assessment of the scene with Denise Richards singing to a Christ doll on a cross. To me, the moviemakers are satirizing people who publicly pat themselves on the back for their religious beliefs. In effect, Denise Richards' character is saying "Look at me -- I'm a Superchristian!" Funny movie. I give it three stars out of four.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a hit-or-miss affair to be sure. It's packed with funny scenes and lines, but for every one of them there is also a completely unfunny and/or tasteless one. As a "mockumentary" it is ok, but only just. You never really get a feeling these could be real people. Allison Janney is the highlight of the actors/actresses, giving a solid comedy performance, and Kirsten Dunst is sympathetic in a rather unsympathetic role. However, Barkin and Alley are left a little stranded, given very little to do with their characters (although Alley has one GREAT line). Denise Richards manages to show her incredible un-acting capabilities and, in doing so, seems just perfect for her part. I found her "cross"-scene quite hilarious, but I do understand that many could easily be offended. Other little gems include the interviews of the candidates (spot-on) and ALL scenes with Janney. On the other hand, I didn't find the anorectic last years winner very funny, as I suspect was intended. It is just too crude. In fact, the whole movie has a rather cruel edge to it, a little more heart wouldn't have gone amiss. But, all in all, good fun for the moment and some brilliant things among a lot of up-and-down material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offbeat and entertaining in its strange way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An offbeat comedy, not to everyone's taste, but worth checking out. It merits good marks for being irreverent and creatively different in skewering the beauty contest scene. I suspect it will prove offensive to some as it often roams into tasteless and sophomoric subject matter. On the other hand, that is part of its attraction, should one be attracted to such things. Still, many segments are genuinely funny, and while some miss (at least they missed me), I generally found myself laughing or shaking my head in bemused bewilderment throughout. Kirstie Alley is memorable as the manipulative mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, over-the-top black movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie, and relatively liked it. It is nothing spectacular, and it is just a rehash of other things that everybody has joked about in school. The movie plot is a rehash of many other movies, with what I call the crazy mother genre. How many movies have you seen where the mother of some child/teenager/adult goes completely psycho and will stop at nothing to assure that the immaculate fruit of her womb will win? I have seen it too many times to count. I will say that this is not a chick flick, and that some guys, not all, will enjoy seeing this movie, if they are flexible, and not typical Adam Sandler lovers. They don't laugh at anything if it requires an ounce of thought.Plot: This is a mockumentary based around a Minnasota beauty pageant. The contestants are killed, or maimed in this movie, and it is meant to be funny. In fact, most of the jokes in the movie do work, if you like that kind of humor. However, the whole movie is just unoriginal and copied. It seems as if I have seen it all before. The end seemed hurried and thrown together, but I thought the movie seemed long anyways.Jokes: They work, for the most part. The movie goes overboard some times, and I was kind of offended. If you have read any of my other reviews, you will see that it is hard to offend me! The movie makes fun of retarded people one too many times. It just was not funny even at the beginning. They could have done without that. However, the rest of the jokes worked. The jokes seemed to be the same after a while. Also, the last beauty pageant jokes, I won't tell what it is, were really funny after Woodstock '99. Overall, the movie went too far at times, but it made me laugh. If a movie can do that, then I can't not give it something halfway decent. However, it seemed to drag, and was a little too long. I got a little bored.-----6</fullReview>

I can see the attempts at being funny but this movie is nothing more than one huge crap dump on mid-western life from beginning to end. It's a gleaming example, not to mention further re-enforcement of the obvious regard the coasts have of fly over country.I lost track of the condescending stereotypes before the first 2 minutes of the film was over. Eghad, I'd hate to think how much of a stink there would have been in Hollywood if they'd taken a similar approach to ridicule some minority class. This movie is about as funny as David Duke screaming the N word. There's nothing funny in my opinion about depicting the worst possible stereotypes to condemn an entire group of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Drop Dead Gorgeous" is one of those movies that might leave a bad taste in your mouth, but also a sweet taste in your mouth. Portraying a beauty contest involving a lot of nasty tricks, they're not trying to be cute with this movie; they're trying to bite everything right where it hurts, and they succeed. I, for one, wouldn't be surprised if many beauty pageants involve the stuff portrayed here.So, it's debatable whether or not we call this a gorgeous movie or a drop dead movie, but I wish to assert that it is worth seeing. Their accents will probably remind you of "Fargo", and Kirstie Alley's character is likely to make your skin crawl. Also starring Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Allison Janney, Denise Richards and Mindy Sterling (Frau in the Austin Powers movies).Lutefisk. Ha!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have some fondness for this movie, but it's like black comedy with the training wheels on. For every couple of bitter, on-the-mark scenes that have you laughing in astonishment, there's one that attempts the same and fails awkwardly. I'm a complete atheist but Denise Richards dance with Christ (on the crucifix) probably is funnier on paper than as performed. Maybe it's Richards herself that's the problem. She pretty much manages to ruin everything she's in. (Spoiler) Kirsten Dunst working at her morticians job, unexpectedly unveiling her boyfriend when hunting season starts isn't funny, it's a shocking, deeply painful moment that just elicited a wince from me.But again there's some great laughs: The sausage beauty-queen segment. The beer can fused to Ellin Barkins hand. The anorexic girl who's the envy of all the contestants.Even with it's hit/miss ratio it's still more original and way ahead of "comedies" like Scary movie 2, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing satire on small town beauty pageants</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In A small Minnesota town the annual beauty queen pageant approaches and a documentary film crew arrives to film the goings on. They meet former winner and organiser Gladys Leeman who wants her daughter, Rebecca, to win. When key competitors in the pageant start to suffer `misfortunes' it becomes clear that someone is trying to win by any means necessary.I didn't realise what this was before I watched it and was pleased to see it was one of these mockumentary style things that can often make satires on anything work (rock bands, dog shows etc). Here the target may be easy but the film still manages to have to go big to get a laugh rather than staying low key and being witty and sharp. It is still funny but I couldn't help feel that it had gone the road of excess in order to score points (just like it's target!). The jokes are good enough to justify watching but, even though it is only 100 minutes or so long I still found that it outstayed it's welcome and could have benefited from losing about 12 minutes from it's running time to keep it tighter.The cast are all very good. Although some have better stuff to work with than others. Dunst is good in the lead but is really the `straight' character of the piece and is a little dull as a result. Richards is better and is sexier to boot and plays her two-faced rich girl well. Alley is very strong with a good accent and sending her character up. Barkin only has one good joke (the beer can) and sadly does it over and over again, but Janney is a godsend. Her white trash Loretta is really funny and is even more amazing when compared to her character in West Wing, she can act no doubt about that.Overall this film is funny but in an overdone way that may disappoint those who like their satire with more teeth and less obvious but much sharper teeth. Here the easy targets are picked off with a shotgun as opposed to a satirical `death of a thousand cuts' which I think would have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire on small-time beauty pageants.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler I only caught "Drop Dead Gorgeous" by accident, it was showing on TV while I was doing some email and web work last night. It is strictly satire, as was "Waiting for Guffman", although scripted instead of improvised. Dunst plays the good, smart, poor, hard-working girl who has an after-school job putting makeup onto embalmed bodies, preparing them for the funeral. Her talent is tap-dancing and she practices while she applies does the job.She also works in the school cafeteria, scraping food off dirty dishes to prepare them for washing.Her chief rival is played by very pretty Denise Richards who is just the opposite, and whose mother (Kirstie Alley) is directing the pageant. As expected they have a number of conflicts during the days leading up to the pageant and during. As we all expect, Richards wins, Dunst finishes second.SPOILERS - The twist comes when Richards is accidentally killed, Dunst goes to the state contest sponsored by a beauty products company. At the big banquet where seafood is served, Dunst a die-hard Minnesotan, doesn't eat shellfish, everyone else gets food poisoning and end up in the hospital, and as the only one well Dunst is declared the winner.No lasting value, a simple little satire that is not pulled off nearly as well as "Dick", another Dunst satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kirsten Dunst is a princess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kirsten Dunst was the cutest thing in the black comedy about the pursuit of the American dream. Showing that fantasy and reality often mirror each other, one is reminded in this film of the Texas mother who hired a hit-man to go after the mom and her cheerleader daughter. Here, it is mom (Kirstie Alley) herself that uses murder to fix a beauty pageant for her daughter (Denise Richards).The biggest laughs in this satire comes from Ellen Barkin, who played Durst's trailer-trash mom and mom's friend Loretta (Allison Janney). They both had incredibly fake Minnesota accents.Adding to the laughs was the fact that just about everyone in this film smoke and drank constantly - not what you would expect at a teen pageant.Supporting was Sin City's Brittany Murphy and Matt Malloy as a sleazy judge. I know I will leave out some other fine performers as there were too many to mention.It was just a hoot and a thoroughly enjoyable movie about the business of pageants. Worth a look for Dunst and Richards alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While in a sick and twisted sort of way I see some true comic genius in this movie, I still wasn't sure whether or not I should have been gagging myself with a dull spoon at some moments. I don't know if it was the exaggerated mid-western accents or the dialogue itself at times. But as a farce on small towns and local beauty pageants you can't help but laugh at the heights of absurdity that this movie climbs too.The cast itself must be given immense credit for being able to perform with those accents and look serious at the same time. I will bet there were many takes where no one in this cast or crew could keep a straight face. Considering the materials they were given to work with their performances were, in my opinion, excellent. But still, that can only go so far, when a movie needs some kind of real help.The movie is campy, offensive to mid-westerners with no sense of humor, and at times painful to watch. But the movie does have its truly outrageously funny moments, which may or may not be good enough to make you watch this movie. I leave it up to you - to view or not to view.</fullReview>

I did like the girl who took the place of Kirsten Dunst when she tapped dance(no, that really wasn't her. If you look on the credits it will tell you the girl who really did the tap dancing.) What I want to know is how did they make her look so much like her? I couldn't even tell it was somebody else tapping intil I saw the credits. Anyway, save your money.

Given that the focus of the movie, beauty pageants, is so deserving of ridicule, the script for this film is woefully unfunny or interesting. Further, the writers do a poor imitation of Fargo by casting every character as an imbecile with a Minnesota accent -- it just doesn't work. I've seen worse films -- but not too many more.

		<shortDescription>Misses the mark by trying too hard..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here in a small town is the Miss Teen pageant held annually by a cosmetic company. A documentary film crew sets out to follow the contestants and their parents, in what is to be another mockumentary in the vein of great spoofs like 'Waiting for Gufman', 'This is Spinal Tap', and 'Best in Show'. Unfortunately it never makes the mark.While the actors/actresses are great, the film is really just a bunch of running gags. The whole thing just turns out unbelievable and that's its fault. The success of the other mockumentaries is that you are convinced that what you are seeing is REAL and REAL people, but in Drop Dead Gorgeous constant gags and humorous puns occur over and over again in what seems to be an attempt at trying too hard and it doesn't seem believable. In the end it doesn't pay off. Its as if the director just decided that everyone should try to speak like all the characters in 'Fargo' and it would work.It's a shame though because the players do well, the material seems workable (teen pageants are an obvious gold mine for comedic writing), and there were scenes that I found gut bustingly funny, but it became like nothing more than one of those SNL skits that runs on too long way after the punch line has been done. Too bad because even model Denise Richards (who I don't consider an actress whatsoever) did very VERY well in this role. She was I think the only bright star (and that says something when you have someone like Ellen Barkin in your picture).Rating 3.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Some of the comedy is insulting, to be honest, especially if you're sensitive to such things. Death and prejudice are issues too big to be tackled by such a movie.

		<fullReview>I had seen a trailer for this girlie fashion film, and as I can be a sucker for cheesy films with good people in it, I decided I should at least try this one. Basically in Mount Rose, Minnesota, the small town has a film crew filming the preparations for Sarah Rose Cosmetics Mount Rose American Teen Princess Pageant. Competitors in the competition include Amber Atkins (Kirsten Dunst), Rebecca 'Becky' Ann Leeman (Denise Richards), Leslie Miller (introducing Amy Adams) and Lisa Swenson (the recently deceased Brittany Murphy), all with their own "unique" talents and aspirations to win, being most beautiful and sticking to the rules. As the competition hots up it is obvious the girls will do anything to win that coveted title and crown, and even the parents, including Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley) and Annette Atkins (Ellen Barkin) are getting aggressive with each other. Eventually a winner is chosen, Becky, who goes on a float for the victory parade, which explodes, passing the crown on to second place runner up Amber. Also starring Allison Janney as Loretta, Will Sasso as Hank Vilmes, Mindy Sterling as Iris Clark, Sam McMurray as Lester Leeman, Michael McShane as Harold Vilmes, Mo Gaffney as Terry Macy, Nora Dunn as Colleen Douglas, Matt Malloy as John Dough, Lona Williams as Jean Kangas and Batman's Adam West. The documentary style is an interesting decision, the performers all get their moments, and there are some good dark humoured moments, so it is certainly a some-what likable independent black comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

Fun to see Kirsten Dunst, Denise Richards and Brittany Murphy come together as teenage rivals at 17, 28 and 22, respectively. Ellen Barkin and Allison Janney have their moments. But you might expect a lot more than this mildly black comedy. Put it another way: You might think "Spinal Tap meets Heathers ... that could work," but it's as though the filmmakers followed the Christopher Guest formula and then watered it down so that there would be nothing too subtle, nothing too original, and nothing that could go over the head of an average 11-year-old (the prime audience for the teen movie genre). This isn't Best in Show, or Saved, but it's diverting enough to have on in the background while doing homework.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tiara on a Turd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Browsing through other online comments, I was most surprised to see this one: "If you're a fan of such movies as "This is Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best In Show", you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie.' Huh? I believe a 180 correction needs to be said: If you're a fan of such incredibly well-written, thoughtful and satirical movies as "This is Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best In Show", you'll thoroughly wish you hadn't wasted your time with this movie. Granted, it's a pretty good cast, but people, people, you can't put a tiara on a turd and crown thee entertainment. Once you've stepped in this movie it's all you can do to clean it off yourself before you track it anywhere else. In fact, my wife sniffed this video out 15 minutes in and left the room before getting it all over herself. Not me, I managed to trudge through this mess for nearly an hour. Yes, in `Drop Dead Gorgeous' Michael Patrick Jann &amp; Lona Williams tried to clone the formula that has worked so well for Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy and others. And no, these writer/ directors do not have proprietary rights to the mockumentary format, but they do have, however, one element that Jann/Williams do not, and that's talent-a flair, finesse and faculty for the form. Aside from a solid performance by Kirsten Dunst, and yeoman efforts by Allison Janney and Ellen Barkin, this movie has more value as VHS tape than a DVD-at least with tape you can rerecord over it. Or maybe we'll be able to look back on this effort and perhaps thank it for ending the truly sorry career of Kirstie Alley, who possesses all the magnetism, charm and ability of a 3- day old bowl of shredded wheat. (And no, hawking bamboo for Pier 1 does not count as a `career boost.' -don't get me started there.)For the movie itself, it was predictable to waning to miserable in progression. Can anyone say they were surprised by any one element or character in this mess? Bitch Queen Stage Mother with Spoiled Princess Daughter, Apple Pie All-American Girl, Anorexic Champions, Retarded Townspeople. I'm surprised they didn't include a Pregnant Teen Smoker, or an Alcoholic Trailer-Trash Girlfriend, oh wait. they did! (And unless the title of your movie includes `DORF' or `Benny Hill,' getting hit in or falling on one's crotch DOES NOT COUNT AS COMEDY. We've see it every week on `America's Funniest Home Movies' folks, it's played out.)With the sometime exception of Dunst, by playing each and every character to its extreme, there was little measure left for true comedy-nuance, timing and development. I'd love to continue discussing how horrible `Drop Dead Gorgeous' was, but you get the point, or poop. Dunst earns this mess a pity vote. 2 out of 10 on the IMDB scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The subject is certainly an easy enough target, and there is plenty of unintentional humor in the actual events themselves. I, for one, wouldn't miss the laugh-filled but ever-so-serious Miss America Pageant every September. Okay, I admit to fast forwarding through some of the talent competition. Drop dead bland, this film features the very untalented Denise Richards and Kirsten Dunst as the front-runners in the race for Miss Teen Princess Minnesota. Well, they have to win Miss Teen Princess Mount Rose first. Dunst is Amber, the blonde from the wrong side of the trailer park, who works after school applying make-up to corpses in the mortuary. She aspires to TV journalism, and Diane Sawyer is her role model. Becky (Denise Richards) is the spoiled rich girl who sees winning as part of her divine right. She has little chance at "Miss Congeniality." Kirstie Alley plays Becky's scheming mom, who won the title herself 20 years and 50 pounds ago. The queen mother will do just about anything to keep the crown in the family. Anything. Little surprise when mysterious "accidents" cause the contestant pool to shrink. Amber's mom, a trailer-trash boozer, is played by the reliable Ellen Barkin, to no avail. The funniest thing that happens to her is a suspicious mobile home fire which fuses a Miller Beer can to her hand. Most of the supporting players, stuck with leftover Fargo accents, are treated with condescension. The State of Minnesota should consider a class action suit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely a "teen flick." It's tasteless and stupid, but it can keep you laughing. The film is larger than life and exaggerated to the point you just want to turn it off. The best part was played by Kirsten Dunst, but the rest just weren't funny. Kirstie Alley doesn't suit the documentary style role and she got annoying. Considering it's a beauty pageant it's obvious the characters had to be drama queens but it could have been more subtle. At least films such as Miss Congeniality the performance of Sandra Bullock kept you sane from the over-the-top contestants.However, this film does have some memorable quotes, such as when Amber Atkins explains why she doesn't eat shellfish (because they carry their home around and you don't know where it's been). Thus, a subtle dig at trailer people possibly? Some of these quotes do stick in your mind, but after a while the black comedy fades. Scenes such as when the girl with the eating disorder in the wheelchair was just sick and tasteless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously the writer and director had seen the Guest mockumentaries and tried to clone them via a smalltown beauty pagent. Unlike Guests' works this one never really works and attempts to pull it's laughs via retard jokes, trailer park trash, barfing and untimely demises in predictible, unfunny fashion.Part of Waiting for Guffmans and Spinal Tap's appeal is that they don't resort to "cheap" jokes to get the laughs they rely on more subtle and more effective means. Also Guest's crew are a lot more polished comedians than the Drop, Dead Gorgeous cast which goes a long ways.It seems like beauty pageants are prime material for a satire but poor jokes, script, editing direction and cast make this one a failed effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flashes of comedic brilliance brighten this dull film. For every former beauty queen hawking sausages in a bloody apron, there is lame interplay between the two main beauty queen contestants, and much mugging and accent butchering by the impressively talentless Kirstie Alley. How has this lady and, for that matter, Tony Danza, enjoyed a successful career when so many talented people can't get work? Such are the mysteries of show business. With better editing, directing and casting- this could have been a very funny film. All it serves in the end, is to show how good Christpher Guest (This is Spinal Tap, Waiting For Guffman, Best of Show) is at mockumentaries. Watch this film, then any of Guest's spoofs to enjoy the difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drop Dead Gorgeous is an unfortunate entry into the "mockumentary" category made great by Waiting For Guffman andSpinal Tap. And if you've seen either of those movies (and Best InShow, which came later), Drop Dead Gorgeous would have to lookamateurish in comparison. DDG borrows heavily from Waiting ForGuffman in particular (both are mock documentaries about amidwestern small town pageant, with "interviews" with thetownspeople, etc.), but really falls flat on its face because itssense of humor is so exaggerated and mean spirited.Because the subject matter (beauty pageants) is so easy to makefun of, the movie has to be very subtle in order to appear clever. That's why Waiting For Guffman was funny - the actors appearedso genuine that the "mocking" hit the target right on. Drop DeadGorgeous, on the other hand, tries to hit you over the head with itstoo-obvious jokes in every single scene and gets tedious real fast. You might say that it's unfair to compare the sort-of-legendaryWaiting For Guffman to this movie, but I don't think Drop DeadGorgeous could have existed without being influenced by Guffman. Someone here mentioned that this movie kind of resembles JohnWaters' flicks (Pecker, Hairspray, Polyester) because of how overthe top and raunchy they are. I think that could have been a goodpossibility if Drop Dead Gorgeous had a better director. Thedirector here plays all his characters as if they had mental defects,which is not only mean spirited but juvenile as well. He also hasall the actors shouting their lines in a stilted, super exaggerated,fake midwestern accent. This is especially obvious in Kirstie Alley,Kirsten Dunst, and Brittany Murphy's characters. Their accentsdefinitely didn't resemble anything from the midwest, the south, orwell, anywhere. I mean, if you're gonna make fun of someone'saccent, at least get it right. In the end, the people who made thismovie come out looking more foolish than the people they're tryingto portray, which is quite a feat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just cannot believe how insipid this supposedly cutting social satire actually is. This film is as subtle as a sledgehammer, and the shame of it is that the concept is great.First, it took me two tries to get through the first five minutes. I don't know what the producers were trying to say by setting this movie in Minnesota -- I recently moved here from Southern California, so I have some suspicions -- but they could have at least hired a dialect coach. Didn't they check with the Coen Brothers? Kirstie Alley's accent was just atrocious, and Kirsten Dunst's was about as consistent as Kevin Costner's English accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Denise Richards didn't even bother with one (good for her), and the rest of the cast had either non-existent or ridiculous accents.** SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED **And if that was all that was wrong with the movie, it would still be watchable. However, the acting was as bad as the accents and the script was even worse. Hands for everyone who guessed the float would explode as soon as the antagonist says, "It smells like gasoline"? How about those who knew that their would be a massive food poisoning outbreak as soon as Dunst said that she didn't eat shellfish? And how many thought that the poison twist was just a trite way for the writers to unbox themselves from a very lengthy movie? At the 90-minute mark it seems fishy indeed. And if you pay attention to the very end, you'll hear people scream just BEFORE the reporter gets it.Also, there are some very unfunny and offensive shots taken at handicapped people, both physically and mentally. Ellen Barkin's attempt to open a beer can with a prosthetic arm was just stupid, and the whole Hank character served no purpose other than "let's laugh at the retard" -- and if you think that it's not PC to use that term, the movie uses it several times from several different characters, even some of the sympathetic ones.Dunst wasn't bad (except for the accent), and Richards was pretty good, but almost everyone else in this movie stinks it up. Honorable mention for Worst Actress was a tie between the two 'state board' officials at the Puke Pageant. These two were the pits in a movie straining to bottom out. If you want to see an effective and intelligent satire of beauty pageants, watch Smile. Avoid this cinematic t**d at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..and I see about 20-40 movies a year.Drop Dead Gorgeous purports to be a scathing mockumentary of the beauty pageant industry and of Bible Belt America. I will admit to having laughed at a few of the jokes, but the sophomoric humor couldn't carry this film much beyond the first half hour, and the plot is so unbelievable that it detracts from the film's mock-documentary style.Ellen Barkin was refreshing as the trailer-trash mother willing to do anything to advance her daughter's beauty career, and most of the actors played their parts well, but the characters in the film were so overly stereotyped that I knew and had seen all that I wanted to know or see of them after ten minutes.I was not offended by the utter tastelessness of the jokes (although many may quite well be), but they simply weren't funny. In fact, that Hollywood released such an over-the-top, politically incorrect film is the only redeeming quality that I could find with its production. Too bad they couldn't have found a better vehicle.Whether you're looking for satire, deadpan mockumentory humor, or sophomoric jokes, the industry has produced many films well more deserving of your attention. Try `Dr. Strangelove', `This is Spinal Tap', or `Animal House' as examples of each of the three.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had real potential, but its just stupid. I have never seen a film with so many unlikeable characters- but I suppose that was the whole point. It certainly succeeds as a satire of American beauty pagents, but its a real hit and miss. Some parts are right on the mark, while in other scenes the film makers seem to be really pulling at straws. Its a novel concept, and a comedy definitely should have been made on this subject, but a lot of the time it just wasnt that funny. It had potential, but it was if some of the actors couldn't really pull off their character convincingly enough- although they all had the whitetrash attitude down very well. I wouldn't ever recommend this film to anyone-for the sole reason that it was a bore, and should have been heaps better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DROP DEAD GORGEOUS is the latest in the long line of films influenced, both in terms of style and subject matter, by smart animation (e.g. RUSHMORE, ELECTION); here leavened with a dose of Michael Ritchie. Indeed, it plays like an extended episode of SOUTH PARK. Like that work of once-genius, it concerns the foibles, self-destructive eccentricity and ludicrious ambitions of small-town life, filmed in a - yawn - documentary stylee, an inverse BLAIR WITCH if you will. All the characters are cartoons, so we don't care what happens to them, and there are many satisfyingly harmless acts of gratuitous violence.Of course, it's not really like SOUTH PARK at all. That show's nihilistic contempt channelled into childish destructiveness is absent here. You see, GORGEOUS wants to Make Points, fatal for any would-be satirical film. One of the problems is that the satire is remarkably laboured and obvious. Every 'irony' is telegraphed ten miles off. American moms are ambitious! 'Murderously' ambitious! American fathers are spineless wimps! (although the fact that he looks the spit of Bill Clinton is pointedly amusing) The American Dream (yes! that old chestnut!) favours ruthless individuality over community and ethics! American gun laws are idiotic and dangerous! The cult of beauty leads to anorexia, dysfunction and unhappiness! YOU! DON'T! SAY! SERIAL MOM is a much sharper, richer satire with some of these themes.What is most offensive about the film is how, like HEATHERS, it is desperate to be seen as sassy, sharp and subversive, and yet underneath offers the same old Hollywood teen tripe. A supposed satire on suffocating small town life, the American way of life, or the ethics of documentary, is reduced to another teen movie about a nice, hard-working, plain (okay, maybe not so plain), decent girl, and a spoiled, rich, preening, gorgeous bitch. Guess who wins. How she wins, though, is quite circuitous from the norm, shocking, and very funny. There is a cheeky suggestion that the only way she succeeds is by benefitting from just the same 'accidents' as her nemesis.Finally, the treatment of the subject matter itself is problematic. The film is about the build-up to a local beauty pageant, and, inevitably, there is the sight of very beautiful young ladies doing nubile, excitable things. A paedophile is prominently placed to distance us from this position, but, as he points out, what he's doing is no different from what the documentary crew, and, by implication, we the viewers, are doing. This might be radical self-reflexivity, or it might be gutless self-serving: a having of our ethical cake, and lecherously eating it.But that's enough carping. What's most important is that the film is very entertaining, from its shameless title-pun theft from a rubbish Tony Curtisfarce, to a wonderfully drawn mix of characters and caricatures, random violence, hysterical set pieces and priceless lines. Things pick up immeasurably as the pageant nears, and you begin to forgive the film its flaws. The scene where Denise Richards serenades a model Christ is a jawdropping comic standout.The documentary framework, irritating at first, is nicely worked out, with asides on objectivity and interference, especially at the end, when the crew meet their buddies from COPS. The performances are very likeable, even Kirstin Dunst in a drippy role, but Richards is a howl, and hopefully won't be stuck in a career rut of just looking gorgeous. The film goes on way to long after the hysterically funny swan demise, but GORGEOUS is great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the opportunity to go to the preview for this movie about two weeks ago and afterwards, wished that I had the chance to turn back time and get that 2 hours of my life back.The basic plot line is about a teen beauty pageant in a small 'redneck' town. This alone should have been warning enough to me but I went to the movie anyway. The movie films from the perspective of a TV company brought in to document the pageant. Throughout the pageant, the different contestants are interviewed to find out a little about each of them. As the movie progresses, pageant members 'mysteriously' die or get injured (although it's not too hard to figure out who the culprit(s) could be). The pageant basically boils down to two contestants, one of which is the pageant organizers 'perfect' (Richards) daughter and the other, a poor 'cinderella' type character. The movie follows the toilet humor of the other summer movies (Austin Powers, American Pie, Big Daddy) but I found it to be pointless and poorly written. The acting was mediocre and towards the end I just wanted the movie to end. Shock humor is used almost exclusively but unlike American Pie, I found it to be crass, and more importantly, frequently completely pointless to the movie. At least in AP, it was relevant to the story. In this movie, it seemed that some of it was put in just for the shock value and hopefully generate a laugh. Now, I do have to admit that some of it was humorous (most of it revolved around the hardware store owner and his mentally handicapped son) but it was not very frequent. The ending was definately rushed. It almost seemed like the director had gotten to a certain point in making the movie and gotten bored with making the film and just wrapped everything up.One final note, if Denise Richards ever wants to be taken seriously, she should start choosing her roles more carefully. Right now, she seems like an actor that is getting roles purely for her looks.Overall, I would hesitate recommending this movie. If you do want to see it, go as a matinee or on cheap night. You'll probably agree after seeing it that you could have spent your evening doing something better. If you want to see a toilet humor movie then go see American Pie.</fullReview>

Yes, it has its "laughing out loud" moments, but by and large it is very poorly made, and not worth 90 minutes to catch the two or three funnies.The Director was shooting for a mockumentary, in the vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP, or WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. But the idiot did not think the audience would be attentive enough to notice his use of multiple cameras, or clean cinematography. Second, a mockumentary must have a believable storyline. DROP DEAD GORGEOUS was the furthest thing possible from believable. It was a farce, more akin to AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON. Now there is nothing wrong with a good farce! But just don't try to sell it as a mockumentary.And therein lies the answer. Run, don't walk from this movie.

		<shortDescription>So many things to hate in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start...Well, the misuse of the mockumentary form should be mentioned. So many of my favorite comedies, from Spinal Tap to Waiting For Guffman have used this form to hilarious effect. What the people who made this film missed, though, is that these films rely on subtlety and a certain kind of naturalism that comes from the use of improvisation (and talented actors, of course.) The comedy here is so over the top and histrionic, the acting so ridiculous, that the documentary style falls apart. It seems like the filmmaker's used this form as an excuse to have the characters speak all of the exposition directly into the camera. They certainly don't seem married to the premise, as they basically act out a standard comedy plot (minus the humor, that is) in front of the supposed documentary camera. The absurdities here include a dance scene where there are at least 7 or 8 camera angles, and plenty of private conversations. By the end, the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that they were even making a mockumentary, as the camera seems to be wherever an important plot point is occurring.Second point. I'm not particularly offended by tasteless humor, but here they really seemed to have forgotten to actually write any jokes. It's as if it's inherently funny to show a huge retarded man-child or a girl dying from anorexia. In fact, the poor anorexic girl must have really made the director bust a gut, as they drag her out twice without writing a single joke for her.All of the characters have their supposedly hilarious quirk, which is basically repeated every time they show up on screen ("I'm a slut", "I like sign language", "My brother's gay.")It all grinds away to a dull and obvious conclusion and then, inexplicably, keep on going, until you fear that this desperately unfunny movie will simply never end. At only an hour and a half, it feels like it takes all day to end, but you will be thankful to see it go.</fullReview>

The critics went ballistic on a movie like waterboy for using dumb comedy...Well at least Waterboy drew a few laughs...This movie was just dumb...Sure there was a plot to this movie...but was it good? No!...This is just my opinion, but if your a 15-18 year old male like I am don't rent this movie to please your girlfriend...Unless you want to sit through an hour and forty five minutes of the worst movie of the past decade...I gave it a 2 out of 10, because I grew up watching Kristy Alley on Cheers, but honestly this movie deserved a 0.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only two good things about this movie - Ellen Barkin and Kirsten Dunst. Even they can't save the movie. This movie is just painful to watch. I must admit, I didn't even watch all of it, my four friends and I fast-forwarded through several parts. I laughed maybe twice.This was also the most politically incorrect movie I have ever seen. Several times I was offended. I guess these things were supposed to be funny. Well, guess what - they weren't!Don't waste your time or money on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a stupid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so let's get this straight. The producers of this movie thought that it would be funny because it had some attempted Something About Mary humour in it. They had parts that tried to offend everyone from Jewish people to Japanese people, deaf and the gay and of course the mentally challenged fat guy. So the producers of this did the same thing that the producers of A Midnight Summers Dream did. They started counting the money before the film was ever made. They thought a film that relies on similarities of a previous film was something that would work regardless of how stupid of an idea it was. Something About Mary was funny because it was crude, yes, but it was also funny because it had a story and not just jokes stuck in the film for shock value. Drop Dead Gorgeous is a terrible film and how it ever got past the boardroom is beyond me. It is occassionally humourous, I'll give it that, but how hard is it to write humour when you are Xeroxing what made another film funny? But as we all know, when making a copy of something, the copy always comes out worse than the original. Drop Dead Gorgeous is in a class by itself for terrible movies and terrible photocopies. Let's start off first by looking at what is such a blatant rip off that it was painful watching it, and that was the mentally challenged fat guy. This guy might as well have been a brother of Cameron Diaz's from Something About Mary. But here he was thrown in for effect. He was thrown in simply for comic relief because they knew they didn't have any humour in the film. But what made the same character work in Mary was that he was a part of the film, he was a part of who her character was. He wasn't just a sideshow. Here he is. There is absolutely no point for him in this film except for us to laugh at his stupidity. If he wasn't in the film it wouldn't be any better or any worse. He is just there to be there. Nothing more and nothing less. If you see the film, ask yourself why it was necessary to have him. There are also silly caricatures of Orientals in this movie. Again, what was the point? And to have 90% of the film done documentary style was just annoying. I of course can see what they were trying to do in the film, and that is to show how pathetic some people can get when it comes to their kids and competing. It also tries to portray small town America as silly trailer trash that have nothing better to do than drink their lives away so that when one has an accident, a beer can is molded to her hand. I honestly can't believe how bad this movie is. It is so bad!What I did like about it ( and this is the only thing ) was Kirsten Dunst. She is way too good to be in a movie like this. Her energy is contagious and at one point late in the film I almost started enjoying it. But that was almost. Even Dunst's energy, charm and sweet smile can't save this awful picture. This is one of those movies that makes me mad. Mad that a film like this can be made when there has to be some struggling young person out there that has a brilliant idea and no way of getting in the door. And then they see garbage like this and it must make their skin crawl. It's strange, this summer has generally been a good summer for films. Star Wars, American Pie and Big Daddy have been good entertainment, but then I have also seen three of the worst films I have seen in quite some time, that being Wild Wild West, The Haunting and now this. What a bummer. What a waste of ten bucks. Maybe what Hollywood producers should do is exactly what Apollo Creed did in the first Rocky. Find some unknown guy with a script and pay him scale and then film his story. It would have to be better than this piece of trash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only charm of this film was Ellen Barkin, who looks great and should be in better made films. Still, in the long line of Pep Squad rip-offs, this one was the closest bet. I reccommend watching this back to back with the other films and really inspect them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you put no value on your time and have no concept of comedy -- this is the movie for you!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I beg you not to waste your time and money on this poor excuse for a film. From the "comedic" scenes that leave you thinking, 'did that just happen?' to the completely predictable and unoriginal plot, this movie is an incredible failure. It's understandable that Kirstie Alley would stoop to such a level - after 'Look Who's Talking' and 'For Richer or Poorer', come on - but Kirsten!! how dare you? I'm appalled that you would even consider adding such a "film" to your repertoire. Bad career move! All in all - I could not be more disappointed with this movie. I rented it expecting an entertaining comedy, but ended up with an incredibly poor excuse for film. I can't warn you enough - I DO NOT recommend this movie. If you truly enjoy movies, as I do, then I beg you to stick with something a little more respectable and worthy of good reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Avoid at all costs.Based on the previews our family rented this movie on Christmas Day expecting a fun family movie. The PG13 US rating also indicated it would be a clean "safe" film - that is what we wanted for our day together.How disappointed and saddened we were. As fans of WAITING FOR GUFFMAN we enjoy mockumentary type films, however, this was not Guffman. Guffman had a great script and excellent acting. This film had a terrible script, was way darker than we expected.Two particular components of the film suggest a PG13 was way too soft. One scene completely mocked the Crucifixion of Christ and others dealt crudely with the work of morticians. Neither scenes were required and should have alerted the ratings board.A completely hopeless film. Sad ending, no joy, poor jokes.The only positive thing I will mention was the performance of the actress who played Amber Atkins...she was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen. I left the theatre with a splitting headache. The movie was not funny and the cast was awful except for the YOUNG GIRL WHO GIGGLED ALL THE TIME. ASIDE FROM her I cannot believe that these hollywood actors belittled themselves and took on such stupid roles. Stupid is not the word. I felt as if I were watching a bad bad bad student film. The acting again was awful awful awful.....I do not know how this movie got distribution. Oh well.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another ridiculous, contrived piece of unfunny trash. Maybe some people find paedophilia, violent abuse and exploitation of people with mental disabilities funny, but I don't.The trailer for the film portrayed it as being quite funny -- it wasn't until I got into the cinema that I realized that the trailer has contained the only funny lines in the whole picture. To me, this was not "satire" nor "black comedy", it was just insulting and pathetic. It is thus far the only film I have wanted to walk out in the middle of, because I cared so little about the characters or what happened to them.The violence and deaths are disturbing in the way that they are treated as a joke... and not a funny one at that. The suffering that people endure in the film is very real, and yet the consequences of their actions are trivial. It is inconsistent. If you want to make suffering a joke, make it funny. If you want it to be serious, deal with it seriously. A big thumbs down.</fullReview>

I seriously laughed once in the entire movie. It had extremely bad taste and was really terrible. The acting was cookie-cutter, and the script was awful. After it I was so mad at myself for wasting the afternoon I went around asking people to hit me and telling them to never, NEVER, NNEEVVEERR, watch that movie. It really is my least favorite movie. I give it 0* out of 1000</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is mean-spirited, poorly scripted, and rife with hackneyed stereotypes. An example of the "subtle humor" inherent in the script: a man who is judging a teenage beauty pageant says, ". . . not that I like little girls or anything. . . " Repeating himself several times. The audience's intelligence is frequently assailed in such a manner."Drop Dead Gorgeous" is told in the form of a "pseudo-documentary" on a teen beauty pageant in a small midwestern town. It attempts to be a biting satire. It fails. We are meant to hate the characters in the film. We do. We are meant to laugh at their violence, their ignorance, their greed. We do not. There are no surprises in this film, no insights, no clever intricacies. Perhaps the thing that I found most disturbing about this movie is it's utter snobbery. Not only is this meant to be an indictment of beauty pageants, but it also intends to jeer at small town America. The small mindedness, cruelty, and blatant stupidity of the townspeople are appalling. Even Kirsten Dunst's performance as the guileless Amber Atkins is irritating at best. As for all of the otherwise fine actors who participated in the making of this film, for shame!I have to give "Drop Dead Gorgeous" credit for producing such a strong emotional reaction in me. It is rare that I ever watch a film and actually find it offensive. Boring and empty, yes, but offensive, hardly ever. It is rare that I ever stumble across a film that is so unrelentingly hateful towards humanity yet simultaneously totally stupid. 1/10 is too high a score for this failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not funny enough--contains one of the worst point of views ever! *1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DROP DEAD GORGEOUS (1999) *1/2Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, and Allison Janney Director: Michael Patrick Jann 97 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language, crude humor, sex-related material and violence) By Blake French: You gotta hand it to "Drop Dead Gorgeous," it may have one of the most ineffective point of views in movie history, but some of its humor is enough to drive one into a wither. Now, about that point of view: The movie is set up as a mockumentary, a movie, like "The Blair Witch Project" that is always seen through the eyes of some stranger recording the film's characters every move. Instead of getting to know the characters, we're stuck with watching irrelevant interviews the documentary crew shoots. When character development is needed, the movie's style is quickly changed in order to fit the occupying scene, and in many cases, it develops the competition that this movie requires. Instead of inducing audience participation, the filmmakers chose to use an inconsistent and repulsive way to explore this movie's story, which in itself is almost a sure flop, although original elements are present.  The plot: A small documentary crew is set out to shot a movie on a minor Minnesota teen beauty pageant that has been a tradition in the town for years. But instead of investigating the documentary crew, exactly how "The Blair Witch Project" succeeded, the filmmakers focus on the pageant contestants. We first meet the past winner who lives in a hospital because of her sever eating disorder. A kind contender running for this year's prize, Amber Atkins, helps by brushing her hair, which falls out with very pull. The girl explains to Amber that the way she became beauty queen is running many miles a day with only a few hundred calories. Later on throughout the production, this anorexic character is used for even more effective laughs.  Competition is soon red hot between the pageant organizer, Gladys Leeman, and her daughter's success, who is a rebellious Denise Richards as Becky Leeman. The contestants who seem to have a pretty good chance at winning are dropping like flies. One blows up while driving a tractor. Another is killed when a stage light drops on their head during rehearsal. Even Amber discovers her life is in danger when first her boyfriend appears at her after school job (the morgue) with a bullet between the eyes and a note that reads "you're next" on him, and the her trailer home blows up with her mother in it. She survives but must live as a handicap for the rest of her life. We have already established that structurally this movie fails. Also to its certain demise, the characters are too very week in motivation. The main antagonist is eliminated 2/3 of the way though, leaving only the film's presence of high energy to carry itself though the end. Although the characters are well cast and acted, they make such a big deal about such small things that it is a strain to laugh even when the film offers funny moments. Most of them do offer a laugh of two along the way, especially an outgoing joke that details the pageant judges, but even that it milked for all that it could be. You see, even though some of the humor does work, lets face it, there is only so far this material can be stretched. I don't know what happened in the last thirty minutes of this film, but they were wonderfully inspirational and funny. This is especially true for a particular scene in which the pageant contestants compete during a rehearsal styled "Fitness USA." And another as the anorexic girl surrenders her crown as she dances to a final song she sings. Lets not forget she is in a wheelchair. So here's my recommendation: go to the multiplex, see another movie, walk out of that theater about half way though, and walk into this one during its last thirty minutes. That way, "Drop Dead Gorgeous" can live up to its script. Brought to you by New Line Cinema.</fullReview>
