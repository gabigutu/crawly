		<shortDescription>The title alone will have you humming the song</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like musicals. They never made any sense to me. Don't get me wrong, I love music; it's an important part of my life. I love movies also, and while the two often compliment each other, sometimes I'm repelled. It's probably the dancing. A person breaking into a complicated dance number, seemingly unaware of their surroundings, or worse yet, in complete synch with a complete stranger is like making fun of the movie, as if to say, "Please don't take us seriously, we like to sing and dance." Or even more ridiculous, "Let's not fight, let's settle this dispute with a song and dance." Forget about suspension of disbelief.This film however, I manage to enjoy. I once was given the task of my film teacher to watch the film and keep track of all the cuts in the film. Well, sometime after ten minutes I lost track because I was so wrapped up in the story. It really is an interesting period in the history of cinema, told well, and with well placed song and dance numbers that at times drag on, but that seems to be more of an excuse to show off the technicolour than anything else. They build you up to it slowly. The first few numbers don't break out at an inappropriate time. It doesn't last though, but by then they've got you.With such memorable tunes as these, it's hard to imagine them going wrong. When Gene Kelly sings the title piece, somehow time stands still as you're swept up in one of the most memorable scenes in film history. Just reading the title in print has likely caused you to hum a few bars, or sing a few words. Or maybe, just maybe, walk out without an umbrella when you know it's raining. One thing's for sure, if all Gene Kelly did was choreograph the dance numbers, he more than deserves the co-directing credit he has.They simply don't make films like this anymore. Which in some ways is a testament to the film's theme and narrative. The business of show is constantly in a state of evolution. The narrative portrays a time period when silent films were being replaced by "talkies" with sound, yet the musical genre itself has almost all but disappeared with the exception of animated films with musical numbers, and rare live-action pieces.One might speculate that Hollywood overdid the musical. Personally, I can't get into them. Most of the time it seems like a drawn out affair, but this film is something special. Considering my feelings about musicals, it would have to take a film of this one's caliber to make me sit up and take notice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fabulous musical romance about film technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song &amp; dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in "The Nanny" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.But the more serious aspects of the plot are fascinating as well. In a significant way, Singing in the Rain is about film technology. Film technology is the hinge of the plot, after all. The climax and dénouement are decided by the advent of synchronized sound in the film industry. We see studio head R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) demonstrating sound films at the party where Lockwood sees Selden for the second time, providing two big turning points at once. There are sequences of actors heading off to diction coaches, as happened in reality once sound entered the scene, and also in reality as in the film some actor's careers were jeopardized by having to suddenly master a new skill.But Singing in the Rain is about technology on another level, too. Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen go to great lengths to ensure that the film is an exemplar of state-of-the-art film technology in 1952. For example, the beautiful Technicolor cinematography is emphasized by the fabulously colorful costumes and production design--they're showing off cutting edge color. The sound is as good as it could be in 1952, and the fact that this is a musical helps show that off. The sets and effects are complex and an attempt is made to show them off as well.Donen and Kelly often play up the artificiality of the sets and effects to emphasize artistry and technology. This is clearly shown in the "Make 'Em Laugh" sequence (and surrounding events) and the extended "Broadway Rhythm Ballet" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Showing off this artistry and technology also occurs very subtly, as with the rain in the "Singing in the Rain" sequence. Even today, rain machines are frequently employed in a way that it appears to be raining on film, but in reality, it's just enough coverage to produce the illusion. In the "Singing in the Rain" sequence, they make sure that you can see the whole area is getting flooded, and they use Gene Kelly's umbrella, as torrents of water bounce off of it, to emphasize that no matter where he goes, "rain" is pouring down on him.While there are many musicals I like as much as Singing in The Rain, this is one of the better-loved examples of that genre, and for good reason. Any musical lover has surely seen this already, and if not, they should run out now and pick it up on DVD. If you're relatively unfamiliar with classic Hollywood musicals, this is one of the best places to start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Hollywood musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't my all time favorite (that goes to "Meet me in St. Louis") but this is definitely in the top 10. This is a fictitous musical comedy of the 1920s when silent films became "talkies". It chronicles how it affects Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), his leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and Lockwood's new girlfriend Kathey Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Problem is Lina has a voice that can cut glass and doesn't like lockwood falling for Selden...This movie has one highlight after another. Almost all the numbers are great--the title tune, "Make 'Em Laugh", "Beautiful Girl", "Good Morning" on and on. My two favorites are two short ones: "Fit as a Fiddle" which has incredible dancing from Kelly and O'Connor and "Would You?" at the end. Kelly isn't that good acting (he never was) but his dancing is superb; Reynolds (only 19 when she did this) is beautiful, energetic and full of life; Hagen is uproarious as Lamont (she was nominated for an Academy Award--she should have won!) and O'Connor is just great as Cosmo (his "Make Em' Laugh" number has astounding dancing). It's hard to believe that Reynolds and O'Connor hated working with Kelly (he was obnoxious, VERY demanding and a tyrant)--it's a credit to their acting that it never comes through.I only have one (small) complaint--the big, elaborate production number with Cyd Charisse in the middle. It LOOKS great and colorful--but it brings the film to a screeching halt and is way too long. After it ends I have trouble remembering where the film left off! Still, that's a small problem. This remains one of the 10 best movie musicals ever made. HIGHLY recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many good things can be and have been said about this one and they're all true. It's a great movie. The title number gives us Don Lockwood (Kelly)...In love as no other person has ever been in love, no doubt. He steps out the door and it's raining but he's oblivious to the rain. Who needs an umbrella when you've got wings on your heart and on your feet? Not the incomparable Gene Kelly as he treats us to THE single finest moment in the history of cinema. Do not miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is one of the best movies ever made. The film is beautiful, tuneful, and loads of fun. While it pokes fun at Hollywood it also does so with great love. Little bits and pieces of Hollywood lore find their way into this great film and it's a pleasure to get the joke or recognize the real star they're referring to.The star trio is just perfect: Gene Kelly give a funny performance as the hammy silent actor; Donald O'Connor makes the most of his "second banana" role; Debbie Reynolds is perfect as the ingénue trying to break into films. The three stars perform many memorable numbers, including Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain" classic; all three in the "Good Mornin'" number; O'Connor's "Make 'Em Laugh"; and Kelly and Reynolds in "You Were Meant for Me." The masterpiece however may be the "Gotta Dance" production number with Kelly and Cyd Charisse?just perfect. Also great fun are O'Connor and Kelly in "Fit as a Fiddle" and "Moses Supposes."There are of course other production numbers, including the montage that shows Hollywood's race to transition to talkies, a scene that ends in the "Beautiful Girl" number featuring Jimmy Thompson. Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) won an Oscar nomination and steals the film in a classic comedy performance. Also good are Millard Mitchell, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno, King Donovan, Kathleen Freeman, Mae Clarke, Julius Tannen, and Madge Blake.The great trick to this film is that while Reynolds is supposedly "lip syncing" for Hagen, it's really Hagen's voice that Reynolds is miming to as in the "I Would, Would You" number. The final miming act is Hagen mouthing "Singin' in the Rain" is really Reynolds. It gets so confusing you can't tell who is lip syncing whose voice.Lots of Hollywood lore retold in this film. Hagen's Lamont character is a veiled reference to Norma Talmadge, who supposedly failed in talkies because of her New York accent. It's also a reference to Louise Brooks, whose talkie debut in The Canary Murder Case was all dubbed. When Kelly screams "I LOVE YOU" it's a reference to John Gilbert in is talkie debut flop. His Glorious Night. Kathleen Freeman's diction coach character is a reference to Constance Collier, who returned to Hollywood as a coach. And on it goes.A great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I noticed in reading the comments of this movie is that nobody recognized the screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Without their screenplay the movie does not get made. It is a great script that was made better by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens' fluid direction. Everything in this movie glides effortlessly. Throw in dancing by Donald O'connor, Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse and of course Gene Kelly, Great songs and the willingness of producer Arthur Freed to let the creative people to do their thing and you have a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dancingest, funniest musical of Hollywood's golden age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have produced the best musical written directly for the screen. They have used the period in film history during the transition to sound movies and embroidered it with the wonderful songbook of Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. The icing on the cake, of course is the choreography of Kelly and Donen. From the first moment, the movie takes flight as Kelly relates the tale of his rise as a silent film star with his sidekick, the incomparable Donald O'Connor. Watch the flying feet of O'Connor and Kelly in the "Fit as a Fiddle" number. It doesn't get much better than this. Everyone is familiar with the classic "Singin' in the Rain" sequence. Donald O'Connor's hysterical "Make 'em Laugh" number is probably the funniest musical three minutes on film. Even the Broadway Ballet is a kaleidoscope of color and movement, with a minimum of the highbrow balletic choreography found in the later "An American in Paris."What makes "Singin'" such an entertaining classic is its superb integration of comedy and music. Jean Hagen gives the performance of her life as the vocally challenged silent film star, Lena Lamont. Every scene she's in is a comic gem. Her "fingernails on a blackboard" voice and massacre of the English language make her a figure of ridicule. However, in the end when she finally gets her comeuppance, one can't help feeling a little sorry for her.This delightful film has been given its due on video. On VHS it can be purchased with the complete remastered soundtrack on CD. The laserdisc versions include one with commentary by film historian Ronald Haver (Criterion) and the film-only version from MGM/UA Home Video with a restored Dolby Digital stereo soundtrack., Last,but not least,is a masterful rendering on DVD with, unfortunately, no supplementary material to speak of.This is truly a film for all time that can be watched just for its entertainment value and studied as probably the apex of the Hollywood musical in its Golden Age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trot Out the Accolades--It's Unparalleled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like "Singin' in the Rain."There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking ("She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers ("Fit as a Fiddle," "Good Mornin'").Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to "You Were Meant for Me." Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff!If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it!PS: In the "rent-this-too" category, if you've seen and love "Singin' in the Rain," check out "The Band Wagon." It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The talkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The transition from the silent film era to the newly arrived technique of the 'talkies' proved to be the ruin for many well established stars that were great on the screen, but who had no professional training in the theater, or otherwise, and had horrible speaking voices. Thus, a star of the magnitude of Lina Lamont, suffers a hard blow to her career and ego.That's the basis of one of the best movies about old Hollywood of all times: "Singin' in the Rain". The film is one of the classics it is because of the marvelous direction of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, two men who knew a lot about musicals. The screen play is by one of the best people in the business, Betty Comden and Adolph Green.MGM was the studio that employed all the stars one sees in the film, and what a cast they put together: Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Cyd Charisse in a dancing part, Millard Mitchell and Rita Moreno. As if those names weren't big enough, there is the fantastic musical numbers that even, viewing them today, have kept their freshness because of the care in which this film was crafted."Singin' in the Rain" is one of the best musicals of all times. It's right up there with the best of them thanks to the vision of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and it will live forever as more people discover this wonderful example of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Divine Miss Charisse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to confine my comments about "Singin' in the Rain" to the "Broadway Rhythm" sequence where Cyd Charisse steals the movie without saying a word. In my view, Charisse, who is still gorgeous at 83, was the quintessential movie dancer of the 1950s. Her height, elegance, aloofness and those impossibly long legs -- along with an uncanny ability to match her style to that of her partner -- makes watching her dance a mesmerizing experience.Many have said that the two numbers in "Singin' in the Rain" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know? as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the "crazy veil" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a "Word of Mouth" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion?not as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.Wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" could be considered on the top of movie musicals... It is fresh, imaginative and enjoyable...Arthur Freed wrote the lyrics to the songs and they were excellent, specially the title number "Singin' in the Rain" which Stanley Kubrick repeated it in his black comedy "A Clockwork Orange," in 1971...But the mysterious power of "Singin' in the Rain" remains in the script, written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green whose sprightly adaptation were also shown in musicals like "On the Town," "It Always Fair Weather," and "Bells Are Ringing." The film is a brilliant musical, the best picture by far of Hollywood in transition...It is a gentle satire on the movie modes and manners of the twenties, put together around the problem that faced several actors and studios in their transition from silent films to talkies... This transition is in reality horror and shock to several film stars who failed for not having enough way of speaking, effective word order between image and voice..."Singin' in the Rain" is the story of a wildly funny sex goddess played by Jean Hagen who steals the classic as an aggressive no-talent squeaky-voiced silent-screen goddess forced to use blackmail to keep her star in the Hollywood sky? Jean was in love with Kelly who wanted to substitute her by the talented chorus girl Debbie Reynolds.. "Singin' in the Rain" is rich in the brilliant way in which it is written and done... Its three production numbers are extraordinary, illuminating the picture with different forms of entertainment and bright colors? The big number 'Broadway Ballet,' is a surrealistic extravaganza filled with magic, huge cast, spectacular use of light, color, costumes and sets, plus a marvelous ballet danced by Kelly and Cyd Charisse...Gene Kelly became legendary as a choreographer and director... With Stanley Donen, in addition to "Singin' in the Rain," he made "On the Town," and "It's Always Fair Weather." Taken all together, they are constituent element to surpass most of musical achievement...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folded Eye Jazz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This is a nearly perfect film from my perspective: It feels naturally improvised. Its episodes are radically discontinuous, but feel like fluid transitions. It has some great numbers, including the incomparable Cyd Charisse.But what really puts this on my `must see' list is the deep self-reference. Superficially, it is a movie about a movie, but actually the folding is a whole lot more complex, even psychedelic. The narrative structure is flashbacks, flashforwards, about the movie, IS the movie, about the fooling behind the movie (oddly, Debbie's non-movie songs were dubbed by someone else!). It has nested abstractions, and encompassing ones. It has several manner of annotative features. And the internal movie itself grows while we watch to have internal nesting of different types: the original costume drama becomes a vision from a modern newcomer whacked on the head. And further, there is the Charisse number which is another abstraction.There were precessors: `Kane' (41) introduced the use of many parallel narrative devices, `Children of Paradise' (45) had conflated reality and performance: `Red Shoes' (48) took it to dance, and those are must see as well. But here, the technique becomes visual jazz improvisations on reality. Thrilling.None of the people involved ever came close on other projects. Odd.Ted's evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those handful of films that is universally loved and respected and I have to join the crowd on that. For over 50 years it has been considered the best musical ever made and I can't argue with that, either, especially with the newly- restored DVD version that came out a short time ago. The film never looked and sounded better!In a nutshell, the reason for the high praise, I would think would be: 1 - Likable lead characters (Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor); 2 - Excellent song-and-dance numbers, capped off by one of the most famous of all-time, the title song "Singin' In the Rain," featuring Kelly; 3 - Very good humor throughout the film, aided by Jean Hagen's dumb blonde imitation, which may be the best ever put on film; 4 - Spectacular color (please get this latest 2-disc DVD), and 5 - of course, simply a very entertaining film start-to-finish.A few side comments: Kelly gets the legacy with his title song dance but O'Connor's dancing in here is just as good. In fact, one of his solo routines reportedly exhausted him so much he could not work for five days. A nice bonus is seeing Cyd Charisse in here, showing off her dancing skills and great legs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you imagine? Me, a film lover since the age of six, hadn't seen "Singing In The Rain" until last night. I had read and heard so much about it over the years that I knew I was going to be disappointed. As a musical I've never seen anything so perfectly "in tune" I can see how many directors have been influenced by the soul of this gorgeous movie. I've seen even Federico Fellini here. The tap routine with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor is so energizing that I wanted to see it again and again. The fantasy number with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse is breathtaking, breathtaking! How extraordinary to see Debiee Reynolds going through the contagious (Good morning!Good morning!) I had seen her a few nights before as Grace's mother in "Will and Grace" She hasn't lost her zest. I'm sure I'll be seeing this movie many times and I intend to show it to very young people from the post MTV generation and I'm betting with myself that they're going to love it. Greatness is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely one of the most genuinely feel-good films I've ever seen. For a musical, it did not fit the mold of being a bit on the corny side. And some musical films I've seen are a bit stale, but this one is far from that label. I was just beginning to see Gene Kelly's work (I had first seen An American in Paris--which is another gem) and I was captivated by his energy and how overall talented he is. Definitely a great dancer of his time. It was also the first film I saw of Debbie Reynolds' earlier work. It is very clear why it's considered one of the best films of all time. It's witty, romantic, charming, and contains beautiful musical numbers. I definitely recommend it to be an addition to anyones film collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' will Sing forever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has long been thought that the musical era was born out of pure enthusiasm over the ability to put sound on film. And while the case holds water, it is not entirely correct. As `Singin' In the Rain,' so eloquently shows; comedy, charm, music, and dance can all be featured successfully within one film.`Singin In the Rain,' is also generally known as the greatest musical of all time. Roger Ebert, the late Gene Siskel, Leonard Maltin, and many other prominent critics agree with that opinion. The plot was born from a song and used others that had been around for many years, ever since `the talkies' were born in the late 20s. The screenplay was written according to the songs. Although the cast had been cast, and re-cast several times; the end result was one of perfect chemistry. The combination of the ever-so talented Gene Kelly (arguably 1 of the 2 best film dancers ever) and Debbie Reynolds worked very well, despite complications that arose off the set. And Donald O'Connor was born for his role as Cosmo Brown, the best buddy to Kelly's Don Lockwood. His wit keeps the film fresh and funny. If you took a drink for every smart remark he made, you'd be drunk, before Lockwood gets the girl!All the characters in this film are dynamic, save Cosmo Brown and Lena Lamont (played by Jean Hagen). This was perfect for what was called for, for this film to succeed. This helps the film `move,' where other musicals fail. This is where the irony enters; since this film was written in reverse of this philosophy. Being able to incorporate quality songs into a quality storyline is a skill no studio has ever mastered, even to this day. Even, MGM, which was known as `the king of the musicals', failed more often than it succeeded. To this day, no one has mastered it; although Disney has almost reached MGM proportions with its animation department.As the film opens, the premiere for one of the famed `Lockwood/Lamont' films is taking place for `The Royal Rascal.' As the stars arrive, one by one, Cosmo Brown arrives. A bit later Lockwood and Lamont arrive. Lockwood tells a `story' of how he and Cosmo get to stardom. To celebrate the release, there is a party at the studio's producer's house. But to get there, Lockwood must go by a different rout than everyone else, finding Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) in the process. After a few cute surprises and accidents, Don gets a conscience attack. After finally finding her, he realizes that he cares for her. Meanwhile, Cosmo Brown keeps up his antics and funny nature. The comic relief is never amiss in this film. Lamont soon learns of the romance and is up to something, but what? What do you think she is, `.dumb or something?'The co-director (also co-directed by Gene Kelly) Stanley Donen called the `Moses Supposes' dance sequence with Kelly and O'Connor, the best dance sequence ever. I agree that it is in the Top 3, but not the best, that's in another film; which Donen directed, for another review. All numbers in this film are memorable, where most from other films are not.There is only one detraction in this film. It is the `Broadway Melody' sequence. It begins with another interesting and amusing song and dance number by Mr. Lockwood, trying to convince his producer of something. But the scene becomes too long and unnecessary. Cyd Charisse is an amazing talent, but the dance number she has in the film, should have been deleted. It is mesmerizing, but is out of place in this film. This 13 minute sequence should have ended at about 7-8 max. Still, this detail is so minute, that it isn't a bad detraction. When this film was released in 1952, it opened to luke-warm reviews and average box office receipts. It wasn't until it's `10th Anniversary,' that people began to notice that `Singin' In the Rain' was special and has been known as such ever since. The AFI, when it released it's list of `The 100 Greatest Films Ever,' ranked this film No.10, to put it at the highest mark for a musical of any era and place Ms. Debbie Reynolds as half of the only mother/daughter combination on the list*. `Singin' In the Rain,' is always fun to watch, the film has also been recently released on DVD with tons of extras. As enduring as Mr. Kelly's lamppost lean is, so this film echoes Mr. Lockwood's sentiments of nothing; nothing but pure joy that is.Personal Rating: 99 on a 100 point scale*Note-Ms. Reynolds' daughter, Carrie Fisher appeared in AFI's No. 15 film, `Star Wars.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not called the greatest musical of all time for nothing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it was somewhat overshadowed by An American in Paris in it's time, it is now justifiably considered one of the best Hollywood musicals ever made. It's my favorite musical, Gene Kelly film, and one of my favorite MOVIES.Kelly was without a doubt at the peak of his amazing career as an actor, director, choreographer, and above all dancer. Each scene is dripping with bright, vibrant colors and plenty of laughs. Kelly's class and charm just exudes from the screen.What makes the film so extraordinary is the way each song and dance number flow effortlessly and are perfectly intergrated into the story. These numbers not only showcase the amazing ability of Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and even Debbie Reynolds, but also the exuberance of that happy and carefree feeling of the 1920's.Some of the standout numbers are of course the title dance through the rain, and Broadway Melody, but also the hilarious "Make Em Laugh" where O'Connor displays his talent of blending humor and acrebatic movements, and "Good Morning" where Reynolds holds her own between the 2 greatest dancers of the time.This film is an American classic and an absolute must see. It's the perfect movie to watch if you want to laugh, smile, or just simply watch something that leaves you with a good feeling. I know I am always left with a glorious feeling in my heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody knows Gene Kelly singing and dancing in the films title number, but this is just one of the many magical musical numbers in this epic piece of blissful entertainment. Set during the turbulent period when Hollywood was converting from silent films to sound, ?Singin' in the Rain' is a perfect example of everything that is good and right about movie-making. Gene Kelly in his greatest role is an all singing, all dancing sensation and his acting is pretty damn good too. Donald O'Connor excels as his exuberant sidekick and almost steals the show with the unsurpassed ?Make ?em Laugh'. Debbie Reynolds is feisty and sexy as Kelly's love interest, while Jean Hagen gives one of the screen's greatest supporting performances as the horrid Lena Lamont, a silent screen goddess whose voice will just not cut it in talkies.The musical numbers flow fast and furious as Gene and Donald perform amazing feats of choreography with ?Fit as a Fiddle' and ?Moses Supposes' while ?Good Mornin' will have you dancing in the aisles. If ?Singin' in the Rain' had no musical numbers it would still be a contender for the funniest film ever made. The problems with experiments with sound films are painfully funny, and Kelly's silent sparring with the demonic Hagen is hilarious. The accolade of sheer perfection can be conferred on few films, and such a title is perhaps even an understatement in this case. And never before did rain look like so much fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most entertaining movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect movie in every sense, 'Singin In The Rain' has rightly gone down in history as the best musical picture ever. But it is much more than that. A sparkling comedy, with a cast that is 100% perfect, and one of the best movies about movies ever made too.Gene Kelly's genius has never been more apparent than in this movie, but, as always he never steals the show, in fact here practically having the show stolen from him by Donald O'Connor's gravity defying 'Make 'Em Laugh' and Jean Hagen's unforgettable Lina Lamont. Kelly's title number is the epitome of carefree nonchalance. The guy's in love and he isn't going to let a little rain get in the way. This 'classic' scene is possibly the feelgood moment to beat all others. I defy anyone not to succumb to the Kelly's Irish charm during this number, if you haven't already been won over.But a musical is just a musical without a decent story. That's where Comden and Green's pertinent screenplay comes in. Using Nacio Herb Brown's songs from the era in which the movie is set we are taken back to Hollywood in transition, a time when silent movies were ousted by the talkies. For what is generally regarded as just a light-hearted song and dance movie 'Singin In The Rain' takes a pretty accurate line and takes a satirical swipe at the studios and the gossip mongers of the day. There were stars, like Lina Lamont, whose careers disintegrated on the advent of talking pictures, and others, like Kathy Seldon, whose stars were beginning to rise. For a while, there weren't enough voice coaches to go round! The race to match the success of 'The Jazz Singer' was truly chaotic, with studios churning out potboiler after potboiler to cash in on the talking picture. It was also a time when MGM itself started it's reign of the musical genre with epic production numbers, and casts of thousands. In a sense,'Singin In The Rain' both lampoons and celebrates it's own ancestry and place in cinema history.Exhilarating, exuberant, and mesmerising. Still, in my opinion, the most entertaining, and the best, movie ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genial, Strongly-Made Satire With Music About the Early Days of Talkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' In the Rain" I find to be a relaxed musical, one whose subject is the traumatic changeover that was faced by Hollywood producers, actors and directors when sound was introduced into film circa 1928. Many fans and critics believe the musical is one of the best ever; I disagree. But it is quite unusual in several respects, I suggest: first because its background is so realistic as a milieu from which to draw appealing characters and opportunities to introduce songs; and second because the film is played on the edge of parody without ever really falling into that error. The three characters at the center of the film are a love triangle. Don Lockwood, played amiably by Gene Kelly, is the on-screen partner of Lina Lamont (Oscar-worthy Jean Hagen); she has mistaken his sincere performance for real interest; he is in love with Kathy Selden, played by too-young but plucky nineteen-year-old Debbie Reynolds, about whom Lina knows nothing. The professional duo are completing one more romantic adventure film as a silent when suddenly sound is introduced into movies. The studio executives panic; and Don and his partner, played by Donald O'Connor, convince the director, craggy-faced and very realistic Douglas Fowley, to get the studio to let them remake the film as a musical--completing the unfinished portion, etc. The problem turns out not to be Don's transition to talkies but Lina's; she has the voice of a screech owl. Coaching becomes necessary; sensational dance numbers are introduced, including Kelly's solo "Singin' in the Rain", motivated by his falling in love with Kathy; Donald O'Connor's "Make 'Em Laugh" acrobatic classic; and the unnecessary but very-well-done "Gotta Dance" showcase ballet with Cyd Charisse as a gangster's moll, and Kelly as a Broadway hopeful. Then, the film is completed and debuted; of course Lina has found out about Kathy. And of course this intelligent satire works out well for all concerned, after some trials and tribulations. Great fun is gotten I suggest from the actors having to learn to "talk into the flowers", where early microphones had to be hidden, etc. Harold Rosson provided the cinematography, with art direction by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons. Nacio Herb Brown's songs were intelligently recycled for the film. Arthur Freed, MGM's master musical specialist, had the use of the talents of Betty Comden and Adolph Green for the screenplay and one song, "Moses Supposes"; he also had then-28- year-old nice guy Stanley Donen as director, soon to add "On The Town" and "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers" to this triumph. Walter Plunkett did the period costumes, with complex set decorations being done by Jacques Mapes and Edwin B. Willis. The studio's boss was played by Millard Mitchell, with Rita Moreno and a dozen familiar faces in smaller parts and uncredited appearances such as Joi Lansing, Paul Maxey, Sylvia Lewis, Kathleen freeman, King Donovan, Dawn Addams, Elaine Edwards, Mae Clarke and Snub Pollard. The film was influential, I assert, my criterion for including it among these reviews, because, immediately afterward, other 1920s and period projects were inspired by its success; these included, "Has Anybody Seen My Gal", the TV show "So This is Hollytwood", and ultimately "The Great Race", "The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond Story" and a hundred others, including a few musicals. I consider it to be genial, a clever period evocation, lightweight, exuberant, youthful, and a very seminal work with a strong central character and unusually-interesting reality background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing In The Rain is to me the greatest musical ever made, sure many others push it close, The Wizard Of Oz for one will always be a 10/10 movie in my opinion, but Singing In The Rain is a film that has no flaws, it is a perfect movie.Don Lockwood is a star of silent movies but his life is boring, then talking movies arrive and with them he eyes an opportunity to greatly improve his life. A chance encounter with dancer Kathy Selden will further shape his destiny, and along with best pal and partner Cosmo Brown, their respective fortunes will hopefully dovetail towards fulfillment.Where do you start? The film is a homage to happiness, be it film making or love, or friendships and honour, the film is pure and simply joyous from the first reel to the triumphant last shot. Featuring stunning choreography, Singing In The Rain doesn't cop out by merely having characters plodding thru a script and then bursting into song occasionally, each song furthers the characters and fleshes out the story unfolding to keep the plot lines tight and crucially, important.Make 'Em Laugh, Good Morning, and Singing In The Rain are just some of the brilliant songs and dance routines on show here, with the latter a now legendary piece of cinematic history that speaks volumes for the joyous nature of the film, whilst the finale sequence of the 'Broadway Ballet' is magic &amp; elegance personified. The cast are uniformly excellent, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor &amp; Debbie Reynolds interplay together like they were hatched from the same egg, and the joint direction from Stanley Donen (along with Kelly) is seamless.Full of hat tipping and self-referencing winks, Singing In The Rain regularly hits the top ten lists of critics and movie fans alike, so lets not beat around the bush about it...it flipping well deserves it. 10/10 in every respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a glorious feeling, indeed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody remembers the scene. It's the one where he walks along the street, dancing, and singin' in the rain. The musical sequence has yet to be surpassed by any film -- even my all-time-favorite musical, "Grease" (1978), doesn't stand a chance. In fact, there's another great musical number in "Singin' in the Rain," with Donald O'Connor throwing his body around like a rag doll. Even though the singin' in the rain number is the infamous trademark of the film and musicals everywhere, my personal favorite is "Make 'em Laugh."Not many people know, however, that Gene Kelly had a 103 degree fever during the filming of the infamous scene -- a dangerous thing to do, in retrospect, considering that he was flailing about and working up a sweat in pouring water with such a high temperature. But even then, not many people know that the "rain water" pouring down on the joyously cheesy street was actually composed of water and milk. The milk was added to the mix in an effort to achieve the effect of raindrops showing up on screen. (Mel Gibson noted once that most of the time during the filming of "Braveheart" it was raining around them, but it was basically impossible to notice any rainfall in the film since the sheets of liquid were so thin.)"Singin' in the Rain" can probably be called the greatest musical of all time, even though my guilty pleasure is "Grease" (how outdated the film is, and yet how amusing it remains!). Every serious filmgoer knows this movie, and just yesterday as I watched Britain's countdown to the greatest musical ever made, I noted that "Singin' in the Rain" was high on the list ("Grease" was no. 1, although any list that posts "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical" higher on a list than "Singin' in the Rain" can't be trusted).Don Lockwood (Kelly) is a silent film star in 1927, an ex-musician living an on-screen romance with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and letting the publicity take their screen relationship to a whole new level (think Ben and Jen's recent tabloid romance). The press loves to think that its two biggest stars are the nation's cutest couple, but in reality Lockwood despises Lamont, and Lamont -- having read trashy magazines -- believes their relationship to be factual. "Oh, Donny!" Lina cries. "You couldn't kiss my like that and not mean it just a teensy bit!" Lockwood: "Meet the greatest actor in the world -- I'd rather kiss a tarantula." Lina: "You don't mean that." Lockwood: "I don't? Hey Joe, get me a tarantula!"When the silent film studio begins the transition from silent film to new "talkies," it means that Lockwood will have to take acting lessons in able to learn to truly be able to act, and Lamont -- a squeaky-voiced young lady -- will have to learn to learn proper grammar. (Some scenes with a grammar instructor reminded me of "My Fair Lady," truth be told, although it was filmed 12 years afterwards.)Lockwood meets a young girl named Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who refuses to fall victim to his Hollywood charm but eventually learns to love the guy after he gets her out of a tight squeeze or two.Meanwhile, Lockwood's pal, Cosmo (O'Connor), suggests that they start to stage film musicals instead of feature "talkies" -- that way, all Lockwood needs to do is sing and dance, something he already excels at. ("Make a musical! The new Don Lockwood: he yodels! He jumps about to music!")But people want Lockwood and Lamont, not Lockwood by himself, and the prospect of losing money is not a bright prospect for the film company. So Lina is filmed in the musicals with him, and towards the end of our film, sweet young Kathy dubs over Lina's voice and is given no credit for the task. Lamont is too embarrassed to admit that she can't sing, and so she blackmails the film distributor -- if they credit Kathy at the end of her new feature film, she'll take legal action.And so comes the climatic finale on stage as Lockwood reveals the true singer behind the film (ironic, since it was Lamont herself who dubbed over Reynolds' voice during the sequence). As Roger Ebert noted, the scene where Lockwood bursts onto stage and fingers out Kathy from the crowd of onlookers is corny, but it's sweet and exactly the time of emotionally uplifting moment that is rarely made nowadays.Gene Kelly's notorious cruelty on the set of "Singin' in the Rain" has become a sort of folklore, and it's true. He berated the actors if they messed up a single dance number. O'Connor later admitted that he was extremely frightened to make a single mistake, afraid that Kelly would lash out at him.That strictness doesn't shine through Kelly's character in "Singin' in the Rain." In fact, many of the dance moves (such as the frantic splashing in the puddles) look quite haphazard, but they were all choreographed to an extreme.Is that why the film is highly regarded as perhaps the definitive American musical? That probably has something to do with it. I think it's mostly the joy of it all, though -- bright, cheery, happy, and uplifting, the film is one of the most purely fun films of all time. It doesn't demand anything like some films, but it gives a lot back.The ads for "Singin' in the Rain" promised a glorious feeling, and in that way the film lives up to its slogan. It is fun and bright and glorious and entertaining. It doesn't take itself seriously, but it offers the viewer a chance to experience something quite rare -- an all-around great movie.What a glorious feeling, indeed.5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why it's the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two kinds of musicals. You can call them different things. You could call them the Hollywood Musical and the Broadway Musical. That's not quite proper because the Hollywood Musical is what the Broadway Musical was in the 20's and 30's, before Rogers and Hammerstein changed everything. maybe a better distinction is the Dancing Musical vs. the Singing Musical, except that both kinds have dancing and singing...Let's try it this way. The original musicals on Broadway in the 20's and 30's and Hollywood in the 30's and 40's were musicals with a slight storyline, some singing and tremendous dancing numbers. They also have low comedy and plenty of beautiful girls. They usually are about show business itself and many of the numbers take place on the stage. the others seem like the likely result of bringing show people together: of course they are going to sing and dance from time to time. Looking at them these days, the singing is kind of boring, the comics dreadful and the plots the answer to a moron's prayer. It's the dance numbers that are timeless. These films were made for highlight reels like "That's Entertainment".Rogers and Hammerstein changed all that. They took serious plays and converted them into operetta of popular music. Characters who were not in show business at all used songs and dances as soliloquies to reveal their private thoughts. The result was some of the best plays and films of all time- Oklahoma, Carousel, The King and I, South Pacific, The Sound of Music, Brigadoon, Gigi, My Fair Lady, The Music Man, etc. South Pacific was the first film my parent sever took me to see and this is the type of musical I normally prefer. Here songs tended to dominate- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top, "Out of My Dreams", "People Will Say We're in Love, "If I Loved You", "My Boy Bill", "I Have Dreamed", "Hello Young Lovers", "Some Enchanted Evening", "Younger Than Springtime", etc. ,etc. There are dance pieces but the dancers are on the sidelines."Singing in the Rain" is the greatest of all the Hollywood Musicals. It has the memorable dances a Hollywood Musical needs: "Make 'Em Laugh", Singing in the Rain", "Good Morning", "Broadway Melody". There is also the best of the Freed-Brown songbook, such as "You are My Lucky Star". But it has the strongest story of any of the Hollywood Musicals, thanks to the Comden-Green team and the memories of the early days of sound. it's virtually the only Hollywood Musical that could have held up as a non-musical. It could have just been a comedy about he conversion to sound. it would not have been "Singing in the Rain", but it would have been good.As it is, it's the one musical that has it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of "An American in Paris", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, "The Dueling Cavalier", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - "I love you, I love you, I love you".All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very pleasant speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number "Make 'Em Laugh" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's get things straight: this is by no means a bad musical. There are some wonderful numbers- "Make Em' Laugh", "Good Morning", that one where the gal with the long leg dangles a hat in front of Gene Kelly- but the film itself is disappointing. I've always found Gene Kelly too arrogant and annoying to want to watch him as a romantic lead, a bit too uptight to be comic and his dancing's better in An American in Paris. Debbie Reynolds is cute but not earth-shattering. Donald O'Connor is fabulous- he's the reason to watch this film. His talent, particularly for comedy, exceeds Kelly's talents. He's definitely underrated.I was told that the whole spoofing of the advent of the talkies was hilarious. It's mildly amusing at best. The characters didn't really grab me either. It's a total myth that the story of a musical can get away with being complete fluff. Even if the story's a bit of a stretch (or a lot if it's Brigadoon), it should at least be entertaining. This film really ought to have simply been a revue.I think that nostalgia and hype may have clouded the judgement of quite a few viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was decided to watch this movie, because I knew and already watched the famous sequence of Gene Kelly singing in the rain .(what makes the movie very famous and also gives the name of it). After watching it, I can say that it is a delightful movie with also a pleasant story: They are in 1927, and Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are famous actors in Hollywood, who always make a couple in their movies,making many rumors emerge about their real relationship. The problem is that the movies now are not mute as a year ago, and they couple of actors have difficulties, since both need to take new acting and speech lessons. Lina, however has a horrible voice, needing to be dubbed by Kathy Selden, a young actress who has a beautiful voice, and makes Don fall in love. It's very funny to see the difficulties of the producers of that time, like when they put the microphone in Lina's chest to record her voice, but they also record Lina's heart beats.</fullReview>

As is Kelly singing in the rain, O'Connor making 'em laugh, Reynolds, Kelly and O'Connor wishing each other a good morning... i could go on.The first time i saw Singin in the Rain i was eight years old,and that was nine years ago.

Etc.Friends, I was once like you. But I have come to see the light. The "rain" dance sequence, that I had seen a million times before, is entirely transformed when seen within the context of the film. In fact, ALL the dancing is hypnotic and fascinating. The story is funny in an intelligent way, and certainly very involving. The LONG takes of flawless dancing still amaze--especially compared to something like the editing of "Chicago," trying to hide its dancer's flaws. Here there's nothing to hide.In short, I have come to understand that EVERY HUMAN BEING NEEDS TO SEE THIS FILM. That means you.

		<fullReview>In 1927, the former stunt Don Lockwood (Gene Kelley) becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) forming a romantic pair with the actress Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen).In the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures, Don accidentally meets the aspirant actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her. Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises."Singing in the Rain" is a musical masterpiece, one of those unforgettable movies that the viewer never get tired of watching. The cast is in state of grace, with wonderful interpretations. Jean Hagen is simply fantastic in the role of Lina Lamont, an actress unable to speak correctly and with an awful voice. Debbie Reynolds has a doll face, Donald O'Connor is very funny and Gene Kelly is fantastic. This is certainly one of the best movies ever made. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Cantando na Chuva" ("Singing in the Rain")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is worth seeing for two reasons: the inimitably exuberant rain scene and Cyd Charisse's unbelievable legs.There's an extremely silly story here, loaded with hammy, stereotyped performances.Gene Kelly is a dance genius and watching him move is an aesthetic thrill. However, his acting here mostly reeks. All of that saccharine grinning gets old really quick.Donald O'Conner's part is more grating. His wise-cracking smart aleck is forever making vaudeville-tacky jokes. He dances well but is only tolerable with his mouth closed.Unrecognizably glamorous compared to her moll role of two years earlier in "The Asphalt Jungle," Jean Hagen is funny the first time she speaks, but her chalkboard-scratch schtick eventually produces an earache. Ah, but the magic of Kelly and his umbrella in the downpour! It captures the essence of man at his best. When we send our rockets into the nothingness of space, these few inches of celluloid should be humanity's calling card. Kelly's artistry in this brief clip guarantees his immortality!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MGM Near the Top of Its Musical Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on "Singing' in the Rain" have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why "Singin' in the Rain" was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made (I liked MGM's "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" more), and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again. I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly, and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing, and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny. But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess, and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career, before she became a broad.The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film --you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions. But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care. The "Singin' in the Rain" sequence does what far too few films do -- it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jean Hagen's contribution makes 'Singin' in the Rain' one of the all-time greats...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as I admire the talents of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor, it's really Jean Hagen who provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. Her character also provides the key to the plot for this witty look at Hollywood making the transition to sound films. A pity Hagen wasn't given any of the song numbers to participate in--but that's my only complaint. Everything is in good hands here--Kelly and Reynolds and O'Connor do outstanding jobs. The only other drawback, as I see it, is the extended Broadway musical number Kelly imagines and co-starring Cyd Charisse. It strikes a somewhat jarring note and wasn't really necessary. His song-and-dance routine in the rain is, of course, the most famous highlight--but equally endearing is the 'Good Mornin' number, staged with such style and verve and performed with gusto by the three stars. Betty Comden and Adolph Green provided a supremely funny script, somewhat reminiscent of an older film with Alice Faye and Don Ameche called 'Hollywood Cavalcade'('39), which also dealt with the transition from silent to sound movies. One of the great MGM musicals, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN's story is well known, and concerns 1920s silent romantic acting team Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen.) Trouble is that sound is coming in--and Lina's speaking voice could peel paint off the wall. The solution? Don's best friend (Donald O'Connor) and love interest (Debbie Reynolds) have the inspiration of revamping Lockwood and Lamont's debut sound film as a musical, with Reynolds dubbing Hagen's vocals. The resulting story is a high-energy, extremely witty, and truly sparkling film laced with period songs by Arthur Freed, a film that many regard as the single finest musical to emerge from Hollywood.In many respects SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a throwback to the early musicals of the era it satirizes, for many of its musical numbers ('Make 'em Laugh' is a notable example) have absolutely nothing to do with the story it tells--but unlike such early musicals the storyline is exceptionally strong, and since the film is about the creation of an early "all talking, all dancing, all singing" movie in which such musical numbers were typical, they have here a certain validity that could not otherwise be achieved.The cast is absolutely flawless, and without exception Kelly, Reynolds, O'Connor, and Hagen (particularly memorable as the literally unspeakable silent star) give the finest performances of their respective careers. The musical numbers range from the vibrant and complex 'Good Morning' to the lyrical 'You Are My Lucky Star' to the brilliantly conceived and executed title song, each without exception the definition of perfection. The art designs are meticulous, beautiful, and recreate the late-silent and early-sound era of Hollywood with considerable wit and charm. As a whole, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN possesses an energy and vitality that simply makes you bounce in your seat from excitement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a musical that even people who hate musicals love. Whether or not you consider it "the" finest musical ever created by Hollywood is, ultimately, a matter of personal preference; there are several contenders for that title, most notably MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, GIGI, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. But no matter where you personally rank it, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is certainly ONE of the best, a film that simply gains in critical and popular stature with every passing year, a national and a world treasure of cinematic art.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' In The Rain" is a musical for people who don't like musicals. Fast, funny, self-aware, and chock full of the best singing and dancing you can cram into 105 minutes, it might as well be the best movie musical since the entire genre peaked here, never to be effectively revived.Fittingly, the movie focuses on the birth of the Hollywood musical. It's 1927, and the silent-film romantic pair of Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) find themselves suddenly wired for sound after "The Jazz Singer" inaugurates a new era. While there are a lot of problems for the pair to overcome, including the fact he hates her for the nasty witch she is, the only real problem is that Lina's Godzilla-like ego comes with a Godzilla-like voice. Making their new movie into a musical might then seem a bad idea, except that Don's new girl Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) can sing like a dream, and doesn't mind dubbing Lina.Knowing humor abounds in this classic, clever film. "You have to show a movie at a party. It's a Hollywood law," says Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), Lockwood's buddy. An opening sequence features a Hedda Hopper announcer introducing vogue-ing celebrities at a red-carpet premiere. "They've been married two months now, and happy as newlyweds," she coos as a catatonic couple stroll past.Even the musical numbers are done with a wink, like "Beautiful Girl" and "All I Do Is Dream Of You." This would be a great film even if the most famous of those numbers, Kelly's "Singin' In The Rain," was left on the cutting-room floor. There's still "Make 'Em Laugh," the funniest song-and-dance routine ever done (by O'Connor and a mannequin) and "Good Morning," with some of the most intricate tap dancing ever performed times three.But "Singin' In The Rain" IS there, and it fully deserves its place in the pantheon, not only with Kelly's wonderfully irrational exuberance but some incredible camera work that pans over and around him to maximize the uplift in this goose-pimple number.If only they left out (and not just trimmed) that Broadway musical number near the end, the pseudo-ballet with Cyd Charisse. It pulls us away from the story for 20 minutes, apparently so Kelly could have a section with his favorite dance partner. No one ever looked better on the big screen, or projected such natural-seeming charisma, as Genial Gene, but apparently he could throw his elbows with the best of them. It's obvious how much this film owes to the other director, the playful and creative Stanley Donan. If Kelly stuck to the on screen stuff, this would have been a better film.But what am I talking about? It's "Singin' In The Rain"! I can't dock this simply because Kelly had a big ego. He earned it with this great film, a movie milestone. If you never see another movie musical, see this one. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The...best...musical...EVER!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Singin' in the Rain for the first time ever this afternoon and I think I'm in love. Oh Gene Kelly!.. *What* I would give to have you flash those pearly whites at me! The story is really just a musical about a musical, going into various dream-like sequences embodied in the twelve minute "Broadway Ballet". The songs are cleverly intertwined with the acting so there's none of that phoniness one is used to seeing in some musical pictures. To watch the choreography is to watch pure genius. Gene Kelly is so talented it should be outlawed. (It's downright sacrilegious he wasn't nominated for the Academy Award®!) I mean - DAMN! I kept backing up to the 'Singin' in the Rain' part seventy-five times in a row...it fills me with such a sense of joy! My Gramps once broke his ankle trying to imitate ol' Gene. The supporting cast is perfect as well, you really must hand it to Debbie Reynolds! She wasn't a trained dancer up until this point. They made her rehearse eight hours a day, hiring different dance instructors to work with the young actress in shifts. The stress proved so overwhelming she eventually had a breakdown and caught the attention of neighboring Fred Astaire who asked, "Why are you crying?" Not able to recognize the man through her tears, Reynolds confessed she felt hopeless and would never meet Kelly's standards. Astaire led her to another rehearsal room where he was busy working on Royal Wedding. "You come watch me," he said. "You watch how hard I work. I don't cry, but I do get frustrated and upset and I'm going to let you watch." The experience showed her how a legendary performer like Astaire, known for his elegant moves on the dance floor, can even feel daunted : )Finally, what else can I say (other than Cyd Charisse wears the hottest dress I've ever seen)? This is one of THE greatest films of any genre ever! They just don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and Jean Hagen are just great in this movie! The best sequences are Gene's 'Singin' in the rain' dance in the rain (pure cinematic genius!), the scene where Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) tries to say her lines with a diction coach (Kathleen Freeman) (her 'can't' comes out 'cain't), the 'Good Morning' dance with Gene, Debbie, and Donald, and the famous 'Broadway Melody' ballet with Kelly and Cyd Charisse (with a Clara Bow/Louise Brooks haircut and a seductive dress). I was in a production of 'Guys and Dolls' and the kids in the troupe worshiped this musical. I would watch this film over and over again without getting tired of it! As many film buffs say, this is 'the greatest musical ever'. 10/10</fullReview>

Ok, I sat there biasly waiting for the DVD to play the So Called top ten movies of all time, and to my utter amazement and total surprise the movie did not suck. In fact I don't recall ever blinking during the show, it was Funny, Romantic- but not corny, seemed real life- for the most part, and over all quite inspiring to me and my fellow classmates here at The University Of Kansas, KU, United States of America. I must suggest that all those who have ever seen a movie before must buy this movie and add it to their collection of all-time favorites. I garante that any person between the ages of 9months and 120 years will love this show and share the same enthusiasm that I have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952) **** Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O' Connor, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, Douglas Fowley, Rita Moreno. One of the most beloved and greatest Hollywood musicals ever showcases the divine gifts of musical comedy in the fetching forms of the always subliminally graceful balletic Kelly, rubber-limbed amiability of O' Connor and wholesomely adorable Reynolds as struggling silent screen era film stars (and wannabes) who are at the cusp of the Talkie era to be that will only strengthen the trio in friendship and ultimately romantic true love. Hagen is a stitch as the Noo Yawky cartoon-voice afflicted shrew co-star of Kelly in their ascent to stardom. Moreno has a small role as Hagen's equally troublemaking flapper gal pal and look close for character actress/comic foil Kathleen Freeman as Hagen's diction coach (she'd have her hands equally full in several Jerry Lewis vehicles to come). Filmed in bravura color bursting from the screen with indelible images of eye candy in bountiful cornucopia with its striking backlot sets, larger-than-life costumes and masterful direction by Kelly and the indomitable Stanley Donen featuring Kelly's indelible iconic moment performing the titular tune in resplendent glee and amor du jour. Kudos to the estimable songwriting team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden for their lively tunes matching in sync to Kelly's choreography (with Harold Rossen) is movie magic replete. Nominated for 2 Oscars (Hagen's hilarious Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton's musical score), they just don't make them like this anymore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) musicals ever made, unfortunately shows its age. Redeemed by several outstanding song and dance routines, the film is a fun and fast way to spend 90 minutes or so. However, at the risk of sounding jaded, much of the film is corny and borderline mawkish. It has not aged well. I recently saw "Singin' in the Rain" at Oakland's Paramount Theatre, a refurbished '20s movie house that can accommodate huge crowds in its big-screen auditorium. (Those that can should attend - tickets are generally $5, and while food and drink are not allowed in the movie, they have a full bar and beverage service before the show. Films selected are usually "classics" like "Gone With The Wind" or "Casablanca", and they have live organ music and Deco Win before each film.) I was amused by both Donald O'Connor, who is great, and the film's dated sensibilities. Many people were humming to Gene Kelly's famous solo, however, and that's what counts. That particular scene must be among the ten greatest or most memorable in film history, and it never disappoints. I rated the film a "7" just for that scene alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the finest movie musical of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For sheer enjoyment, no movie ever made beats Singin' in the Rain. Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly remind us why vaudeville was as popular as it was in the 20s, Debbie Reynolds lights up the screen, and Jean Hagen gives the performance of her career-of anybody's career for that matter. If the title dance sequence doesn't get you moving, then there's no hope for you. There are only two down spots, "Beautiful Girl" and the never-ending "Broadway Melody" dance sequence (but the latter is worth it just to see Cyd Charisse). The rest of the movie is flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a glorious feeling!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, after commenting on many of the great films that I liked very much, I figure it's about time to comment on one of the films that I truly love... "Singin' in the Rain".... I just adore the hell out of this film. There are only a few movies out there that can truly transcend any and all boundries, and make even the most depressed person joyful... Singin' in the Rain is one of them.This film is pure magic. In today's teenage-dominated film industry audiences seem to want more of an adrenaline-pumping, special effect-driven thrill ride instead of a film like this which is true cinema art. It communicates feelings of joy instead of mindless heart-pumping action. Today's films are not art... they are mass-produced moneymakers that attempt to give you nothing more than a rollercoaster-like experience. No substance to them at all...But back to the film, the performances are phenomenal! Gene is always great and is the true entertainer. In the famous 15 minute Broadway finale Gene combines three art forms into one (Song, Dance, &amp; Film) to communicate the story of the aspiring actor who comes to Broadway without using one line of (spoken) diologue. This scene should also be noted as quite possibly the most beautiful use of technicolor ever committed to celluloid.Donald O'Connor... what can I say, the man is incredible! It is so refreshing to see a vaudeville performer in a film outside of the silent era. His gravity-defying performance of "Make 'em Laugh" echos the great silent comedians of the 20's (especially the great Buster Keaton)...And Ms. Debbie Reynolds rounds out the trio. She's magnificent... especially considering that it's one of her first roles. She posseses a wide range of emotion throughout the film, going from the popping out of a cake :) ...to the tears at the end. I really think her performance is underrated... she really brought so much of everything into this movie and I could never, ever picture anyone else in her role. It's really a shame that her performance of "You are My Lucky Star" was cut from the final print.Of course my favorite moment is when these three legends come together to sing "Good Morning"... ahhh, pure magic!Anyway, I just thought I'd express my joy towards this film... not one of the greatest musicals of all time, not one of the great classics, but one of the greatest films of all time.... period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Lived The Research</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the book The Films of Arthur Freed, Freed made one comment about Singin' in the Rain that always stood out in my mind. As the film was about the Hollywood era when films were learning to talk, Freed said that there was no need to do any research as he lived the research. He and any number of people who were still working at MGM a quarter of a century later.The knowledge that folks had who worked on Singin' in the Rain and the talent of Gene Kelly are the two things that make that film some consider the greatest of all musicals.Arthur Freed who wrote a lot of the song lyrics in those twenties and thirties MGM musicals together with his partner, composer Nacio Herb Brown, just reached into his own catalog for the score. The whole score is Brown-Freed except for Moses which was written by Roger Edens and Adolph Green and Betty Comden and Fit As A Fiddler with lyrics by Freed and music by Al Goodheart and Al Hoffman.The only 'original' song written for the show was Make 'Em Laugh by Brown and Freed and was Donald O'Connor's specialty. You have to put that in quotes because even the writers agreed they ripped off Cole Porter's Be A Clown. Which is from an MGM musical that Arthur Freed produced. Lucky they weren't sued.Of course the number that Singin' in the Rain is noted for is the title tune sung and danced in the splashing rain by Gene Kelly. That and the Broadway Melody ballet became two of his signature numbers. I know I don't enjoy myself as much as Mr. Kelly did in that inclement weather.Jean Hagen got a Best Supporting Actress nomination for playing that 'shimmering star in the cinema firmament' Lina Lamont. Unfortunately she lost to Gloria Grahame for The Bad and The Beautiful. One thing that the silent screen did was mask a whole lot of personalities whose voices did not fit the screen image created. That was done for great comic affect by Hagen, but Kelly in some of his love scenes was using the tragedy of John Gilbert who acted in two much the classical manner as a continental lover. Just think how history might have been different if Gilbert had the background of a song and dance man and could have transitioned to musicals. Of course Debbie Reynolds is just fine in her first real starring part as the young singing hopeful whose career is made by sound. So many in fact were, as many as those that were broken. A favorite of mine in this is Douglas Fowley the harassed director trying to get a talking performance out of the nasal Hagen and dealing with the new technology at the same time.As Freed said, no research was needed. Singin' in the Rain is a product of his life experience in those early days of sound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then comes along a movie so iconic, everyone knows its name, even if they haven't seen it. And sometimes the hype greatly overstates the value. Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old cliché where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the cliché is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong. Next time someone asks me to watch this movie, they will need to get me high first, because clearly that is what the makers were when they made it.</fullReview>

I liked how the film used colors as well certain scenes were very vibrant with colors to set the mood while others had a lot of grey in them. I thought the setup for the film was amazing though as well as the editingt. The scenes were immensely large and abstract.

		<shortDescription>A Musical Switch To Talkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favourite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film, one that can be easily enjoyed with family or a group of friends. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem. The leading lady has a ghastly voice and she can't act. Enter Kathy Selden who offers to be a partial replacement.Donen and Kelly do a stupendous job as directors. It's remarkable how they have brought such a well-crafted piece on screen. For Kelly this is a multiple achievement on different levels as he directs, acts, sings and dance. Clearly the guy is a multi-talented legend. Cosmo Brown too is great as the laugh-out-loud supportive friend. His physical comedy are among the funniest sequences of the film. Debbie Reynolds is pretty ands vivacious. She is lovely, both as singer and actress. Jean Hagen deserves mention as the squeaky voiced and arrogant Lina Lamont.The songs are full of energy and spectacularly shot. The dances are amazingly choreographed and a treat to watch. The visuals are pleasantly colourful. The cinematography is superb, especially the long takes. There has already been so much said about the film that I doubt I could add anything new but this is one of the few classic that feels fresh, lively and energizing even today and perhaps it will remain a significant hallmark in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Perfection from Hollywood's Studio System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up there with film classics such as 'Casablanca' and Orson Wells' groundbreaking 'Citizen Kane', 'Singin' in the Rain' is one of the all-time top films to come out of Hollywood. Considered by many (including the American Film Institute) to be the greatest film musical, 'Singin' in the Rain' , with its awesome production values, was made 12 years before the stunning 'West Side Story'.When I first saw the film as a teenager, however, failing to see beyond its American sugar-floss sentimentality, I arrogantly despised it. Yet just one year later I sat through it again and instantly came under its spell, caught up in a magic that has never left me. 'Singin' in the Rain' is a riot of self-indulgent fun, studio skulduggery, romance and innocence of not just one, but two by-gone ages: and therein lieth part of its enduring magic. In rich Technicolor, with some of the finest and slickest visual stunts, (it all looks so effortless on screen) along with some of the greatest song and dance numbers, no one can really say they 'know Hollywood' until they've laughed and cried their way through this film. Parodying a Hollywood back in the days when sound was first coming to the silver screen, it simultaneously reflects the late 1920s, in which the film is set, and the early '50s, (the era in which it was produced). Thus, unwittingly encapsulating much of the entire golden age of Hollywood in one motion picture, like fine wine, it has simply matured with age. The production values are so flawlessly high that I sometimes have to pinch myself to remember that the film recreates in song and dance an era some 25 years earlier..All the songs, including the famous title number, are revivals of numbers that appeared in early sound films, giving the film an air of authenticity. Donald O'Connor's 'Make 'Em Laugh' number is a particular highpoint to watch out for. The typically flamboyant Gene Kelly ballet sequence in the second half is slightly more controversial, with some viewers feeling that despite its brilliant choreography and staging, it slows the action and is out of touch with the naive innocence of the rest of the film, but others view it is the sequence that makes the movie, giving it balance.It is worth noting that this ballet sequence probably would never have made it into the film at all has it not been for the stunning 1948 British film, 'The Red Shoes' (produced by Powell and Pressburger). The ballet sequence featuring Moira Shearer included 15 minutes of uninterrupted, dialogue-free screen time. Gene Kelly loved it, and thanks to the critical and popular success of 'The Red Shoes', (photographed by the legendary Jack Cardiff), Kelly convinced producer Arthur Freed that ballet on film was commercially viable.Just five months before the 1952 premier of 'Singin' in the Rain', MGM had released another major Gene Kelly musical, 'An American in Paris', and initially, this was the film critics preferred. However, with audiences making 'Singin' in the Rain' a box-office hit from the very start, critical opinion began to change and it soon became clear that 'Singin' in the Rain' possessed a timeless quality approaching sheer perfection, revealing that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts. Overall, in a happy combination of chance and design, (not forgetting the chemistry a 19 year-old Debbie Reynolds brought to the screen and Adolph Green and Betty Comden's wonderful script), the production elements in 'Singin' in the Rain' flow together perfectly, revealing just how well the Hollywood studio system really could work at those special moments when everyone, craftsmen and artists alike, were on peak form.Due to loving restoration and the marvels of modern digital transfers, we can now see the film as it originally looked, in all its brilliant colour saturation - a far cry from the washed out versions you may have seen as Christmas time TV fodder. If this is the fist time you've ever seen it, then I hope you are wiser than I was, and that you fall in love with this timeless picture first time around: it really is a cinema treat for all ages!

		<shortDescription>Singin' In The Rain Gives A Glorious Feeling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS In The Rain* Two actors, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), find themselves in trouble when somebody invents 'talking pictures'; Lina more than Don, because she has very bad grammar, a bad character and a terrible voice.She is also 'in love' with Don, who doesn't love her, because of what is written on the gossip magazines, making Don's life more hell than it already is.But thanks to the help of his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and of Kathy Williams (Debbie Reynolds), his true love, Don manages to stay on top, while the vain Lina gets what she deserves.If you want to watch the perfect musical for everybody, ages 2 to 100 (RHPS is perfect, too, but not exactly kiddie material), 'Singin' In The Rain' is the perfect choice, with great acting, ingenious scriptwriting, a nice choice of song (I'm partial to 'Fit As A Fiddle', 'Good Morning' and 'Moses Supposes' myself) which came from MGM's archives, and very good choreographing and directing.A deserved success! Singin' In The Rain: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best musical's of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is one of the most-loved and celebrated film musicals of all time from MGM.The lively and energetic film, co-directed by Stanley Donen and dancer,star,and choreographer Gene Kelly. Singin in the rain isn't just a basic musical it was outstanding, with not just great song and dance number's but good acting too. It was also very breathtaking and graceful, along with anticipation. There was a comical side to from the great Donald O'Connor(Cosmo Brown) and wonderful dances including Cyd Charisse. You don't need much dialogue when you have such high quality and expressive Song and dance's. Gene, Debbie,Donald and Cyd gave outstanding performances and created something which will never be created again. Everything about 'Singin in the rain' is perfect and magical.It's most definitely a film that you can watch over and over, that proves how good it really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer Cinematic Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will make my comments short and pithy, since not many words can describe the sheer grandeur and thrill of watching this film.So many movies nowadays are two-bit shows that required no thought but lots of CGI. The stories are weak and bland at best, and when they do contain something original, it is usually dull, depressing, and morally sh*tty. The acting is insincere, and the characters are ridiculously one-faced and emotionally distraught in some way. The special effects are the only things keeping the movie in theaters."Singin' in the Rain" is the complete, polar opposite of that. When you watch this film, you are transported back to the time frame in which it takes place. You feel the color, excitement, and sounds of Hollywood. But the best thing about it is its boundless joy. This is simply the most fun you will ever have at the movies. You can just feel the vibe and happiness of Gene Kelly's character when he dances through the rainy streets of Hollywood singing that immortal song. The humor is pricelessly good. The musical numbers are simply dazzling, the dance numbers are just sizzling. This is a magical experience. A great substitute for Prozac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried to think of all the film's flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and came up with:1. Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown are supposed to be about the same age, judging by their childhood flashbacks, but as adults Don looks significantly older (Gene Kelly being thirteen years the senior of Donald O'Connor).2. When Don leaps from a streetcar into Kathy Selden's convertible, she doesn't recognize him, which is odd considering that she later confesses to having seen a ton of his pictures (implying she's a big closet fan). Maybe they'd planned for the makeup crew to muss him up and then forgot about it.3. I wish that the weakest song in the film ("Make 'Em Laugh", Arthur Freed's quick knock-off of Cole Porter's "Be A Clown") didn't accompany what is probably the best dance routine in the film.4. The woman doing Kathy Selden's singing for "Would You?" (Betty Noyes) doesn't sound anything like Debbie Reynolds.5. Events in the picture are a little condensed in relation to the real-life birth of the sound era. It's unlikely that a 1927 film like "The Dueling Cavalier" would have been hastily remade into a talkie.(I thought about including points like "a few of Don Lockwood's spiffy outfits are really ugly" and "that head-of-the-studio guy is sometimes annoying" but then decided that these things, which were no doubt intentional, added to the charm.)And I couldn't think of anything else. The fact that such minor nitpicking was all I could come up with in the movie's disfavor should give an idea of how good it is--as almost all the other reviews here confirm. (Yes, I know some folks think the "Broadway Rhythm" sequence is as long and unwieldy as Cyd Charisse's scarf and that "You Were Meant For Me" is a little poky, but I wouldn't change either of them. I doubt most people would, when you get right down to it.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as Good as They Come.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people seem to gush over this picture -- "It's my favorite musical," said one critic, and Kelly replied, "That's good to know." Well, it's hard to believe in lists of best or worst things because everything is made up of several dimensions. Some are good and some are bad. Sometimes very bad. Nobody would argue that Hitler was a nice guy but he DID love his dog, Blondi.However, I have to agree that within the limits of the genre this is probably the most satisfying musical I've ever seen. There is not a single musical number that is a dud. Kelly and Donen avoid Kelly's usual repetitive steps and he really stretches out on this one. There is about a one minute sequence in the "Broadway Rhythm" finale just after Kelly sings "Gotta Dance" from his knees that is given over to his solo. His dance is full of balletic leaps and jagged edges. It's a moment on unequaled exhilaration. He seems at time suspended by wires.I'll skip over the contributions of Cyd Charrise -- my God, those LEGS, like a more than usually sinewy giraffe -- and Donald O'Connor. You cannot NOT laugh at O'Connor's number, "Make 'Em Laugh." Even after several viewings.The most charming (and best-known) number is Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain," but it's not the most technically accomplished. I'd give that honor to "Moses Supposes." The whole movie is of course as corny as they come, although it probably didn't seem so in 1952 when it was released. There's nothing pretentious about it. Kelly had an unfortunate tendency to step out of his class with films like "Invitation to the Dance," and to be involved in musicals with dramatic underpinnings like the overblown "American in Paris." The thing about this MGM musical -- and a few others like "On The Town" and "The Bandwagon" is that they were funny as hell IN BETWEEN the musical numbers. Nobody could ever criticize Astaire's dancing. He was great, a much better dancer than Kelly in many ways, but his 1930s musicals with Ginger Rogers were appealing mainly because of their musical numbers. Betty Comden and Adolph Green in the 1940s added stories that could stand on their own as a comedies.There's something about singing as opposed to dancing too. Anybody can sing -- however lousily. You can sing. I can sing. My pet canary sings. Not well, but we all can do it. But dancing is a skill of a different order and to do it well we need the attention of Terpsichore. All those steps that seem so effortlessly improvised on screen (the taps are always dubbed in later) must be memorized one by one by the performers. Tap? Okay -- heel or toe? Thirty seconds of unedited dancing on screen represents about 100 hours of memorization and practice. Not to mention that you have to be in as good a physical shape as a running back."Singin' in the Rain" is a perfect example of how a nearly perfect musical should be made. Okay, Debbie Reynolds isn't much of a dancer and she can't sing well, but so what? The overall impact of the movie is so warm and fuzzy that it doesn't matter. It's like nibbling some kind of tiny and exquisite pastry, not a big deal, but the equal of any experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful wonderful movie! I love this movie as seeing it is a musical. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you scarce any time to be bored. The lighting of the screen as well as the voices of the actors give it a "vaudville" taste. It tells of the silent movie era and the transition to "talkies" (as mentioned) along with the Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood duo. Wonderful choreography, as seeing the two dancers match up just perfectly in step. I imagine it must have taken a long time to learn, practice, develop and film the steps perfectly. It is chock-full of wonderful music, dancing and singing. What's more, the songs sang by the actors reoccur frequently during the movie, which reminds you of the scene it was last sang in. Which is a refresher, and the closing is a wonderful aspect of humanity. I love it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is near-blasphemy, but I would love "Singin' in the Rain" even more than I do if it were a non-musical, or, more to the point, a musical with different music. Gene Kelly's talent is incontrovertible, and sequences such as the lengthy "Broadway Rhythm" number underscore his (and Stanley Donen's) remarkable vision and talent.They also hold up this snappy, bright, FUNNY comedy.Which is not to say that all of the musical portions are not entertaining adjuncts to the film; the "Beautiful Girls" fashion show is hysterically camp, and of course, Kelly's solo "Singin' in the Rain" is charming, romantic and joyous. However, the screenplay is so solid on its own, the lesser moments ("Good Morning," "You Were Meant for Me") seem to drag on forever.Kelly is movie star handsome here, befitting his role as silent screen lover, Don Lockwood. Donald O'Connor is fine as the ubiquitous funny man sidekick, while Debbie Reynolds displays a nice, sassy touch, especially in her first scene. "Here we are, Sunset and Camden," she trills, having just deflated the ego of one of Hollywood's most notorious wolves. She's a much more interesting romantic foil than most of the colorless ingenues which grace male-dominated musicals.But the real scene-stealer is the extraordinary Jean Hagen, as shrill-voiced screen queen Lina LaMont. It is such a bravura performance, she simply blows the competition off the screen. Never once does she break character. Her slow burns and takes as she reacts to other characters' comments and actions are almost as funny as her (numerous) quotable lines. "I...can...SEEWWWW." "People?! I ain't PEOPLE! I'm a...'shining, shimmering star in the Hollywood firmament.' See? Sez so, right there!" "I CAN'T make LOVE to a BUSH!" "Gee, this wig weighs a ton! What kinda dope would wear a thing like this?" And, her ultimate manifesto: "We're so thrilled you enjoyed 'The Dancing Cavalier,' our first musi-cale picture, togither. If we bring a little joy inta ya humdrum lives, it makes us feel all our hard work ain't been in vain for nothin'."There are countless comic gems in this film: gossip monger Dora Bailey's breathless account of a movie premiere; Lina's hopeless voice lessons; Lina attempting to "sing"; Don and Lina fighting as they act out a tender, silent movie love scene; and, most famously, the disastrous sneak preview of Don and Lina's first talking picture.This is one musical that can stand on its own merits as a fine example of Hollywood comedy at its best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singing In The Rain" is unique in that the song actually inspired the movie. It is set in Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Gene Kelly, 39 when it was made, stars as Don Lockwood, silent film star. Donald O'Connor was 26, played Cosmo Brown, Lockwood's long-time sidekick. And 19-yr-old Debbie Reynolds, in already her 6th film, plays Kathy Seldon, aspiring legitimate (stage) actress set on going to NYC. Lockwood met her initially when he was escaping overzealous fans and leaped into her car from a streetcar top. Also, they later met again when she jumped out of a cake at a party. She obviously needed work!However, the character who really makes the whole story possible, and the movie fantastic, is Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), Lockwood's silent screen co-star, who also happens to be a totally self-absorbed person with the most irritating voice possible. Hagen is absolutely perfect in this role, and I understand she received an Oscar nomination for it. In 1927, the first "talkie", "The Jazz Singer" with Al Jolson, changed movies forever. Suddenly the "talkies" were making all the money and the Lockwood/Lamont team had to follow or close down. No amount of diction coaching could get Lamont to sound good, and the audience could only laugh at the test screening just 6 weeks before scheduled opening. Cosmo had a great idea - Kathy would dub in her voice over Lina's. Also, the serious "Dueling Cavaliers" would become a musical, "The Dancing Cavaliers."The new musical is a big hit, Lina gets coerced by the live audience to sing a song, but it was Kathy singing behind the curtain. Midway through it, they raised the curtain to expose the truth, Lina was put in her place, and the new team of Lockwood and Selden was a hit, on and off the big screen.Except for an extended surreal dance scene with Kelly and Cyd Charisse, which seemed to break the continuity of the story, the movie is almost perfect. I rate it "9" of 10. Of course Kelly was choreographer, and co-director, so I suppose he just wanted that number in. The several energetic dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor are simply great, as are the two individual solo numbers, "Singing in the Rain" by Kelly, right after Don leaves Kathy's apartment, realizing he is in love with her, and "Make 'Em Laugh" by O'Connor, which includes his running up two different inclining walls and back-flipping off them. Who knew Debbie Reynolds could dance so well, and hold her own with Kelly and O'Connor?? Well, she couldn't until she was cast for the part, and she literally worked herself to bleeding feet in rehearsing for the production numbers, and all her hard work shows. She became a dancer for this role.I love music, and I love good dancing. I cannot watch a film like this without mentally comparing the two great dancers of 1950s film, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. I suppose Astaire was the greater "pure dancer" of the two, with always perfect positions and movements that would just glide over the floor. Kelly, however, is my overall favorite of the two. Not only is he a superb dancer, his more athletic build and dancing style, combined with good looks and singing voice, make him more believable in the musical film roles they both starred in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREATEST MUSICAL EVER MADE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the rain is one musical that even the most devout of the musical haters in todays world cannot ignore. And speaking as a reviewer who generally dislikes musicals I feel it has everything a musical should have. The songs "You are my lucky star", "Good morning" and of course the title track are timeless classics to even the most cynical ear. The film also contains a lot of satirical humour which is aimed mainly at the attitudes of the Hollywood Film community of the 1920's. The film is about Don Lockwood and his onscreen (but certainly not offscreen) love Linda Lamont who are big box office movie stars of the silent era. Also in the background is Cosmo Brown who used to work with Lockwood onstage during their early musical careers before making a name for himself as a silent movie actor. But thanks to the success of a certain film called The Jazz Singer their silent world is about to get loud. The Jazz Singer because of its talking segments has stirred a lot of interest among the general public and the Hollywood moguls decide to start making "Talkie" vehicles for their biggest stars. At first the silent movie stars mock the idea of these talkies but they soon find themselves undergoing speech therapy and singing lessons. Don Lockwood successfully passes these tests but it is his co-star Linda Lamont who cannot make the transition to be a proper "talkie" actress.The Hollywood bosses decide to hire Kathy Selden who is a chorus girl to overdub Lamont's voice. But soon Lockwood falls for Kathy much to the dismay of Lamont who tries her best to break them up. Singin' in the rain features some of the greatest dance numbers ever filmed particularily during the "Make 'Em Laugh" segment which is performed by Donald O'Connor. That dance sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Gene Kelly takes his most famous dance steps is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humour especially in the scene where Don Lockwood describes his early musical career to the press as being glamourous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Cosmo and himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall. Though at times the humour is a little bit cruel as a lot of it is at the expense of the character of Lamont. Because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is constantly ridiculed in this film. The character of Lamont epitomises the actors and actresses who failed to transcend to the world of sound because many of them were from foreign countries who spoke with thick accents. These people were eventually cut loose by the Hollywood industry and many of them lived out their lives in poverty. The fact that this film mocks them by portraying Linda Lamont as an idiot villainess with a horrible irritating voice who deservedly gets pushed aside by the Hollywood Studios at the end of the movie appears to be quite an insult to their memory. These people were not talentless like the character of Linda Lamont they were artists of a different type of medium who suddenly couldn't catch up with the technological advances of Hollywood. This film also places an emphasis on the romantic interest between Lockwood and the chorus girl Kathy. This is very good in parts but there are at times when it doesn't gel together quite right. A snobby movie star of the 1920's would never get too serious with a humble chorus girl. It would have been more believable if Lockwood had been penned as a struggling movie actor himself. The film does have a rather weak ending which would stir up a lot of derision among people who dislike musicals. This is where Lockwood sings "You are my lucky star" to Kathy in an attempt to stop her angrily leaving a packed movie theatre. I think they should have just filmed Lockwood singing the song to Kathy alone without anyone else watching. This would have made the ending less cheesier to modern audiences.I would recommend this film to anyone whether they were a musical fan or not. This film along with Calamity Jane, Finian's rainbow and Grease are I feel the greatest musicals of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's just something about musicals that I simply cannot buy into. Something very cheesy about them, but Singing in the Rain is at least watchable. This movie has a cool concept. it's about the transition from silent movies to sound and the problems that arise. Actors/Actresses with unpleasant voices for instance, like Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen, will not be wanted in sound movies. That is the basic story here in this film. Lina Lamont has a horrible high pitched voice that needs to be dubbed out. Kathy Selden, played by the beautiful Debbie Reynolds, is chosen to do the voice over for Lina. Of course things don't go as planned and it culminates in an entertaining ending.</fullReview>

This is just my opinion though because a lot of people think this was a good movie, they're not wrong i just did not like it. But that doesn't mean i didn't think it was a good movie (if that makes any sense.) Like while i was watching i didn't like it but i could still see why people like it. There was just so much damn dancing in this movie and singing and besides the 3 main characters i found most of the cast annoying or boring to watch. But again, this is just my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was too silly for me. Especially how they were dancing in the beginning with the rain coats. But I should expect stuff like that for watching a musical. But it was still a silly musical. Some parts were funny and the story was good and different from what I expected; I had no idea what the movie was actually about besides having a scene where some guy sings in the rain. I like how they referenced the Jazz Singer. I didn't like the main guy's singing and how he was super tan. I didn't realize so many songs I had heard had came from this movie so that was a surprise. Maybe this movie deserves more credit than I'm giving it. The choreography for all the dances was good though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best musical out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin in the rain is a classic musical in the 50's that will leave you smiling all through as well as laughing. As the movie commences, you have to hold your breath because you don't picture it coming out as a classic but as time progresses and some of the acts come into play, this movie takes a shape in your mind leaving behind an imprint that you won't forget.Having moderate success in the box office, as it was produced with $ 2.5 Million and it made over $ 7 Million in the box office. This movie became known by critics as one of the best musicals ever made and it stars Gene Kelly, who also directed and provided the choreography for the movie. The movie's plot featured the transition from silent film to talkies and the reactions of the actors involved, it also features the birth of musical films. Mentions were made of the first talkie The Jazz Singer in 1927.The movie has a cast of three leads, Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood, Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown and Debbie Reynolds as Kathy Selden. In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are a Hollywood romantic pair on screen but Lina, however thinks the on-screen romance is real love.Don with his former partner Cosmo has been together for years and their chase of success led to Don's rise to fame. Don and Lina's latest film is being transformed into a talkie musical but with Lina being unable to sing and act in talkies Kathy Selden is brought in to help provide the voice for Lina, which was then recorded over Lina's.During the movie production Debbie Reynolds faced major criticism from Gene Kelly, because she couldn't dance. As she was crying away under a piano, the great Fred Astaire (Astaire is named the fifth greatest male actors of all times, and whose dancing is known to have influenced many popular artist including Michael Jackson and Gregory Hines) who took her under his wings and taught her how to dance.The films famous dance routine which featured Gene Kelly singing the title song, twirling an umbrella and dancing in the rain. Kelly was sick with a fever during the shoot, as he was soaked. The shooting of the dancing scene took 3 days to shoot.Receiving a 100% approval in Rotten Tomatoes, and rated the best Musical film of all time by the American Film Institute (AFI) and is rated 5th greatest movie of all time in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). Singin in the rain is a fun movie to watch, the comedy will get to you and make you laugh and the movie has a G rating, making it suitable for everyone.I will advise you get the DVD of this movie and watch it, as it is enjoyable.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally do not like musicals very much because they usually are sort of corny and just not my usual preference of entertainment. Singin' In the Rain, however, was something that I actually enjoyed watching very much.The movie was filled with flashy wardrobes and bright colors. The stars wore tons of make-up and enthusiastically performed talented dance moves and sang catchy tunes. There was a lot of comedy, but there was also an entertaining plot and content along with a good love story.I will admit that I also caught myself laughing out loud quite a bit, and it was very enjoyable to watch. I did not find myself getting bored or looking away once. I know that I had seen this a long time ago when I was younger, but I did not remember it very well. It was very refreshing to watch again for the first time in years, and I will honestly probably end up watching it again.The storyline with the movie star actress (Jean Hagen) being a royal witch with a B and having an annoying voice was a little corny, but still undeniably fun to watch. The ending, with Debbie Reynold's character winning the man (Gene Kelly) and becoming the huge star, was predictable, but that is part of what makes the movie a classic romantic comedy.If you are ever feeling down or depressed, perhaps because it is raining outside, put on Singin' In The Rain, and I can assure you almost completely that it will cheer you up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of these romance dance and song films--AMAZING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain (1952)You gotta love a movie like this. But--how in the world do you talk about a classic that has grown so big it defines its own genre? How can you mention, politely, that it's filled with flaws?If there are parts that are frankly corny, to the point of being "stupid" if they appeared in some other movie, can you say so? (The first big opening night scenes where people are getting out of their cars might be one.)If some of the dance scenes seem like throw-ins, adding nothing to the plot and offering only more lighthearted tap dancing and goofing around, isn't this a distraction? (The diction coach dance is one candidate.)What if it's just full of itself? (The Cyd Charisse ballet scenes can be seen that way, for sure.) Or what if the plot is just too obviously a vehicle, and we can't get involved like we should in something more sincere, or more surprising? (The guy lands in the seat of a moving car and finds himself next to the girl, hello?)Well, the answer to all these is you need to chill and lighten up and realize that that's how these musicals go. It's like you had Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds over to your house and everyone started hamming it up and dancing and being silly. And Donald O'Connor stopped by to play piano (and dance up the walls). And you blow it up and give it dazzling color and bright lights. Then rehearse a little so the dance steps aren't just fun, but they are astonishing, and choreographed exquisitely? And what if you, say, want to have a little history of dance thrown in, why not? And of course modern ballet is the counterpart to modern Hollywood musical dance numbers, so why not try to mix them a bit (this is Gene Kelly's doing, mostly)? So if you ramp up the affair into a big budget, slickly filmed movie, but never lose sight of its origins as a kind of fun, not-so-serious romp, it's just a great time. A corny, silly, improbable, romantic, self-effacing, celebratory great time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie contains a number of outstandingly entertaining scenes.However, it also ignores the integrity of its own story - quite spectacularly at the end - in order to pursue some variety moments.Clearly, this works and is acceptable to a lot of viewers.In my view, abandoning the story undermines the whole, and while it might be an all-time favorite entertainment for many, I simply don't think it should be compared with - or included in the same category as - the great stories that have been told on film.It's a ripping historical document brimming with great musical moments, and definitely worth a look.But, in my view, it's certainly not a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of my wonderful childhood memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a charming and warm story, beautiful music and choreography (and dance performance) and lot of fun gags. It's a must see for people of all ages, but seeing it in early youth it's probably best (it made quite an impression on me). They don't make this kind of films anymore, and thus Singin' in the rain may remain unique in the history of film making. I don't know if it's the best performance of Gene Kelly but it sure is one of it's finest. I'm very glad to see that the film and the title song are still appealing for present generations as the were for those of the past. I hope it's beauty will also enjoy in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just a great piece of Golden Age Hollywood entertainment, and this coming from someone who doesn't generally take in a musical complete start to finish. The 'Singin' In The Rain' number I could watch over and over again, it strikes a wonderful balance of joy, freedom and artistic expression. Besides that, it's flawless, making me wonder if it could possibly have been done in one take. Curious though, if you watch closely, you won't see any 'rain' hitting Gene Kelly's face.Though it's primarily Kelly's vehicle, I was sure impressed by the little bit of dance time Donald O'Connor got. That 'Make 'Em Laugh' number was funny and bold, and if I had to say, might have been the best part of the film. OK, for me it was, without taking anything away from Kelly, especially the numbers done with the exotic Cyd Charisse. Growing up in the Fifties and Sixties, one would see all of these greats appear on a variety show every now and then, but this movie puts into perspective just how great each performer actually was.It seems to me the film got away with quite a bit in the sly innuendo department, some cleverly low key and some right out there. The Kelly/Charisse flapper number gets downright steamy at times even while it looks as innocent as all get out. For a head spinning double take, you don't get much more brazen than Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - "Well I can't make love to a bush.""Singin' In The Rain" is one of those films that will continue to wear well and entertain audiences for a long time to come. It captures the grandeur of that Hollywood Golden Age without getting overly theatrical and choreographed, and with a great blend of romance and comedy mixed into the story. It's the kind of film they don't make anymore, and in a way, that's just a bit too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but no classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you closed your eyes and threw a potato into a crowded street, you'd be guaranteed to hit someone who loves this movie. Everyone loves this movie. Just looking at the other reviews here, it's hard to find anyone who thinks it's anything less than a masterpiece. I guess I'll just have to be Billy No-Mates, because I found it to be significantly less than that.Whether you've seen it or not, you've at least heard of it and been made aware of its reputation, but as is so often the case, its reputation overstates its virtues. But while it may have been a fair distance from the five-star masterpiece I was expecting, it was still a good, and sometimes great, movie.The first thing that struck me was Gene Kelly's smile. Cheesier than a statue of Celine Dion carved in Gorgonzola, it simply refused to leave his face. He seemed incapable of frowning, and typified the mood of the movie. Its relentless cheer and optimism was infectious, and it is easy to understand why so many people describe it as a feelgood film. No one could be miserable watching this.There is an unavoidable quaintness in the film. Set in the 1920s, as silent movies gave way to talkies, it both celebrates and gently mocks a legendary era in Hollywood history. But the movie itself is now part of another legendary era in Hollywood history, and this double-nostalgia works only in its favour and adds to its immense charm.The cast is excellent without exception. Gene Kelly is great, and Donald O'Connor is just hilarious. He seems to be having the greatest time in the world making this movie and making ?em laugh. His face-pulling scene is undoubtedly one of the funniest moments the film has to offer. Jean Hagan is perfect as Lina Lamont, and gives us a truly original character. The scene where her terrible voice is revealed was lessened somewhat by having seen a similar joke in The Man with Two Brains, but this deserves the laughs having got there thirty years earlier. Her stupidity is at its funniest when she insists she and Kelly are an item because she was told so by the gossip columns, and she is blessed with perhaps the funniest line of the film: `Why, I make more money than... than... than Calvin Coolidge, put together!'It may be stating the obvious, but the dancing was just mesmerising. Kelly and O'Connor move as if on ice, and their energy is just stunning. To see real talent like theirs, and then switch to the jerky, simplified arm-waving that appears in every video on MTV, emphasises their genius. The songs, however, were something of a disappointment. With the exception of the title track and Make ?Em Laugh, they are nothing special. There were times when they felt forced into the story rather awkwardly, with Good Morning being the most irritating example.I can understand why so many people love this film, but I have no love for it myself. It was fun, and there were a load of great moments, but it didn't come close to being a masterpiece. I know I'm in the minority. For most people, it's a flawless classic. Like most of Cher, it will live forever, and that's fair enough. There is a long list of classic movies which have all disappointed me, and this was by no means the worst offender. I just wish I could have liked it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie certainly didn't appeal to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have to be one of those people who simply HATED this musical and really cannot see all the fuss over it, or ever why people think it should have won the Oscar for best picture of that year. Although it had some catchy tunes, and I guess the dancing was fine, it really didn't grab me. The plot was nearly non-existent. I put it up there with "Easter Parade", "Bandwagon", and "Finian's Rainbow" as the most boring musicals. Even though all of them have some wonderful tunes, none of them really do anything. Though I fully understood the weak excuse of a plot dealing with the transition from Vaudville, silent movies, then to talkies, I found that the actual plot was so thin it left me wanting, and it became nothing more than an excuse on which to hang some songs (albeit some really catchy and lively ones).Sadly, I find that to be the trouble with most Movie musicals. There are no characters that develop at all. However, there are some that have really grabbed me: "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers", "Meet me in Saint Louis" (and yes, it hasn't got a strong plot either, but it hangs together far better than "Singing in the Rain")"Brigadoon", "Showboat","Wizard of Oz", and a few like that. My favourite musical is "Fiddler on the Roof." Why it appeals to me is there is a real plot, and the music is not intrusive and doesn't stop the actual storyline. That is my biggest complaint with musicals is the way everything comes to a stop for the music ("Oliver" is one of the worst for this), and that usually the plot is so weak that well, were it not for the music there would be nothing whatever to watch.Each performer did a masterful job in this movie, that I can admit. The choreography was well thought out (especially anything that Gene Kelly danced, but of course, he did the choreography, so naturally what he designed for himself would be masterful). Even the singing was quite good (though I prefer more robust singing over Kelly's soft breathy crooning). And of course, the sets, costumes, and all that were wonderful. And the editing was well done.But even with all that going for it, it just left me cold and for the most part, bored. The only Movie Musical that bored me more was "Westside Story." And again, it is a musical with some really great music, just far too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here's Gene Kelly at the peek of his career. This is one of the greatest movie musicals in the history of the world. It tells the story of the transition from silent to talking films. Of course, as one would expect, there's a bit of a romance involved as well. Kelly, who co-directed this movie with Stanley Donen, is in top form. Just check out his performance of the title number, which took third place on the list of the greatest film songs of the century. His dancing is always a joy to watch. Plus, he's always had good screen presence, all the way up to his final years. Debbie Reynolds is the girl with whom he is in love. Unfortunately, her singing talent is hardly done justice in this movie. She has a great voice, and she's able to display it in "Good Morning, Good Morning", but with the slower, more melodic numbers, she either has only a brief solo, or is being dubbed. That's not really her dubbing Lina's voice, Jean Hagen speaks for herself, and Betty Noyce sings. Oh well. Speaking of that, no one could have played Lina like Jean Hagen. Oooh, that ghastly voice. Makes me want to give her a great big hug! The always lovable Donald O'Connor brings out all the welcome spice you could ask for. He really knows how to "make 'em laugh" (forgive me!). Cyd Charisse never fails to impress with her dancing skills, though it can't be denied that she's not very attractive this time around: steam coming out of her nose, much too short hair, and even her expression. It sure made a lot more sense that she fell for that gangster guy who kept tossing a coin like George Raft in "Scarface" instead of Kelly during the "Broadway Melody" sequence. Also featured in the cast are: Douglas Fowley as the hysterical director, Millard Mitchell as the producer, and a young Rita Moreno as the lady who was supposed to have Lina's part originally (I think that's the story).The fantastic musical score was composed by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed. Besides the ones previously mentioned, some of the songs include: "You Were Meant For Me", "Fit As a Fiddle", "You Are My Lucky Star", "Beautiful Girl", "All I Do is Dream of You" and a small tongue-twister "Moses-Supposes". I should bring that one to Drama Club sometime. That's about all there is to say. I advise you not to miss this one. It's an essential addition to anyone's film repertoire.Famous Line: "If we bring a little joy into your humdrum lives, it makes us feel as though our hard work ain't been in vain for nothing'."

		<fullReview>Singin' In The Rain quite possibly one of the best movie musicals of all time. The dancing is unforgettable and fantastic, mesmerizing the audience until the credits are done. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor are perfect in their roles. Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a cocky and handsome superstar in the 1920s who just made a bad talking movie with his romantic leading lady, Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen). Donald O'Connor's character, Cosmo Brown, is the absolutely hilarious best friend of Lockwood, who sings his famous "Make 'Em Laugh" number and cracks jokes from beginning to end. Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) enters the plot as Lockwood's love interest and Lena Lamont gets jealous. "Moses Supposes", "Singin' In The Rain" and "Broadway Melody" are fantastic and classic numbers that will make you want to become a dancer yourself! Each time I watch this film, it gets better and better. I can never get sick of it. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is rightly regarded as one of the most fondly regarded musicals of Hollywood's golden age. Not only does it contain four superb performances (Gene Kelly as vain silent screen idol Don Lockwood, painfully making the transition to sound; Debbie Reynolds as Cathy Selden, a chorus girl who wants to be a great actress; Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, the dependable friend who puts fun into the movie; and Jean Hagen as the screechy Lina Lamont, Don's erstwhile co-star) but is an affectionate tribute to the birth of the talkies.The best scene of all is of course, Gene's dance down a rain-sodden street, much anthologised and by far the most technically accomplished and totally joyous piece of musical cinema. I also have to mention the Broadway Melody sequence, featuring the great Cyd Charisse - perfection itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the vitality of its parts, as well as of the whole, that does it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That "Singin' in the Rain" is a great film you can learn from more erudite and closely argued reviews than mine (and from more enthusiastic reviews, too, although I love the film as much as anyone and could be just as enthusiastic if I chose).I'd just like to mention one thing: the films within the film. Donen and Kelly deserve especial credit for not slacking off here. The swashbuckling silent picture that introduces us to Lockwood and Lamont actually comes across as a well-made crowd-pleaser (it is admittedly more compressed than a real film of the era would have been, but we can forgive the compression), and since Gene Kelly isn't afraid to give Lockwood his own charm, energy and physical skill, it's no strain at all to believe that he's a popular actor, or that the film could be a box-office success. (I wouldn't mind seeing it myself.) And the first and last sound Lockwood-and-Lamont vehicle is equally persuasive (in its earlier incarnation as a dire piece of petrified staginess AND later, when it's a perfectly decent early stab at a screen musical).Kelly claims that the "Broadway Melody" section grew and grew from a tiny diversion to a huge, long, lavish diversion; and this, too, tells us something: that side references of this kind, to projects which the various characters happen to be or have been working on, have a life of their own, which means that the projects themselves have a life of their own. This is a GOOD thing. The musical numbers that are part of the story fit the story perfectly well, and as everyone knows the title song could not be a more natural or apt expression of Lockwood's feelings than it is in context. The musical numbers that are NOT part of the story are bound by no such rules of integration. Nor should they be.The final film-within-the-film ? Lockwood and Selden's first project together, the film they're looking at a billboard advertisement for in the final shot ? is also entitled "Singin' in the Rain". Some people think that the film they make is more or less the film we see. But of course it isn't. "Singin' in the Rain" ? neither the film we see, nor any film that Lockwood and Selden would have made together ? is not some exercise in twee, unimaginative, academic self-reference. These people have talent. It's clear from the other samples of their craft that they're capable of CREATING stuff (in fact, they could scarcely prevent themselves from doing so), and they don't need to bottle their own autobiographies and pass it off as art. If you want some clue as to what the film-within-a-film version of "Singin' in the Rain" is like, look to the opening credits, in which we see Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds singing in the rain together. I believe that this is a conceptual sketch (just as the version of "Broadway Melody" we see is a conceptual sketch) of the musical number as it will appear in Lockwood and Selden's film. It's clear the film they make is something entirely removed from the story of how they came to make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but too much singing and dancing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie. Good acting, nice story, all that. But several of the song and dance numbers seem like they were in the movie just because they thought there should be a song and dance number at that point. The numbers didn't advance the story, or illustrate people's emotions, or anything like that. Some examples are the dance number with the dialogue coach, "Good Morning", and the entire "Broadway Melody" sequence. That last one is an amazing number, but it doesn't fit in this movie. There's no reason for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With an entertaining story, interesting characters, a good cast, and song sequences that are often both lavish and creative, this has everything you could ask for in a musical. Besides being one of the best musicals ever made, it is also one of the best of the movies that Hollywood has ever made about itself.The story is a somewhat exaggerated and very amusing look at Hollywood as it underwent the transition from silents to sound. The main characters are defined nicely, and the cast does a fine job with them. The trio of Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor really look as if they are having a good time together. It gets a lot of mileage out of even the simplest aspects of the changes that sound pictures brought, and while the main plot is fairly simple, there are plenty of laughs. Most of the musical numbers work quite well, although the rest of the movie is so good that it probably could have stood up pretty well on its own anyway.This classic is great entertainment, and a movie you can enjoy whether or not you usually like musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title says it all. It's hard to put my love for this movie into words, quite simply because no description can ever do the film justice. Everything is as it should be: the cast, the music, the lyrics, the dancing, the script and plot... the last is most significant, since with musicals (and movie musicals in particular), you always get the sense that the plot has been skimped on--compromised for the songs that the writer wants to feature in the film. In this film, however, all the songs are part of a whole, and the whole works beautifully.If you watch one movie musical in your whole life, make it 'Singin' In The Rain'. Join Gene Kelly as he dances and whirls through the rain and straight into Kathy's (and the audience's) heart. A classic for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin in the Rain is perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made. I absolutely just love this film. It combines music, dance and a really witty script to make the most magnificent of MGM's musicals. The story goes like this: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the toast of 1920's Hollywood. Then The Jazz Singer comes out and all hell breaks loose when they realize that talkies are going to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, Lina has a voice that could shatter a mirror and caaaiiint seem to get anything done when a microphone is present. Don't worry though; Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) saves the day and knocks Don right off his feet. She promises to dub over Lina's voice and stay at the back of the cameras. Of course while Lina believes the press that Don and her are an item, Don is falling in love with the beautiful Kathy. All of the stars put in brilliant performances, especially Donald O'Connor, his ?Make em Laugh' scene has to be one of the best-choreographed displays ever. Jean Hagen's portrayal of the shrill blond bombshell is absolutely hilarious, which won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination that year. And of course the multi-talented Gene Kelly: he can act, sing, and dance? the triple threat. It still amazes me how Gene Kelly was also able to choreograph and co-direct while taking on the role of the main character. Debbie Reynolds is great too, but in my opinion she plays second fiddle to Ms. Hagen. My favorite bit would have to be the trademark Singin in the Rain scene. Just watching Gene Kelly sing and dance around in the streets while it is pouring rain is just wonderful. This is a great film and I recommend it to everybody. If you haven't seen Singin in the Rain then you must go see it, if you already have seen it then watch it again, and for those who don't think highly of musicals; this one is a must for you guys cause it will change the way you view musicals.</fullReview>

Kelly and Jean Hagen (Oscar-nominated) are two of the biggest movie stars of the late-1920s. However, films are turning to sound and Hagen has an awful voice. Enter a very young Debbie Reynolds as the voice behind Hagen's physical performances. The film is intelligent, funny, dramatic, and the musical numbers only add to everything else within the landscape of the movie. Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, and Rita Moreno are all perfect in supporting turns. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying, I hate musicals. Hate them. I have little respect for a genre with such patently bizarre conventions as the musical. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment, they are part of the American cultural landscape in a way that makes them almost unavoidable. I also, much to my chagrin, like Grease and Hair, but for different reasons.With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain. I love it. It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again. SitR is a fun movie, that pokes fun at its own conventions and explodes them in strange and wonderful ways. Gene Kelly is simply too cool. He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance steps (Billy Joel could pull it off sometimes too). Gene Kelly is a damn cool guy with the chops and credentials to make nearly any role legitimate. SitR is no exception. Especially the bizarre, Bernhard-esque dance number at the end, which Kelly choreographed himself. Fantastic.Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works. He is damn funny. His hyperkinetic Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today. He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes his scenes work.The plot itself is interesting, it is a musical about the origins of musicals. It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one. I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Doot Doot Do Doot Do Doot Doot[?]" this joyful hum sung and danced its way into America's hearts in the 1950s, and even though the 21st century is well under way, this glorious film continues to put smiles on people's faces. Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 musical comedy which starred Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Conner. The film was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen and produced by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer or MGM. The movie premiered in Radio City Music Hall in New York City on March 27, 1952, and was released in theatres on April 11, 1952. It made over 7 million dollars in the box office and was one of the highest grossing movies that year. Just to summarize the film a little bit without giving away too much of the plot, the films opens on a movies premiere at the renowned Grauman's Chinese Theatre in California. The crowds have gathered to see the star studded cast including Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont arrive for the premiere of their new movie. When the premiere had finished, Lockwood finds himself in a situation where he is running away from female fans that are chasing him. Lockwood hops into a car where he meets Kathy Seldon. Not realizing who he is at first she screams and tries to get him out of her car. Finally a police officer sees them and instantly recognizes Lockwood from his movies. Seldon feels a bit embarrassed, but continues on the conversation. They get into a disagreement over whether what Don does in his movies is really acting or not. Kathy believes that just looking at the screen and miming the words is not really acting. There needs to be spoken word. Later after having run into Kathy again, he becomes infatuated with her and tries to track her down but is unsuccessful.A few weeks later Don walks onto set for his new movie and the producer of the company approaches Don with a crisis. The talkie The Jazz Singer had become a huge success and the public no longer want to see silent films but wanted to see talking films. The rest of the film deals with the struggle of transforming a silent film into a talking motion picture as well as inner character conflicts resulting in the iconic film that we all love today. Being slightly on the biased side because I am a geek for musicals whether it be on the stage or on the screen, I think that this film deserves all of the recognition that history gives it. While I can understand that it was seen as just another movie when it was released, Gene Kelly made his roll iconic and his scene Singin' in the Rain is one of the most recognized movie scenes in history with his swinging around the lamp post holding his umbrella. This film does a great job portraying the transition that production studios and companies had to go through when the element of a sound system was introduced to the film industry. When the films were silent, they did not have to worry about what the actors' voices sounded like because no one could hear what they sounded like. This film has the perfect balance of humor woven in with desired romance while portraying an important period in history for the United States. While this film may not have been revered during the time of its release, it certainly has made its mark in film history, and if you are in for a good laugh and love musicals, or if you just want to watch a great film, Singin' in the Rain is definitely a film to pick up and watch. It's going to make you want to get up, walk outside and skip around in the summer pouring rain, because we need to "let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place" and "come on with the rain[?]"</fullReview>

All that being said it's good family-type entertainment and they couldn't make a musical like this today. Multi-talented performers like these are gone forever and i feel like that is something that needs to change very soon .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is just that, a musical about overcoming a storm of problems and serves as a great reboot of the musical genre of films. Even if you aren't a fan of these types of movies it is still possible to gather entertainment from this quirky flick. The songs aren't particularly memorable in any sense, besides for maybe two of them, "Good Morning" and "Singin' in the Rain," (of course). While it does nothing different from musicals in our generation of films, it was underrated at the time of its release and harbored an aspect that similar musicals had lacked, a plot! Oh yes, a plot to glue everything together, while collective yet overdone, it operated efficiently and did its job of keeping the audiences attention. Looking back upon this movie retrospectively, it might be labeled as a classic, but it is nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a colorful up beat type of musical. This film is full of classic tunes that they will have stuck in your head for the rest of the week. However some songs and dance sequences can drag on and seem a bit dramatic.Speaking of dragging out I feel that is all the ending was , a big drawn out symphony of dance and song that didn't seem to fit or really feel necessary. The title song is popularized in a more recent film a Clock Work Orange(1971), and having seen that film first i think gave me the wrong preconceived feeling about the song maybe causing me to enjoy it less in this film. However this film definitely leaves your foot tapping and has its own type of hilarity in its dance routines.</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of musicals to begin with, and the dialog was pretty corny, but the plot and the choreography was impeccable. This film successfully managed to tell two stories parallel to each other: the romance between Kathy and Don and the way that the industry dealt with the turning point of cinema (sound). The dancing was flawless and the costumes were vibrant and beautiful. Some of the humor was enjoyable. "Make 'Em Laugh" was a funny song and the physical comedy was entertaining. The choreography during the song that Don, Kathy and Cosmo sang together was perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favorite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, Donald O'Connor &amp; Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film.Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well. Even without the music, a movie about the advent of sound in cinema and the differences in acting and performance that came with it is an interesting an original topic to explore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie serves as a kind of meta commentary...as it is a musical about the making of a musical. The film seems to poke fun at the desperation of the movie industry in the 20's to put out sound films, just to please audiences. The soundtrack for this movie is fantastic. I can honestly say I've never heard the entire title track "Singing in the Rain" until watching the whole film and it was stuck in my head for weeks. All of the musical scenes were well choreographed, looked great in color, and were extremely well voiced by the actors and actresses. The cast was largely multi talented and created a great musical in the process of making fun of a bad one.</fullReview>

The movie is funny and the singing just flows its not random. it was a good movie the middle/end was slow in my opinion. The scenes confused me and I wasn't sure if it was actually happening or if he was just imagining it. The ending of the movie was perfect though since the evil girl go exactly what she deserved. I was actually very frustrated. she had the whiny voice and I am glad the audience was able to see that. I also never made the realization that America fell in love with stars and sometimes had never even actually heard their voices.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say this is one of my favorite movies. I'm not a huge fan of musicals so I did not have very high aspirations for this film. I thought that the plot would be a little more exciting so that caused me to loose focus and therefore ultimately not like the film. The only saving grace for this film was that the characters were moderately funny which made it relatively enjoyable and kept my interest until then end. The cinematic elements of this film were very strong but I think the most effective was the light and obviously, since this is a musical, the sound. The light really gave the film that movie studio look that the production staff was looking for. The movie sounded good overall and those who have a greater appreciation for music could certainly find a loathing for the way the sound was implemented in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I wouldn't call this film Oscar worthy, it was definitely one that captured my attention. The quick witted humor between Don and Cosmo, as well as the adorable romance between the Hollywood beau and the up-and-comer were entertaining, to say the least. I do however, believe this movie is both wonderfully simple and highly overrated. Yes, the musical numbers are outstanding, the singing and dancing are great, the cinematography looks beautiful, and there's some memorable sequences, but overall, this feels rather light. But, it did irritate me that most of the musicals numbers weren't really there to serve the story or move things forward, but just pass the time. I will say, that Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's direction is flawless. Rather than the quick cutting and intense camera movement which is supposed to create more excitement but is really just proof of the director's lack of confidence, Kelly and Donen are content to simply enjoy the spectacle of each amazing set-piece. Their restraint is on display throughout the entire film, trusting that the audience is feeling each moment without the need for explicitly telling them.</fullReview>

However, there were certain aspects that anyone can enjoy about this film. The grand chorus lines and just sheer size of some of the scenes is quite impressive, as well as the coloring. The plot is quite serious actually but Gene Kelly does a great job of adding comedy and boastfulness to the film. The music, not being my cup of tea, is still very great and if you are into large Broadway productions you will love this film. The mise-en-sense of the film is charming.

		<fullReview>Listen, I am not a fan of musicals. It just isn't my thing. However, due to a film class we were forced to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). I'm not going to say it was great or even good, but I could tell why it was a classic. It has the great actors, great voices, and a pretty good story line. I went into the film not expecting much comedy but came out laughing at certain scenes. Jean Hagen's character is funny the entire length of the movie and is a really underrated piece I believe. You can say that she is the center of the movie and what the plot centers on. The singing is okay, typical 1940s/50s corny stuff. This movie is certainly a pioneer for the musical genre but not something everyone will get on board with.</fullReview>

It not only showed how people felt about it, but what it also meant for the actors/actress' and the movie business at the time. This was the perfect subject for the film as in this film they also show just how far sound and color have come from the age that is portrayed, putting on elaborate and colorful singing and dancing routines. Some of the routines did get a little carried away at times, but overall they weren't too frequent or overbearing and there was a pretty good balance of musical and story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think some of the songs could have been cut. The dream-like sequence at the end didn't really seem to fit in, and also there are parts I think could have been cut out. The Good Morning song I guess makes sense (it was morning), but I think it could have been cut, for example.Regardless, it is an excellent example of a comedy, and of a musical done well. I just don't like it when they begin dancing spontaneously, as it takes me out of the world within the movie. That's just me though.The ending was fantastic as well, with the tension building up, and then the grand reveal behind the curtain, and everyone lives happily ever after. That didn't even feel contrived to me, and I think it's difficult to pull of a happy ending like that while making it feel natural.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm 20 years old, and my mother raised me on the songs, but I had never seen the movie itself until I took a cinema class in college, and boy, was I missing out. The music and sound were incredible, as well as the tracking shots. It all has a kind of staged feel which I felt fit very well with the plot of the movie, since most of it DID take place on the stage. And, we have the introduction of dancing and musical numbers, which are always a great thing to throw in. Keeping in the trend of having the viewer feel like the people they are viewing, everything was lit very well, which is reminiscent of the stage lights that they had to stand under. Furthermore, the viewer is introduced to the type of problems that they might face if they were in show business during the transition from silent to sound: Worrying about one's voice, etc. I really think it's an incredible movie that doesn't get near enough attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is one of those movies I think of when I think "classic". I have a question; who can hate this movie? Just like Wizard of Oz, this movie is so full of life, so colorful, so upbeat, so happy, what's not to like? The songs are great, the characters are great, the art direction is great, everything is just great. This movie brings such a big smile to my face that I have to go to a surgeon to fix it. If you're ever feeling down, Singin' in the Rain is the perfect movie to watch. I love the story, and how it tells of the tragic time when movies went to sound and a lot of actors couldn't make the transition. It's like The Artist, but much happier. The acting is typical 1950s musical acting, and there's a lot of corniness to the whole thing, but that's what makes it hold up so well today. Just like Wizard of Oz, this is a movie most people see at a young age, and grow up loving it. It doesn't seem realistic, but this is classic Hollywood. We don't watch movies to see our own lives, we watch movies because they're the opposite of our terrible reality, and they allow us to escape for a short time. It may be a little silly at times, but it just shows how much fun making movies can be. Singin' in the Rain is a classic, and one of the greatest films of all time. It really is one of the most lovable classics in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good! I thought the different technical things that they used were new and different from some of the other movies, making it separate from other movies more.This movie was full of musical numbers and dancing scenes, they added new angles and interesting perspectives. They shot each individual dancing scene in a unique way, in a one of the scenes that they had a montage of scenes in a quick moment. One particular scene with Kathy and Don dancing on stage, the perspective and angle isn't consistent, it switches up from close up shots to scenes that are farther away. In the Singing in the Rain scene, the do a pan shot of him walking along sidewalk. The use of the Technicolor was very cool, and it worked for the movie and I think if certain scenes were not in color it would not show the same effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie that's great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are plenty of movies which may be a lot of fun but aren't really great movies. Singin' in the Rain is a great movie. And great fun. It is one of the most iconic movies ever and deservedly so. Even people who have never seen the whole movie know Gene Kelly splashing about in the rain. But this is a movie which is so much more than that one legendary musical number. For starters there are plenty of other musical numbers which are just as good as, or perhaps depending on your tastes, even better than Kelly's famous nighttime twirl through the rainy streets. But what makes the movie truly great is that it does not have to rely solely on the big song-and-dance numbers. This is a movie with a great story. So many musicals are just biding their time between songs. Not this one. There are actually compelling things going on between the songs. And funny things too. Add it all up and this is absolutely fabulous entertainment.It's Kelly everyone remembers most but great credit must also go to his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. The three of them make such a great team, their Good Morning number is as good as it gets, just as much of a highlight as the title song. We know what a legendary dancer Kelly is but O'Connor and Reynolds more than hold their own. O'Connor even gets a showcase of his own with Make 'Em Laugh, a number which is as much acrobatics as dance. Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds are all terrific in their singing, their dancing and their acting. And yet perhaps the best performance is turned in by Jean Hagen. And Hagen doesn't do any singing or dancing at all. And that's the point. Hagen, a wonderfully talented actress, is playing a completely terrible actress who can't sing, can't dance, can't even talk. It takes a great actress to pull that off and Hagen absolutely nails it.The story takes place in Hollywood at the dawn of the talking pictures era. Kelly and Hagen play Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, the most famous and popular screen couple of the time. But they are silent film stars, the transition to talkies will be quite painful. The biggest problem is Lina's voice which is indescribably bad, grating to the extreme. The movie has plenty of fun at her expense and milks lots of laughs out of the overall struggle of those working in film at the time to come to grips with this newfangled sound technology. How can Don Lockwood go forward in this new era if he's attached to the talentless dim-bulb Lina? Enter, thanks to a rather ingenious suggestion from Don's friend Cosmo Brown, young Kathy Selden. Kathy's got the talent and the charm Lina lacks and Reynolds plays the part of the wide-eyed girl caught up in the crazy world of Hollywood so beautifully. Don and Kathy could be a great pairing, on and off screen...if only Lina could be nudged out of the way.There is a story here full of comic possibilities and the movie takes full advantage of it. O'Connor's character of Cosmo has a few clownish moments but nothing too far over-the top. No need for a lot of slapstick silliness. The movie's more subtle than that. Smarter too. And whereas many musicals struggle to weave the songs into the story everything fits together wonderfully here. The only real misstep comes near the end with a huge production number which unfortunately sticks out like a sore thumb. In addition to going on for far too long it is quite disconnected from the plot. It really seems like an indulgence for co-director Kelly. There was nobody who could tell him it didn't belong. It's performed very well, it just is out of place. And it stops the movie's momentum just as it should be building to a big finish. It's one musical number too far. But that should not detract from what is all in all a brilliantly conceived and performed movie. It may have slowed down a touch at the end but it still has its big finish, and a thoroughly satisfying finish at that. Such a fun, enjoyable, charming movie. Great entertainment. What a glorious feeling indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the Greatest Musican Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain (1952) **** (out of 4) If this isn't the greatest musical ever made it's certainly near the very top of the list. Set in 1927, a movie studio decides to pull the production on a silent picture and convert it to sound. The lead star (Gene Kelly) is fine with the idea but the only problem is that the leading lady (Jean Hagen) doesn't have a good speaking voice. After a disastrous preview screening, the idea gets launched that they should dub the actresses voice with that of someone who can sing and speak (Debbie Reynolds). SINGIN' IN THE RAIN just had its 60th Anniversary re-release and it was quite something getting to see it on the big screen but what's even more remarkable was the fact that the film made it this long. It's funny to know that the film was only a moderate success when it was first released and I wonder what the Kelly and company would have thought at the time if people would be gathering sixty years later to watch the film, which is certainly one of the most loved of all time. Even though everything in the film is a major success, I think it's fair to say that Kelly deserves most of the credit since he not only played the lead but he also co-directed, came up with the dances and helped with just about every part of the picture. The work Kelly does here is just remarkable and especially considering how many terrific moments there are with just the singing and dancing alone. The title track and dance is one of the most memorable, charming and joyous in film history but we also get classic takes with 'Make Em Laugh,' 'Good Morning' and the closing big number, a take on 'The Broadway Melody.' Not only are these sequences terrific but so is the main story as it works perfectly well as a throwback to the day when musicals really took off. The stuff dealing with Hollywood's transition from silent to sound rings especially true and leads to some terrific jokes and some very funny moments. Of course, it goes without saying but the entire cast is terrific with Kelly leading the way with a very strong performance in the lead. Reynolds is also very good as the virginal new star and Donald O'Connor gets some terrific moments with his laugh out loud funny performance. Hagen deserves a lot of credit for the high-pitched dumb blonde who can't do anything right. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is clearly one masterpiece that really lives up to its high reputation. It really doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, the magic lives on each repeat viewing because the dancing, the singing, the mood and the performances are simply so good that it's impossible not to get drawn into the material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Glorious Feeling ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And what a glorious film ... #5 film in AFI's Top 100 movies, #1 musical, #16 romance and #16 comedy, "Singin in the Rain" doesn't celebrate Hollywood, it defines it through a range of emotions, so rich that you can't finish this timeless classic without shouting : "Now, that's entertainment!" If there is ever a movie for which the word iconic takes its full meaning, "Singin' in the Rain" takes the cake, and an appetizing one where you can expect the beautiful Debbie Reynolds jumping out of it. With Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly, she forms the so lovable trio that sets the cheerful mood in the opening sequence : holding their umbrellas, wearing raincoats, they enthusiastically walk and express their joy to be simply 'singin in the rain'. Indeed, the title itself, beyond its reference to the most memorable song, embodies the film's main feeling, something so positive it's impossible to write a review without using up all the synonyms of 'happiness'."Singin' in the Rain" incarnates a quite hedonistic philosophy of life, inspiring the most positive emotions even when the natural elements don't help. While many people try to run for a dry spot, afraid to get wet and catch a cold, Gene Kelly's let himself getting rain soaked while his heart is basking under sunshine of love. He savors the moment with a total carelessness, inviting the rain to come at him. This part doesn't only work because of the communicative aspect of the 'glorious' feeling, but also as an incredibly inspirational moment in its sheer simplicity. The image of Kelly swinging on the lamppost, is the eternal allegory of happiness that only Cinema could have illustrated, a happiness going through every possible stage, delight, pleasure, enchantment until it becomes a totally jubilant moment where Kelly literally splashes on a ocean of joy, until he faces a cop, whose presence puts an end to this orgasmic mayhem, and the melody can finally end ? leaving us with these immortal lines "I'm dancing and singing in the rain"This is one of these magical sequences that immediately penetrated people's hearts and, once and for all, our universal heritage. No one can imagine this film without immediately thinking of the rain, the lamppost and Gene Kelly's illuminating smile. I can't evoke the film, I can't watch it or live it without it bringing me back to my childhood memories. I discovered the song through one of its countless parodies, and it stuck in my mind right away. Once, my dad saw a documentary about the film and immediately called me to see if I that sequence rang a bell. Another day, still as a child, I saw a documentary about Hollywood MGM Golden Age, only waiting for the 'Singin' in the Rain' part ? and when I got to see the film, I finally surprised myself by enjoying the comedy more than the musical, and "Make 'em laugh" by Donald O'Connor, became my favorite part."Make' em Laugh" is another amazing achievement that works alone as an efficient antidepressant. Donald O'Connor accomplishes an impressive acrobatic number, extending his comedic performance to every single element of slapstick, with a natural goofiness and perfect timing that makes it look like a spontaneous act of virtuosity and makes you forget about the rehearsal this would have probably taken : you just open your eyes, and admire the performance. He laughs, smiles, makes funny faces, gravity-defying moves with one motto, no ... not "dignity, dignity" but on the contrary trading any sense of dignity in order to make the other laugh, or giggle, or smile or at least feel good. O'Connor is the perfect clown without any ounce of sadness, the scene-stealing comic relief of a rather hilarious comedy! The movie doesn't disobey the implicit golden rule that there's no better comedy than one with a heart, and the heart of the film belongs to the exquisite Debbie Reynolds, whose character has the merit of having 'inspired' the iconic rain sequence. She's extremely poignant in her lack of confidence and her will to help her friends that we automatically feel for her, as he would do to a Disney Princess. This analogy is not fortuitous and probably explains why I enjoyed the comedy more than the romance, the funny musical numbers more than the serious ones, the villain more than the princess. What a villain by the way, hard to imagine the film's success without the incredible Lina Lamont, played by Jean Hagen who provides perhaps more laughs than O'Connor in the comedy department, with her voice, speech mannerism and hilarious "What am I dumb or something?" catchphrase.My last comment didn't intend to diminish the merit of the romance but I don't really see it as the movie's highlight although it features many memorable scenes. When Kelly as Lockwood says to Lina : "I don't like her half as I hate you", I think he sums it up quite well, as many fans probably love the romance but not as much as they adore the comedy. And count me also among those who fail to see the relevancy of the whole 'Broadway Melody' sequence that kind of deviated from the intelligence of the plot and weakened its 'vis comica'. "Singin' in the Rain" had to keep on the clever homage to that crucial transition to talking pictures and self-reflexive celebration of the genre that consecrated the triumph of talking pictures, the genre that probably best incarnates the bright side of Hollywood : musicals. As flashy, flamboyant and enjoyable as it was, the scene could've been shorter, end up with a kind of punchline or at least respected the "Make' em laugh!" motto.I rated it a 9 because of the Broadway sequence, but the rest of the film deserves a 11 as one of the greatest comedies and the greatest musical ever, even better than "Guys and Dolls" put together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I was dreading having to watch a musical, especially an old one, but wow. It was really really good. The dancing was actually quite talented, funny, and at times plain awesome. I was a big fan of Cosmo (and the way he did a backflip off the wall), he really picked the movie back up at certain parts. They all had good singing voices and worked really well together. It was surprisingly funny too and found myself laughing out loud at parts. Good tap-dancing is so hard not to appreciate, because it's just so entertaining when done well. I highly recommend anyone with phobias of musicals to give this one a chance, you can even take your girlfriend and get brownie points!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like musicals this is one that I would definitely recommend. It is great to see Kelly and Reynolds have so much chemistry on screen. It was said that Kelly gave her a real hard time because she was not a dancer as he was. She could of fooled me. Both performed many forms of dance and did it well. It isn't easy to be synchronized as they were. They are both a triple threat. Not only were they memorizing lines but hundred of choreographed movements as well. Kelly's performance in the "singingin the rain" scene is one that has been talked about for time to come. It was full of talent and funny at the same time.The story line was very entertaining and educating at the same time. It was comical for them to show the behind the scenes of the studios and to almost mock films which were made before with less technology. I would highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really the biggest fan of musicals but I did somewhat enjoy this one. The acting was quite good and the dancing was fa-nominal. I enjoyed how the musical told the story of the switch of the movie industry from silent films to "talkies" and the troubles that came with it. The colors were amazing which made this movie very interesting to watch. The love story was complicated but not so much that it didn't make sense. The thing that I most enjoyed were the dance routines. I have never seen dancing like that before. Even the minor characters could dance, like the "make em laugh" song. Even if you aren't a big fan of musicals, this is one that anyone can enjoy and it is obvious why it is a great American classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is bright and happy, beautifully colored and sang. The story itself is of becoming someone in a town where it is offal easy to be no one; Hollywood. These starlets fight to be at the top and do an amazing performance throughout. not to mention the comedy and adorable love story that all take place in this beautifully done musical. I, myself truly like musicals and this one was fantastic by my standards. I was surprised with the quality of the color and sound and just the brilliance of the comedy. the whole musical was a crazy run around with so many things happening all at once, you couldn't not pay attention. In conclusion you could say i really loved this movie, though it had its moments all and all it was truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What struck me the most about the movie was both the music and the costumes. "Singin' in the Rain" tells the story of Don, Kathy and their friend Cosmo during the time that Hollywood pictures were beginning to talk, and therefore beginning to sing. I am a lover of musicals, yet I had never seen this one before. I was amazed by the colors of the costumes as well as the musical numbers and the choreography that went with them. Gene Kelly amazed me at his dancing abilities, as I had never seen any man dance like that before and Debbie Reynolds, who I learned was not a dancer, but in fact a gymnast and learned all her dancing on the set. In a age where the only place one can seem to see a musical is on a Broadway, or off Broadway, production, it was refreshing to see a musical as a movie with amazing sound and color.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of musicals on film, i like going to the theater and watching a play but something about seeing it on film doesn't generally work for me. However, with that said, this film is incredible. It manages to pack everything of Hollywood's "Golden Age" into the film, great acting, great dialog, beautiful direction and cinematography (the colors, oh the colors) and on top of that it's probably the best musical ever put on film. Now everybody knows the songs aren't original but the dance numbers are great, even the ones that you would think were less prominent (i.e. Make 'em Laugh) are better than most musical's best numbers and Donald O'Connor really steals the show with this one in my opinion. The dance number that immediately comes to mind when you think of this film is Singin' In the Rain and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Gene Kelley is an incredible dancer and he'll have you mesmerized while you watch the scene. I watched this film in my History of American Cinema class and I have a hard time arguing against it being the best of the bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain (1952)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed all the great dancing and acrobatics in Singin' in the Rain (1952). The dancing almost reminded me of an older version of break dancing. Especially in the "Make 'em Laugh" song when Cosmo runs up the wall, as well as other crazy stunts. The female dancing resembled that of the flapper styles from a few decades before the movie was made. The film was comedic and clever, with a balanced mix of impressive music and dance. When the song "Beautiful Girls" was performed, it reminded me of Buzby Berkely style of filming, with all the colors and patterns of the female background dancers. When Don performs "Singin' in the Rain", the camera motion is very fluid, and transitions itself around the dancing actor smoothly and unnoticeable. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but this film is definitely a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Glorious Feeling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Self-referential art can be tedious. Although there are exceptions, it is generally a safe rule of thumb that any novel whose main character is a novelist should be left on the bookshop or library shelf. About conceptual works of art whose purpose is to make a meaningful statement about the purpose of works of art, the less said the better. And when Hollywood makes a film about Hollywood the result is normally either introspective navel-gazing or smug self-congratulation.There are, however, exceptions. The early fifties saw two great movies about the movie industry, one a tragedy ("Sunset Boulevard" from 1950) and the other a comedy ("Singin' in the Rain" from two years later). Remarkably, both films were inspired by the same actress, Norma Talmadge. Talmadge is today a largely forgotten figure; she was a huge star in the silent era of the 1910s and 1920s, but along with John Gilbert became one of the major casualties of the coming of sound in the late twenties. She made two "talkies", but neither was a success and her career came to an end in 1930. Part of the problem was her working-class New Jersey accent; American society is not as linguistically classless as some would like to believe. (Talmadge was still alive in 1952, and I often wonder what she made of these two films; in neither case is the character based on her portrayed in a very sympathetic way)."Singin' in the Rain" is set in the Hollywood of 1927. The Talmadge figure is Lina Lamont, a highly popular silent film star working for the fictitious studio Monumental Pictures. Lina has a crush on her handsome co-star Don Lockwood and convinces herself that he is in love with her. In reality Don has little time for Lina who is vain, shallow and stupid. (She is also to prove bitchy and spiteful). When the first talking picture, "The Jazz Singer", proves an enormous success, the head of the studio decides that he will convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, "The Dueling Cavalier", into a talkie. (The film is a romance set during the French Revolution; Talmadge's final film, "Du Barry, Woman of Passion" was also set in eighteenth-century France). This, however, proves to be a problem, as Lina has a harsh and grating voice, and attempts to give her elocution lessons prove unsuccessful. A young actress, Kathy Selden, is hired to dub Lina's voice. The rest of the film deals with the growing romance between Don and Kathy and with Lina's sexual and professional jealousy of her young rival.Mention "Singin' in the Rain" to anyone today and they will probably think of the sequence in which Gene Kelly performs the title song, a sequence which has become famous, even among those who have not seen the actual film. Even parodies of it, such as the one performed by the British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have become famous in their own right.There is, however, more to this film than just one single scene. It is often compared with that other fine Gene Kelly musical from a year earlier, "An American in Paris". The two films, however, are quite different, and each has its own strengths. "An American in Paris" is certainly more visually imaginative, and I would also rank it higher in terms of its music. Although "Singin' in the Rain" has some well-known songs, including not only the title song but also the likes of Make 'Em Laugh" and "Good Morning", I would not class these as highly as Gershwin's music used in the earlier film. Both films have a balletic sequence designed to show off Kelly's dance skills. In "An American in Paris" he dances with Leslie Caron, who plays his love-interest in that film, but here his partner is not his leading lady Debbie Reynolds but rather Cyd Charisse, who does not actually have an acting role. (At this stage of her career Reynolds was not regarded as a dancer).In terms of plot and of humour, however, "Singin' in the Rain" is the better of the two films; the plot of "An American in Paris" consists of little more than a boy, a girl and a happy ending. The phrase "musical comedy" (like "romantic comedy") does not always imply that a work is particularly humorous; it is often used as a description for any musical play or film except for the minority (like "Carousel" or "West Side Story") which end tragically. "Singin' in the Rain" is one of the few musical comedies which is worthy of the name. It is one of the few Hollywood films which actually dare to make fun of Hollywood itself. A lot of the humour derives from the difficulties the industry encountered during the early days of sound, not only actresses with dodgy voices- Jean Hagen's Lina is a great comic character- but also problems in hiding the ungainly and not very effective microphones and in synchronising the sound with the picture. One of the themes is the antagonism between stage and screen during this period- during the silent era, and even in the early years of the sound era, stage actors, particularly classically trained ones, despised the cinema which they saw as a vulgar pantomime. Here Kathy claims to be a stage actress, although it later turns out her experience has been rather limited. There is also a lot of physical comedy, especially in the scenes featuring Donald O'Connor as Don's friend Cosmo."Singin' in the Rain" was a hit at the box office, but it was not a great success with the critics, unlike "An American in Paris", which won the "Best Picture" Oscar for 1951. Over the years, however, its reputation has grown, and today it has come to be regarded as one of the great musicals, not only of its day but of all time. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really great Hollywood parody actually.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never knew that the movie "Singin' in the Rain" was not just any other musical movie, starring a singing and dancing Gene Kelly. The movie is actually being a great parody as well of Hollywood society, how all big Hollywood productions are very much alike, studio's, the actor's big star behavior and everything else surrounding- and involved with the industry.The movie is set at the end of the silent movie era in 1927 and 1928, when the "The Jazz Singer" got released. This meant new opportunities for some studios and some actors but also meant the end of a lot of other actors and movie-makers, who were not suitable enough to work with the new sound medium for movies. This movie shows people from both these groups and also shows how the Hollywood-world works and how careers get made and ended in the blink of an eye. The movie is not too afraid to show this more evil and less glamorous side of the whole industry but of course at all times with a wink and fun and charm added to it.Fore "Singin' in the Rain" is a real colorful and entertaining movie, that of course is still best known for its musical numbers. It has some of the best songs that the genre has to offer in it, including of course the well known title song of the movie, performed by Gene Kelly. It's one of those typical studio shot musical with some grand looking numbers in it, with lots of big sets and dancers involved. It also on the other hand has some smaller and more timid moments and it knows to create a well balance between these two musical styles. Cyd Charisse also makes a grand appearance and does what she did do best; dance, show of her legs and look greatly sensual, in a silent role.It's a greatly entertaining movie to watch, both through its musical aspects and comedy parody references to the world of Hollywood.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly my favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may or may not be my final user review. I don't really know as I type this. Every character my fingers hits, every key-stroke, brings to me a new realization of my thoughts' worth on film. In that vein, I hope that what I've written has served those who've read my reviews to better guide them to quality entertainment, and hopefully with new insight.But, to the film."Singing in the Rain" has a special place in my heart. It's a window on an era of cinema that itself is another window on another era in cinema. We're seeing what the people of the 1950s thought of film some thirty to forty years before during its infancy.But, the real charm of the film is that we have a dancer who is masculine in his poetry. That, and he carries himself (to borrow from the film) with "dignity". This is another icon of male that a lot of men looked up to when the film was first released. Gene Kelley didn't ogle women, nor mistreat them. He showed gentle power through grace and poetry. A thing that today would be considered effete, or perhaps too high brow for the common man.But, even though we see Kelley giving us his smooth cultured delivery, we're also shown his comic side. He's a clown, but a smooth one. Even the most dignified have their comedic moments. He shows us guys how to court a cute young woman like Debbie Reynolds, and shows us that a woman of quality wants a man of quality. And quality doesn't come in the form of a fat bill fold, but the shedding of baser impulses, and embracing of the heart.Then we have Cosmo, the a-sexual friend whose relegated to the realm of emasculated dudeness. He's the class clown who never grew up. Does he date? We don't know. But then again, does it matter? He seems happy and content to play second string to Kelley's Lockwood character, but shines himself as he brings us the former Vaudevillian turned Hollywood supporting star.Then, there's Reynold's Kathy Selden character, who takes pot shots at the big boys from her humble station. She is elevated to professional performer status from her Catskills beginnings as a side show girl. She's beautiful and charming when she isn't being jealous of those who made it into "the industry", and is taken under the wing of Kelley's smitten character.The plot thickens with Jean Haggen's Lina Lamont, the not-so-ditzy blonde with a nose for leverage. She may not know art, but she knows what she likes. And she likes getting the lime light, and it doesn't matter whose talent she has to exploit to get that light shining on her instead of those making her the starlet she's been made into.There's the head of the studio, the high energy director, various supporting roles, and, of course, the musical numbers. Call me nuts, but I like a good musical. To me there's something reassuring about men and women being able to show their physical prowess to the creative notes conjured by a musical mind. To me that's the peak of expressionism. Why musicals have been unfairly attached to fringe and counter culture is beyond me. Sure, they're old and corny, but why attach a feminist quality to those characteristics?The great thing about "Singing in the Rain" is that it's a musical comedy that formulaic, doesn't take itself very seriously, but is smashingly successful. The guy gets the girl in the end, and isn't that what it's all about?"Singing in the Rain" is good old fashioned Hollywood film. It truly is, in every sense of the word. It was done in the days before CGI and green/blue-screen techniques, has its own brand of SFX, has a lot of dazzling production numbers (again, to wow the audience in the days before model spaceships and CGI), and somehow manages to focus all of that on the haphazard and somewhat rocky (yet still sweet) flavored courtship between a man who wants to be a talented star, but isn't, and a woman who should, but is held back. The two eventually meet, and romantic magic is conjured.And I guess that's why it's my favorite film. It has all the gags and good musical numbers from days of old, but it also tells a tale of the way love ought to turn out. The way it ought to be. And, in spite of all the Hollywood gloss, glitz and glamor, it stays focused on that single message.There's of course Gene's famous dance number, which, truth be told, should resound with every red blooded male who's ever fallen for that one special lady. It should also give us guys hope that that special lady is out there, just waiting to inspire us so that we too can go splashing, and Singing, in, the Rain.I loved films from my days as a boy. This film was, and still is, one of my inspirations for life. If I were to go back into the film industry, hopefully, if allowed, I would be able to go back in time and visit the MGM lot during its musical hey-day, and help create magnificent films like the one I just reviewed. Something with a lot of humor, pizazz, little violence, and gentle story about a man and a woman meeting one another. I think I've always felt that... in fact I'm pretty sure I always have.With that, I'm going to end my series of reviews here for now. Thanks all, but they just don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snippets of fond musical moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is like a theatrical necklace, strung together with gems in the form of musical numbers and then crowned with a sparkling diamond in the middle: the unforgettably classic title track. The running thread in between them might be a little weak, but it's the jewels that that win out in the end.Each musical number carries its own unique magnitude, breathing life, emotion, charm and romance into a lackluster plot. The story is about what happens when the motion picture business in the '20s develops the first talking picture (the appropriately referenced "The Jazz Singer" starring Al Jolson) and how it affects two of the business' biggest stars: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen)...and of course their quirky piano player Cosmo (played by physical humor extroadinaire Donald O'Connor). Underlying it all is Lockwood's love for a wannabe actress Kathy Selden played by Debbie Reynolds, a relationship built on one of the more preposterous Hollywood fantasies.Because of the plot's unoriginality and the sometimes lengthy tangents the songs take you on, "Singin' in the Rain" is enjoyed by the scene. As a viewer, you pick your favorites and pay more attention to them, dismissing those that bore. O'Connor's humorous turn in "Make 'Em Laugh" is a surefire favorite as is "Moses (Supposes)" and of course "Singin' in the Rain." The choreography and the non-stop energy in these numbers makes them so fun and easy to watch. Other scenes like "Broadway Rhythm Ballet" fit the tastes of the dancing connoisseurs as Cyd Charisse steals you away from the film for a good 15 minutes with her incredible shape and grace. There's also a good amount of gags and slapstick filler between numbers, but the numbers are what make "Singin' in the Rain" stand out. The title number is about the only one that perfectly accompanies the storyline. Don is so head over heels for Kathy that he could sing and dance carelessly out in the pouring rain. That's what makes the scene stick out as classic: most of the other numbers are not extensions of the storyline, they're detours from it, but "Singin' in the Rain" endures on this glorious number.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When asked which musical film I remember best, few if any can compare to this all time memory maker. "Singing in The Rain" has it all. A simple but impressive story which winds itself through several decades of various films. Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a city hoofer who enjoys being a popular and noted 'silent' celebrity by everyone except Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who rebuffs him by saying about movies, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' His life long friend Cosmo Brown, played by (Donald O'Connor) is magically talented both singing and dancing which is nearly impossible for the obstacle in the picture, one Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When the studio discovers that silent pictures are obsolete, the director R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) launches a new course for his cast, one which does not include Lamont. The movie is filled with many dance routines, which includes perhaps the most remembered song and dance number in Hollywood. I remember it well. Excellent film for any generation. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's between "The Sound of Music" and "Singin' in the Rain" for the best movie musical, in my opinion. It's difficult to choose, but this might be it. This film proves to be so funny that it could make a great comedy on its own. However, the songs really add something to the story and now I can't imagine the film without them. In an Oscar-nominated performance, it is Jean Hagen that cracks me up the most and really steals the show. She can't sing and act, but she can certainly make an audience laugh. Watching the three main stars (Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds) sing "Good Morning" is one of my favorite moments of the film, not to mention Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain" scene being one of the most famous moments on film. Donald O'Conner's "Make 'em Laugh" is one of the most unforgettable musical numbers anyone will ever see. No other musical in history has a great a combination of comedy and great songs as this one, in my own opinion. Considered one of the top ten films ever made, it's a personal favorite to me as well. Possibly better than "The Sound of Music," but it's hard for me to make that call.**** out of ****</fullReview>

She introduces herself and says that she is a stage actress.Don later introduces her to the film company and they try to find a way of dubbing the squeaky-voiced actress in secret....Singn' in the rain basically shows you what silent films are like and how loads of mistakes were made when talkies came in (you know, when new things come in they can't be perfect all the time).The performances and songs were excellent.This movie is Fun for whole family and is a must see for musical fans that have not seen it yet.This is a movie that dose not deserve to be ruined by a remake.</fullReview>

The figures which trio (Don, Cosmo and Kathy) displayed are so amazing and also their transforming ability ordinary sentences to lyrics are also brilliant. For example, when studying diction technics they transform a sentence to a lyric.Story basically takes progress around the four characters that I said above. Don and Lina are known as darlings by public, but Don always says this relationship is just for advertisement. Only his near friend Cosmo know this. One day Don meets with Kathy who also knows dancing in the parties.

		<shortDescription>A musical about two lovers and their struggle through show business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain is an amazing movie that i recommend to everyone! Singing in the rain is about two actors who fall in love with each other. The main character, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), is already a big celebrity and he encounters a lady by landing in her car after an escape from a mob of fans. The lady driving the car is an aspiring actress named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Don falls for her at first sight, but Kathy argues with him and doesn't think he's all that great. She says that he isn't a true actor. She drops him off and he goes to an after party of his latest movie. Kathy ends up being one of the surprise dancers, and he tries to get her again, but it ends up Kathy throwing a cake into Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen)face. Lina Lamont works with Don in all their movies. Lina despises Kathy after that moment. After quite some time, the studio is making another movie for Don and Lina. The movies they've made have all been in the silent era. The studio already starts filming their next movie, until the R.F. Simpson, the studio owner/producer says that they must either change the movie to a sound movie or just shut the whole thing down. The studio decides to jump on the bandwagon and make a sound movie, because of the success of the Jazz Singer, and the demand for more talkies. The studio starts filming the movie into a talkie. The biggest problem with the talkie is that Lina's voice is absolutely terrible for the job, but they still film the movie. When the first screening is showed, everyone thinks the movie is a joke and is terrible. After the screening, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), and Kathy are at Don's house. The two friends are trying to cheer up Don, and then they ponder about ways to fix the movie. Cosmo comes up with a brilliant plan to make the movie into a musical. Don and Kathy thinks it's a brilliant idea, until they remember that Lina can't sing or speak for that matter. After some thought, Cosmo has a revelation and comes up with the idea that Kathy sings for Lina. The studio thinks it's a great idea and keeps it a secret. The plan is going well until Zelda Zanders (Rita Moreno) tattles on the plan, and Lina demands that the credits say it is her voice and give no credit to Kathy. The studio and Kathy agree but to just this film. After the premiere of the movie, (which is a success), Lina shocks everyone by saying that Kathy must dub in for Lina in all her movies. Everyone is furious and tells her it's not going to happen. The audience then asks for a speech and Lina irrationally decides to go out and present a speech. When she starts speaking people realize that it wasn't her voice in the movie and demand her to sing. Lina realizes the mistake she made and runs off stage and Simpson comes up with a plan, whispers it to Don and Cosmo, and tells Kathy to sing behind the second curtain for Lina. Kathy refuses until Don begs her to. Kathy agrees but never wants to see Don again. Lina goes back on stage. The conductor asks her which song to sing and in which key. Kathy whispers to Lina to tell the conductor "Singing in the Rain" in A-Flat. Kathy starts singing and Lina starts dubbing. Offstage Don, Cosmo, and Simpson pull the curtain so Kathy is revealed. Lina doesn't know this until Cosmo goes to where Kathy is and starts singing. Lina is humiliated and runs off. Kathy starts running away, but Don tells people to stop her and he sings to her and they live happily ever after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The musical singing in the rain, was OK I guess, but it wasn't all that to be. I didn't hate it nor did I like it. Reasons why being, the acting style was weird. It almost felt fake-ish. Like it wasn't real. The choreography of the dances were elaborate and done well, but at times they were too much. The story line was romantic, sweet and predictable. The editing and cinematography was nothing special or not worthy. A guess there was just no thinking the audiences had to do to get the movie, which was a turn off for me. the one slightly more than OK thing was some of the dialog. I don't mean to say that the movie was bad, it just wasn't the type of movie i enjoy watching. I'm glade i did see it because no ill understand when people reference it in other stuff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you review a movie that's quite literally off the charts?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be successful, a musical needs to have good musical numbers well performed. This movie has that, often in spades.In addition, it has one of the cleverest, most brilliant scripts ever written for a Hollywood movie, musical or otherwise, and directors who know how to realize it to its fullest potential.And two male stars that are, themselves, so far off the charts that we're lucky if we can appreciate at least part of their astounding talent. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor dance as well as any dancers have ever danced on film, and play off each other like the best of vaudeville teams. Debby Reynolds certainly holds up her end, but it's Kelly and O'Connor, and the directing of Kelly and Donan, that transform what would have been a first-rate musical into what is, indeed, probably the best musical ever made.Watch it once. Watch it multiple times. Each time you will marvel more at its brilliance.What a picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No "American in Paris"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In thinking about comparing this Kelly film to "An American in Paris" I am forced to recall the Vice-Presidential debate in which Dan Quayle got caught comparing himself to Jack Kennedy: "I knew an American in Paris, and YOU are no American in Paris." I am much more inclined to find the comparison invoked in the famous suburban lawn care commercial: an American Tweedledum in his Kellyesque pastel polo shirt, who uses the product, compares his lawn to that of an American Tweedledee in a similar shirt, and says killingly "He has some nice places ON his lawn, but overall I have the better lawn." Singin' has all the great and memorable numbers everyone thinks of, but despite a good plot idea it is clearly podged together and doesn't coalesce as an artistic unit. In particular, the Kelly / Charisse duet in the "Gotta Dance" extravaganza is clearly made to remind us of the wonderful arty sequence in "American" (right down to using Cyd herself) but instead of flowing out of the main plot is artificially inserted (as just about anything could have been) as an improbable addition to the Dancing Cavalier talky movie-within-a-movie. The best Gene Kelly film is "An American in Paris."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilersThis film is about Hollywood when the movie learned to talk at the end of the 20's. Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen play two movie-stars of this period, co-starring in THE DUELING CAVALIER. The problem is that Hagen's voice is so terrible that Cathy Seldon, played by Debbie Reynolds, has to dub her singing. Therefore Seldon becomes the real star of THE DUELING CAVALIER. The interesting thing about it is that for some of the songs in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN Reynolds' voice was dubbed by someone. So the question is: Who is the real star of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unequivocally the best American musical-comedy out of (and about) the Hollywood Golden age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain embraces conventions and self-reflection like it's the most wonderful things that can be accomplished with a musical-comedy. It's knowing so well of everything that made up the Hollywood musical- and the bumpy transition from silent film to sound- and always gives a wink and a nod while retaining as a form of pure cinema, in a sense, by giving into its gleeful archetypes. It's also, surprisingly, very smart and witty for a comedy, with its goofy and cornball moments well earned thanks to the earnest effort put into looking so effortless and totally fantastical. It's a fantastical sensibility that can only come out of the movies, the escapism of smitten romances, eccentric characters, and a more contemporary spirit than one might expect (one ends up laughing at how risqué the humor can get, and how guiltlessly silly). And ultimately, it breaks ground, like Citizen Kane, using all of the songs, tricks and superlative technical additives at the disposal of the artists to make a film/amalgam a marvel on all fronts. To put it in a more direct way, if you don't feel happy once this movie ends, it may be time to hit up the the doctors for some heavy medication.The story is like a double-edged sword, where the world of film-making and musicals get their just due in being revealing and reveling in the history of it all. Two movie stars (Kelly and Jean Hagen) of the silent era on high acclaim, who really shouldn't be together, get put to the task of there being a new medium: the sound picture, where people need to talk into the microphone, big physical acts and motions of the grandiose don't quite fit, and the dialog needs to make sense- through strong voices. After a disastrous test screening, a new plan is hatched- that the leading lady, the wonderfully high-strung and "dumb" Linda, be dubbed over from her squeaky voice to the impeccable voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Adding in the musical sequences, and tweaking it a bit, make it a total hit, but at what cost? This is the broad stroke of the story, anyway, but there's much more to Singin' in the Rain than the usual double-crossings and cynicism to the Hollywood "dream factory".All the humanity that the principle characters feel, be it humor ("Make em Laugh" is a classic number), or in love (the sweet song behind the Dali-esquire set behind Kelly and Reynolds), or in just enjoying what the world has to offer ala "Good Morning"), gets expressed through song and music, with the title song given a classic form of song and dance expression- as elsewhere in the film- as the camera gets its chances for going into the vibrant style, but also is patient in just capturing all the music on all fronts. On top of being such a sharply crafted comedy, with practically all of the jokes hitting levels of hilarity few musicals could aspire to today (usually in part to Donald O'Connor's determined comic relief and levity), Kelly creates indelible images of choreography, in painstaking detail of foot-work and in the timing of movement with the characters. This all reaches its nexus in a sequence that's all the more brilliant considering it's not even a filmed scene within the film, but that it's the visualization of the idea behind a musical sequence in the film, as Kelly pitches it to his producers. It's loaded with bits of sensuality one wouldn't expect in a 1950s movie (look at those legs!), and encompassing all of the juicy, delightful bits in the crossroads between Broadway and Hollywood musicals. You can lose yourself in this sequence, and always with a big grin at the proceedings. Even towards the end it doesn't lose sight of its 'movie-ness', yet critiquing the nature of the business amid the magic that comes out of it. So get ready to tap your feet and, if inclined, sing along to what serves as the perennial feel-good movie, a work of popular art that has some serious questions in the subtext and never relents to let the audience have a good time at the absurdity of it all- a master's class in absurdity, artificiality, and a love of all things Golden-Age-Hollywood. Think of it as the musical-comedy side of the coin to the dark film-noir coin of Sunset Boulevard; both question what it is to work and stay pertinent in the Hollywood system, but where one treats Hollywood with tougher satire and darker themes, the other goes the route of everything being so fake that it resembles a reality of a fluffy, knowing and kidding dream. An essential of 50s cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Broadway dance sequence is quite phenomenal, but I always thought it was inconsistent with the rest of the movie. It's pretty impressive for a 1952 musical, but not the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a 20s era studio's first talkie. The movie (Singin' in the Rain) is about the making of a talkie about a dancing cavalier, but this modern sequence suddenly pops up unexpectedly. And where's Lina Lamont who's supposed to be the star of the movie?The Broadway sequence is a joy to behold, but it really doesn't fit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always had a problem with the accolades heaped upon this fine movie because that's all I see, a FINE, well-made, well-sung, well-danced film as opposed to a 'classic', 'all-time great', 'best musical ever made' notices that hand around its neck like an albatross constantly threatening to choke the life out of it. It's also difficult for me to think of anyone more overrated than Comden and Green, who are right up there with Hitchcock as far as misplaced plaudits are concerned. Their schtick was New York and the bulk of the Books and lyrics they wrote seldom ventured West of Central Park, this Hollywood-spoof being one exception. Producer Arthur Freed clearly wanted to kill two birds with one stone by raiding his own back catalogue of mediocre lyrics (you don't believe me? try listening to Cole Porter, Frank Loesser, Larry Hart, Johnny Mercer, etc) written largely with Nacio Herb Brown and then blatantly 'stealing' Porter's Be A Clown melody and cobbling on new lyrics. The satire is okay but even in 1952 was hardly new, Debbie Reynolds is competent at best, Jean Hagen and Donald O'Connor excellent which leaves Gene Kelly showing yet again how many light years behind Fred Astaire we was lagging. Pleasant rather than memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie still stands as a rock today, over half a century after its release. As movies from the 40s and 50s seem to be a bit slow compared to today's standards (for example in movement and conversation) this is certainly not the case in 'Singin' in the Rain'.Maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is a winner when it comes down to remarkable and memorable tunes, but this movie also has a few pretty tricks on its sleeve.First of all there is the fabulous and superb choreography and (tap) dancing, one of the most impressive achievements in movie history.Secondly this movie is a homage to movies and actors, in their struggles to make the movie a mature form of art.And last but not least, there is humor all over the place. Especially the ups and downs of making and releasing the first 'talkie' musical is extremely funny. 'Singin' in the rain' is therefore a milestone in the evolution of movie making and deserves to be watched by everyone who likes dance and musical.</fullReview>

Gene Kelly, one of my favorite actors, is absolutely fantastic playing the lead character Don Lockwood. When he performed the title song I was taken away and when he dances it is simply amazing. Donald O'Connor, who plays Cosmo Brown is also very hilarious especially when he sings "Make 'Em Laugh." My favorite scene is when Kelly and O'Connor sing "Moses."

		<fullReview>To many musicals these days focus too much on the amount of charm they contain that they lack other values which include: good script, good humor, good characters, and overall, good intelligence. Once you see "Singin' in the Rain," you'll ask yourself why musicals aren't more like "Singin' in the Rain." What I love about this movie, is that unlike lots of movies from the fifties, it's actually funny. During the preview of "The Dueling Cavelier," I laughed so hard that I had to gasp for breath. The movie has TONS of charm, but it also contains intelligent writing. The plot is great, not because it's complex and contains lots of insight, but because it's so easy to pay attention and is fast-paced at one hour and forty-three minutes. And then Gene Kelly. HOW can no one think of Gene Kelly without thinking of Singin' in the Rain. Every time I see him flying those feet in tap shoes, I get frustrated that I'm not more like him. His charisma, athletic skill, and easy-to-listen-to-voice makes him my favorite actor out there. The songs are wonderful and memorable, but they also don't consume too much of the hilarious and clever script. And by the way, what dance school did Gene Kelly go to, 'cause I'm pretty sure that it'll help me get better.Flawlessly written, incredibly choreographed, and filled with irresistible charm, it's impossible not to like this movie. It's one you can watch over and over again, and still enjoy it.</fullReview>

Cosmo was by far my favorite character in the movie because he is always funny and full of life. His song half way through the movie has to be my favorite song and favorite part of the movie. Now with all of this good it doesn't mean this movie is perfect. there is one scene in particular that I hate and that is the final sing and dance number. This song starts off good like the last but ends up dragging on to the point where I almost just wanted to turn the movie off and call it a quite's. Not only was it dragging on but the quality of that song was going down in my opinion as the song keeps going. But all and all I would probably recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film directed by Donen and Kelly is such a treat! And yes, Gene Kelly, who also stars in the film! The singing spans across many genres and styles, and the title song...there's no question as to why it's become common knowledge "Singing in the rain, and we're happy again!" and "Good Mornin' " (another song in the film). Because even if one hasn't heard or seen the film, they know the musical phrase. This film is beautifully shot, and with it's tracking shots, keeps us, the audience at just enough of a distance that we are engaged yet not dragged into the story. The goal of a musical wasn't to achieve realism, it is meant as a pleasantry to be enjoyed for it's artistic quality. While watching Singin In the Rain, I felt as though I was watching a Broadway show. The camera editing, keeping the audience at just the right angle at all points. Mainly, the music, all of the sound, the facial expressions, and the brilliant use of color. All of those factors contribute to make Singin In the Rain one of the great musicals of all time on film. At the time, the public had had enough after many terrible, poorly though out musicals had been released. Singin in the Rain helped save the genre from dying out entirely. In my opinion. Wonderful film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain is one of the movies in which everything is virtually perfect. The screenplay is one of Green and Comden's best. The direction by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen is perfect. The musical numbers are fantastic, especially Make 'Em Laugh and Kelly's all-time best number (no, not the title number, which honestly I've never loved the way other people do, but the brilliant, balletic Broadway Melody). Kelly is charming, Donald O'Conner is breezily funny, Debbie Reynold's is a perfect girl-next door, and Jean Hagen is wildly funny as an awful person with a voice to match.This is not to say that there is nothing to criticize. There is a tedious fashion show number that I wish could be retroactively excised and Hagen, as funny as she is, tends to look a bit too much like a comedic actress to be 100% believable as a screen goddess (she's very pretty but has the overly-expressive face of a comic). But these are such minor quibbles that for practical purposes, this is a perfect movie.</fullReview>

I usually don't take musicals seriously and the forced singing and dancing usually doesn't appeal to me. But in Singin' in the Rain the dancing and music goes well with the story line and progression of the movie. The comedy that also is included helps to lighting the movie up and gives it a second side that I enjoy other than just music and dancing. It also helps that Gene Kelly can actually sings the songs well. Another aspect of the movie that I enjoyed is the love triangle between Don, Lina, and Kathy. At first Don acts like he is together with Lina to just keep his fans happy but by the end of the movie he ends up with his true love Kathy.</fullReview>

The on- screen romantic duo, Don and Lina try to pursue a romantic to their fans while behind screen, their relationship isn't what it seems to be. When movies start coming out in sound after the debut of The Jazz Singer, Don realizes that he can't have Lina speaking or singing in any of her films. He uses the beautiful voice of a musical singer named Kathy to cover up Lina's nasal sounding voice. Lina soon discovers what is going on and does anything to try to keep her face in film because she wants to be as successful as anyone else. I believe that this movie was easy to get into with all of the good music that was played.</fullReview>

It was nice to finally see them together, not only romantically, but in their careers as well. I also loved that it was a musical, but it felt like it could happen in every day life, just with a few songs and dance numbers thrown in.

		<fullReview>I remember enjoying it the first few times I watched it, but after this viewing I was a little indifferent to it. The acting, story, settings are all quite nice and well done, but it all seems too cheery for me. Everyone is too happy and cheerful- too artificial for me.The trio's performance (Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds) worked well cohesively, and the chemistry between them is solid. They portray their characters with enthusiasm and are very convincing. Hagen as Lina does a fantastic job, and her high-pitched voice gets me every time. The constant swapping between who is singing for whom makes for a fun trivia. The story is very self-reflective in that it shows how movies are made (while being a movie itself). It does a pretty good job at this, but of course only shows the workings of the top decision makers. Also, the self-reflectivity does not interfere with audience engagement as viewers are kept engaged by the romance line between Don and Kathy. As for the musical part, most of the song numbers are pretty entertaining and catchy, though some are a bit long. Also, there is one sequence which is set in the idea of a film Don has (a film within a film) that has no correlation to the narrative itself. So I did not really think that sequence was necessary, but I guess it served to further reinforce the American Dream ideology. The settings are quite vibrant in colour which is nice, but for me adds to this artificiality of the film. Everything is too neat, too clean and pristine. Adding to that, the sound though is synchronized pretty well, is sometimes obvious that it was recorded separately. Overall, a pretty fun film to watch, and which everyone should watch at least once.</fullReview>

Something other musicals struggle to do. There is no doubt that the actors in this were extremely talented, that is showed by some of the complex choreography, such as "make em laugh". The story itself was about a successful silent movie duo making the transition into the world of sound films. Jealously and desire play a pretty big part in this film, which make it entertaining to watch also. However, some of the dance routines were a bit too long for me. I am not questioning the skill of the actors and dancers, but at some points it became slightly difficult to just stare at people dancing for what seemed like forever, such as the Broadway Meleody Ballet. That was much too long for my taste. Other than that, I did enjoy this film, and I would consider it the trailblazer for musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your a fan of Musicals, Singin in the Rain sets the bar and is really fun and full of great energy. As a spectator, writing a review, what I noticed most was how well the Colors worked with this film. For a film that was released in the 1950s the screen shots seemed to work better than most films in this day and age. Just a fun and happy film that will bring a smile to the audiences face. There also was a good amount of humor in this film that worked out great. Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood was brilliant in his performance as well as directing the film . Everything in the film seemed to work and it stands out from other musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his own words Gene Kelly said that this one will last. Not all of them do as films age but Singin in the Rain will stand the test of time.Its not a perfect film, it does have flaws in its story but its a gold plated classic and according to Kelly it is all true, these things happened. He presumably meant the various incidents in Hollywood relating to the transition from silent to sound a subject of the more recent silent film The Artist itself based on the Don Lockwood character played by Kelly in this film but set in an alternate universe where he is washed up when sound arrives not Lina.Don Lockwood is a song and dance man who worked his way up to be a movie star via being a stuntman along with hyperactive Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) who these days be regarded as the gay best friend.Lockwood and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are formidable box office stars and everyone thinks they are an item. In truth he detests her which makes you think that if they have not been together for all these years then who have they been with or were they living like monks?After a film premiere Lockwood literally drops into Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is a wannabee stage actress and he is immediately attracted to her.On the horizon is talking pictures and this makes (as in The Artist) the stars of today has beens unless they quickly adapt because the kind of films they have been making so far now look laughably bad.Worse as they quickly try to make their new film as a talkie Lina has difficulty talking to a microphone, she has terrible diction making her sound course and common and worse still the dialogue sounds clunky.After a disastrous test screening which shows Lina up actually as a dumb blonde, Cosmo hatches a plan to have Kathy dub her voice plus add some song and dance numbers.Don and Kathy fall in love, the studio have plans to promote her as a big star but Lina will not take things lying down but she literally gets the last laugh but this time she is the joke.This is of course wrapped in some classic song and dance numbers from the legendary Singin in the rain, Make em laugh, Good Morning and a sultry sequence with Cyd Charisse.Its colourful (I first saw this as a lad on a small black and white television and I always seem to recall it in monochrome) and some of the dancing is fantastic.Kelly was right, this one will last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I am not a musical fan, i found this film enjoyable because of the up beat attitude that the characters have. the storyline is easy to follow and the film included music that can be up lifting. The acting was decent but the dancing and singing from the actors and actresses was tremendous. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor seemed as if they had been lifelong friends before the movie was made and that made that aspect of the movie believable. As a director, Gene Kelly did a beautiful job putting together the different aspects such as choreography, music, singing, and acting. the film is a classic musical that is rightfully considered one of the best movies of its gene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like musicals. I should like musicals. I like music; I like movies. Why don't I like musicals? If I had a quick guess it would be because most musicals are made for people who don't like movies. They're made for the same type of people who enjoy high-octane action films. They're all sizzle without the steak. Singin' In the Rain is sizzle, it's steak, and it's a fully dressed baked potato as well. I don't like musicals, but I loved Singin' In the Rain.Sure, the music was great, but the story was better. The cinematography was amazing and overall it just felt like an event while watching it. The only moment I even took the time to blink was during the ballet scene. It was at this moment I recognized why I don't like musicals.This movie was funny, it was gorgeous to look at, and it was cleverly edited. I'm not sure Hollywood could make another film like this without turning it into a giant cast blockbuster of an event and as a result end up bombing at the box office.I never thought that my favorite film of all-time would be a musical, and I'm still not 100% sold that it is, but it's certainly in the discussion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of musicals but I did like Singin' in the Rain a lot. I thought everything was great from the editing, lighting, sound, camera-work, acting, just everything about it was perfect! The movie is about a famous "power couple" Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are known for their great chemistry in movies and people think it is in real life also but the real life romance between the two was just for publicity. Well Lina likes Don but Don doesn't like Lina. Don's best friend Cosmo and him have come along way in their success and they don't want Lina to ruin it with her high pitched voice and dumb comments. Don and Lina were known for their silent films but when sound began to make its way into films, Lina's annoying voice would be heard and they wanted to make a musical but Lina could not sing very well at all. Don's new love interest Kathy sings for Lina and they put her voice and singing over Lina's so it sounds good. But when Lina found out it wasn't her voice she was furious. She threatened to sue the company if they took her out of the movie because she signed a contract so they kept her in it just not her voice. After the successful premiere of their musical, Lina went out to sing to the crowd with Kathy singing behind the curtain however, the curtain fell and everyone found out that Lina wasn't the real one singing. Both girls ran away in embarrassment but Don stopped Kathy and told the crowd she was the one with the beautiful voice not Lina. The movie ended with Don and Kathy kissing in front of the poster for their new movie called Singin' in the rain. I loved this movie from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Singin' in the Rain' has been mentioned as an all-time favorite musical by many and I can totally see why. It is such a delightfully hilarious film. The excellent and superb camera and lighting effects, as well as the constant activity leave you absolutely no time to be bored. The story outline revolves around the switch from silent movies to talkies and how a film crew, namely the stars and the producers attempt to create a talking movie but there is one problem, the leading lady can't sing and she can't act. Jean Hagen provides us with the funniest, most hilarious moments in her way-over-the-top performance of the dumb film star with the appalling accent. There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended "Broadway Melody" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story. All and all this film was great and is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain - So Damn Fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a musical fan, ever since I was a kid. I grew up with everything from Disney films like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and a plethora of Broadway productions I went to see in NYC. Yes, I know it's corny and unrealistic, but that was the point of the musical, hence why this was such a win-win for me.First and foremost: it is just so, so fun. And quite funny! I've been meaning to watch this movie for ages and never got around to it, and now that I've finally seen it I was not disappointed. The characters were entertaining and well-acted, the humor was spot on, and had lovely photography with deep, saturated colors. My favorite scene had to be when the main character was dancing with the female lead in an imaginary sequence of their talky film; highly artistic and dynamic even for what was supposed to be just a small part of the movie.I didn't expect to like the songs as much as I did, especially the movie's title number. Something about it makes me just so happy, and I can't put my finger on why but I was smiling the whole time. I do recall being on the Great Movie Ride in Disney World and it showed that one part and ever since it's been ingrained into my mind. So for that, I give it a well deserved 10 for nostalgia's sake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain directed by Gene Kelley in 1952 was the begging of the 'musical' era in film. The idea that sound was almost never used in film until it was found possible in the 30's is hilarious to us now. However, when musicals came about it became a way to make a story flow in a different way. The way they show the struggle of turning into sound through music is both iconic and brilliant. The script to this movie is full of comedy, romance, and of course song. Now that the film industry was really defining itself this is a wonderful example of just how far the film industry had come. The wide angled camera shots are also a key component to this movie. Being able to see so much really emphasizes the movies' meaning</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin In The Rain directed by Gene Kelley and Stanley Donen is an excellent musical. Firstly, I must say that I am not Particularly a fan of musicals, However this film greatly exceeded my expectations. I was expecting constant singing throughout the film but this was not the case. The film actually has an extremely well written script. I would say this musical is way better than the Sound of Music. The films cinematography is uncanny, the choreography by the actors is stupendous and very impressive especially with the long takes during the tap dances. The film is also quite humorous and the acting by Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown was excellent, the two actors complimented each other very well in the tap dancing scenes and overall had great chemistry throughout the movie. overall I give this movie a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly is the best musical movie I've ever seen. I am really not a big fan of musicals and going into this one, I wasn't too excited. After the movie though I changed my view on it. It was fantastic throughout and it was finally good to see a movie in color. All the songs in the movie were good and I didn't know some of the songs were from this movie. "Good Morning" is a song we hear a lot these days and I had no idea that this where it came from. It was also a good feeling at the end of the movie to see Lena be embarrassed by everyone at the show. She had the snobby attitude and I just didn't like her at all. Her scratchy high pitch voice fit perfectly with her because it was annoying just like she was as a person. Her voice was awful and they did a good job of making the audience really hate her and favor Kathy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many have said that the two numbers in "Singin' in the Rain" that feature Charisse probably belong in another movie. I don't know? as the flapper in jade, she sexes up Kelly's rube character to a steamy height unusual in movies of that era. In a dance full of wonderful moves, my favorite comes after she's left him with her cigarette holder. She sashays away from him, blowing on her nails in studied boredom. She's gotten some distance away, and as she tosses her right hand back, he throws down the cigarette holder, grabs her hand and brings her flying up to his chest, where she proceeds to slide down Kelly's thigh to the floor for one of several prone positions she takes during this duet, from which she returns to a standing position with amazing grace. I'm not wild about dances that rely heavily on props, but this one does so very effectively: they're amusing and they reinforce character.And thank heaven for the artistic control that allowed Kelly to keep the "crazy veil" number in the picture. Charisse has discussed that dance, where she got to show off her early ballet training, most charmingly for a "Word of Mouth" feature on TCM. She and others have noted over the years that the wind machines required to keep that impossibly long veil moving and undulating between and above her and Kelly made filming a nightmare. But it looks effortless, on a set that is a subtle optical illusion?not as deep nor as sloped as it appears to be.Both dances end the same way. Whether she's a cheap gangster's moll in garish green or a Grecian goddess in white, less obviously in a mobster's sway, Charisse is invariably lured back to reality by proffered baubles and menacingly tossed coins. But at the end of the crazy veil number, she's the one tossing the coins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An incredibly impressive film, everything about is incredibly fleshed out and well thought out with it. The casting was spot on, creating one of the most believable set of characters in what many would call a "caricature" of life. A very energetic film, always keeping the audience engrossed by any means. The comedy is phenomenal, keeping the characters lively, and making the movie a pleasure to the eyes to see. The cinematography is wonderful, set design, hell everything is pot on. The musical numbers are on point, all of them being rather well fit in, it's never "forced" and just kind of happens naturally, it keeps the movie flowing, and never breaks the sense of motion the picture has.

		<fullReview>I generally cannot stand musicals, however, Singin' in the Rain is an exception. My tolerance also may have something to do with the fact that I have seen the movie with my sister a million times. Anyway, Singin' in the Rain is your typical cheesy, over-the-top love story but what makes the film stand out is the impeccable dancing numbers. Gene Kelly is a real genius when it comes to dance in my opinion and the film is worth a watch just to see the dance numbers alone. Also, the character Cosmo aka Donald O'Connor is an excellent performer and is hilarious with his theatrical stunts. At the end of the day, anyone can enjoy this musical unless they're a real hater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will have you singing the title song for days after seeing the movie and every time you hear the title! This movie is more than a singing and dancing sensation however as it is the story of two silent film stars who must transition into the world of talking pictures. The transition is hilarious as the female lead, the glamorous Lina Lamont has a voice that could easily be compared to nails on a chalkboard. Gene Kelly, portraying the male lead Don Lockwood and his brilliant childhood friend Cosmo, played by the wonderful Donald O'Connor, come up with the brilliant idea to use the voice of the beautiful Kathy Selden, played by Debbie Reynolds, for Lina's in the movie. Of course Lina has been jealous of Kathy's involvement from the start and that's when the real fun begins. In addition to the hilarious storyline this picture includes some of the best dance moves I've ever seen and the singing talent is legendary. Shot is beautiful Technicolor this movie is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally not being a huge fan of musicals, I actually really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. The first enjoyable piece of this film is without a doubt the music itself. There were several songs such as "Good Morning" and "Singin' in the Rain" that were catchy and are well known even today. I thought the acting was great with every character. I was especially impressed with Donald O'Connor's role of Cosmo. He was a phenomenal supporting actor and was extremely talented dancing, singing, and playing various instruments. This film also features basic elements such as a simple love story between Don and Kathy that evolves throughout the film. I also thought this film was pretty funny overall, especially the ending scene at the theater. Although the character Lina had an annoying voice, I thought she served well as the films main antagonist and provided a humorous role as well. Overall, I can clearly see why "Singin' in the Rain" is highly regarded as the greatest American musical. I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film very interesting and well liked because of the various techniques and colors Gene Kelly put into it. A lot of people get bored with musicals, but i think this film could also be characterized as a comedy.The lines and also the dancing was a fun part of the film. I loved how Kelly used such vibrant colors in some of the scenes, for example the scene of the Broadway show. In most of the film, you can see that Kelly uses 2 and 3 technicolor, for example, when John and Kathy are on the roof top, as Kathy is on the ladder. Also, in the short films that the actors in the movie are watching, you can see that tint is being used. Kelly uses a flashback technique in the beginning to focus on how John and Lena met. This movie was a lot better then I had anticipated it would be. The choreography was great and everything just fit in perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Musical at its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#x200b;Singin' in the Rain, directed by Stanley Lockwood and Gene Kelly may be a tad bit out of date now, but it is still a must see classic musical. It defines a period in film history when musicals were very positive as it was done purposely for audiences to be entertained and get away from the harsh realities of the outside world. The music is timeless with many people being able to know the songs without even seeing the actual movie. The choreography was excellently done and the acting should be commended. My only complaint with the film is that many of the songs did not have anything to do with furthering the plot, and that a lot of the scenes are outdated, but either way this movie is still arguably one of the best film musicals of all time. It is for that reason that this film is well- worth watching. &#x200b;Singin' in the Rain is a musical comedy about film productions switching from silent films to ones with sound. Some actors in the movie have an easy time transitioning to sound like movie star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), while others have a pretty tough time like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Afraid that Lina might ruin the film production company's latest film with her incredibly displeasing-sounding voice, the company decides to use Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) voice instead for Lina. The performance by all the actors and actresses were outstanding in my opinion, but Jean Hagen stood out the most to me. Her voice did not sound that bad in real life. The fact that she made her voice sound like that to make the audience laugh at her and like her character even if she was an awful person in the film shows how well she played her character. Another performance I found very entertaining was Donald O'Connor's portrayal of Don's friend Cosmo. His performance was very comical and his dance numbers in the film were exceptional. "Make 'em Laugh" was one of my favorite songs in the whole movie because of how well O'Connor danced in it. These two performances in my opinion out-shined all the others in this film. &#x200b;A key element to this film is its soundtrack. Like most musicals, the soundtrack obviously plays a pivotal part in it. What's so great about this film's soundtrack is that is able to stand the test of time even after sixty years of its release in theaters. Songs like "Good Morning", "Make 'em Laugh", and of course "Singin' in the Rain" are all classics. Most people who have never seen this movie can recognize at least one of these songs because they are still used in pop-culture today. The only issue I have with the soundtrack is that many other songs have nothing to do with the film's plot and they are there for more entertainment purposes. Songs like "Moses Supposes" have very little with the actually plot of the movie. Musicals now in recent history usually use their songs for plot purposes and it goes along with the film. This just shows how times in the film industry have changed. Back when this film was released the two main genres that people went to go watch were film-noirs and musicals. Film-noirs showed the corruption of society and were very much negative. Musicals were the polar opposites at the time as people went to go see them to be entertained and get away from all of the negative aspects. Singin' in the Rain does just that. It's very entertaining with not many serious topics at all discussed. I think that this might be my only issue because I myself am from a different generation of films where many films, even musicals, have more serious tones. Nonetheless, the soundtrack of this film is timeless and really represents the time period in which the film was released. &#x200b;In conclusion, I highly recommend watching Singin' in the Rain. Even if one is not a fan of musicals, they should watch it anyway for its nostalgia. A lot of the scenes are outdated as the effects are not the greatest and the lines are cheesy at points, but it is still a great movie to see. The performances by the cast were great and so was the soundtrack. It is hard not to finish watching this film without having the tune of at least one song from the film stuck in your head. &#x200b;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of a musical movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is a musical movie in which we watch the change from silent film to films with sound from a company that produces silent movies. Also in this movie we have a couple which plays in all of the movies and the female star has an issue with her voice. Although everything change when a new girl comes in front.I really liked this movie because I believe as I said before that this movie is the definition of a musical movie. It shows us how a musical movie has to be in order to have the best impact to the audience. About the direction of this movie I have to say that Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly did their best and that was obvious in the whole duration of the movie. About the interpretation we have to mention the great interpretation of Gene Kelly who played as Don Lockwood and he was simply outstanding, Debbie Reynolds who played as Kathy Selden was equally good and I also liked the interpretation of Jean Hagen who played as Lina Lamont and I believe she had the most difficult part in this movie.Lastly I have to say that "Singin' in the Rain" is a great musical movie which everybody has to watch. Even though I do not like musical movies this movie changed the way I see musical movies. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have that kind of movies.</fullReview>

This movie is funny without being vulgar, which is something that movies nowadays have in order to be considered "funny". The dance sequences are spectacular and will leave you wondering "how in the world can they dance like that?".I truly recommend this movie to anyone who needs to relieve some stress and enjoy a good old classic with lots of laughs.

		<fullReview>I'm on the fence when it comes to musicals. I tend to avoid them in general, usually because of second hand embarrassment. Some dancing scenes were a bit of a try-too-hard for me, and some scenes were kind of dramatic, but what do you expect from a musical? It was cute though, especially with how colorful and animated the cast was (you have to be, but these people were touching in a way). Everything was bright and cheerful. The sound was very clear, so some of the songs were able to get stuck in my head after a while, and I have no complaints about it. It's a hilarious and well done movie, and I'd certainly watch it again, but with friends. It's sort of hard to enjoy it by yourself, in a weird way.</fullReview>

The sound is clear and the score fits the film perfectly. The finishing performance by Gene Kelly dragged on for quite some time and became a bit off putting though other than that it was a successful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is an impressive film because it possesses an infectious glee. It's a film that sets out to be enjoyable and fun, and it does this so well it achieves a level of quality normally reserved for serious, austere films. It has a very jubilant nature that focuses on being entertaining, and I really admire its devotion to making its audience happy.Singin' in the Rain is a lighthearted musical comedy about a studio and it's actors dealing with a difficult transition to sound. The co-director Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a multi-talented actor struggling with growing doubts over his acting ability. After his first attempt at a drama with sound is an embarrassing failure, he and the character that is essentially his sidekick despite being more likable and talented than him, Cosmo Brown, along with love interest Kathy Seldon are able to salvage the film and inexplicably fly a convertible into the sky in the middle of a carnival. I had a hard time connecting with a musical. Not to say I didn't like it, it's just not my genre of choice.Here's the thing, I feel like I just don't know enough about musicals to articulate my feelings about the film. I know it was good, and I know the actors were some seriously talented dancers, but I know nothing about dance. All I'm really sure of is that the movie was fun. I had a good time watching it. It was genuinely funny and Donald O'Conner was outstandingly charismatic and impressive in being able to stand out as the most skilled dancer and funniest character. Hopefully I can write something better for West Side Story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually don't watch musicals but this one was great. The dance routines had balance and grace. And the musical numbers were epic. It was great to find that the actors and actresses used their own voices while singing. I thought this movie was cute, cheesy word but there's no other way for me to describe it. It had to take so much work and time to get all of the dances down for this film. And not to mention COLOR! The film was so clear, it made me feel as if I was in the Pop Art era. All of the strong vibrant colors towards the end of the film was incredible. Though I did feel like the ending dance number was a bit too long, it had great scenes within a scene and I loved how it was a thought that the main character had. It goes to show you have wild ones imagination is. In all I just thought this film was great. Definitely recommended to anyone who's interested.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch-Even if you're not a musical person!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't think that I would like singing in the rain due to the fact that I am not a musical person. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. For being a person who doesn't normally like musicals I wasn't overwhelmed by the amount of singing that they placed throughout the movie. It was elegantly placed in the movie and was strategically placed so it flowed beautifully into the scene. Scenes with the music were also very dramatic and well thought out, such as the well known "rain scene". The only complaint that I would have about this movie is that the end scene tends to drag out a lot longer than it needed to. It felt like it took forever for them to get to the main point for the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is a wonderful film. It's beautifully shot, the songs are memorable and the dance choreography is fantastic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds have perfect chemistry together and are all terrific physical and comedic performers. It's really amazing to see them singing and dancing together and because the film maker knew how talented these people were, the editing during these scenes is sparse, allowing you to really admire everything with few cuts. I had seen the titular segment where Gene Kelly is "singin' in the rain" and still it contained so much joy that it felt fresh to me. That's an iconic moment that makes the movie worth seeing all by itself there are many other great segments, like the "Make 'em Laugh" sequence, where Donald O'Connor does an impromptu number, all on his own without a stunt double and "Good Morning" where we get to see the three leads together celebrating a breakthrough. You really get to see that these people were amazing physical performers and it makes you want to get up and practice their moves in the hopes that you could be as good. There's so much energy in the film that it's a real delight to see. It's sure to please you and make you smile, it's laugh-out-loud funny and I also enjoyed seeing the lighthearted insight on the world of filmmaking as the talkies started replacing the silent films. Even if you're not interested in musicals, it's hard to imagine someone not enjoying the movie. (Theatrical cut on the big screen, August 19, 2012)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' In the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved the musical Singin' In The Rain (1952). It was fantastic!!! This film was originally a MGM film produced by Arthur Freed. Freed was also an uncredited produced on The Wizard of Oz. I LOVED the color in this film. It was bright and vibrant. Singin' In The Rain was done in a 3 part Technicolor; shot in three strip black and white printed, printed with dye and then transferred onto a single strip of film. This film was truly amazing and is what I consider to be a classic. It was ranked number 5 on the list of greatest American films in 2007. The only part of the film that I truly didn't appreciate was the end when he was trying to explain his vision of the end of his musical to the producer. I feel like we could have still gotten the point of it if it were a whole lot shorter. Another aspect that I loved, besides the color, was the use of all the difference dances throughout the film. I notice that they used ballroom, tap, ballet, line and whole bunch more. Watching them dance was more entertaining than the actual plot at times! Overall, I think this is the best musical I have watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love musicals, so I was so excited to watch this film in class.Singin in the Rain is a classic musical which is featured in color, starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. This film was also directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.The movie is about silent film star Don Lockwood, who happens to drop in on an innocent bystander, Kathy Seldon while attending a premier of one of his movies one night. It was instant flames for Don, however you can tell that Kathy isn't as interested in him. In the end the guy got his girl, as in most typical love stories.I think the co-star Donald O'Connor was much more interesting to watch, than Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. His comedic style was priceless. I loved watching his creativity in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time that I saw this movie and I have to say that it was absolutely wonderful. I loved the entire movie from the beginning to the end. There were a couple of drawn out scenes that could have been eliminated or shorten but overall it was great.Although a comedy it had a dramatic meaning and plot of deceive, love and power. Gene Kelly played a magnificent character or Don Lockwood an actor trying to make it to the top. Jean Hagen plays the character for Lina Lamont, a woman that has the most annoying voice in Hollywood but has the stage presence that everyone loves. Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden, a soft spoken lovable woman that has an amazing voice and personality. Donald O'Connor plays Don's sidekick Cosmo Brown.Throughout the movie there is a lot of different types of singing and dancing. It was greatly choreographed with incorporating so many different dance styles.The camera use in this movie was fabulous. The camera angle and height was used all different ways to draw your attention further into the movie. They used the Aerial view in a lot of shots to capture the entire picture within the frame to give us an overall view of the shot.The storyline of thinking fake love was real love, pretending to love to keep fame, finding real love, and recognizing real talent was all put together in a manner that keep my interest and made the movie, funny and intriguing while enjoyable to listen to.</fullReview>

Music is a form of art a lot of us at least learned something from " Singin in the rain" the joy about music, how music can change our moods and emotions. I would love to know how to play instruments but somehow I feel like it's too late. I love music this is why this movie was more than just fun to me. I do not think there exist another movie musical as much more fun than "Singin' in the Rain," this movie to me was an epic! It putted me in an amazing mood. Costume were fashionable, and I think just because it is a color movie it took a lot of times, patience, intelligence, and experiences for lighting the scenes. Low key lighting were mostly used in "Dancing in the rain" scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Film May Cause Elation in Viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So yesterday I made wife (Russian) watch Singin' in the Rain with me. There are two kinds of classics: the many that now feel like a museum piece, the few golden that are timeless. Singin' in the Rain is a true masterpiece.The comedy is cleverly woven into the script, taking advantage of inherent opportunities afforded by the plot rather than ladling it over the surface like some kind of sauce. Jean Hagen, as the actress with a voice made for silent films, got more laughs from my 5-year-old daughter than any of the fart jokes from more recent cartoons. The musical numbers, of which there are so many, each manage to encapsulate a moment, and each is unique in style. Here we really get the benefit of a more mature Gene Kelly, who has had time to develop and evolve stylistically as a dancer. Donald O'Conner is at the top of his game--you can't help but be impressed with his athleticism and attention to detail. Debbie Reynold's has the perfect voice for the part and is so charming that you can't help but love her.As great as all that is (which seems like way too much to fit into 1:43), that's not what makes the film. It's that everything flows so easily and seamlessly that you don't think about any of this while you're watching. You only stop to think about that when everything has finished. During the film you're just enjoying each moment:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So a musical movie with comic drama in it oh, I loved it.The Artist, a film that I now believe is hugely inspired from Singin In The Rain, has won the best film Oscar while this film was not even nominated as best film. That shows, how are we going down in providing quality films. The plot is pretty simple of introducing sound into movies. Its periodic and is yet so flamboyant with tap dances, music and love making space to make it a true musical. Music is what made this movie so very typical and outstanding, it's characters are so stereotypical and yet so humorous thats its so very easy to fall in love with. Performances by each one is just so clean and engaging but Gene Kelly has provided an outstanding performance as Don Lockwood. Plot is simple but the way it was made will make anyone just be happy, there are no twists here, but there is beauty in the simple things that we see. The voice being dubbed, the introduction of microphone, each things makes a scene either cynical or comical and without taking anything overboard. Yes, there are too many songs and dances and yet I loved most of them, coz they are so very real. Anyone would love Singing something In the Rain as Rain in itself is a romantic phenomenon and love sprouts from deep within at such times, I loved this film for its songs, its performances and just for making me feel so happy. Technically, its cinematography, its editing lack their slick which we see these days, but its too very detailed in terms of dialogue and art direction, so it gives us the space to fall in love with it.Recommended for sure, it's 4/5 for one of the best musicals ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The joys of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the rain is a triumph of 50s Hollywood cinema that manages to pay homage to the past while also utilizing cutting edge techniques of the time. The film is also the zenith of the musical film. Besides the classic songs, what struck me most about the film was the hilarious physical comedy, the sheer athleticism of the lead actors, and the gorgeous orchestral accompaniment during the musical numbers. The comedy has aged very well, such that it makes me miss in today's cinema the physical element that these actors (influence by Vaudeville) brought to the film. Donald O'Conner does some pretty incredible acrobatics, most memorably doing several Matrix style back flips (running up a wall and the flipping backwards off of it), and Gene Kelly's dancing could compete with any professional.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hero gets the girl, the sidekick and the dumb blonde get the awards....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Singin' in the Rain" won praises in 1952 for its salute to the beginning of the Hollywood sound era, the critics praised everybody involved with the film, from producer Arthur Freed and director Stanley Donen, all the way down to minor characters Madge Blake as a Louella Parsons like gossip columnist and Kathleen Freeman as a diction coach. Gene Kelly was praised for his graceful dancing even more so than the classic musicals he had already starred in, and Debbie Reynolds was saluted as a promising new leading lady who was perky enough to rise to the top yet established enough to hold her own with the veteran leading man. Ironically, it was Kelly's pal Donald O'Connor who went home with a Golden Globe, and Jean Hagen as a dizzy movie star whose voice killed her transition from silents to sound who received an Oscar Nomination.Now referred to as one of the best movie musicals ever made (certainly in the top 10), this has been re-done for the Broadway and London stage (with mixed results) and imitated through spoofs on T.V. variety shows and in various modern movie musicals. Even "Xanadou", a 1980 cult flop which was Gene Kelly's last musical film role, made a reference to this in one of their musical numbers. But it is this movie which stands the test of time and retains its place of glory in the movie musical hall of fame. Of course, Kelly's performance of the title song remains its most famous moment, but how can you not be amazed by the "Broadway Ballet" production number which features a gorgeous Cyd Charisse as a silent movie vamp. Future "West Side Story" Oscar Winner Rita Moreno is instantly recognizable as a Clara Bow like cutie, and Millard Mitchell is imperious yet comical as the perplexed studio head.This was released at a precarious time in MGM's history, just as the transition from Louis B. Mayer to Dore Schary was taking place behind the scenes. Television was taking off, too, and movie audiences had to be really intrigued to skip Lucy, Uncle Miltie or Red Skelton to go to the movies. Reviews across the board were fantastic, and to this day, people can still quote Hagen's nails-down-a-chalkboard lines such as "What's wrong with the way I talk?" and of course, "Ta te tee to too." There's a fabulous montage saluting the early years of talkie musicals, and if you see some of the rare ones released between 1929 and 1931, you can appreciate the detail which went into the creation of this number.O'Connor really steals the scene when he breaks into "Make Em' Laugh" which almost sounds like Cole Porter's "Be a Clown" from "The Pirate" which ironically was originated by Gene. Debbie gets her chance to show her dancing skills when she joins O'Connor and Kelly for "Good Morning" which has been utilized for orange juice commercials recently. O'Connor and Kelly prove that graceful dancing can be comic in Kelly's montage over his transition from vaudeville hopeful to flickers wannabe to matinée idol ("With dignity. Always dignity", he repeats as flashbacks show otherwise) and "Moses Supposes".While there were no musical superstars at MGM during the early age of sound (Broadway veteran Charles King comes closest thanks to "Broadway Melody of 1929" and a few other forgotten musical antiquities), other studios had teams and individual stars who come close to representing whom Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds play here. As for Hagen, there were a ton of forgotten silent stars whom she could be, but even if fictional, the reference to what was the major problem is hilarious, as is the revenge Kelly and O'Connor get on her in the conclusion and the discovery of Reynolds as a major musical talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He sings, he acts, he dances, he directs.This Gene Kelly classic transformed how musical movies are produced in the 50's. Set up in late 1920's this musical elegantly portrays the transition from silent movies to the so called 'talkies'. The performance of Gene Kelly in the song "Singin' in the Rain" is a treat to watch and is now considered iconic. The other roles have also been executed perfectly most notably the performance of a vain and talent-less star by Jean Hagen.Although the depiction of the motion picture industry could not have been less accurate, Donald O'Connor and Gene Kelly's exuberant tap-dancing bravado combined with a paramount anthology makes this movie a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Musical Ever Made? Hell Yeah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reflecting state-of-the-art quality in every filmmaking aspect, jam-packed with wonderful songs, amazing choreography &amp; exquisite use of humour, and depicting the often frustrating process of getting accustomed to something completely new, Singin' in the Rain is the story of a silent film production company which, along with its cast, makes a difficult transition to sound.To be honest, I'm not really a fan of musicals. In fact, I despise live-action musicals but this film has so much charm, charisma &amp; laughter that it manages to make itself work extremely well for the majority of its runtime. Directed by Gene Kelly &amp; Stanley Donen, the film is a hilarious ride from start to finish &amp; puts on screen some of the most exhausting dance sequences ever filmed.The technical aspects deserve a mention too as cinematography includes many moments of long single-takes, fluid camera movements &amp; perfectly captured shots, editing concisely paces the whole story without ever letting any boredom to set in, although that Broadway sequence did feel out of place &amp; unnecessary to me. And last but not the least, many of its songs are instantly catchy &amp; memorable.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds &amp; Jean Hagen, and although Gene &amp; Debbie no doubt share a great on-screen chemistry here, it's Donald O'Connor who ends up impressing the most for he was an absolute show-stealer in every scene and his highly energetic performance easily overshadowed everything else, including Gene Kelly's magnetic work both on &amp; off the screen.On an overall scale, Singin' in the Rain is hailed by many as the greatest musical to come out from Hollywood &amp; I wholeheartedly agree. It certainly has every ingredient that makes a movie great &amp; despite my initial lack of excitement or expectations, it turned out to be such an incredibly fun, hilarious &amp; enjoyable cinematic ride that I'm going to cherish it for a long time. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe the hype. "Singin' in the Rain" is the greatest musical ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who doesn't love "Singin' in the Rain" (1952)? It's been considered by many as one of the most beloved motion pictures of all time. Even people who usually hate musicals can't bring themselves to say they disliked "Singin' in the Rain". Films in which everyone loves are very difficult to come by, because we all have such diverse tastes. "Singin' in the Rain" is a timeless American classic because it has something in it for everybody. There's outstanding songs and dances, high-end production values, excellent Technicolor cinematography, lots of laughs, terrific writing, irresistible story and characters, everything you could possibly want from a film musical. But "Singin' in the Rain" is much more than just a great movie. It's one of the rare films that is unquestionably guaranteed to heal any mentally depressed soul. Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a highly popular silent film star in the roaring 1920's who works for the film studio Monumental Pictures alongside his best friend/musician Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor, in a wonderful performance) and leading lady Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Don is having a difficult time tolerating his frequent co-star, but the studio insists on carrying out a fake romance with Lina for the sake of maintaining their popularity with the public. One night when he tries to escape from some crazy fans, he accidentally meets a stage actress/chorus girl named Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). At first, she says some harsh words towards Don that makes him question how good he is at his profession. But soon enough, Don and Kathy start to fall in love with each other and Kathy becomes a reliable new star for the studio. There's only one problem with their romance: Lina still thinks she and Don are a couple. And let's just say she isn't amused with the idea of Don and Kathy being together and she'll do anything in her power to make sure they're separated. So that's the love story in a nutshell. However, I didn't mention that the picture Don and Lina are currently working on next is becoming a troublesome production. Not only are the technical experts having trouble figuring out where to put the microphones, but Lina's voice isn't sitting well with the cast and crew. "Singin' in the Rain" is at its funniest when it's showing us the filmmaking process and the challenges the cast and crew have to face when trying to get the sound to work right. The director (Douglas Fowley) in particular was hilarious in terms of expressing just how frustrated he was with each and every take. You practically see every reaction you could possibly get from this guy in a situation like this with each reaction funnier than the last. I personally got a kick out of the members in the audience in each film screening we see. I love how in the test screening of one picture, some girls are jealous of Lina's glamour. And in another, some guys are doing sort of a "Mystery Science Theatre 3000" routine picking it apart and laughing for all the wrong reasons ("I love you. I love you. I love you."). The filmmaking process and the smart audience members aren't the only elements that make the script by Adolph Green and Betty Comden so excellent. For one thing, I love how Green and Comden handled the character of Cosmo. He often receives less credit than what he deserves, but he never lets this disadvantage get to him. Cosmo still helps out his best friend Don with his musical contributions and shows his loyalty to Don in that sense. He's never jealous of Don to the point where he goes off on his own to try and top him. Thank God! Cosmo's just perfectly content with what's he currently got and I think he's pretty awesome for that. Don and Lina's relationship is absolutely hilarious. You can clearly see Don struggling to stay calm over Lina and the wrong ideas she keeps obtaining from the fan magazines. I love how everyone including Don keeps talking down on Lina so that anything they say with a smile will be interpreted as nice to her even when it's not. I also bought the chemistry between Don and Kathy. Even though it's been brought to my attention that Debbie Reynolds had a difficult time with Gene Kelly during this picture's production, it never felt that way with her performance. That's of course a huge compliment to the acting talent of both Kelly and Reynolds to convince us that they're in love even though they didn't get along on set. Funny how the central romances for both "Singin' in the Rain" and "Some Like it Hot" (1959) were between people who couldn't stand each other, but I digress.Perhaps what "Singin' in the Rain" is best remembered for aside from its story, characters, and comedy are its musical numbers. Everyone remembers when Don Lockwood is literally singing in the rain in the famous title tune. It's one of the most recognized scenes in film history for a reason. Amazing that Gene Kelly did the number while he had a fever. Cosmo's classic "Make 'Em Laugh" number has plenty of wit, comedic energy and innovation to spare. Did I mention that Donald O'Connor did all the stunts in the number himself? It goes to show you how dedicated and passionate these artists were during that era. The entire soundtrack is just perfect with other fun highlights including "Moses Supposes" and "Good Morning", in which Debbie Reynolds does a great job keeping up with Kelly and O'Connor. What else can I say? "Singin' in the Rain" ? the greatest musical ever made and one of the rare films that deserves its enormous hype. If you're tired of what's shown in theatres today and are looking for something much more lighthearted and timeless, you owe it to yourself to see "Singin' in the Rain".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first in a trilogy of movies I'll be watching with my Dad over the next few days.The other two are Defending Your Life and Annie Hall.Unfortunately he's had a long week, and passed out about halfway through the film.It does get a bit slow about halfway thru but that's where this criticism ends.Because Singin' is a fantastic film that I'll revisit someday.Gaggery and dancing abound in this sixty two year old film.The good news: It still holds up.The great news: It's entertaining and brilliant!If you're the stuffy type with no taste for dance numbers, singing or stage show antics of any sort; this probably isn't the flick for you.If that's the case, I feel bad for you because there's some good stuff in Singin' in the Rain.It's my least favorite rating: G.But that doesn't detract from the plot. I forget right away.There are a lot of pop culture references to this movie.In The Lion King, Timon and Pumba do a hula dance that is reminiscent of the raincoat scene during the song, "Good Morning," in Singin'.I'm pretty certain The Artist is an homage in its entirety. The plot lines are very similar.Both films are about a silent movie star, an annoying actress on her way out, and a cute young up-and-comer with a lot of potential. Both are set in Hollywood during the transition between silent movies and talkies.SITR specifically is set in 1927, and Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, Donald O'Connor co-stars as his best friend Cosmo Brown and Debbie Reynolds plays Kathy Selden.If you haven't seen it, check it out! But beware the spoilers below.First of all, this movie is primarily a satire. A very well-made one.The different scenes moving through partially built film sets, are spectacular and fascinating. From the very beginning, with the violin performance between Don and Cosmo, the various duets and dances they perform are exceptional.Cosmo is easily my favorite part of the film. Every once in awhile, it's nice to have a reliable and unconflicted deuteragonist (the side kick or best friend character) behind the protagonist. Donald O'Connor turns in a remarkable performance, with several solo dances.The film is so self-referential that the fourth wall is sort of perpetually broken throughout. I'm not certain if they ever actually commit to it.But when Cosmo (who fills in as a screenwriter, audio recording jockey, etc. throughout) takes over for the conductor at the end of the film, it's a pretty direct nod to the audience that everything is off the rails.He cracks some of the best jokes, and is the source of the majority of the humor.At one point Don and Cosmo are speaking with the studio head. The man says to Cosmo, "Remind me to make you a screenwriter." Cosmo hands him one of his own cigars and later on the man says, "Remind me to give you a raise."Towards the end of the film, when the studio head becomes an antagonist, Cosmo says, "I once gave you a cigar. Can I have it back?"It wasn't his cigar to begin with! Hilarious, right?To conclude this glowing review, I'll end with a quote from Don while he courts Kathy. He's positioning the purple artificial lighting on Debbie Reynolds, who's seated on a ladder within a partially constructed set."You sure look lovely in the moonlight, Kathy."- Gene Kelly as Don Lockwood</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain is one of America's most iconic musicals. It captures audience through a mix of music, comedy, and a story we all can appreciate. The film has both cinematic and social significance. As a motion picture the movie truly portrays the idea that musicals don't just be long on Broadway and in the theater industry but there is also a sufficient place for them in Hollywood. I'm hard pressed to picture the on stage performance of singing in the rain being as good as the movie. The sound, color, and lighting aspects of the movie would be hard to replicate and even harder for audiences to recognize and enjoy if it were preformed live. Through use of film technology producers of singing in the rain proved that the ability to edit, use artificial light, and manipulate sound quality has advantages in more than just the average film genera's of that time. Aside from being an benchmark for musical film singing in the rain has a social significance about the underdog presented in a comedic manner. "Stage Actress" Kathy is a dancer who comes into contact with famous silent film actor Don Lockwood. He exposes her talent to his studio and because sound is being incorporated in films they request to use her voice dub over the horrendous voice of Don's co-star and avid admirer Lina Lamont, another famous silent film actor. Over the course of the film Lamont attempts to sabotage the relationship Lockwood and Kathy are developing while she fights to save her acting career intolerable voice. In the end Kathy is exposed as the voice behind Lina Lamont's and she is praised for her talent by the public, earns a job as a real actress, and wins Lockwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The two critical elements of a musical is it's singing and dancing, and Singin' in the Rain does both perfectly. With memorable songs such as 'Good Morning' and 'Fit as a Fiddle' and without a single step out of place, Singin' in the Rain can easily be considered one of the greatest musicals ever. The problem with most musicals is that they can come off too corny, maybe because they try too hard or simply because of bad screen writing. Singin' in the Rain is, admittedly a little corny, but surprisingly engaging. The story, the characters, the song and dance, it all works quite well and leaves the viewers wanting to see what happens next. Singin' in the rain is a delightfully charming film and is good for a couple of laughs every time you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was a really great movie and not what I expected from a musical. Most of the movie in fact is not a musical in the sense we think about today. Most musicals i have watched from the modern era are really over the top and over use singing to the point of destroying the store or plot of the film.I am happy to say that this film does not beat you over the head with a song in every single scene. It sticks to a great plot line with a lot of funny and corny jokes and a little slap stick humor thrown in to break up the seriousness.The plot is also great. Basically it begins with an actor and his delusional co-star "girlfriend". He tries to escape the event he is attending one night without anyone seeing him and finds himself in a sweet women's car who he is surprised to learn may be the one girl who doesn't really fall head over heels in love with him immediately. he seeks a relationship with her but is turned down. This of course only serves to make him want her even more. After shooting a film with His co-star the producer informs them that sound in a film is the new hot thing and they must immediately change the silent film into a movie with sound. This would be but his co-star is a complete idiot and can learn how to talk into a hidden mike. They record the best the could with sound and on the night of the premier they get to see how good the film now with sound would turn out and it was a complete failure and everyone including the himself hated it. With no other options the actors lose faith until they women he met in the car suggest a way to save the film and that was to turn it into a musical. This was going to save the film except the fact that his co-stars voice was worse than her acting. So they come up with a plan to dub over her voice with the girl he meet's voice which ends up saving the film and she gets recognized as a new up incoming star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of good things to say about this movie, the acting and characters, the colorful set and costumes, and of course the musical numbers. Being that I am a big musical fan I thought this movie was amazing and fun. Some people may find that when characters break out in song in the middle of a conversation it is unrealistic and weird, but that's exactly it! It is unrealistic and that is what makes it so much fun, it takes you into another world, one not like our own. It isn't real life and you can get lost in this world on the screen. Singin in the Rain is no different, while watching this movie it is hard not to get absorbed in the story, and you find yourself smiling and tapping your foot along to the music. A lot of the musical numbers are up beat and playful like "Make them Laugh" "Good Morning" and of course the famous "Singin in the Rain" Not only were the musical numbers great to listen to but they were amazing to watch, the color really popped off the screen. This movie was made with Technicolor and this was still new to the audience because a lot of movies were still being made in black and white at this time. So Singin in the Rain really took advantage of filming in color by making the sets full of color, and having very vibrant costumes. Singin in the Rain is a fun movie to watch and I recommend it to musical lovers and haters alike! This may be the musical to change your mind!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily one of my favorite musicals, "Singin' in the Rain" is fun, witty, and entertaining throughout the entire film. As far as musicals go, it is difficult to find one more entertaining than "Singin' in the Rain". Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds, this musical focuses around a Hollywood studio during their transition from silent films to "talkies". Known for its iconic title song, "Singin' in the Rain" is just pure fun to watch. With the perfect mixture of singing, dancing, and humor, this is definitely one of the most energetic films to date. In terms of its stylistic format, "Singin' in the Rain" is brilliantly made. The films' underling plot, after all, is about the progression of film technology in Hollywood and "Singin' in the Rain" does a great job of creating a realistic representation of that. By using Technicolor the film stood out, not only because of its plot, superb acting, and happy-go-lucky singing and dancing, but because of it's beautiful appearance. In terms of the musical genre, "Singin' in the Rain" is easily, for me at least, in the top three of best films ever made.</fullReview>

Since then, my Dad would constantly make references to this movie, but because I never actually saw the whole thing, I didn't recognize where they were from until I saw it for my movie class a few weeks ago. I absolutely fell in love with it. I will admit, it was the first movie that we watched in class that I genuinely enjoyed, through and through. The music was perfect, the color was great, the acting was amazing, and the jokes were hilarious. The jokes are what really got me to love this movie. I'm almost always in the mood for a comedy, and wow....the whole class was laughing louder than I'd ever heard, and I was going right along with them. Overall, I would say that it was a nearly perfect musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I call this film not just a musical because it is so much more than that. It has its musical moment, but it takes the viewers through a big part of history in film. Actually the film tells you the way musicals were created and not through some musical piece to show it.The actual story of this film is when sound came to movies... what a great invention to the film industry. Not everyone said that when it was created and became a needed thing for film not wanted. So the studios that have sound will be more popular what about the others. Well the film takes you through the struggles of adapting to sound and since it wasn't exactly a success at first something needed to be done.The musical isn't just about singing in the rain it creates a whole different story about a famous actor who thinks he can act as a silent actor but is challenged when he has to use his actual voice. Also is challenged by a woman who said he isn't a real actor without sound, which begins a little love story that brings the audience through the back doors of Hollywood. Of course there are musical moments but it does help give the film a better atmosphere for the film and keep it up and a more positive setting for viewers.</fullReview>

I like how this film was made and incorporates lots of different scenarios and scenes. The use of cameras at pre-determined locations makes for a steady flow and up close and personal feel.

		<fullReview>Given how much I love musicals, I really shouldn't have been surprised I dug this movie. Call it snobbery, but I rather was! I've had opportunities in the past to watch this before I actually sat down and did. That's years lost where I could have been rewatching!This movie has everything I like in a musical. Incredible singing, and dance numbers that tie in beautifully to the plot being the chief thing I look for. I like the music numbers to mean something, and here they did. I found my face on the verge of breaking from how hard I was smiling and as soon as I finished the film, I was on youtube rewatching my favorite scenes. I fell completely in love with the three lead characters and their relationships to one another. They are your classic story telling triumvirate, each adding something to the puzzle that the others couldn't. Good Morning was my favorite, not because of the song itself, but because I got to see these three let loose together and have fun. It goes without saying how absolutely stunning the visuals were. The colors blew me away and the only film today that I think comes close to its beauty is Moulin Rouge. This film though had the room to play around with so much more color wise given how it was right on the edge of when color films were becoming the norm making it really stand out.I'd rec this to anybody who loves musicals or feel good films. So glad I finally saw this.</fullReview>

Not only were the songs excellent but the acting was that much better. Obviously Don and Kathy's characters were portrayed excellently but I thought the actor that portrayed Cosmo Brown absolutely stole the entire movie. Him singing Make Em Laugh was the best part of the entire movie.

		<shortDescription>The Audience are all singin' in the rain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the time I first began viewing films with a certain passion, there haven't been too many- in fact, very few- musicals that have impressed me and lent me to revisit them appraisingly. Firstly, very few of them actually contain interesting characters and subject matter with Les Miserablés being a recent, remarkable musical/example. Then, there was the whole eventual boredom that would emanate from the film's constant dancing, singing, and stylistic and unnatural reliance on choreographic performances. Fortunately, in this case, Singin' in the Rain managed to surprise me with its sheer quality and entertaining nature. Attuned to what I previously claimed, the picture features incredibly charming characters with Don Lockwood (played by the great Gene Kelly) being a very clear exemplar. Normally, Hollywood films in that era would portray relationships in largely superficial and (negatively) theatrical fashion. The couple would persistently utter hackneyed lines to one another. Some might find them beautiful, but I find them horribly clichéd- that is unless the pairing has a charisma and charm to them that's able to separate the two from the generic Hollywood romance that was customarily depicted on-screen during those times. In this instance, Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden (a rare beauty played by Debbie Reynolds) commence their unorthodox relationship with a stir of skepticism in which Kathy doesn't quickly wrap herself up in the famous star's arms. Her likability and credibility is earned by her resistance to his glamour. This effectively displays her character as strong-willed and alluring- she's not the kind to thoughtlessly sleep with a guy the day she met him because he's a worldwide sensation; no, she's the kind that's hard to obtain. At this point, the male audience (or, at least, me) immediately find themselves resonating with Don because I'm sure most of us have come across a woman we painstakingly loved but were unable to attract without great effort. This fascinating relationship follows in a similar manner throughout the film until they realize the appeal of one another. In sum, the terrific chemistry between the two characters is self-evident from the absolute start, which is also wondrously contributed to by exceptional acting performances. On another note, the soundtrack is quite delightful and classic in its melody and rhythm and provides for astounding choreography. With that being said, though the feature is predominantly entertaining and clever, it slightly loses its pace with its middle act in which we're introduced to non-stop singing and dancing. The intriguing story is compromised and temporarily paused while the filmmakers use this precious time to showcase the musical performances as this is a musical at the end of the day. Unfortunately, that particular segment (prolonged, indeed) lowered the film's overall quality and troubled it with a highly noticeable flaw. When I was discussing the unrealistic look of musicals at certain moments towards the beginning of my review, this is exactly what I meant by their unattractive aspects. When all is said and done, Singin' in the Rain was a pleasing experience, and although it was considerably hurt by its second act, I hope my memory of the film will be dominated by its satisfying plot, characters, music, and cinematically historical significance, which all drastically overshadow that one meandering element.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The genre listed above is a big personal turn-off. People frolicking around, singing and dancing with the added melodramatic romance scenes is simply not my cup of tea. The fact that this movie turned out to be far more enjoyable than I had imagined, speaks a lot for itself. Set in the year of 1927, when movies were still silent and the new trend of 'talking pictures' was classified by many to be a passing trend that doesn't hold any water. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are a hugely successful on-screen duo who have created many famous romantic saga's. Don is a noted dancer, singer and performer whereas Lina has nothing but attractive looks. Her shrill and squeaky voice makes her a misfit for a talking picture but at the same time the studio management has a contract with her on which they cannot go back on. Kathy Selden (Reynolds) is a theatre artist who knows the challenges when it comes to acting while talking and believes that actors in movies are not true actors at all. When Don and Kathy meet at a party, they are both at disagreement over each others thoughts about acting but still find a connection between themselves which makes them fall in love. The movie is filled with energetic performances, mostly danced and sung by Gene Kelly himself. The overdose of music may not go down very well with many, like me, but there are still a few select performances where the moves are marvellous and anybody would appreciate it. Singing and dancing apart, the movie beautifully showcases the evolution of movies and the hilarious challenges that directors, producers and actors had to face alike. A good entertainer where one can easily skip the singing and dancing and move on with the movie.</fullReview>

Cosmo specifically stuck out to me, he was very funny and had me laughing throughout the whole movie. The scene with the actual singin' in the rain song was great, it gave me a very happy feeling. You could certainly tell Don was in love with Kathy. They had a very strong connection and I loved the fact of how they met and she played it off cool unlike other girls that would be all over him. There are many aspects of this movie that were really great, great storyline as well as characters. The voice of Kathy was really intriguing, a lot better than Lena! I also liked the message of in a sense you will always be exposed for being or doing something fake, this particular movie really gave out that message. I personally did not really get the end of the movie, I thought it could have been done different to make more sense. The ending was about the only problem I had with the movie, overall I thought it was a great musical.</fullReview>

Other than that i loved every minute of it. It was extremely funny. I laughed multiple times during every scene. The comedic talent of all of the leads was amazing.

I'm not a big musical person, but even i found myself enjoying this movie, of course i prefer the version of the title song used in A Clockwork Orange. It's a very fun movie to watch, even though it's incredibly corny and campy. Like most films of the time, there isn't a lot of camera work that stands out. There are a few shots that stuck with me, like the dream sequence of Don Lockwood's fantasy musical, and some of the early back story scenes, but all-in-all i won't look back on this movie for the camera angles. This movie brings its A- game in its music. The score for the movie is near perfect, with varying genres and perfectly executed choreography. I almost broke my foot trying to tap dance like Gene Kelly. Unfortunately, the quality of the dancing didn't transfer to the story. The story wasn't bad, i liked it, in fact i thought it had a pretty creative concept, but i was expecting a whole lot more coming from a movie which placed 5th on AFI's top 100 movies list. Still though, the movie succeeds, and not even all these flaws can stop the sun in my heart, cause i'm ready for love! 8/10</fullReview>

In Disney or Universal when I was probably 5, I have a picture of me taken under an umbrella next to a streetlight, with a background like in this movie. So I've always known that the movie contained a scene like that were they sang a song called, "Singin' In The Rain". I figured that would be the most memorable scene, but actually for me, it was the "Make Them Laugh" sequence performed by Donald O'Connor. I really liked how it was choreographed. Donald and Jean Hagen were my favorite actors in this film. The only part of this movie that confused me and I think it could have done without was the whole "Gotta Dance" sequence. It was really out of place and unnecessary. Or at the very least, too long. Maybe if they shortened it by like 5 minutes it would have been better. But that's the only thing I didn't like about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain (1952) is a musical comedy directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds, the film story follows the career of two silent screen actors ? Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). Don and Lina are popular and successful movie stars during the height of the silent film era. While being chased by crazed fans, Don jumps into a car driven by Kathy Seldon (Reynolds). Kathy is a fledgling actress that Don is smitten with immediately. Meanwhile, "The Jazz Singer" is released, and with 'talkies' becoming the rage of Hollywood, Dona and Lina are faced with no choice but to adapt.The film uses song and dance to follow the challenges Don, Lina, and their studio has to develop their first talkie picture. The majority of the musical pieces were previously released in earlier films, but Kelly and O'Connor are phenomenal in their choreographed routines with two scores standing out ? "Moses Supposes His Toeses are Roses" and "Good Morning". The later score also had Reynolds joining in the scene. The athleticism and agility of Kelly, O'Connor, and Reynolds throughout the picture make the 103 minute runtime 'tap' by quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not care for musical movies. I prefer to see them preformed on stage. I love music, I think it helps to express a lot of things, but I do not care for musicals being acted out in a movie. The acting is not very good, though the dance numbers are done very well. Though, the story line and plot isn't bad. It was able to hold my attention, even though I am not one to watch musical films. I did enjoy the song numbers though, they were well written and preformed. The Technicolor of this film is very rich and vibrant. It had a very artsy feel, both technically and visually i thought. For a musical film though, it wasn't half bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of musicals but I have to admit this one had some darn catchy tunes. The joy and sense of music was contagious, the colors and the infamous rain scene were delightfully directed and acted. One of my favorite scenes was the dreamlike one in which the woman with the very long white dress flowing danced and the man danced around her and her dress, the camera movements and the choreography not just in that scene but the entire film were awe inspiring. It made you feel like a kid, kind of brought out that sappy youthfulness which was alright. It's a positive feel good film, the technique and wonderful singing and dancing help keep your eyes glued to what's going on because it's so elegant and over the top, and so it's worth watching if you're ever feeling down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first: it pains me to give this movie a good review. For years I have been adamantly against musical films, often considering them a sort of cop-out for a real film. I suppose this movie served as a sort of awakening. I went into the viewing with contempt, but was soon truly enveloped in the happenings on screen. Above all, I have to credit the movie's choreography. The musical acts and accompanying dance routines were so well thought out and deeply intricate, being unimpressed is an apparent impossibility. The songs both added emotion and also made the film a bit more lighthearted at times. Gene Kelly delivers a remarkable performance, as do his co-stars Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying, I am not a big fan of musicals. Of course, there will always be a place in my heart for The Wizard of Oz and The Sound of Music, and Grease as they are films that are more rites of passage than actual entertainment. With all that said, I love Singin' in the Rain. I love it. It is one of the finest films that I have ever watched and I can watch it again and again. Gene Kelly is simply too cool. He is one of the few men that project cool while doing goofy and graceful dance moves. Especially the bizarre,dance number at the end was Fantastic. Donald O'Connor, though, is one of the main reasons why this film works. He is sofunny. His Make'm Laugh skit still gets me rolling today. He is beyond brilliant in this film and really makes it all come together. It is a romance, a comedy, a history lesson and a some of the best dance numbers ever all rolled into one. I don't really know what else to say about this film except... wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though i really respect this movie for its up beat tunes and use of sets, it was not my favorite movie. To start out i'm not a huge fan of musicals and this movie had no point really. Yes it was suppose to be when films with sound just came out and they are trying to make a movie better then The Jazz Singer. they were trying to hard to make it a hit. regarding the plot they made it really corny though i know more recent musicals try to take more youth wide problems for people to relate. though they still never interest me. A couple of things I thought they did well with the shooting and lighting. they used the lighting to interact with the characters making it very visual. over all again I did not enjoy the movie as a whole but certain aspects were really great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain takes us back to the late 1920s, when the film industry was abandoning silent films in favor of talkies. In a way I found this film informational because it does a very good job at describing what life was like for an actor back then. To many this film is known as one of the best musicals of its time, however I feel as if a lot of that has to do with time at witch is was released. Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly did a fantastic job at explaining the transformation of silent films to musicals, well after the genre had become established, but more than a decade before it began to run out of steam. It also was one of the few movies available at the time that used Technicolor, which in my opinion did a fantastic job at emphasizing every source of color in the film. These factors along with an excellent variety of characters, a number of interesting settings, and unique concept of showing the world the true Hollywood are what made this film so enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I'm not a fan of musicals, because as the movie goes on it becomes boring and irritating. However, this movie was a bit different, I actually enjoyed it. This was an old time musical which I expected to be boring and never to end. This movie wasn't like that all, it was full of vibrant colors, great comedy, and bold characters; which whom had versatile acts. I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to the very end. Everything just fell in place; I wasn't confused or stuck on what was happening. Like most musicals I watch, I become confuse and lost into what I'm watching. Maybe because I become so overwhelmed with the singing, I forget what's going on in the movie, Lol. Although this movie was a musical, I actually enjoyed it and thought all the songs that were sung were pretty catchy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From A Guy Who Doesn't Like Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit I'm biased against musicals; I just have a hard time suspending my disbelief when I see a group of people burst into pitch-perfect song and well-choreographed dance. I know, I know, I can willingly accept a movie that happened a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, but I can't accept a musical that takes place right here right now? Anyway, I happened upon it during a business trip, and with nothing better to do, I popped it into my DVD player and had my mind changed.What I liked most about it were the musical numbers. As I watched them, they impressed me because these weren't simple numbers, and a lot of them featured extended takes, so kudos to the performers for making them so fun to watch.I also like the humor in the film; I didn't know much about the film except that it was a musical, so would the non-musical parts be comedic, dramatic, tragic, what? I can tell that it was predominantly a comedy, although it had its dramatic moments. The funniest scene I remember took place when a silent film was being filmed, and it was a romantic scene, yet the actors in it were insulting each other, hilarious!All in all, a nice family film to sit down to, my only complaint is that there is one musical number that runs a little too long and doesn't really contribute anything to the plot, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as musicals go, this movie was not that bad. After seeing this movie, I started to understand all the references that I've seen in the past about this movie that I didn't picked up on the first time around. The movie was very exciting and has lots of energy. This movie also gave you a better understanding of how silent films were starting to become outdated compared to the new talk films and problems it caused for actors and film directors. The plot of the film centered around that theme. I also like the sense of realism that they included with Gene Kelly performance when he was walking and singing in the rain and then the cop showed up. The one part I didn't like in the movie was the long dance scene where they show Gene Kelly going to the big city. Although I'm not a big fan of musicals I like this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few thoughts on Singing in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of all musicals. I mostly like only comedies. If a musical seems too corny to me it's a huge turn off. This, although was corny in ways, ended up being a great movie. It really gave hope to all those waitresses working in Hollywood trying to make something of themselves. Hard work pays off and this movie shows it. It also pointed out something that could have actually happened if it had not been brought to the public's attention through this movie and that is: people not getting credited for their talent. I'm sure that it probably does happen here and there, but I'm hoping it's not nearly as bad as it could have been. I think somebody getting credit for someone else's talent is one of the crappiest things that can happen. I'm glad that they made this movie so early and that they incorporated that dirty trick in it. That sort of stuff can potentially ruin a talented actor/signer/writer/comedian's career.I thought the music in this movie was a little on the corny side, but in a good way. This movie was funny. I could relate how stressed the director was getting to the actor not speaking into the microphone. I don't know why they made such a big deal about her voice though. It wasn't that bad. I also don't know why they didn't just have her do her own voice over's backstage and then sync it to the movie (before they made it a musical of course, because she was a bad signer). This might sound strange, but did anybody else want to be friends with Cosmo? He seemed like a funny person to hang out with. Both of the guys were awesome at dancing, I didn't realize tap dancing could be so cool. Their dancing was way different then the shoulder leaning two stepping crap dancers are doing today. This movie was good, I suggest you watch it. It's for sure a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain has it all. And all of it is really good. An array of songs, a top notch cast (led by Gene Kelly), a script that contains romantic and exciting writing, and the picture and color of the movie is vivid and beautiful. Yes there are some holes here and there, and the plot is "cheesy" and silly but that's what a musical is. Cheesy, hammed up, with everyone singing and dancing. Not my take for a good movie, but Singin in the Rain was I must admit a good musical. This musical not only contains the obvious music but also contains a hint of comedy.In a nutshell, this movie has a good screen play but is made better through the fluid directing and excellent acting and cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typically like musicals to some extent, but I can't say they are always my favorite thing to watch. I usually don't wake up in the morning and say "I'm going to watch a musical today". However in the film Singing in the Rain I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Growing up with sound I tend to like hearing people's voices. So that I can decipher the tone of voice used and etc. I found this film to pleasantly humorous and yes there were some scenes that I thought could have been shorter, but over all I thought the film was executed nicely. I liked the interactions with the characters and the plot line. I almost fell over after hearing Lina talk! The story line to me was well developed and easy to follow along. I thought the singing in the rain scene was outstanding and I also enjoyed the scene where Cosmo sings and dances! It was a phenomenal long shot and the scene itself was lively. One other scene that I found very impressive was the scene where a woman is dressed in white. She has a very long piece of fabric attached to her garment. I don't know why I found this seen so interesting, considering all she did was walk and move around, but the fabric was suspended in the air for the entire scene. It was simplistic, but beautiful and I can only imagine having to be the woman in that scene. The film kept me entertained and I didn't mind that it was a musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best compliment for any form of entertainment is to say that it put you in a great mood, and no film I have ever seen did this more than Singin' in the Rain. This film had it all. It was a great comedy, a great musical, and a great love story perfectly intertwined. The cast was flawless. Gene Kelly's leading man was perfect. I could write forever about how charming, funny, and likable he was, but simply put he was just perfect. Debbie Reynolds also turned in a stellar performance, and Don O'Conner's character, Cosmo Brown, stole the show. When he was on screed I literally could not take my eyes off of him. His great dancing, quick jokes, and boyish exuberance were mesmerizing. This film was so entertaining and fun to watch that my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. An absolute must see film that will leave you smiling.....and singing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was certainly not my first foray into the realm of musicals, but it is easy to see why this film garnered such critical acclaim upon its release. Everything aspect of this film is top notch. The fact that it is a musical that plays on the first sound films being released and the whole slew of trouble that ensued makes it even better. This brings me to my next point, humor. This film is genuinely funny, and not just as a student, but as a viewer as well. The writing is sharp and witty, albeit a bit sentimental for my taste. From the films opening scene on the red carpet, as a viewer there is no mistaking that this movie is going to be great. Gene Kelly's acting, singing, and of course dancing, is superb to say the least, and is made even better by the cast around him. The music in the film was a bit slow for my taste, but it is understandable considering this film is supposed to be set in the 1920's. I feel as though there is not much I can say that has not been said already by many others about what a high caliber film this is. Jean Hagen as the nasally and pompous Lina Lemont made me want to cringe every time she entered the scene. While I understand that it is a movie, nonetheless, I can't imagine that role did not stick with her for a while. What I mean to say is, I'm sure that people berated her on the street because of her performance. But I digress.. The overall feel, or mis-en-scene of the film is great, from the costumes to the set and production design, all the way down to the minor details like the microphones in the flower pot. It just goes to show that something as simple as sound in films, which assuredly we all take for granted every day, had at best, rocky beginnings to get to the point where it is today. Not to sound overly cliché, but this film is a timeless classic that I would highly recommend to others.</fullReview>

As the movie goes on he meets a girl and like most movie by the end you can guest what happens. And you can tell she likes him and he likes her. One of the best parts is when they the sound on filmed and even funnier when the movie come out. I like the dance number they was fun to watch and Entertaining and the acting was great it was very believable.

		<fullReview>I have never been a fan of musicals, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, minus a couple of songs that went for for a bit too long. That being said, this movie has not changed my opinion about musicals, they just are not my thing. And that is because this movie was not like most of the musicals I have seen before, this one was dialogue that was forced into song, it was dance and song numbers that conversations led into. The lead actor, Gene Kelly is amazing. His performance throughout the movie is very solid. But, the person who steals the whole movie without having the biggest part by far is Donald O'Connor. His performance during the "Make 'em Laugh" song makes everyone else in the movie look like a bunch of amateurs. I have never before been impressed by someone's dancing before in my life until this movie and that part of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" makes you complete forget about how oppressive Gene Kelly was during the making of this film. I love how bright and colorful the sets were, as well as the characters. The songs are also incredibly memorable; 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Make 'Em Laugh," and 'Moses Supposes,' to name a few, are going to be stuck in your head for days later. Donald O'Conner is probably my favorite actor in the movie, mostly because of his attitude and delivery. He's keeps the beat, executes some fantastic moves, and, for guy who admitted to being afraid of messing up around Kelly, he certainly seems like one of the happiest and care-free characters in the movie. I actually think he reminds me of Stephen Stucker, the bizarre actor of "Airplane!" fame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Then you'd should check out Singing in the Rain. It's simply put a wonderful movie to watch. Even if you're like me (believe I really hate musicals) and find the dance numbers and songs all quite absurd and cheesy, this movie is still very entertaining nonetheless, including many sight gags and one liners throughout the pieces. This movie is something more of a comedy movie, with singing and dancing. How does one not find the scenes they made of their movie "The Dancing Cavalier" absolutely hilarious? Maybe one who isn't a fan of The Jazz Singer, which they not only make fun throughout the movie, they insult it by name. Quite brave, if you ask me. The one complaint I have (again because I have an apprehension towards them) is when they're dancing in his dream, and it's very colorful, about how he wanted to be on Broadway. I can't remember the name or anything, but it went on a bit too long and I started to get exhausted from it. Thankfully the whole dancing thing cuts back right after. So, if you're not a big musical fan, but you like comedies, and haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did you read the summary I wrote? I HATE musicals. Hate them so very much. I'd rather be inflicted with some sort of pain than sit through an entire musical film. Singin' in the Rain had quite the opposite effect though. I LOVED this movie. Musical or not, it was largely entertaining and hilarious all the way through. Gene Kelly is superb in his role as Don Lockwood, as he is charismatic, funny, and charming- as is his partner, Cosmo. I loved this movie for many reasons, but above all I think it was the overall look of the film. Some similar films of the same time period (where the sidewalk ends, I'm looking at you) just didn't have the same technology or feel I suppose. When I started watching Singin' in the Rain, I had no idea it debuted in 1952. In fact, I though it was much newer than that because of the amazingly crisp Technicolor technology. This movie looks smoother and clearer than many movies made in the 70's 80's and 90's. It was that good. I was, and still am, blown away by the amazing picture quality this movie possesses. I cannot say enough good things about this film. The ONLY detraction. I do mean ONLY, is that some of the musical scores carried on a little bit longer than I had cared for, but I was never bored. I only say this, because, as mentioned before, I am not a fan of musicals; just this one. Funny, suspenseful, entertaining (especially the stunts and dances). This movie was amazing. I loved it and recommend it to anybody. 9 out of 10, I loved it and so will you. Go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best 1930s musical ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is the best musical ever made, according to the MGM publicity department. Except, perhaps, for Oklahoma!, Guys and Dolls, The King and I, Carousel, the Sound of Music, The Music Man, West Side Story or My Fair Lady. And then there are those who say Meet Me in St. Louis or Hello, Dolly! were the best musicals ever made, which is true, if those are the only movies they have ever seen in their lives. The big problem is that Singin' in the Rain is not a modern musical, one in which the music expresses the inner thoughts of the characters, that advances the plot, and that is not performed by actors playing actors or musicians, performing on stage. MGM never really got the hang of producing artistically great, modern musicals. They were never able to fully integrate a great plot with great music and dancing. The plot was usually a weak skeleton to hold the musical numbers together. The musical numbers often written earlier, and the writers had to strain to find an excuse to tack them on to the story line; An American in Paris is a prime example. Even the title song Singin' in the Rain had already been recycled many times by MGM. MGM spared no expense on the lavish song and dance numbers, and figured that was good enough reason for people to pay admission. MGM's musicals are mostly fluff, although perhaps the world's most magical fluff. These are stress-free shows, lacking depth, thought provoking controversy, or social message. They tend to be modified revues, the earliest form of film musical. Yet the beginning of the modern musical had already appeared on Broadway in the 1920s with Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's Show Boat. It was first filmed in 1936, and its theme was the evils of racial discrimination. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein later teamed up to produce Oklahoma! on Broadway in 1942, and then on film in 1955. Hammerstein, whose grandfather had been an opera impresario, brought much greater artistic sophistication to musicals, strongly linking the story and lyrics. Ultimately, it is difficult to name one "greatest" musical because they are unique and appeal to different audiences. However, if you establish the criteria of strongest story, strongest writing, most memorable music, best dancing and most lavish sets, I think there is a clear winner: My Fair Lady. What gives it the edge is that the screenplay is based faithfully on Pygmalion, by George Bernard Shaw, who was the 20th century's Shakespeare (aka, Edward De Vere). (Guys and Dolls, and The Music Man would be strong runners up in my book.)And which studio made My Fair Lady? MGM? Heck, no! It was Warner Bros., the rebel, non-conformist studio -- the antithesis of MGM. Singin' in the Rain is a fun musical, and one you can watch several times before getting sick of it. It is certainly important, and a must see for film literacy, not to mention commercial literacy, such as the old Donald O'Connor athlete's foot ads. What Singin' in the Rain really is, is the world's best 1930s musical, which happens to be when it was set.Or, on second thought, the second best. The best 1930s musical was Top Hat, by a mile.</fullReview>

As so, we are then introduced in a sort of ''metafilm'', a film inside a film.The leading trio are a standing artistic supremacy and delivers us a simply magical show, served by a soundtrack.

		<fullReview>I can't gainsay this classic musical its status as one of Hollywood's very best, although I do have one or two issues with it which stop me giving it an even higher mark. On the plentiful plus side are the wonderful dance numbers, particularly the iconic title piece, but also Donald O'Connor's brilliant solo "Make 'em Laugh", the golly-gosh niceness of "Good Morning" and of course the celebrated "Broadway Melody" finale, the often overlooked very witty and funny screenplay which brilliantly satirises the traumatic transition time in Hollywood from "Silents" to "Talkies" and some fine acting performances, if not by the leads.I admit to something of a problem with Kelly, he's no great singer and his lantern-jawed acting often distinctly smells of ham, but a great choreographer and dancer he undoubtedly was and he's never better than here. I did find Debbie Reynolds too young and winsome for her part as Kelly's love interest and it's a pity her character's initial feistiness is watered down as the film progresses, but her personality still shines through more than enough. Donald O'Connor I do like in his supporting part as Kelly's side-kick, even if he does seem at times to be a mini-me Danny Kaye, but it's Jean Hagen who steals the acting plaudits with her sub Judy Halliday routine as the screechy, back- stabbing Lina Lamont - you'll be saying "I caint stain 'im" for hours afterwards.The film is bright, colourful, musical but most of all very funny and can deservedly be celebrated as one of the best musicals ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 79 Singin' In the Rain. A true classic, and a well deserved reputation. It's charming, cute, catchy and funny all in one bright cheery package of joy. A gem, and one of the very few musicals I've enjoyed.Singin' in the Rain is about Hollywood, and how it had to change from silent to sound. It's a cool premise that works very well. We follow Don Lockwood, a silent film star, played perfectly by Gene Kelly, with charisma and plenty of smiles. His opening scene, highlighting his road to fame, is hilarious. His "relationship" with Lina is equally funny, as they alternate through time liking and being repulsed by each other. Jean Hagen is really funny as the ditsy starlet, with that legendary voice and her head in the clouds. While we're talking about actors, I can't forget Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, friend to Don, and star of the legendary Make 'Em Laugh.The film is bright and cheery,and it puts you in a good mood. The plot moves quickly, and the numbers are not too far apart or back to back. And they're great. Some amazing tap dancing (and rain dancing) are mesmerizing, and there are no weak acts. The songs themselves are easy to get into and catchy. The time to prepare for such acts must've been dizzying, especially since some songs don't change the camera often.The film wraps up nicely, with a good ending. Strong from start to finish, Singin' in the Rain deserves its praise and holds up very well today. Even one who doesn't like musicals will enjoy Singin' in the Rain. 8.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time travels back 84 years ago in the year 1927, where silent movies have met their match against a new type of movies called sound pictures or "talkies". Famous Hollywood star Don Lockmond's(played by Gene Kelly, who also directed and wrote the lyrics for this movie)career was threatened by this new development after the sound picture version of "The Dueling Cavalier" became a flop due to audio difficulties. However, his friends Cosmo Brown(played by Donald O'Connor and my favorite character in this movie) and Kathy(Played by Debbie Reynolds) suggested that Don should turn "The Dueling Cavalier" into a musical and for Kathy to dub squeaky-voiced Lina Lamont's(Played by Jean Hagen) voice as well. Unfortunately, when Lina found out that Kathy was doing her voice, she wants to buy the studios she works at with Don and give poor Kathy the axe! Will Don and Cosmo convince the movie audience and save Kathy's career(not to mention the studios) or will it all be washed up for Don and his friends? Singin' in the Rain is one of my favorite musicals and is the greatest musical of all time! My favorite number in the movie was "Make'em Laugh" performed by the wacky Cosmo Brown and my favorite scenes were when Kathy hits Lina with a pie(Ironically, she was aiming for Don) and the Dueling Cavalier experiencing audio difficulties(Very funny, actually!). I guarantee that you'll enjoy Singin' in the Rain with its excellent choreography and musical numbers. Singin' in the Rain is one of the best! 10 Trillion Stars out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Definitive Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's "Singin' in the Rain" is the musical to define musicals. A depiction of the transition from silent films to those with sound "Singin' in the Rain" displays the world of late 1920's early 1930's Hollywood in a comedic way and is an amusing film for it. The film employs a variety of dances and music from various genres' ranging from Latin beat to Jazz, including the Charleston and samba dancing. Dance and musical numbers are often used as a means of stressing a point that would often be made as straightforward dialogue in traditional movies. Instead of stressing a point characters chose to perform a song and dance that displays their feelings or opinions of a situation. It is not unlike the exaggerated motions of those who acted in silent films. "Singin' in the Rain" is in all ways a classic. The movie is must for any who enjoy musicals and it is a proper example of what content makes for a well made one. Consistently funny and always engrossing "Singin' in the Rain" stands the test of time and is film enjoyable by practically anyone capable of appreciating song ad dance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this film. It is a fun-filled love story musical showing Hollywood's transition from silent films to "talkies" in a comical manner. In my opinion, Debbie Reynolds (Cathy) is not the best dancer. She is not as tight with her movements and doesn't flow as well as her partner. However, what makes this film so captivating IS the singing and dancing. It incorporates many various types of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet and even a bit of ballroom, swing and salsa. There was also a mini section of African dance. The dream-like scene switched from a classical ballet to more of a modern ballet. I thought that the "Make Em' Smile" dance was wonderful and thoroughly entertaining. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really liked about this film was the variety of dance and music sequences that appeared in it, making it the musical it became. The songs paired with dances were vibrant and full of life adding to the experience of this well rounded story depicting the difficult transitions studios and actors had going from silent films to sound films. The film is very well put together and seamlessly moves from one scene to the next.Perhaps the best scene, was when Cosmo set out to make Don laugh in the song and dance number, "Make Him Laugh". As the scene unfolds, you see the true comedy is in the accidental funny moments (although fully on purpose on behalf of the cast) as Cosmo uses improvisation to whip up some complex moves, such as running up the side of a wall and flipping off of it, and of course, some much welcomed laughs too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain(1952) is very nearly flawless. Great performances from Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor entertain and impress throughout. The pacing of the film is absolutely spot on with jokes, emotional moments, entertaining musical numbers, impressive achievements in dance that all combine to create perhaps the greatest "feel-good" film ever made. I hate to focus on the negative as there are so many positives but I feel that the only thing keeping it from being a perfect film was the extended sequence of the musical within the musical with the "Gotta Dance" routine. The interactions between Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor absolutely made the picture and as Kelly goes off on his own the film loses it's plot and it's heart. As an audience member I had fallen in love with Reynolds' and O'Connor's characters and being without them for such a lengthy period just felt wrong. Despite the departure, the film stands as one of the most enjoyable and entertaining works of all-time, I'll just have fast forward through that sequence in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said that hasn't already been said about the marvelously beautiful songs and dance numbers? They're simply captivating and stunning. While they are the heart and soul of the film and truly capture the audiences emotions, what make this such a successful movie are the characters, the comedy, and the story, which don't get enough praise.There's funny dialog that works its way into a few songs, and great physical comedy as well. The cheerful and comical nature of the characters makes the audience fall in love with them. The story is what makes the movie for me though. It is a brilliant take on the attitudes and events that occurred in the transition between silent films and talkies. Faced with many challenges Don, Cosmo, and Kathy work together to save the latest Don Lockwood film in a way just as brilliant as the music and dancing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary &amp; Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain (1952) is a comedy and musical film directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Gene Kelly also stars in this film along with Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen.This film is about a silent film star (Gene Kelly) who is very well known to everyone in the town. He was always partnered with the same female star (Jean Hagen) who had great looks, but had a terrible voice. During the film Kelly meets a dancer (Debbie Reynolds) and he criticizes her because she wasn't in films. Later in the film, the studio tries to transform into a musical studio, and Kelly uses Reynolds' beautiful voice over Jean Hagen's character voice. Hagen does not like her and she tries to take over the film studio.I liked the opening flashback in the beginning of this film that showed how Kelly met Donald O'Connor's character and how Kelly's character got partnered up with Hagen's character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be the first to admit that I've never been a fan of musicals and probably never will be but I have to give a lot of respect to this film. The main reason I respect this film so much is because along with all of the singing and dancing there was a story line I could follow and stay interested in. A big reason I don't like musicals is because nobody runs through the streets singing and dancing in real life without being committed to a mental institution. The best part of the movie was when Cosmo was doing his comical routine on the movie set. In my opinion Donald O'Conner stole the show with that performance but he was my favorite character through out the movie. Another thing I liked about the movie was how they showed how the industry worked and the difficulties of bring sound into movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time i have seen "Singin' in the Rain" and I seriously enjoyed the movie. the story was engaging and keeps you interested, but its the dancing that really held my attention. every dance scene was incredible. my favorite was definitely Cosmo Brown's dance solo. It was extremely funny while visually entertaining and show cases how acrobatic he is. I noticed that a lot of his comedic dance moves are quite similar to moves in modern break dancing. At one point he runs up a wall about six feet and back flips off, it was insane. I also of course enjoyed the famous singin' in the rain solo song and dance by Don Lockwood. I actually want to go jump in puddles this summer because of that scene. Great movie and i plan on watching it again sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>great movie. Fabulous. A visual sensation. This movie was made in 1952 but takes place around 1927 in the film industry. This movie is both educational about films at that time and also intriguing with an excellent storyline. The movie is so visually mesmerizing, outstanding mise- en-scene along with superb choreography and singing. A true musical sensation. Also the visual illusions of the movie are not only imaginative but also very creative. The film also had an excellent sound track to mix with the singing of the film. By far the best musical ever made because it's more than just a musical, it's a story as well. This film combines excellent direction and story progression along with astonishing camera and lighting techniques, great acting and dancing, choreography and music to combine and create an outstanding musical film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very definition of escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A musical that all others will forever aspire to, Singin' In The Rain unequivocally holds the soubriquet 'classic'. It's at once an irresistible romance, a gently satirical history of the motion picture and a spectacular song-and-dance show. It also manages to paint a picture of ideal Americans but with a paint dipped in that peculiarly wistful dye of the American experience.There is, perhaps, no better distillation of what is to come than the first shot of Gene Kelly. Dressed from head to toe in white and with Jean Hagen similarly costumed, his megawatt smile shines brighter still. Throughout the film characters and situations burst and blaze with life and fun, unconfined by the screen. Donald O'Connor matches Kelly tap for tap and Debbie Reynolds pulls off the much-emulated trick of playing the girl-next-door in the body of a Hollywood star.In the sensory offensive it's possible to overlook some remarkable, adventurous shots and sequences. For example, the 'modern' sequence, substituted for Kelly's description to the studio boss is more than just an interpolated Broadway number. It risks a proto-ballet dream-in-dream pas-de-deux (with the now-equally-immortal Cyd Charisse) and a great crane-dollied zoom in and then out, the latter with Kelly overlaid in foreground. Perhaps Stanley Donen was inspired by the motion-picture experimentation theme of the film itself.It would be nice to be able to draw some sort of conclusion about the timing of the film: a conscious postwar feel good, or perhaps some sort of agitprop surrounding nuclear armament ("surely the principals decked out in rain/lab-coats are smiling through a wet metaphor for nuclear fallout?"). No, I think that if there is a threat responsible for the film's inception it must simply be that of the dull Sunday afternoon which will forevermore be lit up and enlivened by this wonderful film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a trip to Europe, now it's a return to America and the cradle of filmmaking: Hollywood. Usually, I'am not fond of this kind of story (a movie about movies, a TV show about TV, a book about an author) because it's a blow to imagination. Instead of creativity, originality, the camera shoots what happens in front of it so it's not very interesting.Except this movie shows a pivotal moment in the golden age of Hollywood, when sound appears with the pictures so mute movies turn into "talkies". I am surprised that the first reactions were to despise this technology and above all that mute "stars" could have such silly voices or unable to act. The premiere of this new kind of movie is really funny.Another good thing about this movie is that all the songs have subtitles. But, the best thing remains Gene Kelly. Change him for another actor and the magic is gone. It's true that is an affirmation of life because we can share a glorious feeling in the rain whereas it's usually a unhappy moment to be under.In memoriam of my grandmother (1911-2010) who died this day of watching.</fullReview>

But the dancing was divine (I especially liked the interlude with the lovely Cyd Charisse). What really made this flick for me was Donald O'Connor. He was amazing. His goofy expressions, his lightning fast quips, and his own impressive dancing skills were marvelous. Debbie Reynolds was okay, but Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont was a splendid scream. The movie had me laughing out loud often, and I was held rapt by the dancing. The songs were delightful (I know I'm saying that word too much, but it fits), and it was great fun all around to watch.

		<fullReview>Singin' In the Rain sounds like a boring old musical that is an awful film like The Sound Of Music (which was sh*t by the way) and I had been led up to believing this until the age of twelve. I wasn't too keen on watching a couple of old fools singing and dancing throughout the whole film because the idea did not excite or interest me in anyway. The song Singin' In The Rain has been used in a lot of animations and films, particularly in television, because it has quite catchy lyrics and that classic lamp post dance. When I borrowed this film from a local library for a three week loan, I didn't get to watch it until the 20th day and by then I still didn't want to watch it. This film maybe my worst prediction in excitement in a film. The film had me hooked from start to finish and I consider this the greatest musical ever made because it has music, drama, action, laughs, thrills, and a sense of mystery. The acting from Gene Kelly (Don Lockwood) and Donald O'Connor (Cosmo Brown) made acting for what it is now and I am proud to say that. They both were amazing and funny, especially Donald O'Connnor. Debbie Reynolds (Kathy Seldon)was the best female actress in the film. Jean Hagen (Lina Lamont) was terrible because her voice is too scream-like and her acting is dumb even though it's meant to be like that. It is very hard to like her! There was one problem which stopped me from giving this film a perfect ten and that is that the film does not have as much singing as I would have liked. There was too less music but the songs were beautifully written and sung. Since the film did not have too much music it did make way for more non-music time and that's is a great combination of skill.In 1927, the former stunt Don Lockwood becomes a successful actor with the company of his best friend Cosmo Brown forming a romantic pair with the actress Lina Lamont. In the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures, Don accidentally meets the aspirant actress Kathy Selden while escaping from his fans and fall in love for her. Lina has troubles with the sharp tune of her voice, and Cosmo and Don decides to dub her, using Kathy's voice, to save their movie. When the jealous Lina finds the strategy of the studio, she does not want to share the credits with Kathy and tries to force the studio to use Kathy in the shadow to dub her in other productions. But when Lina decides to speech and sing to the audience, the truth arises.The film will with a doubt amaze old music lovers and just MIGHT make the kids sing "What a glorious feelin...." because it surely had me doing just that. My dad smacked me because I sang it out loud in the middle of the night. The neighbors had some complaints as well. I cannot stress how far this movie is a masterpiece and how it should be watched by audiences old and young alike. Do not miss out on something that you rarely see now a days. I guarantee you, it will have some sort of impact on you. MIGHT! 9-10 - NEAR PERFECT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Singing, Dancing Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is set in a time where silent films are being converted to talkies. And the trouble lies in the fact that the successful duo, Lamont and Lakewood, have a woman (Jean Hagen) whose voice is more or less awful. How can they continue to be successful and open their mouths? I had some concerns with this film. Gene Kelly gets all the credit, but his little buddy is clearly the better dancer, especially during his long comedy scene. Sure, Kelly has more talking time, but the other guy gets the short end of the stick (so much so that I cannot even recall his name). Also, Lena's voice is made out to be bad, but it really wasn't that awful. Judy Holliday has roughly the same voice in "Born Yesterday" and no one complains. I'm not sure why this is called "Singin' in the Rain", as that's just one scene... it could just as easily have been called "The Dueling Cavalier". Oh well.The humor of converting silents to talkies is pretty great, more or less the highlight of the film. The strategic use of hidden microphones, and how the sound can get out of sync. The film as a whole is good and has some nice dance sequences if that's what you're into, but this part was really want made it memorable. This will go down as one of the greatest films in MGM history, and someday maybe it will get a retroactive "Best Picture" Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome musical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>15/10.My observations about this movie: Great dancing!!! My favorite the triple tap dance with Donald, Debbie and Gene: "Good Morning, Good Morning!", all dressed up in grays and light blues. I loved Debbie's blue high heeled tap shoes. They were just divine. This show-stopper was very powerful, lightning-fast-paced and highly energetic, and even done in the wee hours of that morning. When the three danced down the steps, and over the sofa, was totally awesome. The characters were deciding to turn "The Dueling Cavalier" into a musical.I love musicals, and I always stand up for them. This was one of the greatest. Singing and dancing are my favorites, as you know.I liked seeing Kathleen Freeman as the voice coach. The coach didn't quite succeed with the stubborn and air-headed Lina Lamont, however. We believe that Lina is really dumb, too, and Lina convinces us that education was never her cup of tea.Gene was great acting the cad movie heartthrob, even though a negative character. I don't like it when he played this side of the character, being all selfish, boastful and thinking he was God's gift to women. Even in "The Pirate", he plays a smarmy so-and-so who is too fresh for Judy Garland's sensibilities, and such a jerk there again.I better like Gene playing the wonderful human being, of course with a great set of tap dancing feet. Gene's "Singin' In the Rain" number in this movie is highly lauded, dancing around the lamppost and getting pneumonia during the filming, but it is my second favorite dance in the film after "Good Morning!" Other movies where I like Gene's characters are "On the Town" and "Take Me Out to the Ball Game".My third favorite "dance" is with Donald and the cloth dummy. Too bad Donald didn't get a romantic part in this movie, like he did in "Call Me Madam", when he is interested in the Princess Royal and dances with her (Vera-Ellen / I thought, "Miss Turnstiles"!!, from "On the Town"!!). In "Singin' In the Rain", in the scene where Donald dodges all the two-by-fours and workmen traveling, I feel that this is a marvel in choreography and adaptation to props in the way. The fake hallway on the wall is excellent, as is the wall where Donald jumps through.Debbie Reynolds was excellent. She was quite an energetic tap dancer, and a good singer.Finally, retrogressing to the beginning, I like the early part where Donald and Gene are children and then dance partners, musicians and singers in Vaudeville.15/10, actually, I repeat.</fullReview>

The movie is a classic and it's one of my three favorite musicals: Singing in the rain, West Side Story, and Sound of Music.There are some funny scenes that are so pure with no complications and can make you laugh long like for instance the one when Kelly and O'Connor make fun of the phonetics instructor and the scene when O'Connor sings make'm laugh. And of course, at the end when Lina Lamont is singing and doing that silly move with her hands. The movie is just one of the unforgettable classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That film is one of these classics we all know about but we most of us have never seen, in full or in parts. And that was my case. That film of 1952 looks back at the great shift in the cinema from silent movies to talkies and the drama it may have represented for some artists who could not adapt. This film adds to that some nasty aspects of that change, of silent films (and that has not really changed), how everything is artificial and nothing but a glossy appearance. Those actors and actresses love one another in so bizarre ways at times, and they have to cope with producers and directors. But the film is funny because so many elements are shown as ironical, humorous or just plain hilarious, not to mention some cruelty here and there. Then the plot is sentimental and even romantic with a complete rift between a fake mediatic love affair and another secret and deep love that is no affair at all but a passion. The film amplifies that rift by giving to the mediatic mistress the voice of a goat and her impossibility or rather unwillingness to train herself into some kind of drinkable vocal sound, drinkable for the audience. So the studio invents dubbing and the actress is dumb enough to want to speak to her audience who liked the voice on the screen so much. The shock is so hard that they require a song and then the dubbing has to be revealed and that is the end of a career that gets silent and mute because it should have stayed silent and mute, but vanity requires adulation and worship and then a voice has to be put on the nice face and it is the discovery of the lie, of the illusion and the public never takes it with a grain of salt when they discover they have been fooled. That film is famous for one song though it is a singing and dancing treat from beginning to end, an allusion to the career of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and some others, but with a touch of realism in the behavior of these Hollywood people. And that touch is the best fun of the film: vanity has no limits and vainer than I you die. A real treat of entertainment and an important page in the huge history book of the cinema.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the rain is a wonderful classic. Unlike The Music man, which is absolutely terrible. Sngin in the rain is funny, romantic, and sweet. It's one of those Sound of music type deals where everything about it is fantastic. Singin' in the rain is one of the greatest musicals ever. I have only seen one bad musical, and that was, well, The Music man. That film was stupid all the way through. I had little fun with that film. Actually, no fun. At least with films like Mamma Mia and Singin in the rain you can laugh and have fun. I didn't think that this was the best musical. But it was sure as hell on the top three. Probably the second. My favorite musical was Sweeney Todd though. I give Singin in the rain a huge thumbs up... it's a classic.Singin in the rain:****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lovely, great film, worth watching by just about anybody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was not my first film starring Gene Kelly, but it had a good light to it and I very much enjoyed it. :-) It has fantastic dancing from Gene Kelly and Donald O' Connor, an expected but lovely storyline, wonderful characters, good themes to the plot (such as the one of the main characters starting out as stunt men and struggling through the beginning of "talkie" films), memorable and likable songs and a shiny MGM quality no longer made in films. If there is one thing I am slightly negative about "Singin' in the Rain", it is that the horrible woman is so horrible and has a very irritating voice.In this film, we meet the film star Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and his (sort of) fiancée Lina Lamont. Trying to escape hordes of fans aware of his fame and desperate for an autograph, he finds himself in a woman stranger's (Debbie Reynolds) car. She is quite impertinent about the way he is behaving, partly because she does not watch films and does not realize Don Lockwood is famous. He tries to explain to her he is an "actor" and basically she replies, "I'm an actress, but I act on the stage." She tries as quickly as possible to deposit Don out of her car, who has already decided he is in love with her and not Lina. We meet his friend Cosmo Brown, who is very close to Don and for the characters mentioned above, there is later plenty to be dancing and singing about..!Highly recommended to whole families of people who like musicals, absolutely fantastic dancing, quite funny films and romance films. A real classic, enjoy "Singin' in the Rain"! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The question isn't whether this is the best musical ever, but whether it is the best film ever. Unlike most musicals, this one has a terrific story about Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies. Kelly, Reynolds, and O'Connor have great chemistry. Mitchell is marvelous as the studio head while Hagen's performance is a comic gem. Kelly and Donen are in peak form behind the camera. The musical highlights include "Make 'Em Laugh," "Good Morning," "All I Do is Dream of You," and "Moses." However, nothing ever put on celluloid can touch the jubilant glory of Kelly's romp in the rain to the title song. It is the most magical moment in the history of cinema. What a glorious feeling!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. The dance numbers were superb, and the actors were amazing. (Donald O'Connor is more than amazing, in my opinion)During the song, Make 'Em Laugh, Donald O'Connor is hit on the head by a board twice, fools around with a dummy (doll), and does a flip off a board. Some find it pointless and embarrassing. I find it amazing choreography and skill. Moses Supposes is a song that many people find crude and insulting, (due to the ending, when Cosmo/O'Connor and Don/Kelly dump all sorts of things over the teacher) Yes. I was slightly confused with the ending of that song, but when I thought about it, I realized that it was worth it. The talent that was required for that number...and for every number...I would HIGHLY recommend this film. There is humor, music, and...well...there's a reason it's one of the most remembered musicals of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is undoubtedly the greatest musical of all time. Forget all those rumours that Gene Kelly wasn't a very nice person, or that nearly all the songs weren't original, and that the "Make'm Laugh" number was blatant copy of another song, all that matters is that its brimming with jokes, a brilliant performance from Jean Hagen, and the best musical number of all time ("Singin' in the Rain"), wonderfully sung by Gene Kelly. The plot, which is better than most musicales, is about Hollywoods transition from silents too talkies and (of course) Gene Kelly's character, Don Lockwood, falling in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). An absolute must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing In The Rain (1952) would probably have to be one of the most enjoyable and family fun musicals of all time. With its elegant dress array's/costume designs and brilliant and vibrant colour schemes, Singing In the Rain really proved to live up to its reputation.Set in the late 1920's, Singing In The Rain follows a rather prominent yet 'Found-from-the-blue' actor, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) who has to put up with daily interruptions and distress brought on by his co-star in a rather ambiguous 'Movie Pair', Lina Lamount (Jean Hagen).Despite the obvious fact that is hard to just some up the whole 'experience' of this wonderful classic film and to prevent spoilers, one can only say; "This would have to be one of the greatest musicals of the modern age".A brilliant and enjoyable masterpiece which anyone would/should enjoy.Yours truly, Julian Allées 6th February, 2009</fullReview>

And this movie is one of the funniest movies ever to come out of Hollywood.Gene Kelly makes every dance scene look effortless and Donald O'Connor almost steals the show in every scene that he's in. But Jean O'Hangan as the bitchy but dumb Lina Lamont is the real star of this movie.By the way, the famous Singin' in the Rain sequence is magnificantly ripped off dance step for dance step in an episode of Padington Bear.

		<fullReview>Most people I think remember this film for the 'Singing in the Rain' sequence and rightly so. However there is so much more in the film. For example, the athleticism, exuberance, timing, inventiveness and shear fun of 'Make 'Em Laugh' should I feel, also be remembered in the same affectionate way as the title song. I reckon Donald O'Connor is a genius. His cartoon like antics in the song, betray the skill and poise needed for such a feat. He not only danced, acrobated and timed his way though it, he did it with joy too. It's a make you feel good film, full of escapism and during the dream sequence eroticism too? It's a great film that works today, just a mere 56 years after its release.</fullReview>

No, Singing in the rain is the movie that you find in the bottom your movie chest and say "hey, I have not seen this in a long time." Then you look at the clock and the next thing you know it is 2 in the morning and you still don't feel tired at all. It is without a doubt the most fun and the best musical ever made, bar none.

		<shortDescription>A fun and memorable musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is one of the most highly praised American films, regularly appearing in critics' top ten lists. It tells the story of a group of film-makers and stars circa 1927 making the awkward transition from silent to 'talkie' pictures.The film is basically a celebration of the well received MGM musicals that had appeared for about 25 years at that point. Almost all of the songs used in the film originated in earlier films. Actually, the story was built around the songs, which is evident in the sometimes tenuous associations given by the script.The cast is a good one but not outstanding in my mind. I thought that Jean Hagen (as Lina Lamont) fared the best. She received an Oscar nomination for her efforts. Gene Kelly's dancing is excellent but I'm not crazy about his singing voice and Debbie Reynolds, while cute as a button, is not quite as talented as the others in terms of singing or dancing.The story is interesting as it revisits the time of transition between silent and talking pictures, showing some of the difficulties encountered. On the other hand, I would have liked to have seen a little more imagination go into the romantic subplot. On the whole, though, the story is joyous and satisfying.Certainly the high point of the film is the technical aspect. The co-direction by Gene Kelly &amp; Stanley Donen is assured and provides us with several memorable moments. The "Broadway Melody Ballet" portion of the film is particularly ambitious and breath-taking, while Gene Kelly's rendition of "Singin' in the Rain" is legendary. Too bad that the film is full frame, though; a film with this kind of scope practically begs for a widescreen presentation.In conclusion, I think that this is a good film but not quite as good as the critics would have you believe. Definitely a fun film, though, and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Musical of All-Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is a true classic that is by far the finest movie musical to ever be released.The story of Singin' in the Rain takes place back in the late 1920s, just a few years before the Great Depression. The story is set in the Golden Age of Hollywood, and follows Don Lockwood, a highly famous silent film actor. At this time in Hollywood movies have begun making the change to talking pictures, and just like everyone else Don is having to make the change to making pictures with sound; of course his career is put into jeopardy when everyone finally takes notice that Don's romantic co-star for years, Lina Lamont, has a voice that is like nails on a chalk board. Don is in real trouble, and in a move to try and save his career he comes up with the idea to turn his and Lina's next film into a musical, and Don's friend Cosmo Brown convinces Don to dub over Lina's voice with that of Don's girlfriend, Kathy Selden.Singin' in the Rain is just genuinely one of the most positive films in movie history, there is no way you can come away from this film without a smile on your face. The musical numbers are perfectly staged, ranging from the awe inspiring Broadway Melody to the title song Singin' in the Rain. Of course what keeps driving the film and allows it to transcend generations is the romance between Don and Kathy, which is one of the most heartwarming relationships I have ever seen in the history of film, but what truly allows the romance to come off so well is the terrific acting by Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds, which brings to mind another strong point of the film, the acting. The acting is superb, ranging from the great Gene Kelly as Don, or the hilarious Donald O'Conner as Cosmo Brown, the cast is very well rounded and helps keep the film moving at a terrific pace and allows you to truly grow an attachment to these characters.This is just truly a terrific film, which is not just the best movie musical ever made, but just might possibly be one of the greatest romantic comedies as well.I give Singin' in the Rain a terrific 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie ... Needs to be seen on a big screen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this on small TV is hard; I tried many times but was distracted away by other programs. However, when I saw it on a large screen with a group of people ... wow! It was pretty awesome. Suddenly what seemed like a corny old musical for a different generation became lively, engrossing, fun and kind of magical.The overall story is about a film studio in 1927 that is in trouble because their big new film, their first "talkie" (sound) movie, sounds terrible. Their biggest problem is that the star actress (from silent pictures) has a voice that's pretty painful to hear. However, they find an innovative way to solve the problem ... but it's not without its own problems! At the heart of the movie is a romance between the studio's lead actor (Gene Kelly) and a new actress (Debbie Reynolds). It's complicated by quite a few things, but like the rest of the film, it's lighthearted and funny. I'm not really a fan of musicals or dance movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed both in this movie. The music is tuneful and is kind of a substitute for talking and self-expression; it's not done just to insert singing.As for the dancing ... well, I never appreciated Gene Kelly's remarkable physical prowess until I saw this movie. As mentioned earlier, one really should see this movie on a large screen to appreciate how intense his and his sidekick (the character Cosmo) physical movements are. Their dancing was spectacular and fun to watch. Like the singing, it was also nicely integrated into the movie.This movie was a lot of fun to watch and should appeal to just about everyone. If you're in the mood for an innocent, fun, romantic comedy with lots of music ... and can get yourself past any stereotypes you might have about this film ... you'll be richly reward with a great experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw some comments in this website saying it is overrated. It is not overrated. It gets what it really deserves.This movie shows the conversion of Hollywood movies from the 'silent' to 'talkies' in a humorous and enjoyable way. Starring Debbie Reynolds as a dancer, Donald O' Connor as a music supervisor in movies, Gene Kelly as a silent movie star and the scene-stealer, Jean Hagen as the funny-voiced actress, gives life to this rather great movie.The movie's story is just simple but what it makes great is the performances. Gene Kelly was perfect for the role. Donald O' Connor was funny, Debbie Reynolds is charming but Jean Hagen is the most memorable. She was just hilarious. The musical numbers are the best musical numbers ever filmed. Songs here like the titular song, Good Morning, Make 'Em Laugh and others gave life to this wonderful movie. The tap dance were used greatly.Over-all, this movie is a great experience. I would definitely give it 10/10. I wouldn't be surprised if it will be one of the most favorite films of all times.Again, it is not overrated.</fullReview>

The movies soundtrack is like a songbook and every song has had great influence on other musicals which followed after that. Also they have been very important for jazz, for many songs are used as jazz-standards. I think that the idea how the silent movies developed in to a "talking picture" is great and it gives the viewer an idea of the reaction of the former audience on the innovation of talking movies.Further on, i think the dancing, the choreography and the singing are just fantastic and Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor do a marvelous job. I can just recommend this movie to you and your family for it is even interesting for the new generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Masterpiece of the musical genre, complete with hilarious slapstick silliness, a sweet romance, dazzling song and dance numbers, and amazing acrobatics.This is one of those movie where Hollywood laughs at itself; a nostalgic glance at the dawn of the "talkies," in the late '20's. That innovation turned the film industry up-side-down, as studios hastily but ineptly scrambled to give audiences a taste of this new cinematic toy. Some of the funniest bits are when actors, with bulky mics stuffed in their clothes make loud brushing noises as they embrace, or the sound goes in and out, or you can literally hear the actor's heart beating! They also had no idea how to script dialog, and the resulting overdone melodramatic corn is hilarious too. "Yes! Yes! Yes! No! No! No! I love you! I love you! I love you!" Delightfully idiotic nonsense. Also some actors' careers disappeared, because they had bizarre voices or accents. This is represented by Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who makes a hilarious, nasal-voiced villainous.Classic routines by Donald O'Connor (Make 'em Laugh), and Gene Kelly (Singin' in the Rain), plus wonderful singing by Debbie Reynolds, and you have one of, if not the best, musical ever made. My only nitpicking objection is the "Broadway Melody" routine goes on too long, and seems disconnected from the rest of the movie--perhaps included only to give Kelly an extra opportunity to dance.That minor excess aside, this movie remains one of the fun movies to recite lines from and to watch and enjoy again and again.</fullReview>

By the end of the movie, you will be singing along.The movie begins with the silent era coming to an end. The main star, Don Lockwood, is at his movie premiere and from there on out the musical sensation begins. The movie is definitely top notch in choreography, music, and pays a lot of homage to the early musical directors of the 1930s. A lot of the different camera techniques, as the overview head, were taken from the early directors. Also a lot of the characters in the movie are based on a real life counterpart. The Gene Kelley scene were he lays out his most famous 3 minutes in history is definitely memorable. The fact that supporting actor Cosmo brings comic relief to this movie will be a warm hearted affair for all. My deaf aunt even enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot in a nutshell - The roaring 20s are coming to an end, and with it is the end of the silent era of film, for a new form of film entertainment is at hand: the talking picture, inspired by the success of "The Jazz Singer". Just as silent screen stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are about to make a new film "The Cavalier", Don - who with each passing film is growing ever more weary of the ego-maniacal and delusional Lina - meets sweet virginal ingénue Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds, AKA: Princess Leia's Mom), who aspires to be an actress in her own right. Don meets Kathy while running away from his adoring fans and hitches a ride with her en route to a post-party premiere while she's en route to work. Secretly a fan of his films but wishing not to appear to be a gushing fan girl, Kathy claims to be a stage actress and comments that she doesn't find film work to be all that professional or dignified as there is no sound or words, merely melodramatic gestures, which Don, who worked his way up long and hard from humble beginnings with his sardonic childhood piano playing friend Cosmo (Don O'Connor), finds insulting. Kathy is later humiliated when Don finds out that she's actually working as a song &amp; dance girl at the very Grove where his party is being held, where she makes her grand entrance from a giant fake cake, her embarrassment fueling Don's smug amusement. When Don starts grilling Kathy about her "profession", she tries to hit him with a pie, but ends up hitting his obnoxious screen partner Lina instead, which costs Kathy her job when Lina complains about it to the management. Don's frustration is pushed to critical mass by this, and finds he can't stop thinking about Kathy, feeling both guilty about her misfortune and his own confidence undermined by her words. Don later finds Kathy working as an extra for a musical number for another project at the studio where he works, Kathy's true fan girl colors are exposed, but in old school Hollywood fashion, Don &amp; Kathy fall in love.Following this, Don's new film, "The Cavalier" is besieged with problems as the studio tries to convert it into a sound picture (many of them taken from real life problems encountered during the sound conversion). When the film is given its initial test screening, the film is booed and mocked, as the audience beholds the now hammy, melodramatic acting of Don and Lina as well as Lina's glass shattering squeak of a voice. This serves as a blow to Don's pride and he figures that Kathy was right before, that he never was an actor, just a show-boater. Kathy and Cosmo encourage Don not to give up and, recognizing his skill with song and dance, suggest turning "The Cavalier" into a musical, with Kathy dubbing Lina's speaking &amp; singing voice. Lina eventually finds out and is none too pleased, and tries to ruin both Don's relationship with Kathy and Kathy's career, with Lina wisely utilizing her contract to manipulate the studio head R.F. Simpson and insisting that Kathy be uncredited her for work while continuing to be her uncredited "voice" otherwise, Lina could sue the studio for contract violations. The newly musicalized film, reworked to have the hero fantasizing he's in the old time instead of being there, opens to be a rousing success, and Kathy &amp; Don find out about Lina's wicked deed just after the film ends. Kathy is devastated, but just when all hope appears to be lost, Lina's ego gets the better of her as she makes her own speech for the first time, which confuses the audience as to how Lina could have such a beautiful voice on screen but a squeaky voice in person. Lina then insists that Kathy sing behind the scene to her lip sync, which Don encourages, annoying a disheartened Kathy who tries to disown him, but then, just as the sing/sync gets underway, Don, Cosmo and RF gleefully pull the curtain up, exposing the deception. Lina is finished, Kathy is now on top, and Kathy &amp; Don live happily ever after.A bit long winded but still an engagingly bright musical comedy in the old school Hollywood musical tradition. Debbie Reynolds is adorable as the golden hearted Kathy. Don't miss the title song number.</fullReview>

There's nothing better than "Good Mornin'," "Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Supposes," and the title song. However, I always fast forward through the Cyd Charisse number. Why? Because IT DOES NOT BELONG IN THIS FILM. It ruins the flow of the story. How can such a masterpiece become so compromised? Did the writers/composers/directors take a week off? I just don't get it. Anyway, it remains my all-time favorite, even with this flaw, because nothing I've seen is even a close second. And it wins over my little cynical eighth graders' hearts every time I show it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a must-see for any movie fan. It is a classic that will never be duplicated by today's "talent" - the dancing is fantastic and the songs are now standards. The proof is that you see some of this stuff placed in TV commercials today, although the GE baby elephant can't touch Gene Kelly! Debbie Reynolds is young and active and the number with the three of them ("Good Morning!") is near perfect. I can't guess how many "takes" some of these numbers took, but they are amazing in their timing and difficulty. Gene Kelly's "dancing in the rain" scene comes across as realistic, yet is surreal in that logic tells you it can't be done that way. Great ensemble cast with the plot being subservient to the musical numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It Is without peer, the greatest musical ever filmed. There is no "Number 2". Watching it many times, does not diminish it charm.Impossible to be in anything but a good mood after watching " Good Mornin'" dance and song. It is a perfect film.No musical since this even comes close to the charm, of a simple tight plot, with dancing and singing, by extraordinary talents like Kelly and O'Connor. The spoof of the John Barrymore era, whose career ended with " talkies" and booze, is delightful.The signature scene, Kelly singing the title song, is forever emblazoned in anybody's memory that sees it , even once. O'Connors "Be a Clown" does things in a couple of takes, that would take lesser artists many many edits and cuts. Seeing is believing.The best. I rest my case.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is a bit silly, but it's funny. I remember a diction coach in college, working with beautiful young women, to try to get them to pronounce the simplest words. This story revolves around this issue. It takes this simple plot and then explodes. Wonderful production numbers. Wonderful characters. Wonderful songs. Each one delivered in an imaginative way with incredible charm. The title tune is a part of Americana with Gene Kelley stomping through the gutters in on of the most incredibly choreographed moments ever. Also, the "Good Mornin'" song is great. I could go on, but this is one of those movies that you can turn on any time and wait. It doesn't even matter if you see the rest of the movie. Each number can stand on it's own, but, more importantly, it progresses the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With countless catchy tunes, glorious Technicolor, fun, creative dancing, wonderful costumes, fantastic storyline, it is hard not to love this classic, fun movie! This is a wonderful way to escape reality and dive into the magical world of movies. Singin' in the Rain is essentially about the history-changing transition from silent movies to sound - something the movie bosses said wouldn't last! Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a very popular silent actor. He has a fake relationship with Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) for publicity purposes. When the Hollywood is struck with sound, there is a problem.... and Don puts his career on the rocks when he falls in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). In conclusion, Singin' in the Rain is the best musical I have seen. Dancing, singing, laughing... everything in one. The best musical ever made.</fullReview>

Just watch his face especially after "Good Morning" when Kathy kisses him. His face is priceless. Gene Kelly is definitely the man and is simply irresistible. Debbie Reynolds is also amazing! She is just such a captivating person. Put the three of them together and you have the perfect movie trio.

		<shortDescription>Great to Sing in the Rain ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly, the best musical ever made did not win the Golden Globe Award of 1952 for best musical or comedy. That honor went to "With A Song in My Heart," a musical drama based on the life of singer Jane Froman.Nevertheless, "Singin' in the Rain" deals with the advent of talking pictures and its ramifications on the silent stars of that time. We know that actor John Gilbert, a matinée idol of the silents, had his career ruined when talkies came in.Such shall be the fate of Lena LaMonte, hilariously played by the late Jean Hagen in a well-deserved performance which landed her a best supporting actress nomination.Our hero, Gene Kelly, plays opposite. Lena. To say that he despises her is to put it mildly. Gene really loves Debbie Reynolds who he meets in a very funny scene in this film.Donald O'Connor shines in this film. His rendition of "Make Me Laugh," while he literally walks on walls is memorable and terrific. The guy was a real class act.The problem is what to do with Lena? Her scratchy voice reminded me so much of Judy Holliday in her award winning "Born Yesterday." The scene where it is shown that Debbie has been singing for Lena is a riot. Humiliated, Lena runs off stage; hopefully, never to be heard from again. Let's make sure that this movie is always heard from again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain sets the standard for musicals because it really owns what it is. Other musicals take themselves too seriously and make the musical number seem out of place. Others are too nonsensical and lose the audiences attention. Singin' in the Rain is perfectly balanced. The acting performances are great. Characters meant to be loved are lovable and those meant to be hated are despicable. The musical talent these actors possess is impressive as well. The choreography is wonderful and the singing is amazing. However some songs do go on too long and lose some of their splendor. This does not happen often though. There is also too little character development between the lead actor and actress making their romance a bit unbelievable. But that is forgiven because the nature of the film is meant to be jolly. This would be my number one recommendation to anyone who has never seen a musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Singin' in the Rain, I found a new favorite musical. This movie was very entertaining and kept my attention the entire time, I couldn't look away. Gene Kelly played his role exceptionally well as well as Debby Reynolds. Many of the songs I have heard before but never knew they were from this movie. Most of the songs are known by many people that have and have not seen the movie. The filming and editing in this movie is very good. Director's, Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, used technicolor in the film and it worked. Scenes and settings were extremely colorful. One part that I did not like was the random, uncalled for, and kind of off topic scene that lasted too long toward the end of the movie. Without this scene, I look at this movie as fantastic and I highly recommend it to be watched more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, before watching this film I never really cared for musicals. I just thought that musicals were bland stories where the characters would just go and start singing terrible songs every five minutes. But with Singin' in The Rain there was something different about it. The songs that were sung in this film were enjoyable to listen to. Each one had a certain characteristic to it that fit each scene well. And the colors in this film all look amazing. They're so vivid that your eyes will always be focused on the scene. And I must say the one scene where they are thinking of ideas with the studio president is without a doubt the best part of the movie. It does drag on for longer then it needs to be but nonetheless it was still enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

Is something that goes on in Hollywood pop culture today the movie practically predicts future Hollywood. I love how this movie doesn't take itself to seriously its just a good time from beginning to end. The dancing in this movie is awesome Gene Kelly really seems like a maverick when it comes to dancing. The camera is also cool I like how it shows how grotesque close up shots can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The year is 1927 and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the hottest couple on silent film.However, the industry is changing and with the arrival and success of the world's first talking picture,'The Jazz Singer' the studio must step up their game in order to compete.There is just one problem; while Lina was blessed with Hollywood starlet looks, her voice sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Oh, and she and Don can't stand each other. Their romance is all for show, but only Don seems to know it.Instead, he is in love with Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an aspiring actress he meets one night while he is being chased by adoring fans.When Don and Lina's first talking picture 'The Dueling Cavelier' bombs at a test screening, Don enlists the help of Kathy and his best friend, Cosmo (Donald O' Connor) to save his career.They come up with a plan to turn the movie into a musical, using Kathy's voice dubbed over Lina's. But when Lina finds out she takes revenge by insisting that Kathy keeps dubbing her voice in future movies, putting Kathy's own career in jeopardy.I'm not even exaggerating when I say the amount of energy everyone, especially Gene Kelly and Donald O' Connor, emit during their performances in this movie is immense and it's exhilarating to watch.When filming the sequence for the movie's title song where Don reflects on how happy his blossoming romance with Kathy makes him, Gene was giving it his all despite suffering with a fever at the time.My personal favourite song numbers include Donald O' Connor singing 'Make 'em Laugh' where Cosmo impresses upon Don the correlation of humour and success in Hollywood, and the ballet number during the Broadway Melody sequence.Is there any point talking about the direction or cinematography? Not really; though the cinematography during the ballet sequence and the scene where Don sings 'You were Meant for Me' to Kathy is especially beautiful, it's all pretty much perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Through the years I have heard many great things about this musical SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. One day I had the chance to watch it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies). Going into the film my expectations were set very high, and surprisingly this film met those expectations.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is one of those films that will brighten up your day! Set in Hollywood in the late 1920s, a time when the silent film era was coming to an end, a film production company makes the transition to "talkies." This film is full of laughter, music and romance. With its many memorable songs like "Make 'em Laugh," "Good Morning," and the most iconic "Singin' in the Rain," I was humming along and tapping my feet. The musical numbers are fun and catchy, I am sure they will be stuck in you head. Starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen, you will surely be entertained throughout the film.Overall, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN makes you want to really sing (and dance) in the rain. With memorable songs and a great cast, this film will entertain audiences for generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd-pleasing charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder it has been universally acclaimed as the apotheosis of Hollywood musical in the golden era, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN conjures up an enticing historical premise of the significant sea change in the film industry, with THE JAZZ SINGER (1927), the dawn of talkie which would forever change this scope of the burgeoning media.Set in 1927, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are Monument Pictures' golden couple on screen in the silent films, yet in private Don despises the ditsy and talentless Lina, whose diva temperament and funny sheep voice is the studio's best kept secret. Don, on the contrary, starts his career in showbiz as a vaudeville artist and stuntman with his fellow Cosmo Brown (O'Connor), so his bent of singing and dancing well-tested. One day, running away from crazed fans, Daon hops on the car of a young girl Kathy Selden (Reynolds), who quite pertly disses the superficiality of his acting and stardom, it strikes a chord to Don, who begins to question his own capability.However, it turns out Kathy is a struggling starlet, with a doll-like cuteness and a voice can sing. Don falls for her instantly, but does she love him back? Of course she does, it is a musical comedy, no one can resist a superstar's charm. After THE JAZZ SINGER becomes a sensational hit, all the studios begin to tread its footsteps, so Don-and-Lina's next picture will be their first talkie, named THE DUELLING CAVALIER, talking is a cinch for Don, but the soft underbelly is Lina's cockamamie voice, a disastrous test screening forebodes this talkie would be the Waterloo for Don-and-Lina trademark. Six weeks before its official release, Don and Cosmo creatively advice to change the picture into a singing-and-dancing musical, renamed THE DANCING CAVALIER and asks Kathy to dub Lina, the last-minute plan saves the day, except for Lina's prestigious career as an actress.Stretching from the titular song, the script cunningly grafts a cheery romance upon the nostalgia to a bygone silent era, from the opening flashbacks trace back Don and Cosmo's slapstick entertainment (also brilliantly contrasts Don and Lina's lovey-dovey public images and their personal incompatibility), until the long and elaborate set piece named Broadway MELODY BALLET, freshly revamps several music numbers from THE Broadway MELODY (1929) and Broadway MELODY OF 1936 (1935) as a fetching homage, which is not germane to the main narrative, but introduces dancer-turns-actress Cyd Charisse's vampiric moll to the limelight.Kelly, the co-director and the leading star of the project, is swooningly deft in the iconic solo titular piece, and admirably, he also magnanimously leaves the stage for his co-stars to shine, O'Connor's MAKE 'EM LAUGH is la cr?me de la cr?me, his effortless agility makes the dangerous antics look ever so easy and winsome. Although billed as the female lead, Reynolds is less a spectacle especially lined up with Hagen, who is the only one in the cast nominated for an Oscar (the film's unjust snub by the Academy is another big scandal mars the award's credibility), fakes her comical tone and upstages everyone else with sheer deadpan amusement.SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a tested classic, a first-rate choreographic marvel, a less refined character development nevertheless, one can hardly resist its old-fashioned flair and crowd- pleasing charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Musical, But Not The Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't normally expect greatness from a huge meta-film like this one; a movie about making movies seems self-indulgent. However, this film is not full of itself with the fact that it is about movies - it even addresses problems that sound provided in the early years of sound's use in the motion pictures. It seems that this reflection on cinema's early days of sound may be the reason it is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, though I disagree with this idea. While this is considered the greatest musical film of all time, I'd have to say Yankee Doodle Dandy definitely tops this one.What is great about the story of this musical is it is easy enough for anybody to follow, which makes me think that this might be one of the first movies I show my children if I ever have any. The antagonist - Lina Lamont - isn't evil enough to crush a child's innocence, but a child would understand to dislike her while laughing at her ridiculous voice, making her not so ruthless of a villain.This film has an interesting take on many aspects of Hollywood. It doesn't state whether or not we should consider film to be a high art since there is much commentary (especially at the beginning) on theatrical actors giving more input into their performances than silly faces projected on a screen. Also, the various numbers in the film are filmed with long takes, making it seem more like a theatrical musical than a film (with exceptions to the incredibly- filmed sequences "Beautiful Girls" and "Broadway Melody"). Since it is hard to tell where the theater ends and the film begins, the film doesn't give one specific stance of film as an art but rather different points of view on the matter. I suppose this may be why the film is considered to be among the greatest movies ever, but as I have said in past reviews, ambiguity does not necessarily mean greatness. It has to be pulled off right in my opinion. I am not saying the movie is less than good, it is great! But is it really this masterpiece everybody says it is? It is a formulaic musical where the central couple ends up together at the conclusion as expected by the audience. Yes it has entertaining numbers such as "Make 'Em Laugh," but do such numbers make this a masterpiece? This is a great film to watch with highly entertaining moments, but a self-indulgent film shouldn't automatically dictate greatness - stories about more "everyday" situations are much more powerful. Not all of us know the Hollywood life.3.5/4.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What a glorious feeling I'm happy again!" That's the feeling I got watching this again on DVD-after 30 years of last seeing it. Gene Kelly's title number is sublime and deserves it's iconic status. Donald O'Connor deserves his place in film musical history by his "Make 'Em Laugh" number alone. (Never mind that the song is a partial steal from Cole Porter's "Be a Clown".) Young Debbie Reynolds does well with such polished hoofers. Jean Hagen is hilarious as the vain and egotistical movie star. The songs by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed, who's also the producer, are entertainingly performed. And the direction by Kelly and Stanley Donen is just perfect not to mention the original screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green! Nothing more to say except, Singin' in the Rain is indeed perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made! P.S. Great commentary on the track of the DVD in which Ms. Reynolds intros various members of cast and crew and others making their comments. Oh, and it's a shame it was only nominated for two Oscars-none for Best Picture: Ms. Hagen for Best Supporting Actress and Lennie Hayton for Scoring of a Musical Picture. At least Donald O'Connor got a Golden Globe for it. The eventual winner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards for 1952 was The Greatest Show on Earth which I'm reviewing next...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will be spoilers ahead:This film has rightly become a classic, proving that the Academy Awards are quite fallible. A good case can be made that this was more deserving of a nomination for Picture than three of the five films nominated-including the eventual winner, The Greatest Show on Earth. That Jean Hagen lost out to Gloria Grahame can be chalked up to the fact that Grahame had three prominent supporting roles that year and won for the most dramatic of them in The Bad and the Beautiful. Hagen's turn was, in my opinion, the best of the year. Oh well.This film is so well known that I doubt I need to discuss the plot much, so I'll give a brief outline. A silent film star and his leading lady have their careers jeopardized by the advent of sound and the reality that her voice isn't ready for prime time and would sink them and probably the studio. He cannot stand her, while she's convinced she's God's gift to the world. His love interest dubs her voice for the star's in order to save everyone.Sounds clichéd and dull. Without the songs and the performances, it would have been forgettable. But Gene Kelly as the star, Debbie Reynolds as his love, Donald O'Connor as his best friend and collaborator and the incomparable Hagen as Lina Lamont, horrid voice and all, as the iceberg to the studio's Titanic, elevate the story and make the film magnificently fun! Hagen steals every scene she's in. Lina is crass, vulgar, crude, obnoxious, arrogant, vain, self-centered, mean and dumb-and those are her good points. Watch for Rita Moreno in a small role as Zelda, Lina's friend.Cyd Charisse has a significant dancing role in one of the major musical numbers and O'Connor has the funniest musical number in the film, with "Make 'Em Laugh". But the film belongs to Kelly and Reynolds, who shine in their leading roles. There's a chemistry between them which makes the whole movie believable.This film is available on DVD and Blu-Ray and is worth watching. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the rain can be considered one of the first musicals released from a major Hollywood production company. Not only does Gene Kelly star in the film, but he also was one of the directors of the film, something that we as Americans see a lot nowadays with films, but was relatively rare back in the 50's. Due to scenes that included rain drops, and the ability for the camera to pick up the raindrops on film, this film is an excellent use of back-light lighting to get the desired effect.Another reason why everyone should at least watch this film, is because it is apart of the Nation Film Registry due to the fact that it is deemed culturally significant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Appreciated the look at movie history, especially the use of sound even when the industry wasn't quite ready for it. The passion for movie making and affection for silent film can be seen in the funny film clips within the film. The transition from silent to talking film was tough. It's sad, real, and funny when the director (film within the film) tries to get the performer to talk into the microphone. Best scene was seeing and hearing the film from the director's point of view; he struggled with new technology and we all can relate to that. Perhaps an editing weakness is that some dancing shots are too long and a few too short. Finally, with awe, wow, that's dancing at its very best, and they make it look fun.</fullReview>

Most people my age wouldn't agree, but musicals can be interesting, and this movie is great evidence. Also, a lot of editing and mechanics went into this movie. A lot of special effects were added, but it made it that much more fun to watch. Not many dull moments in this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain - 5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" has provided me with probably the most joyful cinematic experience so far in my life. The movie functions entirely on happy juice. Some movie characters can light up a room; the main cast in "Singin' in the Rain" can light up the whole darn street. Many profound critics, like Roger Ebert and Pauline Kael, has declared it as the best Hollywood musical ever made. No wonder.Great movies have a way of beating time. Their original audience is replaced by a new generation, but the positive reception stays the same. Curiously, "Singin' in the Rain" earned more praise as it got older. Though a success at the box office upon its release in 1952, people were late to give the praise it really deserved. It seemed that the increasing admiration continued with the following generations. And as I saw the film for the first time only a few nights ago, I was struck and stuck in a state of awe. It's been a long, long while since Hollywood has made a musical like this one, hasn't it?"Singin' in the Rain" is a marvelous movie for many reasons, but watching it at this point in time highlights some things about it that has become a rarity in today's movies, making these things all the more treasured. Consider, for instance, its attention to a sense of movement. The sets are simple and the props are few, but one can tell that the makers of "Singin' in the Rain" have spent a whole lot of time and training to the people and their performances. And these performances were about feelings and passion and about the art of performance itself. Most musicals today, and other genres too, have learned to place too much dependence on money, for the sake of money. The recent excess of 3- D movies may prove a point.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/singin-in-the-rain-movie- review-2/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great classical musical movie. The singing and dancing is just incredible. The dance numbers are intense and beautifully done that I just have to give a huge applause to the whole cast. A lot of musicals end up being really corny and in a way this one was corny but in a good way. It was executed extremely well that everything just flowed in a way that pulled the viewer in and made them want to see what happened next. Another thing that really helped make the movie was the chemistry between all of the characters. It was very believable how feelings were betrayed between each of the characters and how it changed through out the movie. The movie also did a great job in representing the shift from silent films and "talkies" and how some actors/ actresses had a hard time shifting. Over all definitely one of the best musicals ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not in to musicals. Never have been, most likely never will be. The only musical film I semi-enjoyed was Moulin Rouge. As for Singin' in the Rain, It's okay. I expected more from such a highly revered film. It is about 30 minutes of plot (an extremely weak one, at that) stretched out far past it's limits. It seems as though the plot was just a feeble device to string together a bunch of dance sequences - dance sequences that repeat the same moves over and over. Impressive, but repetitive. This movie is all show. I think Hollywood overestimates how interested people are in movies about music, or even movies about Hollywood. Maybe it was wrong for me to hope for anything deeper than surface-level gloss. But I did. And I was pretty disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooray a musical about a Musical =/</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my own opinion if you want to make a musical about a musical you better be Mel Brooks. "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) is by no means a bad movie and the dancing and comedic feats of Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown are sure to delight anyone, but the this musical movie is about the making of musical movies and at times seems to trade of substance to add an extra dance number. If you love Musicals by all means this is the film for you, but if your like me and your indifferent about them I'd steer clear of this one. To me a good musical will incorporate the song/dance number into the actually plot, "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) often fails to do this. Now the scene where Don Lockwood and Kathy Selden finally meet up again and have a romantic duet in a studio on a Hollywood lot the film does a great job of incorporating the song into the plot. An example of where the movie fails to do this is during the number "Moses Supposes" where Don and Cosmo are at a professor of linguistics office and break out into this goofy little number for pure entertainment. Now I don't mind a funny goofy musical scene but at least make it matter!!! If you love musicals and have some time to waste then by all means enjoy the film; if not please look elsewhere because "Singin' in the Rain" is not for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic film, yet flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost sacrilegious to find fault with a classic film, one on most top 10 lists of great all-time films, but I continue to wonder about the dream sequence. Enough has been said about all of great scenes and song and dance numbers, but what about the Gene Kelly / Cyd Charisse scene? I never liked the piece and thought it totally stopped the pace of the film. The scene itself seems to have nothing to do with the picture and just drags on and on. I left the movie for many years and in watching it again my opinion of that scene only gets worse. I turned on many people to the film over the years, including my family. The first thing they said when the movie was over was, "what was with that dream scene? Is just dragged on and on!" I can only guess the director, Stanley Donnen either thought that somehow presented another view of the toughness of making it in Hollywood, or Gene Kelly used his star power to make sure that number stayed in the film as an ego trip. I would have much rather seen the deleted number with Debbie Reynolds singing to the billboard. Oh well, it's still a great movie. Though it meant something different to audiences who saw this picture only 20-30 years after the advent of talking pictures and who heard these songs in other movies, it still is good family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fifties Musical that has it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood musical certainly went out with a bang in the early 1950s with "The Band Wagon" and this film: "Singin' in the Rain" has something for almost everyone, even those who don't care for musicals. Set in 1927, the year "The Jazz Singer" (and the Oscars) changed the movies forever, it is simultaneously an original musical, a period re-creation, and a good-humored satire of everything Early Hollywood-- from the stars' street clothes and PR-driven romances to styles of direction and the alleged differences between the Follies and the burlesque house (both of which supplied Silent-era sets and other rooms besides).The screenwriters pack the script with references to, and outright impersonations of, period figures: Fairbanks, Gilbert, De Mille, Chaplin and Keaton (O'Connor does them both at once, while wearing a hat that is half of each), Harold Lloyd, Clara Bow, Bebe Daniels, Norma Shearer, Louise Brooks, Pola Negri, Elinor Glyn, Busby Berkeley, and many more. Kelly and O'Connor are amazingly versatile, but the best performance comes from Jean Hagen as the haughty star from Brooklyn whose career is being ruined by the new gadget, the microphone. And Cyd Charisse does some memorable dancing as a flapper with a Lulu haircut.As if a quality script, music, dancing, singing, choreography, photography, costumes, sets, design, and period details weren't enough, SITR also manages to squeeze in several original and ingenious movies-within-the-movie (bits of a silent swashbuckler, a transitional clunker, and a hilarious "demonstration Talkie"), and some Charleston and Black Bottom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's What They Said About the Horseless Carriage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is a great movie about change. The change it describes, of course, is Hollywood's shift from silent film to talkies in the late 1920s. Ironically, it was made during another period of change. In 1952, Hollywood was shifting from mostly black and white movies to mostly color and from standard format (1.33:1) to widescreen. "Singin' in the Rain" bridges the gap; it's shot in Technicolor in standard format.A better title might have been "Dancin' in the Rain". Almost all of the musical numbers have their dance sequences. From Gene Kelly's tap duets with Donald O'Connor to his fantasy ballet with Cyd Charisse, the film is a study of the human body in motion.In most musicals, the songs are written to fit the simple plot. In this one, a complex plot was constructed to fit songs that were over 20 years old, and it works. The film doesn't stand still during the musical numbers: the plot drives the songs and the songs drive the plot. The "Broadway Ballet" finale and the corny but hilarious ending are epilogue; the film's real climax is the scene where Don Lockwood (Kelly) dances along a rain-washed street. He has fallen in love with the girl of his dreams. The problem of Lina's voice has been solved. Everything that follows is inevitable.Set in 1927, the plot revolves around silent star Don Lockwood, his on screen romance with Lina LaMont (Jean Hagen) and his off-screen romance with aspiring actress Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Mix the love triangle, the career-wrecking advent of talking pictures and comic relief man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) and stir liberally for a great screwball musical comedy.The coming of sound destroyed the careers of many silent film stars. It was a form of entertainment-industry Darwinism. Those who didn't have good voices suddenly couldn't get work. Don is a wonderful song &amp; dance man, but Lina's voice is sharp enough to cut steel. Until now, her job has been to look pretty and pantomime on the silent screen. As Cosmo puts it, "She can't sing, she can't dance and she can't act. A triple threat." Her well-rounded incompetence and her spoiled-brat attitude make her one of the greatest comedy villains of all time.Most movies try to hide the tricks of the trade, but "Singin' in the Rain" is a movie about film-making. It revels in the secrets of movie-making and the technical foibles of early sound films. In one of its most memorable scenes, Don declares his love for Cathy on a movie set. In the process, he demonstrates some special effects machinery.For the 50th anniversary edition, Warner Bros. (which now owns the rights to the movie) has put together a handsome 2-DVD package worthy of the film. The documentaries on disc 2 are all interesting. The easter eggs (on both discs) are even better. In fact, the egg on disc 1 is one of my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man and a woman stand at the top of a stoop in the pouring rain. After they kiss and embrace, the man walks down the stairs and waves off his driver. The stage is now set for one of the most legendary sequences in cinema history.MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952) has dazzled audiences for over 50 years. It's a movie about singing, dancing, and movie making. Gene Kelly (An American in Paris) stars as Don Lockwood, a silent film star who along with everyone else in the movie making industry is trying to make the transition from silent's to talkies in the 1920's. He is part of the duo Lockwood &amp; Lamont, the other half being Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). The unseen member of the threesome is Don's right-hand man and best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor, Francis). One night after a successful premier of the latest Lockwood &amp; Lamont feature, Don finds himself in trouble with hardcore fans and jumps into a passing car. The driver, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, The Unsinkable Molly Brown), is startled to find out that it is Don Lockwood, and continues to hurl a barrage of insults to his profession, "If you've seen one, you've seen the all,". Later that night at the after party, Don finds Kathy is one of the dancers who ends up getting herself into quite a mess with Lina.When the movie The Jazz Singer, the first full length talkie, debuts it's a smash hit. All the studios must make the change to compete. This brings production to a halt and the need for a new screenplay. Their current work in progress The Dueling Cavalier is a travesty and needs to be revamped. The only problem is Lina can't sing, dance, or act "the triple threat". Now they must find a way to make a winning picture.Directed by Kelly and Stanley Donen, Singin' in the Rain only received two Oscar nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Jean Hagen) and Best Score. This movie was ranked 10th all time on AFI's 100 Greatest Movie list. How could it only receive two nominations and no wins? Most likely it was due An American in Paris, released one year prior to Singin' in the Rain by MGM, winning a total of six Oscars and eight nominations.Today's cinema has changed dramatically since Singin' in the Rain. Movies have incredible special effects, the cost has gone up considerably, and the values have changed. Kelly worked like a dog to make this movie all it could be and he did that and more. The movie is filled with color and sound using a well crafted style.One of the most intense sequences in the film is the "Make em' Laugh" number performed by the incomparable O'Connor. He showcases his dancing abilities and acrobatic stunts. The scene involves Cosmo trying to cheer up Don. The only way he knows how is to make him laugh. The scene was so tiring that after filming O'Connor was in bed for three days straight. Reynolds also endured a lot on set trying to keep up with Kelly and O'Connor.To truly become a masterpiece a film has to have survived through many years and Singin' in the Rain has done just that. It's truly a work of art that will be cherished for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic film. I've never really been a massive fan of musicals but this one just had everything. The songs are wonderful, especially Good Morning and the title tune, performed by the man himself, Gene Kelly. The guy is just a genius, watching him dance just made my hair stand on end. Even the story was great. I loved the film-within-a-film concept (even if the love story is a little slight). The whole thing is just so polished. Final mention must go to the 'Make Em Laugh' sequence which, while admittedly having little to do with the main plot, was just so brilliantly executed by Donald O' Connor (who is also 'the man'). When he starts running up walls... I want to cry it's so good. Singin' in the Rain: makes me happy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's raining outside. Every time it rains, i start singing "with a happy refrain". Rain takes on a whole new meaning after you have seen this unique and wonderful movie. Whenever I see someone walking down the street in an umbrella, I can't help but envision Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor singing and dancing together. My favorite song from the musical is "Good Morning". It is hard to believe that Debbie Reynolds couldn't dance before this movie. I guess that you can't help but dance well when you are taught by someone as good as Fred Astaire. This movie became even more magical to me after I learned about the characters. Debbie Reynolds was only nineteen during the filming of this movie, Gene Kelly was somewhat of a tyrant, and Jean Hagen dubbed herself. If you can see this musical and not like it, then you should examine yourself as a human being. I would have to say that this is one of the greatest musicals of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit that I am not much up on my musicals. Nevertheless, after watching this movie it makes loads of sense why this might very well be the greatest musical of all time. This flick was really enjoyable from start to finish! However, not being a big musical buff, a few things really stuck out to me: 1.) For all the greatness of Gene Kelly, Donald O' Conner stole the show (although I realize that Kelly is the one who choreographed all the moves). 2.) The only thing that keeps the movie from being a "10" in my book is the whole "Broadway Melody." While it is very entertaining in itself; nevertheless, it made no sense in the grand scheme of the movie. In other words, it seemed liked SUPERB filler...yet it is still seemed to be filler material. There is no excuse for any movie, no matter how good it is, to contain stuff with no relevance to the picture as a whole. Not that anybody will read any of this, but I thought Singin In The Rain was great!</fullReview>

We see the glamorous lives of Hollywood stars, allowing us to feel like we are a part of the life of which so many moviegoers dream of. Gene Kelly, as always, charms the audience with his many talents, which are greatly complemented by Donald O'Connor's comedy stylings and Debbie Reynolds' beautiful voice and acting.

		<fullReview>Tonight was my second time watching "Singing in the Rain" and I am actually surprised that I ever saw it again. Now it is not because it's a bad film--it just holds an annoying memory. You see, when I saw the film, an annoying person named Anne Marie was also watching it....and yelled out what would happen in the finale BEFORE it happened. So, after years of therapy, I have finally decided to watch this again. And, in light of the annoying Anne Marie, I WON'T spoil the film by announcing spoilers in my review! "Singing in the Rain" is set at the time period in which silent pictures were being replaced with sound (about 1927). Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen play two established stars who are beloved by the public. Sound isn't a bad thing for Gene, as he can sing and dance. But Jean, uggh, she has a voice like a Brooklyn parrot and her career is doomed (and she great in this role). That is, until they get the idea of dubbing her with sweet Debbie Reynolds. But as the film progresses, it becomes obvious that Jean is a devil and Debbie is amazing--and Gene is head over heels for her. What's to become of them?The film does something interesting for a musical. Almost all the music is actually recycled from earlier MGM musicals (often from this late 20s time period). While this might seem cheesy, it worked very well because the songs were period and because the production values (the dancing, Technicolor and singing) were so nice it really breathed life into them. In fact, several of the musical numbers are among the best ever filmed--such as "Singing in the Rain" and "Make 'em Laugh". Unfortunately, and I know this will sound like sacrilege, but I think the film had too many numbers, as some of the more garish dance numbers ("Gotta Dance") detracted from those that were sublime. Still, it has a very, very memorable score, a lot of energy and fun make this a musical to watch...provided Anne Marie is no where in sight. I wonder what ever became of her....perhaps some other film viewers killed her (we can only hope).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is a musical that explores the transition from silent to sound films. It also features the story of actor Don Lockwood, who is famous for his on-screen romantic pairing with Lina Lamont. Lina expects Don to marry her, but Don is more interested in Kathy Selden.Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen and Debbie Reynolds are all excellent in the lead roles. Hagen is especially amusing and her screechy voice functions perfectly as an impediment in the transition to sound films.There are not surprisingly a lot of musical numbers, which are generally well-made. Especially good is the title number as sung by Gene Kelly while meandering through a street. The only number that seemed out of place was the extended "Broadway Melody" number toward the end of the film, which looks nice, but is disruptive to the flow of the story.The storyline exploring the tumultuous transition from silent to sound films and the relationships between characters were clever and amusing. It helped that I watched "The Jazz Singer" (1927) shortly before watching this one, as the film makes reference to its role as the film that ushered in the sound era. It is not essential to view it before seeing this, but it may help to learn of the song "Mammy" from that film since some of the jokes in this film make reference to it. "Singin' in the Rain" is not my favorite musical, but it is certainly one of the better ones I have seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone seems to agree that not only is Singin' in the Rain the greatest of Hollywood musicals but one of the best of any kind of movie ever made. That's what I think too. Its plot line of the arrival of movie sound points one inevitably toward one of the greatest comic plays ever written, Kaufmann and Hart's Once in a Lifetime, (1931) written equally hilariously about the same topic. And its reminding us of all the vocal pronunciation coaching that went on in those panic stricken days irresistibly summons up analogies to Eliza Dolittle's language lessons in Shaw's Pygmalion and My Fair Lady.The musical goings on are very hard to focus on in the crediting department. Usually one name in the credits will suffice for a movie composer. But between orchestrators and music directors there are about 15 musicians in the crew list, most of them uncredited, including Johnny Green as music director and Alexander Courage, later of Starwars fame. The lush adaptations, orchestrations, and ballet numbers, all especially written for this movie make it a festival of musical riches, never mind the great songs themselves. I found it strange that Donald O'Conor's "Make 'Em Laugh" song never broke into the more familiar words "Be a Clown" featured in "That's Entertainment." Anyone wanting to read an excellent background book on the whole silent-to-sound transition should read "The Shattered Silents," by Alexander Walker (1978).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In late '20s Hollywood, a beautiful but squeaky-voiced star of the silent screen can't adjust when Tinsel Town goes Talkie, yet a disaster is averted when her male co-star has his new girl dub the actress's lines and her singing for their latest costume epic. Glorious musical-comedy is savvy (if a little soft-hearted) about show business, and truly first-rate as a visual feast (with colors that saturate the screen like a painter's dream palette). Though he deserves most of the credit for his co-direction, singing, dancing and choreography, I'm not sure how convincing Gene Kelly is as a love-interest for Debbie Reynolds (they seem more along the lines of close pals, or perhaps brother and sister). Kelly, a real showboater who constantly plays to the camera, knows his strengths like no other musical star, yet his penchant for playing to the audience can either be deemed cute or simply unctuous. Still, the man is a human dynamo, and he cuts quite a presence on the screen; though his elaborate "Broadway Melody" number really belongs in a different picture altogether, Kelly is ingratiating calling out "Gotta Dance!" to a stage full of arms-flailing teens--he's the bedrock of the movie, as well as its heart and soul. Debbie seems rather young for him, but she's full of joshing good cheer, like a great buddy. Donald O'Connor has energy to spare as a pianist, and his exhausting showpiece "Make 'em Laugh" (though prolonged) is one of the few times when Kelly doesn't steal the spotlight. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The new Don Lockwood. He yodels; he jumps around to music!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to get the record straight, I don't really like musicals. Whilst I'm fond of most cinematic genres, the musical has been one to which I have been rather averse. Perhaps it is the sheer absurdity of a character suddenly breaking into song at the most inopportune moment, or maybe it is the films' tendencies to have a flimsy story connecting the numerous song-and-dance numbers. In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared.Following the great success of 'An American in Paris' a year earlier, 'Singin' in the Rain' was co-directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, and is set in 1927 ? appropriately, the year of cinema's transition from silent films to "talkies." Don Lockwood (Kelly) is silent cinemas biggest star, featuring in a string of monumental financial successes for Monumental Pictures, usually opposite the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who can't comprehend that Lockwood only acts affectionate towards her for his films' publicity. With the release of 'The Jazz Singer,' every studio is eager to cash-in on the demand for talkies, but Don and Lina find themselves with a problem: Lina's shrill New York accent definitely does not complement her glamorous public image.After their share of difficulties ? including one hilarious, trouble-plagued test screening for Don and Lina's new film, "The Dueling Cavalier" ? a possible solution is happened upon. Don's energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and pretty, young Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, just 20 years of age when the film was released) suggest turning the disaster of a movie into a musical ? "The Dancing Cavalier" ? with Kathy dubbing all of Lina's dialogue and singing. Of course, not everything goes quite to plan, particularly when the selfish and arrogant Lina finds out about this and tries to have Kathy stripped off all the credit for her excellent work. What sets 'Singin' in the Rain' apart from almost every other musical is the story. Whilst it's obvious that most of the songs were selected well before the plot was formulated ? sometimes the musical numbers go off on an unnecessary tangent that is irrelevant to the story ? no true fan of cinema can go past a film about Hollywood itself.The actual storyline is genuinely engaging, and Lina turns into quite a loathsome villainess by the end of the film, especially when her selfishness threatens to destroy the career of one so innocent and promising as young Kathy. Gene Kelly is great in the main role, his superb confidence and boyish charm, coupled with flawless singing and dancing skills, helping to make him one of Hollywood's most fondly-remembered stars. Debbie Reynolds was also very good, despite reportedly having a difficult time on set, her underdeveloped dancing skills often incurring Gene Kelly's frustration. Donald O'Connor, who I can't believe I've never heard about before, is absolutely phenomenal throughout, his every appearance funny, energetic and memorable. Likewise, Jean Hagen savours every moment as the dim but influential Lina Lamont, earning an Oscar nominations for her troubles.Of course, the true highlights of "Singin' in the Rain' are the musical numbers. Whilst very few of the songs are original to the film (for example, the title song was taken from 'Hollywood Revue of 1929'), the use of each is so inspired that they now forever associated with it. I'm not particularly a fan of the slow, romantic love songs, but some of the more lively tunes appealed to me greatly. "Singin' in the Rain," performed by Gene Kelly on a rainswept nighttime street, has now becoming legendary, superbly demonstrating how Don's love for Kathy has eradicated all of his troubles and left him blissfully happy. O'Connor's energetic rendition of "Make 'Em Laugh," in which he somersaults off the walls of a movie set, left him in a state of extreme exhaustion. "Good Morning," a catchy little tune performed by Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds was also nice to watch. Perhaps the film's centrepiece, Kelly's "Broadway Melody Ballet" has little to do with the plot of the film, but it is such an astounding flurry of colour and excitement that I am willing to forgive its running a bit overlong. For fans of musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Indeed, even for people who have little interest in watching musicals, you shouldn't give up on the genre until you have at least seen this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great musical absolutely brilliant and i can easily say to someone who has not seen this that this is a movie you much watch before you die. This is Gene Kelly at his very best and was his best by far but his other films are still good to watch. But let's not forget Donald O'Connor's performance he was just as good but like many others will never be as good as the great Gene Kelly. The songs were catchy and is something that would suck in the audience and make them sing along. Gene Kelly's dance when he sings singin in the rain is just fantastic and leaving me wondering how on earth he can dance like that. Even though Goodfellas is my most favourite movie of all time, i would still have to put singin in the rain up there on my list, but would definitely be my favourite musical as nothing compares to this. It is authentic and has some funny moments in it too but anyone who has not seen this PRETTY PLEASE i beg you to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS It was once said that "Everyone loves a musical". Whilst not completely accurate (there are those who just can't get their heads around the genre), there's no denying that the majority of people across the globe love the beauty of a true musical. Often brightly coloured, sometimes with spectacular dancing numbers, and always with a soundtrack to die for, these films have made generations smile for a long time now. The most famous, and perhaps the finest musical ever made, was "Singin' in the Rain". Starring Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, the film made a dancing heroine out of newcomer Debbie Reynolds, and aside from one irrelevant period where Kelly dances through a 1920s setting, it is the most well constructed and well known musical of it's (and any other) generation.Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen) are the favourite silent movie couple of Hollywood. Unfortunately though, with the rise of the talking picture, with Lamont's squeaky voice, their days look numbered. That is until Lockwood accidentally meets Kathy Selden (Reynolds), an unknown with a beautiful voice. Now, putting the screen presence of Lamont and the voice of Selden together, Lockwood might just have a way of saving their careers.Everyone able to watch television will have seen or heard about Gene Kelly's scene in the rain. It's a scene of legendary status, and worthy so. The film itself though is so much more. With songs like "Make 'em Laugh" and "Good Morning", there are more musical gems in this film than you could ever want. All sang by either Kelly, Reynolds or O'Connor, you hear these songs and you find yourself singing them back weeks afterwards. There's just no way to criticise them.On acting and dancing fronts as well, "Singin' in the Rain" is as good as it should be. Kelly and O'Connor were already dancing geniuses when they agreed to star in this film, but Reynolds was a complete newcomer to the art. This obviously didn't stop her as she not only manages to perform brilliantly, but she more than equals the abilities of the two male leads.Aside from the three main actors, Jean Hagen is more than worthy of her Oscar performance as the infuriating Lamont. She screeches and grates throughout the entire film, despite the fact that the actress herself actually has an amazing voice (and even ironically provides the voice in the musical that Reynolds is meant to be providing for her). Hagen is the ridicule humour in a film of good intentions. She's the bad guy who everyone likes to see suffer, and she does it exquisitely.In fact, despite it's slow start, "Singin' in the Rain" would be the finest film of all time, if not for one key flaw.About two thirds of the way through the film, we are whisked away to a musical number where Gene Kelly is a young talent in New York. Trying to make it big, he dances his way along singing "gotta dance". Eventually, a woman becomes involved, and he makes it big, and all manner of events happen, but we just don't care. The scene is completely irrelevant to the film and does nothing but ruin it's flow. The scenery is too bright, the clothes are ridiculously colourful, and basically the scene feels like it goes on for hours at an end. If they wanted to feature the scene, it might have been tolerable for a tiny period, but by putting the whole piece in, it destabilises the structure of "Singin' in the Rain" and ruins what could well have been the perfect film."Singin' in the Rain" is without a doubt the finest musical ever made. It's songs, it's dancing, it's acting, it's cinematography, everything is perfect. That is, except for one woefully inappropriate scene. The film is more than worthy of any praise it might get, but until we witness a version without that scene, it won't quite make it as the greatest film of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful feelin'! There is no other movie that will brighten up a cloudy day more than 'Singin' In the Rain'. A classic movie musical, complete with comedy, romance, and a full-length Broadway Ballet, 'Singin' In the Rain' is an enjoyable watch. The story features Don Lockwood, (Gene Kelly) a young, romantic, 'swashbuckling star of the silver screen' who rose to fame via a lucky break, after living the trials and tribulations of a vaudeville hoofer/musician, accompanied by his lifelong best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor). After a flashy world premier, Don is nearly suffocated by adoring fans, and narrowly escapes by jumping from a tour bus into the car of the unsuspecting Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), a cute, talented dancer/actress, and not only finds himself falling into the passenger seat, but falling for her as well. Throughout the film, he and his leading lady, the very stunning, not so cunning, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are presented with the challenge of switching from the over-dramatic silent films to the new, hip talkies. The production studio then attempts to transform their current film, 'The Dueling Cavalier' staring Don and Lina, into a vocalized picture. Donald, who has had vocal training, can easily surpass this new feat, but the lovely Lina has a voice that would rival a banshee's. After the humiliating sneak preview airs for theaters, and only a few months until the world premier, our three heroes undergo converting the 'Cavalier' into a musical, and superimposing Kathy's exquisite pipes over Lina's screechy squeals in an attempt to save their careers. From here on out the story roller coasters through romance, comedy, betrayal, and fabulous, incredible, world class DANCING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest musical of all times!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the rain takes place in the 20's when talkies first started coming to life. It is about an actor Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) who doesn't like his obnoxious partner Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). He ends up falling in love with Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds), who at first didn't like Gene. throughout the movie there are many terrific dance sequences such as, Make 'em Laugh, performed by Donald O'Conner, who played Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown. Also, Kelly's performance of "Singin' in the rain" which is known as one of the greatest scenes of all time. When they get to the talking point in movie history they run into a problem. Lina Lamont can't talk, sing or dance. The studio decides to use Debbie Reynold's voice to voice of Hagen's. This movie was produced and choreographed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. If you enjoy great musicals this movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, in my opinion is the BEST FILM EVER MADE! It is funny, has a good story, and excellent musical numbers. The acting, singing and dancing is superb and unforgettable. I mean, How many people haven't seen Gene Kelly's most well known scene where he actually is "Singin' In The Rain"? Donald O'Connor is excellent as Kelly's best Friend Cosmo, as id Debbie Reynolds as the star struck fan who falls in love with Kelly. Great performances are also given by Jean Hagen as the ditzy blonde and Cyd Charise as the mysterious dancer in the fabulous 13 minute Broadway Melody Ballet. There is no point during this film where you feel like you want to skip to the next chapter on your DVD, every moment is brilliant, and it is a shame that it is not in top 10 of the Imdb's list. It is hailed as the greatest American musical ever made, but i believe that is most definitely an understatement.</fullReview>

Whenever things in life get me down...and I mean really down... I watch "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN" and somehow suddenly things don't seem so bad. If they could bottle this film it would be the greatest anti-depressant on the market. In my opinion it deserves more than the highest rating ever. LONG LIVE "SINGIN' IN THE RAIN".

		<shortDescription>GREAT MUSICAL!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain is another brilliant musical based on the 'Talkie madness' of the late 1920's. Two famous celebrities, Don Lockwood and Lena Lamont are a famous on- screen couple. However, their 'getting along together' is pathetic. Don meets Cathy Selden accidentally and is amazed that she is the first girl not to have fallen for him. She says 'You're nothing but a shadow on film, a shadow'...and these words haunt him. Another accidental meeting- and this time Cathy is being considered for a role in a movie. Don falls in love with her and vice- versa.When the talkies are in a rage, the audience asks for more and Don and Lena are put to their first big test. One big problem is Lena's unattractive and squeaky voice which Monumental Pictures are a bit frightened to reveal. Other problems do arise and the premiere of their fist talkie becomes the laughing stock of the masses. With six weeks left for release, things look pretty hopeless until a solution comes; they decide to make the film into a musical with Cathy speaking for Lena. However, this is not known to Lena, but when 'The Dancing Cavalier' (the movie) becomes an overnight success, Lena plans to have Cathy speaking for her in every movie without any credit. Things are revealed to the audience in the end and Lena leaves, having made a real fool of herself in front of the world.The movie is really hilarious and entertaining. You can't really get tired of it. Gene Kelly's dances are brilliant (man! what a dancer) and the others are great too. My favourite song is 'Singin' In the Rain' but all the others are pretty good as well, such as 'Make 'em laugh' and 'Good morning'.Good direction, very good acting, entertaining and very animated. A must for all to see. Real fun to watch! A GREAT MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Classic musical making its way through art houses with a remastered format that causes the colors to jump off the screen. Never a much of a Gene Kelly fan, however, his pompous persona lends itself very well to screen star Don Lockwood. Tremendous performances by Kelly, O'Connor, Reynolds, Hagen and Charisse drive this spectacle to heights no other song &amp; dance film has ever reached. I do not rate it as the best musical of all-time, because I think "Sound of Music" and "Music Man" are both slightly better, but only "West Side Story" even comes close on the dancing. O'Connor is nothing short of physically amazing on his "Make 'em laugh" and the trio's performance during "Good Mornin'" will leave you wanting more. Jean Hagen is perfectly excrusciating as the screech-voiced Lina. Truly, I think Reynolds and O'Connor should receive more credit for the success of the film. Both are in supporting roles that nearly steal the film. If you have never seen this on the big screen, hunt this down in your town - and take your friends and kids and parents!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the greatest musical ever made (and also one of the greatest comedies), Singin' in the Rain is the definitive form of entertainment. Starring screen legends Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, and Donald O'Connor, Singin' in the Rain was released in 1952 as an all musical, all singing, all dancing extravaganza. It truly is. It is probably the greatest feel-good movie of all time. Kelly and O'Connor have a great musical duo with "Moses Supposes." Add Reynolds and you have the classic "Good Morning." O'Connor's "Make 'em Laugh" is a scream and hilarious. Kelly has his unforgettable "Singin' in the Rain" number where he literally tap-dances with an umbrella under pouring rain. Jean Hagen, as Lina Lamont, was the only actor to be nominated for an Oscar and is truly the standout in the film providing most of the laughs as a brainless and obnoxious blonde with an annoying high-pitched voice. The film is a perfect showcase for showing the transition from silent films to talkies and all the mishaps that came along with the period of the late 20s and early 30s. Witness the romance, the dancing, the music, the singing, the comedy, the profound impact of the greatest musical entertainment of all time! 10/10</fullReview>

This film is based around the lates 1920s, when the talkies revolution took place! And it basically, focuses on the rise of Don Lockwood, a former stuntman on slient films becomes a superstar overnight, alongside his former music colleque, Don Lockwood. Donald o'connor's character goes over the top when singing Make 'em Laugh! But who cares! It's extremely more entertaining than other "over-the-top" comic stars, like Jim Carrey!But it is the classic Singin' in the Rain sequence with Gene Kelly prancing about in the streets on a rainy evening is classic film-making. No other musical has such brilliantly cherography and a well-directed dancing sequence filmed in all my film-wacthing life! It's a gem! This really meant the hollywood classics that are not made like this gem anymore! Not even the modern-day hollywood can compete with classic film-making that it used to be when this was realesed! Come on! This film was entirely made with no computer graphics in site. If it did, in a re-make, it would deteriate the quality dramatically! This is truly the best hollywood musical since the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gotta Dance!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it. Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical: A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired. It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama. But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past. To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk. And where does Monumental start? By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama. If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon. The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands. But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it. And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted. And that's where the story really begins.Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show. The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying: Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse. But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.' And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here. He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch. And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence). Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting). But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period. And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable. His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?). And he makes it look so easy. As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades. He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating. If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor. Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence. She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing. It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot. Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance. And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe). If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies. Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it. There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being that the is the first musical I've seen it is hard to say that this is the best, but I must say that it was an incredible movie, and must see for movie lovers. The originality of Gene Kelley and his dance scores is just simply put, `amazing.' As the director and major character of the movie, Kelley makes this film come alive. The plot line, based around a silent film movie actress forced to begin making talking pictures, is an inviting and amusing one that keeps you coming back for more. With such talented actors as Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds it's hard to find flaws in the casting directors picks. O'Connor's antics and awesome dance routines make him unforgettable. The role that he plays as Cosmo Brown, Don Lockwood's sidekick, is very well acted. The chemistry between O'Connor and Kelley is well rehearsed. The beautiful Debbie Reynolds, who plays the young Kathy Sheldon, is also stunning. In the beginning of the film she picks up Lockwood so he can retreat from the crazy crowd that is chasing after him. She pretends to know little about him and his impressive career, but we later find out she has seen a great deal of his films. Lina Lamont, who is the silent movie actress, is so realistically played by Jean Hagen. She is the gorgeous blond bombshell that is certainly not hard on the eyes but whose tone of voice could just pierce your ears. This movie is just such wonderfully directed and almost effortlessly made movie. I would suggest it to anyone in for classic movie and great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delectable Film for all Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is a film that will be enjoyed by all ages. This musical is the only one which my friends and I have truly enjoyed. It is a humorous film that has talented actors and actresses such as Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. Singin' in the Rain was a great movie in the time which it was produced, even though there were some critics who would disagree. It is a story based in 1927 about a man named Don Lockwood who has yet another film to star in. Only this time it is a `talkie' which his partner, Lina Lamont, doesn't have the voice for. It was great how they showed the use of dubbing in films which is used quite often in many films. Don later falls for a fan of his named Kathy Seldon. This becomes the romantic part of the movie that mostly appeals to older generations. The film was pretty cool in the tap dancing and musical parts, but the most amusing was the comedy. You don't really see men dancing and singing all the time, most of us are brought up to be masculine and do masculine things, not sing and dance. This is where the great Gene Kelly came in, he made the singing and dancing seem like it was the thing to do. The comedy mostly played by Donald O'Connor, was hilarious. It was by far the funniest classic musical I've ever seen, and blew everything else in those genres out of the water. The more technical fascinations with this movie are just as great. The illusion shot was definitely one of my favorite parts, when Cosmo, played by Donald O'Connor, runs up a wall. The synchronous sound worked great for the film, and I'm sure it amused the audiences then as it still does now. As for the illusion and reality part, in reality not many successful actors go for their fans. Also Jean Hagen who played Lina Lamont, can actually sing and doesn't sound like she has been sucking helium. One thing I have found, is that, if you are ever feeling down or sick, this is a great movie to see to get you going again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie for the first time on VHS the other day. What a great film! Sure, some of the dance numbers are weird and/or go on too long, but that's just me and I'm generally not captivated by songs. But in this movie, they're mostly great, including "Make 'Em Laugh", "Moses", and, of course, that title sequence. Also, the leads are fantastic- although Gene Kelly as the hero was pure exuberance personified I really admired more Donald 'O Connor, whose legs seems to be motorized and who was the definition of the word "rascal". And who knew that Debbie Reynolds was so cute back in the day? All in all, a movie highly recommended if you love to watch movies just for the sheer joy they can have.</fullReview>

When you watch the "Moses Supposes" number, it looks like he is just as good a dancer as Gene Kelly, who was considered one of the best. And no one can deny that "Make Them Laugh" is hysterically funny and shows great talent.Nominated for two Oscars, "Singin' in the Rain" is a wonderful musical comedy with romance and unbeatable performances.

		<shortDescription>I love this film, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the dance numbers, and even some of the songs, are less amazing than those of its immediate predecessor, An American in Paris, made by gene Kelly a year beforehand. I know that the An American in Paris songs were just adaptations of Gershwin songs, but they're great, and they work. That rendition of "I Got Music" is wonderful, and the 20 minute ballet at the end is one of the greatest things I've ever seen in a film. There are several songs from Singing in the Rain which were a little weak, and the "New York Ballet" doesn't feel right at all in this film. It's obviously a grab for the success of An American in Paris and its amazing finale. That one made a lot of sense in that film (and was itself inspired by the even more amazing ballet sequence from The Red Shoes). That ballet sequence had much more substance, and didn't seem excessive. The New York Ballet did seem a bit excessive, although nice to watch.What puts Singing in the Rain above An American in Paris is its plot. An American in Paris' plot was almost completely filler material between the songs and dance. The ending to that film (after the ballet sequence, that is) was very abrupt and didn't even make much sense. Singing in the Rain is extremely interesting in its setting. It's very interesting from a historical perspective, and that's what pushes it to a 10/10 for me, 1 above An American in Paris.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just about every number in this film has at least something (and almost always many things) that make it very enjoyable and an instant classic. "Moses Supposes" has a catchy tune and rousing chereography. "Good Mornin'" also is very catchy and upbeat. "The Braodway Melody" does go on and doesn't add anything, but it's got Cyd Charisse and some amazingly colorful costumes. What else can be said about "Make 'Em Laugh?" that hasn't already been said? It's got the talent of Donald O'Connor and some real knockout routines, (But that's already been said.) And the title tune,... Gene Kelly's joy and happiness is just so infectious! And plus, it's already a classic. I wish that were more than enough to convince you to see it. If not, then it's got some very funny satire on the transition from silent pictures to talkies, with a hilarious performance from Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont. (Just hearing her voice will make you crack up, promise!) Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds also give good performances but not great ones. Still good enough, though. PLEASE SEE THIS! You'll be all the better for it, really. Even if you don't like musicals, you will no doubt at least like it, and probably love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still a very young man (14 yearsold) but my aspiration in life is to be a film critic. So I started watching the old classic movies. The first one I said I needed to watch was Singin In The Rain. After seeing it many times since I have come to one conclusion. Gene Kelly singing in the rain is the single handed most beautiful and aspiring pieces of work ever caught on film. I think that the rest of the movie is also just pure classic. Moses and Make Em Laugh are two classic scenes that any person who has ever seen a film should see this movie. Donald O'Conner is great and Gene Kelly is just so perfect. May he rest in peace. In conclusion, Singin In The Rain is just beautiful and no one but Gene Kelly could pull that off. The only thing that comes even close to me is the end of the first back to the future and of course the end of Casablanca. But Singin In The Rain is just the best.</fullReview>

Most say yes, but I like West Side Story better, primarily because the music in WSS in incomparable. But WSS is dark and depressing, SITR is light and snappy and suitable for anyone.See this and see the Kelly-O'Connor combo its peak and one of the best works of art from Hollywood's golden age. **** out of **** (which is barely enough).</fullReview>

It it is university policy that each students undertakes 3 units totally irrelevant to their degree with the intention of broadening ones greater knowledge of the world. I am delighted by this films story line, it offers the viewers so much and given the period in which it was filmed, it would have to be up there with the best produced movies for that era. The dancing is fantastic, the synchrinisation is perfect, each song neatly entailing a story, a theme. As a movie to study, Singin' in the Rain has provided me with many issues and topics that I have been able to recognise and follow throughout the movie, noting the significance of each song and dance to the story line. I have since watched the film a few more times, each time appreciating it more! I am surprised at the level of interest that I generated personally to towards this film, very out of character for me given my usual broad narrowed high action movie preference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is simply fantastic and certainly has a cushy spot in my top five. Singin' in the Rain was a high-water mark for musicals, and after 1952 there would be few true classics of the genre (just The Band Wagon, Kiss Me Kate, West Side Story and a couple of others). What a pity, especially since Kelly had only been in Hollywood ten years when this was released.But regardless, Singin' in the Rain is a real treat, from the first time to the fiftieth, because this one just keeps getting better every time.Yet I can see how it might seem overrated to some. When I first saw it I had never been very interested in classic film, so phrases like "best musical of all time" and "one of the greats" certainly weren't running around in my mind. I'd heard of it, it was supposed to be good, so I watched it and I was hooked. Only when I started looking around the net and the library for more information on this gem and it's star did those words pop up. I thought about it and, since by then I'd seen more of the genre, I decided it seemed to fit. So I am now one of the many who regards this as one of the greats. But people who go into it thinking this will have high expectations and will possibly be disappointed.The songs and dances are sheer perfection. I love them all, but my favourite is the Broadway Melody Ballet in which Cyd Charisse slinks around a bewildered Gene Kelly. Incredible. I admit that the rest of the number is a bit lengthy, but it's worth sitting through for Cyd.If you need encouragement beyond the comments on this page, forget it. It will be lost on you. But if you're willing to give it a try, do so, but don't go expecting entertainment that far surpasses anything you have ever seen, or a plot so complex that you have to take notes, but look for cute numbers, likeable characters, and great use of colour. You will certainly find these things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest classic musicals of all time, and one of my favourites, from directors Stanley Donen (Charade), and the star of the picture. Oh before I start, its not just the film that is a homage to past musicals, but the song (along with many of the others in the film) is popular in two other films. Anyway, basically it is 1927, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly, starring, directing and staging the musical numbers) is one of Hollywood's biggest stars, along with his annoying voiced co-star of his new picture, Lina Lamont (Oscar nominated Jean Hagen). Warner Bros. have created the first talking motion picture, or "talkie", and all other studios are joining in, including Don's current studio, who have decided to turn his new upcoming silent film, The Duelling Cavalier, into the first talking musical, The Dancing Cavalier. Don has the perfect voice, where as Lina obviously ruins it, so they get a new star to replace her voice, who Don has already met and become very close to, Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Cosmo Brown (Golden Globe winning Donald O'Connor, kind of like another Sir Norman Wisdom or Lee Evans) is also a part of the act, not just as Don's best friend and help in production, but at showing him and others his great, and often hilarious abilities. In the end, the film, after all its trouble in production, is a success, Kathy is revealed as the true great singing voice of Lina, and she stars with Don in a new motion picture (shown on poster). The story has taken great songs from other musicals, there are great colours and staged dances, including that one where Kelly is imagining a part of his new film where he wants to be a dancer, and eventually runs into Cyd Charisse. The cheerful "Good Morning" was number 72, the hilarious "Make 'Em Laugh" was number 49, and of the course, the key sequence of the film, Kelly's solo dance routine showing a character's true love and expression of this, "Singin' in the Rain" was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. I can believe the rumour that because of An American in Paris a year before took over the Oscars, and this as a result did not win any, which it should of, it only received two (pretty lousy) nominations, but I would say that this certainly much more admired. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Lennie Hayton, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. Gene Kelly was number 66 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 1 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 10 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a very small, select number of films, which stand the test of time and will live on forever. One such film is 'Singing in the Rain'. Made in 1952, much of the Hollywood satire found in the film is still relevant to the star system and studio structure of Tinsel Town today. Gene Kelly puts in an unforgettable performance as the all-singing, all-dancing, Don Lockwood.The story follows a group of Hollywood filmmakers, making the transition from the silent movies of yester-year into the new age of talking-film. With a little help from his friends Lockwood turns a terrible formulaic studio picture into a show stopping musical.This is one of those films that everyone should go back to and watch again. It is a fantastic reminder of how the musical genre used to be, and should be! It also struck me as surprisingly historical, charting the introduction of the talking-movies and the initial public and professional reaction to it. Watching this film will remind you of the heart-warming, lifting feeling that many modern films just fail to deliver. If anyone can resist the urge to smile and laugh during Donald O'Connor's fantastic performance of 'Make 'em laugh' then it would be a very sorry day indeed! If it is an achievement to get your audience on the edge of their seat then this film surpasses that achievement because I was very close to dancing on mine!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film, but only in its true version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always adored this movie. It is a wonderful, funny, creative and influential film. However, if you've only seen the fullscreen version, please realize that you are cheating yourself! The original widescreen version gives you the full effect and wonderful visual scope of the film. The fullscreen version is literally painful to watch. The choices made in shots take away from a cinematic masterpiece. Please, please, please invest the time in seeing this film in its original format. Also, take a few minutes and examine the "Broadway Rhythm" section of the film. It is a beautiful piece of dance, and is often underrated in my opinion. I have seen An American in Paris many times and of course I adore the ballet encapsulated within the film. However, the Broadway Rhythm section of Singin' in the Rain is my favorite dance within a film scene of all time. It is extremely funny if you take the time to watch it closely and it is also beautifully scored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How rare! A thoroughly enjoyable musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a fan of the Musical genre, when I come across a musical film that I enjoy, it's pretty much an anomaly. `Singin' in the Rain' is one of those exceptions, because it is not only immensely enjoyable, but it is sarcastic and intelligent as well. `Singin' in the Rain' stars Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and is a romantic comedy about the advent of the talking picture in 1920's Hollywood. While a lot of the jokes are over the top and biting, one can't help but imagine that this is probably a fairly accurate portrayal of the hysteria over talkies and the scramble by the studios to compete. Probably the most striking thing about `Singin' in the Rain' is the unbelievable talent, particularly the performances of O'Connor and Kelly. When they start dancing and doing their shtick, I'm suddenly ten years old again and grinning like a fool at the screen. There are few films that make me laugh out loud, and often, but this film is one of them. One of the very few criticisms I would have about this film is the scene with Gene Kelly (`Gotta Dance!') toward the end of the film that is about twenty minutes long and pretty much grinds the film to a screeching halt for me. Until this (unbearably long) musical number, the film is moving at a really quick pace, but it takes a few minutes after this scene for the film to pick up steam again in time for the hilarious conclusion. I'm not sure what the reasoning was behind the decision to put such a long and displaced number in the film, but if the intent was to show the irony of Hollywood, etc. I'm sure they could have been a bit more concise about it. (And still showcase Cyd Charrise's amazing legs!)It takes a lot for a comedy, and especially a musical comedy at that, to turn me into a drooling fangirl, but `Singin' in the Rain' does that every time to me. This is a feel-great movie that is truly a fantastic classic.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Peak of MGM-ness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Together with An American in Paris, this film represents the pinnacle of the great MGM musicals. And there's nothing new in stating that, or how wonderful Gene Kelly is, or Donald O'Connor is or the screenplay or the music etc etc.But what about Jean Hagen? What a supreme comedy performance. And where did it lead her? To years and years of sitcom wife-ness with Danny Thomas. Why didn't MGM build her up as the rival to Judy Holliday?One of the many great things about this film is that it is a musical- COMEDY, and the comedy part is largely due to her fabulous performance, PUT TOGETHER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best musicals, if that's worth anything</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised around musicals, but I could never stomach the concept of people breaking out into song and dance at the most inconceivably awkward moments. Still, the musical-within-a-musical premise allows "Singin' in the Rain" to set up the numbers better than any other musical. For that, I tolerate it.As one of the best musicals ever, I rated it above-average as a movie. For me, that's an impressive feat. After all, like I said, musical numbers tend to abuse the creative license offered by telling a story on a screen. But this movie tied together the music and the plot as good as anyone could ever hope to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolutely perfect movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of wonderful movies out there. So many, in fact, that it is very difficult to choose a favorite. And while there are multiple movies that are good enough to be considered a "favorite", when asked to choose a number one, this is consistently the one I have chosen. Now, I have many reasons for this choice. One of which has to be the absolutely fabulous soundtrack. Any movie that can launch a song that thousands of people sing whenever it starts to rain must be absolutely fabulous. Make Him Laugh is likely one of the funniest musical numbers in movie history. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds are fabulous actors that sell the story wonderfully. And the plot is funny and well written. This is easily one of the greatest musicals, even one of the greatest movies, ever made. While there are many fabulous new movies, there are times when nothing beats an old classic. And this one is a classic for a reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest musicals ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin in the Rain is co-directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donan, is produced by Arthur Freed, has a screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and stars Gene Kelly, Jean Hagen, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Millard Mitchell, Rita Moreno and Cyd Charisse.Singin in the Rain is a dazzling mix of Technicolor, beautiful costumes, comedy, romance, toe tapping songs and spectacular dancing.In Hollywood in the late 1920's. Two of the biggest stars of the Silent era are the dashing Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly)and the beautiful Lina Lamont(Jean Hagen). They are a beloved screen couple and have thousands of fans, according to gossip magazines the pair are actually an item in real life. That couldn't be further from the truth, in real life they can't stand one another.Lina thinks they could and should be a couple but Don doesn't love her. Don also does all the interviews on behalf of the pair not giving Lina a chance to speak because her voice is atrocious. So after several arguments the pair become sworn enemies but in public act like everything is fine so as not to upset their fans.One night Don meets dancer and aspiring actress Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds)and the pair fall in love. It's obvious these two are supposed to be with one another but they don't stand a chance with the jealous Lina around.Lockwood and Lamont's latest film The Dueling Cavalier is shut down during production because of the successful debut of the first sound film, The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson. Realising that talkies are going to be the next big thing, director R.F. Simpson(Millard Mitchell)decides to make the Dueling Cavalier as a sound musical. Of course Lina's voice is terrible so Don decides to have Lina's dialogue and singing dubbed by Kathy. There is a snag though, Lina wants Kathy to continue doing this for the rest of her career at the expense of Kathy's own chance of fame in Hollywood.Gene Kelly proves once again what a gifted dancer he was with several energetic dance sequences. The famous scene between him and Cyd Charisse is a highlight of the film, their dance is sensual and sexy and the pair dance very well together.Jean Hagen steals every scene she's in and proves what a gift for comedy she had. Jean was nominated for an Oscar for her performance but sadly didn't win and that is a real shame because she deserved it. I always feel sorry for Lina because although she is very much the films villain, she pretty much represents many of the real Silent era stars. Almost overnight careers were ended because the stars voices didn't sound right on film.Debbie Reynolds does a fine job as the shy and unassuming Kathy, who can't quite believe that she is now a part of Hollywood and is loved by one of the biggest stars.Donald O'Conner is hysterical as Cosmo Brown the best friend of Don Lockwood. O'Conner's Make Em Laugh routine is a highlight of the film and never fails to make me cry with laughter.A young Rita Moreno can be spotted too as Zelda Zanders, another glamorous Hollywood star.One of the best musicals ever made, Singin in the Rain is a joy from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.What a charming and beautiful "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) is. Great acting, music, staged dances, script, story, performances, direction - it all clicks here at it's very best. In general i don't like musical, highly dislike them. I do not understand why i some serious conditions everybody just stars singing and dancing. But "Singin' in the Rain" one of the few best exceptions i have ever saw (first time in 2016 to be honest). This is a movie that doesn't take it self seriously, but it is a very direct representation of Hollywood's system (behind the scene), and it is just a charming musical as well.Overall, "Singin' in the Rain" is a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favorite and do it now. Doesn't matter that it is 64 years old now, great things don't age - "Singin' in the Rain" is like a great bottle of wine - it ages with charm. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Unlike Other Musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This musical is one that is unlike any other. Even a person who does not like musicals would love this movie. Most of the musical numbers are written to almost make fun of other musicals, while resulting in a film that was way ahead of it's time. The choreography in this film is an art in itself. Gene Kelly fills the part of Don Lockwood like no other could. To this day, "Singin' in the Rain" is a musical number that is known everywhere. The dedication that all of these actors showed while this film was in progress is truly remarkable. This one of the earliest films in color and the color in it is almost better than the color that is in movies now. It is very pure and very vibrant so it adds to the overall effect of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching this timeless classic ever since I was a kid, and the appeal hasn't waned one bit down the line. The music and the dance, the laughs and the charm, not to mention a truly charismatic Gene Kelly at 42.... this isn't a movie, it's an experience. As a singer myself, I think it's one of the finest to ever come out of the Hollywood camp. It's also an instant pick-me-up for me. Whenever I'm down, I play the movie and am assured of some great laughs. In fact, I've tried to ape Kelly's famous rain dance sequence and fallen ill as a result! To me, it will always be the most magnificent musical ever made, much ahead of Sound of Music or West Side Story or My Fair Lady.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is one of my absolute favorite movies. It seems to occur at this point where absolute technically sound filmwork meets whimsy and flat-out fun. This is a very tough thing to achieve, considering the technical planning that goes into such choreography and camera-work (see: Make 'Em Laugh).This film is so full of elaborate sequences (elaborate in their choreography, lighting, sets, dynamic elements of camera-work, sound, set, and props) and great dialogue that it's clear to any viewer how much work went into each component of Singin' in the Rain.The movie only loses its over-the-top enjoyable qualities during one sequence toward the end. The ballet sequence seems ham-fisted, and goes on for far too long. I find myself wondering when they'll get back to the movie when it's going on, and I'm sure that's no filmmaker's intention for any part of a film.Beside this, however, the movie is thoroughly captivating, not just enjoyable. The playful use of sound to emphasize it as a story element is apparent in scenes like Don Lockwood's (Gene Kelly) flop of a movie premiere, as well as one scene where he and Lina (Jean Hagen) struggle to act with a microphone. These scenes are not only humorous and fun but also speak to the strange transition that filmmaking underwent after the advent of sound in film.Singin' in the Rain is great for so many reasons. To be such an example of excellent filmmaking and also be so purely enjoyable is an incredible combination of things to get out of a movie, and this one has both, with so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not fully fond of musical films but this to me has to be the best one. I have seen other ones like West side Story, but I liked Singin' in the rain a whole lot more. I thought it was great. A great story and great characters and great choreography. I really liked the cinematography in the film a lot. Many of the songs felt like a really nice touch and helped explained the story. I remember as a little kid, I'm 19 now, hearing the song "Good Morning" that they sang in the movie but I never knew it was from this movie. The choreography number for "Singin' in the rain" by Gene Kelly when he has like a 101 degree fever is crazy. A lot people don't understand or notice how much the quality of dancing has changed since then. Everything back then seemed to actually take some talent and skill. Nowadays, dancing is too easy and anyone can do some stupid modern dance.</fullReview>

There was a lot of different types of songs and feel in each music scene. It wasn't just one type of, say, a sad musical song. There were funny ones, romantic ones, and sad ones. The sound effects were great, too, they really gave the scenes more humor and drama. The acting was pretty good, too. They all did a fantastic job with showing the different personalities of the characters. Lastly, the camera. This was this movie's flaw. There were long random scenes that were boring and irrelevant. Not only that but there were a lot of shots that were either too close up or too far back. Over the film was well done with just a few flaws that could be fixed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are two greatest stars of the Cinema. Lover inside the screen and "Lover" outside of it, just because of fans and gossip magazines. But, in fact Don barely tolerate Lina, a definition of a blond.Troubles begin with the period of transition from silent movies to talking pictures. Beside technical problems, screenplays with dialogues, main problem is Lina. Beautiful blonde with horrible voice.In fact I don't like Musical movies at all. But, Singin' in the Rain surprised me. I was surprised with the picture and colors that are great even that this movie was made in 1952. Music is wonderful, as I knew it would be. My favorite one was "Good Morning"Along with Music and Romance are those Comic moments with Donald O'Conner as Cosmo who reminded me Charlie Chaplin. Funniest guy in the movie! Acting in overall was great with Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, especially Jean Hagen.Generally speaking, Singin' in the Rain is one of the greatest movie ever, with great acting, directing and script.Combining Music, Romance and Comedy, entertainment is guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain (1952): Dir: Stanley Doren, Gene Kelly / Cast: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell: The greatest of all musicals presenting a portrait of falling in love and the unwillingness to allow hardship to overrule joy. It opens within the birth of sound within motion pictures and Gene Kelly plays a celebrated actor in early cinema who falls in love with Debbie Reynolds. Donald O'Connor plays his life long friend who does a back-breaking number called "Make 'em Laugh." Jean Hagen is hilarious as Kelly's co-star whose high pitched voice becomes a technical problem for the talkies. Millard Mitchell plays the studio head who reluctantly embraces the idea of talking pictures due to the success of The Jazz Singer, so he decides that Kelly and Hagen's current film be a talking picture. Reynolds will factor in at the encouragement of Kelly to lend her voice over top of Hagen's. With inventive and glorious dance numbers including Kelly's wondrous title number where the storms of life fail to penetrate the expression or discovery of love at its most finest. This is a total celebration and expression of music and emotion. It also presents historical cinema shifting from one medium to another. It is a masterpiece that represents the very best from directors Stanley Doren and Gene Kelly. It is a dazzling and charming film full of joy and wonder. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

I could listen to the soundtrack of this film over and over again. The script was well written and the characters were believable and enjoyable to watch.

		<fullReview>I had always heard about the film Singin' in the Rain and had always heard about how it is a classic. So finally I sat down to watch it and I really enjoyed the film. I got very drawn in at the beginning of the movie because I thought it was a cool concept having a film about actors, especially during such a time a crisis as the period where silent films were switching to sound. I found the humor of the film to be very enjoyable and constant throughout, along with the very entertaining and catchy song queues with a matching amount of entertaining dances. I wasn't very surprised that I enjoyed the film because I do enjoy the occasional musical from time to time, but this has definitely become one of my favorites. I found the movie to be very good and entertaining from beginning to end. My only problem with the movie, which probably isn't a surprise, is about the one musical and dance number towards the end of the movie that just goes on longer than it should have. It was a cool scene with lots of interesting things going on; I just believe it wasn't very necessary and could have been much shorter. Overall though, I do agree that this movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone who's ever enjoyed a musical.</fullReview>

Not much to mention of editing or cinematography except for a few impressive long takes. could have bee a 10/10 maybe if not for the long and notorious Broadway scene. When the most famous silent film stars are faced with the transition to sound films, there are many obstacles they must over come. Don and Cosmo, old pals, grew up together entertaining making their way to the big screen where they find success as a team. Renowned and loved by many, Don tries to break ties with his on screen lover and their publicized fake relationship to make room for his true interest, Kathy, a beautiful and talented singer and performer who is the perfect match to Don and Cosmo's trio. With Kathy's help they are able to make the transition to sound much smoother.Film contains rich color and sound. There are many fun and fantastic dance and musical numbers that leave you begging for more. The on screen chemistry is a real treat.

		<fullReview>It is really hard for a musical to grab my attention. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy Singin' in the Rain, my favourite parts of it were the musical numbers. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for tap-dancing, and Donald O'Connor &amp; Gene Kelly are magnificent dancers. Make 'em laugh is simultaneously a jaw-dropping routine, and a work of absolute comedy, and their duo dance scene in the voice training studio is unbelievably well done. The one routine that, while also very well made, didn't really fit in, was the one towards the end. Not only did it feel way too long, it was also out of step with the rest of the film. Beyond just the dancing, the film was topical and interesting in plot as well. Even without the music, a movie about the advent of sound in cinema and the differences in acting and performance that came with it is an interesting an original topic to explore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1920s silent movie era Hollywood. Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) are the biggest stars of Monumental Pictures. Their public persona is a loving couple but in reality, he hates her and can't get rid of the clingy Lina. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) is his piano playing childhood friend. Don meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) as he jumps into her car getting away from adoring fans. They meet again when she jumps out of a cake at a company party. Monumental's boss R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) is blindsided by the success of talking picture "The Jazz Singer" and he tries to jump start his entry with Don and Lina. Cosmo Brown becomes the new music director. It's a struggle to do something new and worst of all, it's a struggle for the self-obsessed and delusional Lina with the horrible voice. The first attempt ends in a laughable disaster. The trio decides to change it into a musical with Kathy dubbing for Lina.The moment that Jean Hagen starts talking is the most hilarious thing. She's a real gut buster. Gene Kelly is a cad and a very likable one. Donald O'Connor is solid in being the nice guy second fiddle. His dancing is so energetic. Debbie Reynolds is completely adorable. The songs are incredible and so catchy. The dancing is iconic. Most importantly, the story is actually funny and compelling. For all the pain and tears shed, this movie is worth every praise it gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film! The color was so vibrant and it added so much to the film because it helped make things over the top, as only musicals can do. The music was fantastic and the tap dancing (though a little too much at times) was also great! As a choir nerd myself, I love musicals of all kind and I had not seen this, but it was so much fun! I definitely found myself humming some of these tunes later through the week. The story was perfect for a musical, it was lighthearted and fun and you still had a bit of a problem to resolve, but nothing that couldn't be solved with music. The characters were all likable except for the really annoying Lina, played by Jean Hagen, who did a great job. The friendship between Cosmo and Don is palpable and the romance between Don and Kathy is sweet and both of these relationships add to the feel-good feel of the movie as a whole. The humor was also there, and though at times it was a bit cheesy it was part of what made the movie memorable. Perhaps not the best of films in other people's book, but it's a 10 in min.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, this movie. It makes me miss tap and ballroom dancing. I haven't seen it in ages, and I absolutely could have sworn that it was black and white, but I'm rather glad that it wasn't, as the color was amazing. A little over the top at some parts but, I understand that they're showing off a bit. However, I honestly don't think it'd be quite as spectacular if it weren't in color. Aside from the work of the camera around the choreography, I can't say I specifically like the filmmaking itself. But, I did enjoy the movie.It's everything a musical should be: funny, witty, universally enjoyable story, historical context, and of course great songs. That's one of the reasons that I think musicals like this are so well remembered, because of the songs. They just stick in your head. I've always had a bit of a problem with movie musicals (90% of the time I'd rather see them on stage) but there's something about the ones from the early 50s that are just great, this one included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis for Singin' in the Rain (1952)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie! I find it the best musical feature since "The Wizard of Oz", and I have been hoping that I would see it again. This was well written, very musical, and very funny. I also love the way the actors did their characters, especially when it comes down to the last scenes of the movie. When I see the film, I really believe that I would want to get into the beat and sing my heart out. I also like the way the actors did the dances, because they had to be choreographed nicely, and that was exactly what happened. The best part about the movie was when it was near the end. I love the way Don and Kathy did the last song of the film. Also, the last scene with the poster was very nice. I love the way the poster was done, and when I saw Don and Kathy kissing in the end, I loved it so much. Overall, this film is one of the best movies that I have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Musical I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catchy songs, beautiful choreography, and a great cast to boot, Singin' in the Rain is by far a gem of it's time. Gene Kelly kills as Don and his teeth are so white! The romance in the film feels natural and real, and gives me plenty of warm-fuzzy feelings. Jean Hagen shines as a would-be antagonist, hilarious and beautiful and infuriating all at once. Together they form a colorful cast of characters, made for the big screen. The Technicolor of the film is stunning and brilliant. Despite some plot loopholes (Couldn't Lina still sue at the end?) I still thoroughly enjoyed this production. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of musical films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is one of the best Musicals I've ever seen. It has such a good story and so cheesy songs that will never leave your mind. I love it. People always talk about it at my town and everyone is always commenting about how good the movie is. Besides, it has been modified now a days into a newer version of the movie which is as good as the old one. If you ares still deciding whether you should watch the movie or not, you should. Trust me you will not regret it. I really love this movie and I'm sure you will too. As I said before, this movie will connect to your life like gum. The scenes are so lovely and the characters act so good. Singing in the rain is a really good movie because I say so. You should watch it now.

		<shortDescription>Exuberant and sublime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is quite possibly my favourite musical of all time, a glorious and sublime experience in movie-making which shines with sheer exuberance and, it has to be said, brilliance. Nobody puts a foot wrong - literally - in this colourful, song-packed outing which really offers career-best turns from the cast.Of course, the film belongs to Gene Kelly, whose professionalism towers above all. The titular sequence is highly memorable, but then so are many others, and none of them a disappointment. This is the kind of musical you can't watch without your foot tapping away, the sort of film that Hollywood producers try to hark back to but fail miserably because they truly don't make 'em like this anymore.The likes of Jackie Chan and other martial arts performers have cited Gene Kelly as a major influence on their work and it's clear to see how; the way Kelly moves, turns, and interacts with props, other performers, and scenery is just flawless. Even better, in some ways, is Donald O'Connor's solo number in which he performs the wall somersaults with dizzying splendour. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is the sort of film that finishes leaving you with the feeling like you want to watch it all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else can it do but make you laugh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a nudging feeling that Singin' in the Rain has gotten the reputation of being overly-corny and shamelessly frothy with age and those accusations have unfortunately lessened the impact of the picture. The film is very obvious in its emotions and obnoxiously sunny in its disposition and tone (don't consider these flaws or criticisms), but it's also a picture to laud for the professionalism of its cast and the inanely addicting melodies of its song and dance numbers.The film concerns Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a popular and egotistical silent film star who is now feeling the switch from silent film to "talkies," films that have actual sound. Lockword often works with his cheery and humorous friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) as well as the shallow and often incorrigible Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) in his films. After the success of 1927's The Jazz Singer (the first film with sound), Lockwood and Lamont's next picture, titled "The Dueling Cavalier," is now a talkie but will need to overcome challenges. The most prominent challenge is Lamont's high-pitched, nearly-insufferable singing voice. Meanwhile, Lockwood meets Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), an attractive and ambitious young actress. At first, they find each other to be irritating in their own ways. But Lockwood must learn to work with Kathy, once the crew discovers her presence may be necessary for the success of the project.Such song and dance numbers from Singin' in the Rain need to be experienced and can't be done justice in a conversation or an analysis. If you've seen the film, would you rather discuss the hilarity of Cosmo's "Make 'Em Laugh" number, involving the character zealously prancing around a stage, doing flips and crazy dances while singing perfectly on key, or view it for the umpteenth time? Would you rather analyze Don Lockwood's titular song and dance (while battling a high-fever and a bad cold), or would you rather see it again and maybe wonder how Kelly performed so well when he was so ill? Musicals are a challenge to review because no matter what words you use to describe it or how you about analyzing the picture and its musical numbers, you simply don't feel like you're doing justice to its quality. I often laud musicals very heavily on atmosphere, sets, and acting, and all of those features are unsurprisingly top-notch here. The element likely to be neglected here is the acting, as Singin' in the Rain feature many talented people performing in a way few could. Such performers needed to be of a certain quality and such actors needed to be up to the challenge of performing a dance with such militaristic precision and rigor.To me, that's why Singin' in the Rain is the masterpiece that it is. The sets can only hurt your eyes with color for so long. The songs can only be fun to hum and sing for so long (I confess - I've been singing "Moses Supposes" for two weeks straight now and feel it ranks as one of the best songs ever in any musical that I have yet to see for its difficulty in pitch and tongue-twisting lyrics). What Singin' in the Rain has that secures its long term success is its outstanding cast of performers that, from the start, are committed to delivering material with such memorable, complex force. Never have I seen a musical so assisted and made successful based solely on the talent of its actors.Starring: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and Donald O'Connor. Directed by: Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>silent films where the rage for 25 years till the talkies came to town did you ever think what it was like to change over to talkies or to make a musical. The problems people have when they buy into their own made up publicity or they think their to big of a star to listen. To any producer this is a horror film to us laymen its pure comedy. Gene Kelly Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor show us the "life" of the actors and others involved. the Comedy is first class and the singing... well you cant get any better then Debbie Reynolds... Its also very interesting to see the glamor of Hollywood at its finest how reality vs. fiction is always being used for "good" publicity. please enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What everyone says - a fun look at the movement from the 'silent movie' era to the sound movies. There are SO MANY fun scenes, like 'moses supposes', etc. And not the least of which is the title song with the beautiful dancing of Kelly.The most surprising is that Jean Hagen did not win 'best supporting' for her role. Just try to imitate her lines. So great and amusing. Of course everybody talks! What's the big deal??The movie is a true classic and everyone should see it. Aside from Kelly, there is the wonderful O'Connor and a very young Debbie Reynolds, who worked so hard on the dancing. I've read somewhere that she said Kelly was such a hard task master so she felt like she HAD to get it right. And was exhausted every night! Wonderful, wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of musicals, however this film had me captivated in so many ways. It isn't even fair! The plot was very relate-able and sweet. Who doesn't like a film about love. I enjoyed the photography. I enjoyed the colors. I enjoyed the costumes. I loved everything! The roles played by the actors were well thought out. It seemed as if they fit the characters perfectly. The antagonist really had a major impact on the film. There was a point in time where the audience felt like she was actually going to get her way. The overall plot of the movie kept people on the edge of their seat. You found yourself feeling like you were fighting for justice right along with the good guys. The lighting was amazing in this film. There was so much use of color that it was hard to pay attention to the two. The lighting did play an important role though. It definitely set the mood. For instance, when one of the main characters was walking through the rain at night, the lights were shining on him but darker in some of the city corners. The technicolor that was used in this film was not as harsh on the eyes as some others.It actually suited the film quite well. It gave more pleasure to the eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Singin' in the Rain...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan of musicals, but I must say that this movie definitely changed my mind about that. It was a great movie to set the bar on how my attitude towards musicals are. I like the whole storyline of the movie and how the movie was put together. The movie, itself, was genius in the fact that the film was based on a making of a film. The colors that were in the film made it pop just so much more and the way the camera work was set had the viewer (myself) lost in the film. Being so occupied on what was going on in the film, you'd forget what and why a person said to get to where you are now in the film. A great classic to just sit down and watch with others who also like musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a treat to finally be able to see the movie where the famous song comes from, and an excellent film this is. It has a lot of great characters, including the two leads, a movie star, and a Voice-over. Jean Hagen makes an excellent antagonist for the movie; she's snide, controlling, loves to be the cream of the crop, and you just hate her throughout the whole film. At least you can laugh at her voice(sorry to offend Jean Hagen if that's how she actually talked). The scene where Don daydreams about the final draft of the play...pretty much looks like what getting high sounds like(not that I've ever gotten high); lights flashing, people jumping up and down, and a weird song in the background. Still, it's a great movie all the way through, especially the ending. Everyone should watch it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overview</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) has incredible cinematography, especially considering how early in the color era it was made. The whole movie has a very smooth, unedited feel, with long, smooth takes, especially in the dance numbers. It's almost as though the scenes were done in one take, as you would expect for a life-stage production of a musical! The acting by Jean Hagen (Lina) and Debbie Reynolds (Kathy) are my favorite parts of the film, however. They play such contrasting characters and each made their part so their own it's really something to see. Then you throw in the famous songs, "Singin' in the Rain", "Moses Supposes" and "Good Morning", this musical is just fun waiting to be watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly this was one of the most beautiful musicals I have ever seen. I would not consider myself a real musical fan but this was a very enjoyable movie. The colors and the imagery were brilliant, particularly one section had these amazing colors, as some sort of technicolor extravaganza that i thought had made a great scene. The acting is also top notch, with characters really coming to life. The only thing i didn't like about the film was that the plot was so ironically asinine it hurt. Now certainly in some ways it was a dig at the film industry but for the most part the plot of this movie was basically just designed to have a musical. Its a musical about being in a musical.

		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain has always been one of my favorite musicals. It is a automatic pick-me-up for me. The fun upbeat songs will instantly put you in a fabulous mood and the dancing makes you just want to get up and dance. Gene Kelly is so great in this movie, his character is hilarious and Kelly really brings him to life. The plot of the movie is really great too; there is never a dull moment in the film. Another things that really adds to this movie is all the bright colors. Everything in this movie is bright: the set, the costumes, even the makeup was a little on the bright side but I absolutely love it. I might be a little bias since I love musicals but I think for someone who does not like musicals this would be a great one to ease into, just because of its humor and happy messages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Make 'Em Laugh!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is part musical, part comedy, and part romance, but it is always all of these things at the same time. The story follows Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly), a famous silent movie star, and his friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) as they brace for Hollywood's transition into the Age of Sound. This period in film history serves only as a backdrop for one of the most lavish films ever made. In addition to the comedy, what makes "Singin' in the Rain" so memorable is the dance numbers. Watching O'Connor flail around during "Make 'Em Laugh" is hilarious and nerve-wracking at the same time, and Gene Kelly's infamous "Singin' in the Rain" epitomizes the film's spirit.The "Broadway Melody" sequence that Gene Kelly pitches to producers toward the end of the film is often cited as a flaw for slowing the film's pace. This is just wrong. If the sequence had been omitted or cut in any way, the film would be less brilliant for it. Every aspect of this scene is a work of technical genius. Watching Kelly and dancer Cyd Charisse move across the pastel pink background, Charisse's sash blowing around her with amazing flourish, is one of the most incredible experiences I've had watching a movie. "Singin' in the Rain" is a perfect example of that kind of great film that unites its audience through pure, unfettered entertainment. It's loud, it's colorful, and it's funny as all hell. The film isn't just about love or the importance of doing the right thing, though it's characters are very much concerned with those things. The film itself - every song, every dance, every screaming fan chasing after Don Lockwood in his car - is about how movies can be magical experiences that remove us from our lives and force us to have fun for a little while. Even if we don't need it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can tell why this movie is loved by so many people. Whether you like musicals or not, this movie is a whole lot of fun to watch. Almost everything about this movie was perfect. The cinematography was excellent with many long fluid shots, the transitions between scenes were great, the story line was amazing, but the actors definitely take the cake for most spectacular. Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds were fantastic in their performances. As triple threats, they both shine in singing, dancing, and acting, making it a truly enjoyable film to watch. However, my absolute favorite part of this film was Donald O'Connor. "Make 'Em Laugh" is easily one of the best scenes in the film. His ability to make singing and dancing look effortless is super impressive and makes for an unforgettable performance. After seeing him in this, I looked up what other films he was in so I could potentially watch them. This movies only flaw was the awkwardly place dance number towards the end of the film. You know the one...As a big lover of live-action musicals, I really loved watching this. I enjoyed every second of it and plan on watching it many more times. I highly recommend this to anyone, regardless of ones movie taste. It's a really feel good movie that will make you smile and laugh. Excellent film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was actually very good. I'm not a real fan of musicals but I actually enjoyed watching this one due to the time period and the color clarity. I'm not sure why but this film seemed very bright in color and the picture quality was very clear even during dark scenes such as when Don Lockwood was literally singing in the rain after he dropped off Kathy Selden at her house. I also found it to be very comical like during the scene where Don and Cosmo were messing around with the speech therapist helping Don. Overall I found Cosmo to be the funniest character in the whole film. He was very likable and cracked so many jokes that it was impossible to not find him funny. The sound was very good in this movie too, I actually find it kind of ironic that it is a movie about actors filming movies and learning how to speak in their films. You could hear how bad the sound quality was when they were trying to record Lina Lamonts voice for her film. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I believe it's the first time I've ever enjoyed a musical.</fullReview>

Cosmo was my favorite charter though and I'm sure many other would agree he plays the perfect part of comic relief without overdoing it. The movie is full of good laughs and heartwarming moments that anyone with a soul could enjoy (unless you are evil) and is a very memorable film.

		<shortDescription>Forgettable Songs Hinder An Otherwise Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is often hailed as the greatest musical ever made. It's constantly referenced in modern film, and has been universally labeled as a masterpiece. So would it be strange if I were to say this film would've been much better without the musical numbers?I have nothing against musicals. Some of my favorite films are musicals. But the songs in Singin' in the Rain are mostly mediocre and instantly forgettable, diminishing an otherwise entertaining and enjoyable production.Don Lockwood is enjoying life as a Hollywood star, even if he does have to work with the irritating Lina Lamont. However, when a new kind of film known as "talkies" becomes popular, Lockwood, as well as his two friends, Cosmo Brown and Kathy Selden must learn to adjust to this new kind of cinema.As I mentioned before, the musical numbers and songs are among the only things keeping me from giving Singin' in the Rain a better score. I wanted to love this film, but I can only truthfully say that I liked it. More often than not, the songs serve more as filler than something that actually progresses the story, or enhances it.Only the title song, "Singin' in the Rain," and "Moses Supposes" remain in memory. All other numbers are unremarkable and uninteresting. If you asked me to recount any of the lyrics to any of the other songs, I would struggle to come up with more than a few words. This is a huge shame, because outside of the musical numbers, Singin' in the Rain is a cheery and entertaining film. The characters are well developed, which makes the story richer. Don Lockwood is confident, but only when the public opinion of himself is positive. Lina Lamont has fame and fortune, and everything she wants, but becomes grumpy when she is not loved by Lockwood. To contrast, Cosmo Brown is a nobody, but is thankful for what he gets and is always positive. Kathy Selden is the most uninteresting character. The spunk and personality displayed in her first few scenes disappears after she makes amends with Lockwood.Likewise, the acting is excellent. Gene Kelly pulls off confident Don Lockwood perfectly, while Donald O'Connor is perfect as Cosmo Brown. Jean Hagen is great for the despicable Lina Lamont, and Debbie Reynolds makes the best of her character, Kathy Selden. But it's Douglas Fowley who steals most of the scenes as the cranky director.It's a shame that in a film where music is the main point, that the musical numbers are also the weakest aspect. The actual film is good, corny, feel-good stuff that's fun to watch. You get some laughs, you get some smiles, it's all in good fun. Unfortunately, the songs lead to some terribly dull stretches that break the flow and ruin this otherwise highly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain falls in the genre of Romance and comedy. The musical is about a movie star Don Lockwood who was based in theatre and Vaudeville comedy before he got a lucky break and made it large. He meets an aspiring actress Kathy Selden and is drawn to her because of her forthrightness in her critique of his acting skills and later, falls in love with her. In order to make the rather difficult transition from silent movies to talkies, Don's production house needs to think out of the box as his co-superstar Lina Lamont is unable to adjust to the change. With the aid of Cosmo, his best friend who has been with him from the very start, and Kathy, the production house is able to turn an unsuccessful talkie into a buoyant musical.The strength of the movie lies in the effervescent portrayal of the main characters. Don's 'dignified' flashback sequence, an enchanting and bittersweet love affair with the theatre, sets the tone for the movie. As the movie goes on, one cannot help but fall in love with the characters and the delectable manner in which the dialogue is constructed among them. Be it Don mocking Kathy at the after premiere party, his charming confession that leaves Kathy blushing or Lina threatening to sue Monumental, the acting is so genuine that the viewer is engaged all the time. Glimpses of how Hollywood works behind the scene adds to the exciting feeling of going to the movies in order to be charmed.Gene Kelly portrays a superstar in this movie and certainly acts like one. He is brilliant in his role as the protagonist and puts in a charismatic performance. Donald O'Connor and Debie Reynolds are both adorable in the movie. Their inspired camaraderie and attempts to cheer Don up in times of trouble are beautifully done. Cosmo adds the spark to the scenes that liven them up and make them endearing. Kathy's innocence and impeccable affection for Don is charming. Jean Hagen is wonderful in her portrayal of Lina Lamont. In scenes with the diction coach, on set of the new talkie, her scheming to get rid of Kathy and the final premiere of the movie, she evokes such a wide array of emotions. You feel pity for her cacophonous voice at one time and loathe her for her nefarious plotting at the end.The heart of the movie lies in its musical numbers and sequences: Make em laugh, Singing in the Rain, Good Morning, Beautiful girl, Moses Supposes, Broadway Melody. All of them are sprightly and refreshing. Each of these numbers is an awe-inspiring and captivating work in itself. They portray unfettered emotions capturing joy, surprise, love and hope.Over the course of the movie, I felt as if a spell had been cast on me that left me enchanted. Musicals can have this effect and Singing in the Rain is definitely one of the best that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can't you love this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mini-review...This movie always makes me happy, it's just so damn happy, energetic and entertaining. I hate musicals, but I love this, I hate (most of) Hollywood films, but this works as an satire. It's a strong film in every aspect. The story is great, it's basically about how "talkies" came to Hollywood and killed silent and what happened to those silent film stars. It's a really great satire and a criticism to Hollywood's mentality of ditching old stars when something new comes. The music bits are great. While that kind of music isn't what I normally listen (my favorite band is Velvet Underground..), but it still fits with the mood of the film, happy. And you can see how these people were very talented, they sing well and they dance very well. The dance moves and how it's directed is not what you would see today. The camera stays with the dancers and rarely cuts away. Showing they have a lot of talent, unlike today when they try to hide that with music video style editing. The use of colors is just wonderful in this. A lot of strong and bright colors makes a lot of the mood. The sets are the typical Hollywood sets, even when they are outside, you can clearly see that they are in a studio. But maybe that was the point, shooting everything in a studio, like they did in the late 1920's and early 1930's. It's one of the best feel-good movies. And while it's not one of my favorite films, it's still no doubt my favorite musical. When ever I've had a bad day, I can watch this and feel alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a review of how this film fits into the careers of the stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't need a 500+ person to tell you that this film is a classic in terms of the abundance and quality of the music, dancing and comedy, So, I'd like to fill my space with insights into the stars' overall relations and how certain key performances relate to their previous and subsequent films.It's the only film that paired two of the greatest male musical comedy entertainers of that era: Gene Kelly and Don O'Connor. We might wonder why they weren't paired again? Although Gene was a well established MGM star, this was Don's first musical outside his home studio of Universal. He would do another MGM musical the next year: "I Love Melvin". Debbie Reynolds again was the romantic lead. Clearly, this film was not given the royal treatment of the present film and is much shorter. But, it gives us an opportunity to see what Don and Debbie could do without Gene and Cyd(quite a lot of fun,too!) Reportedly, working with Gene on the present film was rather a traumatic experience for both Don and Debbie, especially the latter. Gene's extreme perfectionism and egoism was legendary. Nonetheless, nearly all his costars, especially Debbie, improved their dancing and acting by working with him. However, neither Don nor Debbie was anxious to do another film with Gene, and neither did.Debbie was actually an anomaly in Gene's '50s musical comedies. In every other of his last 5 Hollywood musicals beginning in '51, his first choice as his leading lady and main female dance partner was Cyd Charisse. Cyd had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade, mostly as a cameo dance specialist. Gene wanted her to costar in "An American in Paris" the previous year, but a pregnancy ruled that out. Of course, she was a conspicuous dance specialist in the present film. She was his leading lady in the much less commercially successful "Brigadoon" and "It's Always Fair Weather", but declined this role in Gene's last Hollywood musical: "Les Girls", as did "An American in Paris" costar Leslie Caron. I think they rightly smelled a turkey.I'd like to talk about Don's famous "Make 'Em Laugh" solo performance, having seen nearly all his Hollywood musicals. Although there are certainly original features to this madcap performance, you might be interested to know that a number of the main features can be recognized in several of his previous Universal films, from '45-'51. Thus, in "Top Man", Don and Peggy Ryan dance with cloth dummies in one scene. In "Something in the Wind", he does the bit behind the couch, although without the dummy.In "Feudin', Fightin'and Fussin'", he does the terminal plunge through a papery wall after dancing. In "Double Crossbones", we see his jumping up on a wall, followed by a backwards flip. Even the tune was essentially recycled from the "Be a Clown" Gene Kelly-Judy Garland performance in "The Pirate"Having also seen nearly all of Gene's Hollywood musical comedies, I'd like to comment on the relation of some of his past and future performances to this film. Back in '44, he costarred in a color film with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers, called "Cover Girl". Several features of that film have often lead to it being dubbed 'the poor man's "Singing in the Rain' ". Phil takes the place of Don, as the odd man out in the central romance, but nonetheless an intimate friend of the romantic couple. Rita takes the place of Debbie, being a stage dancer and singer. This threesome do a street dance of joy, sometimes arm in arm, twice, including the parting scene. This somewhat resembles the "Good Morning" and threesome "Singing in the Rain" scenes in the present film. Also, Gene does a solo street dance with his shadow, somewhat foreshadowing his "Singing in the Rain" solo street dance in this film. However, there is a critical mood difference. That 'Alter-Ego' dance was inspired by frustration and apprehension about his future relationship with Rita's character, not by the elation of a new found love, as in the present film.As regards his future films, we see Gene's joyful "Singing in the Rain" solo as a model for functionally equivalent solos in his next two musicals: "It's Always Fair Weather" and "Brigadoon", in the form of the "I Like Myself" and "Almost Like Being in Love" dances. I find the former performance, done on roller skates, his most challenging and interesting dance. Don, who didn't do solo dances in this context in his prior Universal musicals, did a functionally similar new love-inspired performance in the first portion of his long "I Wanna Wander" performance in MGM's "I Love Melvin", and his classy "A Man Chases a Girl" dance performance in Fox's "There's No Business Like Show Business". His equivalent solo dance in Fox's "Call Me Madam" was, like Gene's previous dances in "Cover Girl" and "On the Town", born out of romantic frustration, but seemed like a dance of enthusiasm, because he got drunk from his frustration! Even MGM's Fred Astaire got in on this trend with his classic new love -inspired ceiling and wall "You're All the World to Me" dance in "Royal Wedding", the previous year, and his solo "Seeing is Believing" levitation dance on a high building in "The Belle of New York", released the same year as "Singing in the Rain", and unfortunately overshadowed by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movie musicals!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never a big fan of musicals as a kid. They often lagged forever and I never really listened to the lyrics. I got very bored, very fast. Then in my junior year of high school, my friends pushed me at the last minute to audition for my school's production of Cabaret and I ended up getting a small role. I started to fall in love with the genre and the following year, I landed the male lead (Professor Henry Higgins) in their production of a show that's considered to be one of the greatest musicals of all time, My Fair Lady. The experience changed me and really made me appreciate the process that goes into making one.The first time I watched "Singin' in the Rain" was for an assignment. I could not believe what I had been missing. Everyone knows the famous title sequence where Gene Kelly, Donald O' Connor and Debbie Reynolds are walking towards the camera in yellow slickers and holding umbrellas as well as singing the title song. This may seem cheesy for many and may be a huge turn off if all you know about the film is this and Gene Kelly's infamous "Singin' in the Rain" number. It's so iconic that I practically walked into the scene when I went on The Great Movie Ride in Disneyworld. This is the musical that works for people who aren't even a big fans of musicals.What is it that makes this film so great? The level of talent that the three leads possessed back then is more than the biggest stars in Hollywood today. Gene Kelly plays the likable and charming Don Lockwood in a role that was basically made for him. He effortlessly makes song and dance look like anyone can do it, but Kelly has been dancing since childhood. He is not a show off however; the first thing I wanted to do (and I'm sure everyone wants to do but never actually does) after seeing the film is sign up for tap dancing lessons. He and Donald O' Connor make dancing look like it's the greatest job in the world, such as in their "Moses Supposes" number. O' Connor provides a lot of comic relief and is a likable personality all his own. Many people underestimate his big "Make Em' Laugh" song which is one of the better numbers in the film.This brings me to my next point: there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. I'll repeat that: there are no bad numbers in Singin' in the Rain. Each number with it's fusion of song, dance and innovative creativity is never boring to watch. The same rules apply for the scenes, Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen have created several little witty moments and gags which are associated with the genre of musicals. The big rule with musicals is that you have to accept how unrealistic they are and Singin' in the Rain is no exception but even so, most audiences will embrace this. For example, the unscripted facial expressions of Cosmo Brown. Big kudos also go to actress Jean Hagen who plays the villainess Lina Lamont. Although an unlikable character, Hagen succeeds at making her very humorous.There's a reason this film is considered to be one of the greatest of all time, but to understand the magic of why it is you'll have to see it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singin' in the Rain (1952)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Singin' in the Rain is the best musical of all time. This is such an energetic film, definitely one for the whole family. Its about a how a studio deals with the new switch to sound movies, in 1927. I used to watch this film with my great grandfather all the time. I don really like musicals, especially modern ones (like the TV show glee), but Singin' in the Rain is different and I don't really think of it as musical (yes I know it is). Even though musicals always have that sense of make-believe, i feel Singin' in the Rain has a more real feeling to it than most musicals. I give this film a 10 out of 10 because it is such a great musical and its one of my favorite movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best if not the best film I ever seen, it has all the elements. Comedy, romance, and sadness. The dancing is top notch full of excitement and rhythm, the actors played their roles to perfection especially in the musical numbers. Cosmo's "make em laugh" solo number was my personal favorite because it did what the title said; made me laugh. The singing in the rain is another one of my favorite dance numbers but overall I enjoyed all the dance numbers but those two are the top on my list. The plot was great it ended the way that everyone would want with the mean person not getting anything and it makes everyone happy. This musical is my favorite and if you haven't seen it as of yet go out and buy a copy , don't rent buy so you can watch it whenever you want.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had me wanting to learn to dance like Gene Kelly, it's very interesting how the film showed the steps to make a film within it. The dance choreography was excellent. The scene when Donald O'Connor dances in the rain, a beautiful scene. Gene Kelly is unbelievably talented, never realized he was a director, along with being an incredible dancer and actor. The photographer did a great job at capturing the color within each scene, although the singing in the rain scene had little color, the color that was present seemed to glow with exponential value. One of the best long takes of it's time. All the other dances and comical conversations within the film just added to this great film.</fullReview>

I didn't think there were any problems with the lighting or angles of the camera in each scene. I think they were all shot very nicely and captured the moods very well. Before this I only saw the dance scenes in this movie, so it was nice putting a story line to them and it came out beautifully. I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone.

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie many times, I think now that I am older I appreciate it a lot more than I use to. The dancing always fits the mood, which was great for there were SO many different moods, for example when you had slow droopy dances for sad moments and then up to beat almost silly dances for happy moments. I loved the dance that Donald O'Connor did in the beginning, it was an awesome stunt piece dance that had a very Charlie Chaplin style to it. The chemistry between Kelly and O'Connor was awesome, I was very convinced and amused the whole time. I thought that Reynolds and Kelly had a lot of good chemistry even though they didn't have much of a good relationship off set. I thought also for not being a dancer Reynolds was awesome!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dancing, Singin', and Technicolor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain, 1952Let me begin this by saying I'm not into musicals. I don't care for watching dancing in film or listening to gleeful songs throughout movies. I get bored by this easily, and often I feel like the songs unnecessarily drag on. That being said, Singin' in the Rain is my exception.In this up tempo, feel-good musical film about the transition from Old to New Hollywood, leading man Gene Kelly puts on an absolutely incredible performance. It's hard to believe that Kelly performed that unforgettable title number ("Singin in the Rain", obviously) in the midst of a 103 degree fever. Donald O'Connor also gives an outstanding and comical performance, while also giving us some memorable numbers. And Debbie Reynolds...Who could imagine that the beautiful starlet who put on such a show throughout the film with her wonderful voice, had been quoted years later saying this had been the most difficult experience in her life aside from surviving childbirth? Well, she was no dancer. But it's so easy to look past that in this incredible movie. I found myself rooting for her character the whole time, in spite of that nasty, annoying Lina Lamont lady (Jean Hagen). But it was much more than just the acting, singing, and dancing that made this movie what it really is. The gorgeous, well-crafted sets of Old Hollywood, the Monumental Pictures studio, the rainy city street, etc. are just phenomenally done and simply cannot go unnoticed while watching this. And my favorite aspect to this film, possibly, is the amazing color. The brightness and vividness that emits from the picture while watching it is just superb. It really makes the film that much more enjoyable to view. Simply amazing.Once again, I repeat that I am not a fan of musicals. But this certainly is an exception. This movie is just great. Everything about it is awesome. See this classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musical comedy about a production company who makes the transition from silent films to sound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best films I had seen in a while. The combination of bright color, diversity of characters, and the array of talented singers and dancers made it a fun and comical production. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) was my favorite of the characters. Hit witty comments and hilarious performance of "Make Them Laugh" made him standout although he technically wasn't a main character. The budding romance of Don and Kathy can be seen from the very beginning as a sort of Screwball Comedy way of making them poke fun of each other at first but slowly put aside their differences and fall in love. I loved how, especially in the beginning, they sort of make fun of the materialistic norms of Hollywood. The public's obsession with "power couples" and the idea of Lockwood and Lamont as a household name. But as the movie goes on Don starts to lose interest in following the Hollywood norms and becomes more interested in giving the love of his life, Kathy Seldon, some credit for her amazing talents as an actress and singer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singing in the Rain definitely met every expectation I had and then some. I hadn't heard much about the movie, but the name was very familiar and anything I had heard about the movie was very positive. In the beginning it was a little slow, but as soon as the singing and the dancing started I couldn't not stop smiling, I enjoyed every moment of it. The color of course was amazing, especially compared to all the black and white movies I have been seeing. But the talent of the actors is what makes this movie. Gene Lockwood and Donald O'Connor are a great pair together as they dance many duets, never missing a beat and always staying on key. I found their tap dancing to be amazing. The singing also blew me away; Gene Lockwood Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are triple threats as the acted, sung, and danced their hearts out. I never thought I would enjoy a musical and was kind of nervous to have to review this movie, but I must say this has to be one of the best movies I have ever see, it really blows me away. I found this film absolutely entertaining and would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film. Its very lighthearted and fun, providing 100 minutes of non-stop entertainment. The film also surpassed my expectations, because I generally do not like old films and comedies. But this one keep me entertained during it's whole run.The film's plot takes place during the transition from silent films to talking pictures, the protagonist is a successful Hollywood actor who meets an upstart. Later the two fall in love, in a traditional cliché. However, the film is not locked in the plot, which instead serves only as a scaffold to place the many spectacular musical pieces of the film. So the lack of originality and complexity in the plot or in terms of the main characters do not hurt the film as much as it could.Overall, I would say that this musical is highly enjoyable for all audiences despite the fact it is a 60 year old film. It held well with time, differently from Casablanca, for instance, which I found rather mediocre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My second all time favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I have the words to describe how wonderful this film is. It starts off being a parody of silent film and then looks at the transition into talkies. There is some semblance of truth to this as there are reports out there where either studio bosses or directors are reported to have said " so and so can speak". Donald O'Connor gives his best ever performance I think in this film and the quality of the whole team just shines through. I saw this first many years ago and have watched it many times since and it does not lose that magic that denotes a great film. The great moment of course is the "Singing in the Rain" sequence which is just magnificent but then the denouement at the end where "Cathy" is revealed as the singer is just joyous. Sit down relax and enjoy. This is movie making at its absolute best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is movie magic, now I don't particularly like musicals. But this is one of the great ones with some great and memorable musical numbers. The singing and dancing is spot on and it's a real treat to watch. Just about ever scene in this movie is memorable. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in the theater today thanks to TCM. There was a lot of old couples and their daughter in the theater and it was nice to enjoy this movie with the older audiences. It sort of felt like I traveled back in time to the 50's for 2 hours. Gene Kelly is just amazing and has the right to be called the triple threat, he can dance, he can sing and he can act. Well more so in the first two areas. Donald O'Connor brings so much energy to this movie. Debbie Reynolds is just spot on in this and she is one of the few actresses I have respect for. The story is unique and fun, it's about a actor and actresses playing actor and actress and it's a musical within a musical. The humor in this is just sweet and yet it really works. It got me laughing a few times. This is a magical experience and it's a film that all film lovers should watch.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Musicals used to be one of the most popular Genres of all time with classic hits like Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, Clamity Jane and Fiddler on the roof. But, like in every Genre, there is always one that rules the roost...This is my review on Singing In The Rain.The plot goes like this;It's the roaring twenties and the silent era of film dominates public entertainment. At this time, Don Lockwood is the most famous man in the film industry staring in hundreds of popular silent films along side his love interest Lina Lamont. When the first ever talking picture is released, directors and producers are forced to leave the era behind and begin making "talkies". Things turn out for the worst when Don's first vocal film is a disaster which would lead to his downfall. However, his best friends Cosmo Brown and Kathy Selden decide to turn things around and persuade Don to transfer the film into a musical before the film ruins his career.There's no other phrase for it; Singing in the rain is a masterpiece. Trying to pick faults in this film is like trying to pick faults in a perfect diamond- There is none!So what makes the film so good?Lets start with the acting. Acting legend Gene Kelly stars as the main character, Don, and his performance is WAY above average. This is the film that turned his career around and there is good reason for this. The way he smiles, the way he laughs- what ever he does you buy the character. His part is quite hard to play and Gene gets the emotions of the character spot on. He also is a fantastic singer, but I will get onto that later. However, while Gene is brilliant, the actor who steals the show is Donald O'Connor's Cosmo Brown. NEVER have I laughed so much at an actor's performance in all my life. There is not a man on earth who can play the part of Cosmo Brown like Donald. You often find yourself looking at I'm even when he is not speaking in case he is making some hysterical facial expression. How he never brakes into i cink of laughing is beyond comprehension, but Cosmo Brown has to be one of the greatest characters in movie history. Finally, Kathy Selden is played by the lovely Debbie Reynolds. Her performance is great, though there isn't as much to say about it as the two actors i mentioned above.The plot is actually really good for a musical. Musicals are usually pretty basic films with light hearted plots, which is fine, but Singing in the rain delivers more than that. Singing in the rain is definitely great for young children as the plot is easy to follow and there is a lot of funny material in the film to keep them entertained. This is the film children should be watching instead of films that have adult material which children seem to like these days. The film is also great for casual viewers who love music and romance and if you are one of these people, you will be greatly impressed. The film, however, really stands out for die hard film fans as is has all the things above plus a little more. There are lots of references to films before it's time like Lovey Mary and even Citizen Kane. The man plot even revolves around The Jazz Singer, the very first talking film. They could have easily just said that the vocal films are coming into fashion, but this film takes it one step further and actually addresses the actual film that started it all which relates the film to the real world.The film's greatest feature is it's musical numbers. The music in this film surpasses the music of the modern age by FAR. Each song is lively, innocent, funny and heartwarming and you actually feel the love and emotion that went into writing these marvellous songs. I am only going to address some of the songs cause I would rather you go into the film and be surprised. "Make 'um laugh" (sang by Donald) is the funniest song of the film, which really relates to the title. It consists of Donald pulling of a serious of stunts and I still cant fathom how he did them. You see him bouncing off wall and flirting with an old doll. Garenteed laugh. May favourite song in the whole film the theme song, Singing in the rain. Every time your hear the tune you are instantly prepared to have your heart filled with Joy at the brilliant lyrics. The love song by Gene, which is debatably his best scene in all his acting career. The icon of him hanging happily onto a lamppost is one of the most famous movie symbols of all time- and with good reason! It's time to wrap the review up. Singing in the rain is so wonderful that words cannot sum it up in one single review. The romance is great, the songs are perfect, the plot is intriguing and the acting is amongst the best in history. This is the film i'll be watching again and again. This is the film I will be sharing with my children. This is one of the best movies ever made!I'm definitely giving Singing in the rain a 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge Gene Kelly fan and I've loved this movie since i was a kid. I'm not particularly fond of musicals at all, but the plot in this one far outshines the fact they sing. The classic story of an evil lady trying to sabotage an innocent girl is almost always an entertaining story. The whole script was just so well written from every stage of the movie, from the flashbacks in the beginning, to the end, and even some of the song lyrics, every things perfect. What i love most about this movie is the fact that it blends comedy so well with the fact that its also a musical. First and foremost, it's a love story with twists and turns and such, and secondly, they sing. I mean, i have to admit some songs were catchy and the choreography was phenomenal, i just find most musicals something hard to relate to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate musicals! I absolutely can not stand them! I loathe them!Singin' in the Rain is different though. Most importantly, it has music that I actually want to listen to. Most musicals are bogged down with love songs that I don't care to hear, or songs just written to elongate the running time. I never once said, "Oh Jeeze, they're singing again?"It's a clever concept that was done very well. It's like the Artist, but better! It was so cheerful and the colors blew my mind.Even the dancing in most musicals is cringe worthy. In "Singin'", it actually inspired me to learn to dance. (For about a day, but those catchy songs were stuck in my head for at least two weeks after that.)I could really get into musicals if they were all like this one. Please God, help man make more musicals like Singin' in the Rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Is Singin' in the Excellent Movie Category</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between 1930's and 1950's, musicals were considered the poison of the movie industry. This movie, however, was one of the best musicals released in the 20th century. This one included many feelings of happiness and compassion and was very entertaining to watch. With lots of color as well as some of the wits shown by some of the many characters, especially the end,this movie has lived up to the height and made it to the top of best movies of all time. All in all, the movie, in my opinion, was a spectacular piece of work and deserved its position on higher lists. It also caught my interest that the lead actress was also involved in a movie that I had also watched just recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best musical ever. Thanks MGM.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was recently chosen by British critics as the best musical ever made, and not by accident. The song and dance numbers are elaborately staged and full of energy, the production design is gorgeous and everything looks colorful and lit up brightly in classic MGM fashion with lots of high key lighting effects. No detail was spared and no expense either, on costumes, set pieces. It just looks phenomenal. Also - rare for a musical comedy - the plot is actually worthy of being followed. So many musicals have just enough plot to string the audience along between songs, but this one has a clever, funny story line that plunges briskly ahead, tracking the ups and downs of the coming of sound to the movies. It could have been done as a comedy without the songs and still been a great movie, and how many musicals can say that?More than anything, though, the musical numbers actually fit into the emotional background of the story. Yes, cast members start singing or jigging and music appears from no discernible source - pretty standard for the era - but the numbers are a joyous expression of friendship, a means to express ideas, to mock, to revel in the moment. So many musicals have to contrive reasons to put in song and dance numbers, and sometimes don't even bother with logic and just throw them in anyway. Here, no musical number fails to fit logically or character-wise. This movie is a triumph. Watch it once a year forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie musical with no stage forebear.Consider what's in the mix: A cachet of songs, all tried-and-true from other movies. A cast that was at the top of its form, all the way from Kelly himself to the supporting leads played by Rita Moreno and Millard Mitchell. A script that is, at once, romantic and exciting and sharp and funny.Stir together with a generous heaping of MGM color and a dash of a director with a stellar pedigree and the result is, well, something like "Singin' in the Rain." There's not a misstep in the movie's entire 103-minute running time. I love the pokes at early filmmaking ("She never *did* figure out where that microphone was, boss!") and the sheer energy of the musical numbers ("Fit as a Fiddle," "Good Mornin'").Not only that, but there's not a more romantic scene in all of filmdom that can compare with Reynolds and Kelly dancing to "You Were Meant for Me." Their side-by-side tap dancing says more about how they feel about each other than pages and pages of dialog.Great stuff! If you think this movie is just the sequence of Kelly splashing like a five-year-old in a puddle, you obviously haven't seen the entire film. Do so--now! You won't regret it! PS: In the "rent-this-too" category, if you've seen and love "Singin' in the Rain," check out "The Band Wagon." It skewers the world of theater in much the same way as this film roasts Hollywood!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I absolutely loved his upbeat film! From the beginning, it is obvious that the underlying theme to this film is the ever-popular love story. However, Singin' in the Rain is a modern, colorful film with more to it. When their original movie that they are making goes down the drain, characters Dan and Cathy find a way to bring it to the top. Lena is downright dumb and hilarious at the same time. Her voice is anything but ordinary, which fits right in with this original movie. And so the film ends with the perfect demise of the enemy, Lena, and a show of modern dance, song and images. Great musical!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was just all in all great and I'm glad I watched it! I love musicals and this was just another great musical in my opinion. The songs were great and the audio with the movie sounded crisp and clear. The shots were great especially during the songs because the photographer had to follow the dancers around which can be difficult to do smoothly. The photography excellence can be seen the best during the song "Make 'em laugh" where the camera follows the actor throughout the dance and as he jumps on top of a piano and such. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheery funny movie, even if you hate musicals you'll still enjoy "Singing in the Rain" it's just that great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being somewhat ambivalent about musicals and having a general tendency not to watch movies which debuted before I was born, I had no real knowledge of this movie other than its existence. I also was only peripherally familiar with Technicolor and wasn't aware it was really any different than any other color film technology. Now that I have seen both, it is easy to understand why this movie is so famous.Yes, to those of us who are less able to appreciate the intricacies of some of the extended dance scenes, they can seem too long, but this is a small criticism which is easily washed away by the deluge of all the other excellent qualities the movie possesses. The acting is, of course, superb, but I think I was struck most by how humorous and clever the writing is. The music and singing are also exceptional. Every time someone says "Good morning!", I am reminded of Debbie Reynolds' particular way of singing the words. The vibrancy of the color saturation due to the Technicolor process lends the movie an almost dream-like quality that fits so well, I cannot imagine it any other way. The camera work is so fluid it sometimes seems the actors are dancing with, not just for the camera. The costumes and sets are great and done is such a way that the movie has aged well; it doesn't seem to be a movie made over 60 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly one of my favorite musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I admittedly am not too big a fan of musicals, I was able to find plenty of entertainment in "Singin' In The Rain". The dancing was skillful and impressive to watch, and there were plenty of funny moments that kept me laughing and tied to the film. One of my favorite moments from the film is when Don Lockwood is talking about his past in show business, and he always says something that directly contradicts whatever comes up on the screen. There were plenty of other funny moments in the film that I enjoyed as well. The only complaint I would have about this film is that I thought that one of the musical bits was a little too long (The bit where Don describes his character's entrance to Broadway), but again, I usually end up walking away when ANY musical bits come on in other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved some musicals in my childhood - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins, to say a view, and I came into watching this musical with an open mind. While watching it, it was alright but overall I did not really care for it. I cannot really place my finger on it, maybe I was not really all that interested in the dancing but something set me off to it. I really enjoyed Donald O'Connors role and I enjoyed his performance. It made me look him up and want to watch more movies with him in it, and to me? If a movie can provoke a person to watch something new and find some type of joy in it, than it did its job.

		<fullReview>How can you not consider Singin In The Rain to NOT be one of the best musical film that has ever been made, or ever will be made?? The three lead actors were absolutely fantastic, and perfectly cast. Gene Kelly never danced better, Debbie Reynolds gave one of her greatest and probably most underrated performances, and Donald O'Connor was never slicker and more witty. The chemistry between the three leads is perfect, Gene and Debbie exude growing love. You feel a REAL friendship between Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown. This chemistry is one of the reasons why this film works so well; can you see Howard Keel dancing in the rain as originally planned? Or someone else besides Debbie popping out of a cake. The music is the best and the dancing is SECOND TO NONE. The most famous obviously is Gene Kelly splashing around in puddles; and is the second most recognizable moment is screen history (first is Scarlett O'Hara's silhouette in front of Tara-with that classic score behind her.) I LOVE Debbie Reynolds, so I really enjoyed "All I Do Is Dream Of You." But my favorite number by far is "Good Mornin'" and this is why: it is the only number to include all three leads.Can't get any better than this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Silent Films To Talkies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is a comedy musical film starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds and directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, with Kelly also providing the choreography. It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to "talkies."Hollywood, 1927: the silent-film romantic team of Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont is the toast of Tinseltown. While Lockwood and Lamont personify smoldering passions on screen, in real life the down-to-earth Lockwood can't stand the egotistical, brainless Lina. He prefers the company of aspiring actress Kathy Selden, whom he met while escaping his screaming fans. Watching these intrigues from the sidelines is Cosmo Brown, Don's best pal and on-set pianist. Cosmo is promoted to musical director of Monumental Pictures by studio head R.F. Simpson when the talking-picture revolution commences. That's all right for Cosmo, but how will talkies affect the upcoming Lockwood-Lamont vehicle "The Dueling Cavalier"? Don, an accomplished song-and-dance man, should have no trouble adapting to the microphone. Lina, however, is another matter; put as charitably as possible, she has a voice that sounds like fingernails on a blackboard. The disastrous preview of the team's first talkie has the audience howling with derisive laughter. Watching Singin' in the Rain is an exuberant, magical experience -- a journey deep into the heart of feel-good territory.On the strength of the plot alone, concocted by the matchless writing team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Singin' in the Rain is a delight. But with the addition of MGM's catalog of Arthur Freed-Nacio Herb Brown songs -- "You Were Meant for Me," "You Are My Lucky Star," "The Broadway Melody," and of course the title song -- the film becomes one of the greatest Hollywood musicals ever made.Clever, incisive, and funny, Singin' in the Rain is a masterpiece of the classical Hollywood musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are a famed Hollywood duo, making films at the tail end of the silent era. The studio has been issuing PR suggesting that they're a romantic item. In reality, they can barely stand one another. One night, while on the town with his best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O' Connor), Lockwood has to run to escape fans who want a piece of him badly enough that they'll literally rip his clothes to shreds. He hops over a number of moving vehicles and ends up in the passenger seat of Kathy Selden's (Debbie Reynolds) car. Lockwood seems immediately taken with her, but she gives him the cold shoulder. She says she's an actress with a love of theater, and she looks down on film acting. Later, Lockwood discovers that she was inflating the truth a bit, as he sees Selden performing as a cute song &amp; dance girl at an industry party he's attending. She runs out of the party and Lockwood chases after her, but he's too late. While he tries to track her down, he, Lamont and their studio have to deal with the changing nature of film in 1927--made much more difficult by the fact that Lamont may look glamorous, but she talks more like Fran Drescher in "The Nanny" (1993).Aside from the more serious aspects of the plot, Singing in the Rain is a great success as a romance and a musical. It also has an astoundingly rich Technicolor look, and it is charmingly humorous. Kelly and Reynolds click on screen, even if offscreen Kelly, who also co-directed and co-choreographed, was famously difficult to work with--he drove Reynolds so hard (she was a much more inexperienced dancer) that her feet literally started bleeding at one point. The songs are great, they're worked into the story well--which is perhaps surprising given that most of them weren't written specifically for this film--and the choreography is impeccable, frequently jaw dropping and always aesthetically wondrous and sublime. If for nothing else, the film is worth a look for its often-athletic dance numbers, which can resemble Jackie Chan's showy martial arts stunts as much as dancing. It's also imperative viewing for cultural literacy in the realm of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most purely exhilarating films you will see in a lifetime of movies, pure Hollywood royalty. You didn't need me to tell you though, so let's talk about something else.Visually, the thing is as magnificent and minutely controlled as Kubrick's 2001, as vibrantly colored as The Red Shoes, with a weave of self-reference layered deep enough to make Peter Greenaway sit down and write a list about it. Of course the whole idea behind the thing is that it is a movie about the makings of a movie, the one we have come to see. Warners pioneered this in the early 30's, and they had Busby Berkeley staging wonders, but this goes beyond.Why the film amazes to this day, beyond its technical credentials, I think has all to do with the spontaneous engineering of the design. How it has been choreographed to dance around the burdens of a thinking mind and speak directly to the eye, the pull smoothed over so that it appears completely natural. I shudder to think what painstaking effort must have went into choreographing the lights and camera and individual performances, and then timing everything to flow at once.It is a perfect accomplishment in how we're engaged to dance; first with the fictional space as though it were real, but gradually, getting to know the steps of the spell, coming to understand that we were only using the fictional to hover closer to what is real and matters. Love in our case, the glorious feeling.Consider for example the scene where Don takes Kate to an empty studio lot and begins to arrange an illusion around her, movie lights, wind machine, painted horizon in the back, but all arranged to allow him to speak about a love that is true. They erupt in spontaneous dance, adding to the illusion arranged for us. It doesn't make a lick of sense why they would suddenly dance, but we absorb naturally because the spark is natural.Consider how love for this woman transforms the entire film in production. The many times that characters avail themselves truly while framed inside a fiction, before a camera or in front of a screen. How the plot of The Jazz Singer is cleverly mirrored in the plot of a man pursuing his dream about dancing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great musical. Normally I can't stand musicals, but this one keeps you laughing. Especially the piano playing friend, Cosmo. I liked how they had poked fun at the silent film era. Plenty of long takes suck you into it, and the crisp of color of the picture.The color alone is reason to watch, with colorful costumes. Along with the wide shots, and great use of lighting, this film shows good dance sequences. Set at the dawn of the talking picture era, the film concerns silent film stars, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), a tremendously popular romantic duo, who attempt the difficult (and for many, impossible) transition from silent pictures to the talkies. The acting honors here go to Hagen, who gives one of the funniest performances in movie history, playing a leading lady with a voice like fingernails on a chalkboard. As Lockwood's best friend, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), says, she is a triple threat: "She can't act, she can't sing, she can't dance." Kelly was never better. O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds, as Lockwood's love interest give fine performances as well. The entire cast, even down to the minor characters, is superb. Directors Kelly and Stanley Donen work movie magic. The songs by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown are perfectly integrated into a witty script by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. There are numerous memorable musical numbers, the best being Kelly's rendition of the title song, sung as he dances down a rain-soaked Hollywood street. This film is a must for any fan of musicals, or movies period!</fullReview>

Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen have a great eye for musical numbers and for hilarious comic relief. Each number is masterfully executed and the numbers are done in the best style. They build up and keep getting better, rather than giving all the great stuff first. Kelly is a superb actor/dancer/singer/co-director and is what makes this film such an enjoyable movie to watch. Stanley Donen helps out plenty though and is great with the musical stuff. The choreography remains just as strong today. Compare this next to Chicago, the Oscar-winning musical a half-century later and see how much more powerful the choreography and cinematography is over that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big fan of Musicals when it comes to movies. They always come off as cheesy and very bland. But, "Singing In The Rain" is a magnificent musical. For those who are unsure about this genre of film, this movie will change your mind. It is the first colored film we have watched in my History of American Cinema class, and also the first musical we watched and I loved it. The dancing blew my mind. Donald O'Connor's character, in my opinion, was the best and made the movie more exciting. His crazy dancing, and off the wall personality was so entertaining and put a smile on my face. The other character who made me laugh was Jean Hagen's needy character. Her part in the movie just made it that more enjoyable because it goes to show that not every "hollywood glamor" girl is perfect for every roll. It also shows that an ordinary girl like Debbie Reynold's character, does have a shot in the big world! The singing, and dancing were phenomenal. I love the scene with O'Connor and Gene Kelly dancing around the speech teacher!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Most Film Buffs, the Quintessential MGM Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie studio made better musicals than MGM during the 1940's and 1950's but the golden crown in their musical stable was definitely 1952's SINGIN IN THE RAIN, an instant classic that was an affectionate look at a difficult time of transition in Hollywood...the advent of talkie films taking over for silent films. Gene Kelly plays Don Lockwood, a silent film star who has made several films with the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), both of whom are thrown for a loop when "The Jazz Singer" is released and is a smash hit. The studio then decides to turn their latest silent feature, "The Dueling Cavalier" into a musical but there is one huge problem: Lina has a speaking and singing voice like nails on a chalkboard. Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), a young chorus girl with lofty theatrical ambitions who agrees to dub Lina's vocals for the film and falls for Don in the process, much to the chagrin of Lina, who believes the fan magazine stories that Don is in love with her. This simple yet clever story provides the backdrop for MGM's greatest triumph which became an instant classic upon release. Kelly is charming and charismatic as Lockwood and works well with Donald O'Connor, who plays his best friend Cosmo Brown. Debbie Reynolds, 18 years old at the time, is completely winning as Kathy and Jean Hagen earned the film's only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her brilliant comic turn as Lina Lamont, the glamorous, vein glamour queen whose ego far outweighs her talent. Musical highlights include two dance numbers with Kelly and O'Connor, "Fit as a Fiddle" and "Moses" which allow the viewer to compare and contrast the different but equally dazzling dance styles of these two artists; O'Connor's hysterical solo, "Make Em Laugh", Kelly and Reynolds' lovely pas de deux, "You were Meant for Me", and of course, Kelly's title tune, which is practically Hollywood folklore now. And notice must also be taken of "Broadway Ballet" a 20-minute fantasy/production number which features a special appearance by the divinely long-legged Cyd Charisse. No true lover of movie musicals should miss this one...it's simply, sensational.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite Movie Quote: "Whadda ya think I am? Dumb? - Or, something!?"Of course, today, not a lot of people realize just how many Hollywood actors' careers were completely ruined back in 1927 by the coming of sound. Believe me, the number was not small.In a nutshell, these famous actors of the Silent Era may have projected plenty of that wonderful thing called "charisma" onto the silver screen, but when it came to their voices (ugh!), they were atrocious!Actors such as the super-dashing leading man, John Gilbert, with his laughable, high-pitched lisp, and the ultra-chic beauty, Barbara La Marr, with her horrendous Bronx honk, were literally laughed right off the screen when their voices were finally heard by movie-audiences all across the nation.In Singin' In The Rain, actress Jean Hagen is absolutely priceless as Lena Lamont, the seductive superstar of silent films. I mean, Lena may have looked like a million bucks, but, whoa, when that babe opened her trap, man, she had a voice that could literally rupture eardrums from 50 paces. No kidding.Hagen's "Lena" was a prime example of an actress whose career was, most surely, destined for the axe once "Talkies" took over in 1927.All-In-All - Singin' In The Rain ranks right up there as one of the greatest and most entertaining Hollywood Musicals of all-time. Even if "Musicals" aren't your thing, you'll find it near impossible not to enjoy this high-energy, non-stop spectacle of song, dance, and comedy.Singin' In The Rain is a fond recreation of that bygone movie-making era when the flourishing Hollywood film industry was making its shaky transition into the greatest sensation of all - Talking pictures.The entire cast in this film are all absolutely first-rate, with everyone putting in a stellar performance from start to finish.My favourite musical number was "Broadway Melody".</fullReview>

You will have the movie 'Singing in the Rain' playing in front of you. At the end of the film, you choose your favorite number and scribble in down on a piece of paper." If I were the victim, I would prefer dying. Anyone who has seen SITR will really face this dilemma. We have numbers ranging from the titular 'Gotta Dance' to the benign 'Good Morning', titillating 'Singing in the Rain', dazzling 'Beautiful Girls', hilarious 'Make Em Laugh', foot-thumping and naughty 'Fit as a Fiddle (And Ready for Love)', chirpy 'All I do is dream of you' and the poignant 'You were meant for me'. Selecting one would be to disregard the other numbers in this legendary, avant-garde spectacular, extravagant, joyous, spellbinding and sizzling, magnum opus par excellence! Singin in the Rain is a lustrous effort showcasing the making of a movie in changing times. Lamont (Hagen) and Lockwood (Gene) are silent-film's darling couple, revered and envied by fans and carnal, shameless paparazzi who write 'bananas' about the couple. The cameras flash as celebrities grace the red carpet, the first being a unhappy sexagenarian-or-so with a unusually happy and ditsy girl in her 20's (gold-digger alert), the second an impassive one that is supposedly gleeful and then enter the couple-of-the-moment, with Cosmo being ignored completely, smiling photogenically, slickly pushing away an intruding paparazzi. Lockwood then glibly fabricates a make-believe story, devoid of crushing reality, while contradictory events play on screen. The reality of the couple too is quite different. Lamont is an egocentric, deluded, diva with a screechy voice and uncultured manners, reviled by much of the crew, who now face the brunt when both have to star in a talkie. To Lockwood's side are his comical yet versatile partner Cosmo and his love Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds), chirpy, sprightly lass. And the director, producer etc. while Lamont has her by-the-book lawyers. What follows are unforgettable, timeless musical numbers with effervescent colors, embracing both screen and stage.What makes this movie such a bundle of crackling joy is its interminable will to entertain. It has a buoyant story to be, which is rare for musicals that normally falter in this facet; iconic, veteran performances, delectable dance routines (some are as sizzling as a sizzler heated to perfection), memorable music and taut direction. With every viewing, the viewer not only is enchanted by its timeless persistence but also taken aback by the depth of the film. British countdown voting 'Grease' as the best musical ever is a travesty. Grease was greasy, a movie that has a pungent '70-80s' odor with clumsy, non sequitor storyline. SITR however is a movie that transcends all times, and this is how musicals should be made- without compromises.The musical aspect itself would've covered a 1000 word if I had the choice. This, clubbed with creamy, cr?me de la cr?me dance routines by Kelly, Donald, Debbie and extras transports the audience to a heavenly stadium. And everything is so faultlessly placed, each balancing the other. The first, Fit as a Fiddle, is more for the feet, 'All I do ?" too flutters up the atmosphere. 'Make Em Laugh' is a comical treat, and really explores Donald's comical forte (The funny faces he makes are drop-to-the-floor funny!). Then we move on to 'Beautiful Girls", a classy number, that is preceded by a dazzling montage on the burgeoning of musicals in the 20s; 'You Were?' is radiant, powerful, slender, 'Moses' again increases the pace (redundant though some may find it, it still seems refreshing, to keep the attention of the fidgety audience intact). 'GM' with its impromptu Hawaii interlude is quite a spectacle, while 'SITR' is legendary. Then, to top it all, we have 'Broadway Melody' a twelve minute clou du spectacle, with an enchanting, ethereal number by Charisse and Kelly. In fact, Kelly's lines are so expertly and gracefully executed I had a vicarious ecstasy within me. I would be delighted to see more movies of his.The acting is stupendous across the board. And the Oscars and the Critics Circles should be ashamed for not recognizing the merit of this wonder. I'll enlist the performances in brief: 1) Gene: Marvelous, with shining comic-timing, he is the ultimate ladies' man and quite a gentleman too. Watch out for his chemistry with Debbie and his mis-chemistry with Jean. Favorite lines: "Believe me; I don't like her half as much as I hate you. You REPTILE!" "What can I do to you, I'm just a shadow!" are ROFTL ones.2) Debbie: Na?ve, bubbly and a girl-next door Kathy is so gently played by Debbie, shedding any grandiosity of an actress and adding a genteel quality to the film.3) Donald: Robbed! Yeah, carrying a performance with such jovialness is hard, and incorporating silly faces without making the movie look silly is indeed Oscar-worthy.4) Jean Hagen: Probably the most distinctive aspect of the film apart from the dance-numbers is the hare-brained Lena Lamont, hysterically played by Hagen. Her delivery is impeccable, with perhaps the most memorable lines. (Including the scene with her speech therapist) 5) The rest fill up the minute crevices in the film. The surly director, Lamont's speech therapist (perhaps an aspiring but failed actress herself in the film) etc. solidify the movie.The most alluring aspect is its replay value, as I've seen it four times in 3 days, not just being enticed by the flashing lights but being educated on the fiascos the poor actors of the 20s had to endure. Singing in the Rain is everything; the granddaddy of musicals. I'll take one step further and say it's one of the best movies in film history. Its efforts have paid indeed. And its infinitely better than that overrated Casablanca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This absolutely delightful film has everything I love in a musical, and is definitely one of the greatest musicals ever made.(I love them) I personally think the film's main merit is the electrifying choreography, evident in the songs, Make Em Laugh, Roses, Good Morning and especially Broadway Melody.As for the songs, they are superb, and quite rightly some of the finest in the history of musicals, and somehow they remind me of Easter Parade. The performances give a rare sense of energy and charm, particularly Gene Kelly as Donald Lockwood, also co-director. His rendition of the title is possibly the most famous scene in the movie, and is pretty extraordinary. Donald O'Connor is hilarious as Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds, with her lovely appearance and fabulous voice is perfectly appealing. Jean Hagen is quite hysterical as Lina, the source of the film's ongoing joke, that her character can't act, dance or sing, and her acting in the talkie was intentionally laughable. Also nice to see the beautiful long-legged Cyd Charisse and Rita Moreno. (best known for Anita in West Side Story)The plot mayn't be the best merit of the film, but with everything else so good, it is such a minor criticism. All in all, a wonderful film, that is well worth watching for the song and dance numbers alone. 10/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1927, Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are a famous on-screen romantic pair. Lina, however, mistakes the on-screen romance for real love. Don has worked hard to get where he is today, with his former partner Cosmo. When Don and Lina's latest film is transformed into a musical, Don has the perfect voice for the songs. But Lina - well, even with the best efforts of a diction coach, they still decide to dub over her voice. Kathy Selden is brought in, an aspiring actress, and while she is working on the movie, Don falls in love with her. Will Kathy continue to "aspire", or will she get the break she deserves? This movie is a bit too overrated. But it still have great classic in it. I only wish that they did an extended edition.</fullReview>

Sure to him . That was my initiation,my first imprinting with cinema . Lookback to me in the dark cinema-place I still remember my wide-open and astonished eyes and over that wonderful world. Colours,music,songs,characters surrounded me and brought me out in a magical atmosphere of joy made of good feelings and simple ,but not stupid , reality. I couldn't say at that time how useful and "therapeutic" those images would be for my future and present life. Now, i'm sitting in a chair and writing with difficulty cause a Parkinson disease from ten years. Often,cause my illness , i'm depressed and in a bad humor. Specially yesterday night because i had finished my pills and no pharmacy store was open . But yesterday night i met once more (last time was the first of January 2007 ) ,Singin in the rain in TV ... ...and the enchantment returns. I'm back in touch with the children i was ,joy returns and sadness go away without pills and i'm back in possession of my life and my future.

		<fullReview>If you are depressed, this is the film to watch to get you out of that dark mood, it is the best feel good film I have ever watched. It has become my favourite musical film because Gene Kelly is a genius with the dance routines and they are a work of art all on their own.The film is about the era of silent movies where Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the most popular and successful silent movie stars. This all changes when talking pictures are introduced to the cinema goers and the film company has to keep up with the other studios by bringing out a talkie movie. In real life, this could be a kiss of death to any silent movie star whose voice didn't fit their image and who couldn't act in this new forum. This is true of Lina who has a very squeaky, high voice and Kathy Sheldon (Debbie Reynolds) is used as Lina's speaking and singing voice. Don falls in love with Kathy but Lina keeps getting in the way of their romance.It is unbelievable that Debbie Reynolds was just 19 when she filmed Singin in the Rain. She is just brilliant, I am annoyed to find out her voice was dubbed in some places as I think she has a beautiful voice and this should not have been done. She does make me laugh when she is acting out all the poses the silent movie stars make to Don who does that for his career.Donald O'Connor as Cosmo is the best. The energy and animation he shows in Make em Laugh has me in awe. I got tired just from watching him perform around the room.Whenever it is on, it does cheer me up and leaves a smile on my face for the rest of the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE greatest musical of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this film is the greatest musical ever made. In fact, it is in my all time top ten of any films. What is there not to like in this pic? True, there is little in the way of plot, but that is more than made up for in the singing and dancing. Gene Kelly had no equal when it came to choreography. I defy anyone to watch him in full flow and not be in awe. The title song will lift your heart on the lowest of days and I personally, will never tire of it. A great cast supports Kelly and should be given credit. I remember the first time I heard Lena say "What do they think we are, dumb or something!". Sheer joy! Debbie Reynolds and Donald O'Connor each contribute significantly and should be congratulated for their professionalism in the face of Gene Kelly's apparent tyranny. I could go on and on, but will end by reiterating my original assertion the this is THE greatest musical ever made and will NEVER be topped. They certainly don't make them like that anymore!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sum Of All Parts- A Musical Celebration!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps the true greatness of Singin' In The Rain (1952) lies not solely in it's excellent musical numbers, but the clever plot and sparkling screenplay that the song-and-dance numbers are set to. Singin' In The Rain is a rare musical in that it is also an amazing, accomplished feat of film-making.It is also amazing that this most fresh, witty and original of all musicals is, at it's most basic, a nostalgic mi sh-mash of Early Hollywood. Most components are copied- Kelly's legendary title number had already been rolled out in a creaky early talkie (with not much success) and the brilliant 'Good Mornin'' number is a re-hash of Kelly's dance with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers in Cover Girl's (1944) 'Make Way For Tomorrow' number. Previous stock footage of Kelly from 'The Three Musketeers'(1948) is used, and the Kelly/Reynolds relationship is very reminiscent of the March/Gaynor relationship (minus the drinking) in A Star Is Born (1937)- Kelly even resembling March in a number of scenes. It is remarkable that Singin' In The Rain did so well, as all but two of the musical numbers ('Moses Supposes, a simple, catchy, little ditty set to Kelly and O'Connor's toe-tapping, and 'Make Em Laugh', a rather blatant rip-off of the previous 'Be A Clown') were re-worked old MGM musical staples way past their use-by-date.Yet this relentless copying and re-working is what makes the film the masterpiece it remains today. It works primarily as a celebration AND an affectionate send-up of early Hollywood. It's plot, revolving around the awkward transition of the film industry from silents to talkies, takes in many actual occurrences and insider-jokes to provide a truly wonderful portrait of late 1920's Hollywood. The screenplay is deceptively hilarious yet rich in detail- those who are not overly familiar with this period of history should do some research, as these sly pokes at early Hollywood are fascinating. The more you know about classic Hollywood, early talkies and the birth of the musical genre, the more you will appreciate this.Many famous screen stars are parodied- from a heavily-accented European silent film star who dismisses the talkies as 'Vulgar!'(an obvious take on Pola Negri, who actress who didn't make the transition to sound) to the now-famous scene in Bebe Daniels' early musical Rio Rita (1929), where Bebe 'lightly taps' her leading man with a fan. Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen) heavy Brooklyn accent (both a copy of Judy Holliday's 'Born Yesterday' voice and a jibe at Clara Bow, whose honking tones coupled with her wild partying and mental instability ruined her career)and the over-sized blonde-white wig Lina must wear (actually the wig Norma Shearer famously wore in Marie Antoinette, an MGm film from 1938!) represent Kelly and Donen's subtle parodying of the era. Rita Moreno's 'Zip Girl', vamping it at a movie premiere, is a play at Miss Bow's 'It Girl' persona. Kelly's hilarious 'I love you, I love you!' dialog is a direct reference to failed silent matinée idol John Gilbert, who made a flop talkie debut in His Glorious Night (1929). Kelly and Donen do misrepresent history, as Gilbert's voice, evidenced from clips, was not all that effeminate, it was in fact a combination of an outdated image, horrendous dialog, L.B Mayer's vendetta to ruin him and his own personal insecurities that led to his downfall and premature death. However, Singin' opts for a more light-hearted focus in capturing the essence of the failings of many early sound films.Aside from the history, the remarkable and captivating musical numbers are what viewers remember from the film. O'Connor's' 'Make Em Laugh' routine is a masterpiece of physicality, almost Chaplin-like in it's humor and appeal. Kelly's title number is nothing short of stunning and is justifiably one of the most memorable sequences in cinema. The Kelly/Reynolds number 'You Were Meant For Me' is both a a beautiful ballad and an ironic comment on the setting-up of the romantic musical number- a look at the artifice needed to create such an intimate moment.The ballet sequence (added after the success of 'An American In Paris' a year earlier) merges traditional balletic movements with the jazz/blues rhythms of the 'Roaring Twenties', again evoking the era. Kelly's partner in this astonishing sequence, Cyd Charisse, sports a sexy green flapper dress and a 'Lulu'- a severe page-boy cut popularized by Louise Brooks in the brilliant silent Pandora's Box. Cyd's moll is accompanied by her coin-flipping gangster boyfriend, a bizarre creation who merges the looks of Peter Lorre in 'The Maltese Falcon', the scar of Muni's Tony Camonte in Scarface (1932) and the coin-flipping of George Raft from the same film. The 'Broadway Melody' ballet is a highlight of stylized dancing, a blazing array of color, sound and movement, a parade for Walter Plunkett's terrific costume design, and a journey through the musical, with Kelly dancing in revues and as Florenz Ziegfeld in a 'Follies' tribute.In a word: Terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Forecast Is Only Bright and Sunny for This Unparalleled MGM Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only the cloudiest of curmudgeons could possibly begrudge a musical as pervasively buoyant and consistently inventive as this 1952 classic. Thanks to the unstoppable creative energy of Gene Kelly and co-director Stanley Donen and the sharp writing of the redoubtable team of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, what could have been just another MGM confection is really a non-stop singing and dancing entertainment and a clever satire on the talkie revolution that transformed Hollywood's movie industry in the late 1920's. Fortunately, the 50th Anniversary, two-disc set released in 2002 is an appropriate tribute to this film since it includes a pristine print, clear audio and plentiful extras.Kelly's athleticism and natural braggadocio manner are put to optimal use in the fictionalized story of silent screen stars Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont, both of whom make a particularly bumptious transition to sound with their romantic costume epic, "The Dueling Cavalier". Thanks to the introduction of primitive and awkwardly placed microphones, the stars' mute over-emoting looks and sounds ludicrous, in particular, Lina's Bronx-accented helium squealing. Off-screen, Don can barely stand Lina, and what's more, he becomes smitten with young ingénue Kathy Selden much to the consternation of Lina. After the movie's disastrous preview, Don's best friend and piano accompanist Cosmo Brown comes up with the idea of turning the potential fiasco into a musical, "The Dancing Cavalier", with Lina's unbearably comic voice dubbed by Kathy.While Lina uses blackmail to keep Kathy under wraps, the plot still comes to its inevitable conclusion but not before an elaborate and rather anachronistic production number, the fourteen-minute "Broadway Melody Ballet". Although not as enthralling as Kelly's similarly lengthy tribute to the French master artists in "An American in Paris" the year before, this number has all the razzle-dazzle one could possibly hope for in a single number, including the leggy Cyd Charisse dancing flawlessly as a coin-flipping femme fatale. In fact, the whole film is so energetic and saturated with color that it's hard not to be enraptured.Most every musical number is a memorable classic from the classroom antics of Kelly and O'Connor in "Moses Supposes" to the ebullient furniture prancing of "Good Morning" to O'Connor's acrobatic turns on "Make 'Em Laugh" to Kelly's classic rain-drenched solo set to the title tune. Kelly is inarguably at his peak here, and so is the youthful O'Connor who proves even more than the females, to be Kelly's most compatible dance partner. Nineteen-year old Debbie Reynolds is kewpie doll-adorable as Kathy and dances with hard-earned ease with her veteran colleagues. The scene stealer, however, is Jean Hagen who plays the not-so-dumb Lina with genuine comic élan. You will also notice twenty-year old Rita Moreno playing a Clara Bow-like movie star named Zelma Zanders.The DVD comes with a wonderfully insightful if somewhat crowded commentary track with participation from O'Connor, Reynolds, Donen, Comden, Green, Charisse, and co-star Kathleen Freeman (who plays Lina's failed elocution teacher), as well as film historian Rudy Behlmer and director Baz Luhrmann. Most of them also participate and repeat their recollections in a thirty-minute featurette on the second disc, "What a Glorious Feeling" made specifically for the DVD. There are two other shorts - one on the first disc called "Reel Sounds" which details the evolution of the sound picture during the setting of the movie, and the other is a lengthier 1996 documentary, "Musicals Great Musicals: The Arthur Freed Unit at MGM", which provides a broader view of the classic MGM musicals of the period.There are also trailers, some outtakes and antiquated movie excerpts of songs written by Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, who penned "Singin' in the Rain". All in all, this is a terrific package for a most deserving Hollywood classic well worth repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finest musical of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if you wanted a phrase to sum up elation in spite of difficulties? Then you illustrated it with songs, dance, a love story crossing different eras, you offered parallels in the business and personal world, and then underlined it all with a dig at a society that takes itself too seriously? Would it come become widely acknowledged as the finest musical of all time? Singin' in the Rain takes a lost art form, travelling back to the days of silent pictures. A matinée idol (played by Gene Kelly) is caught up in the transition, together with his buddy (Donald O'Connor), a co-star with a grating voice (Jean Hagen) and the girl of his dreams (Debbie Reynolds). Just as is often the case in real life, the lovers bond by accepting each other's worst side. She can't stand his pompousness but her image is shattered when she takes a lowly job and jumps out of a birthday cake. She seems the perfect 'star' but, apart from her whole opposition to the Hollywood industry, she has the jealousy of the real 'stars' to contend with.Singin' in the Rain successfully re-creates the roaring twenties. By placing much of the story within the film studios themselves, there is easy access to backdrops of wildest imagination, providing constant visual contrasts - music-hall, western, action stunts, as well as forays into black-and-white. The aural contrasts are no less scintillating. The opening scene has Kelly, Reynolds and O'Connor dancing to a jazzed-up title song, quickly cutting to the dreamy Lucky Star number for the opening credits, followed by the clamour and excitement of a red carpet interview. Parodies on silent film, dubbing for sound, and dialect coaches continue to grab attention from one moment to another.This effervescent, all-American movie (together with An American in Paris) heralded a revolution in the American musical. Part of a counter-trend against popular film noir of the day (like Double Indemnity and The Big Sleep), Singin' in the Rain has been described as a 'great amalgam of realized style and stylized realism'. Even the ending, for all its emotional fulfilment, exalts successful caricature over 'serious' film making.Although it had to overcome many difficulties in the making, it remains one of the most enduring, effervescent and exuberant of films. It spoofs not only the silent era but also many earlier movies from which most of its songs are taken. Finding true sincerity beneath such light-hearted irreverence is part of the task of the seemingly ill-matched lovers. Today, Singin' in the Rain may be bypassed by devotees of contemporary cinema, echoing O'Connor and Reynolds' characters quip: "Why bother . . . You've seen one, you've seen them all." Yet each year the film gains new converts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Musical Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or is it? I don't know. I first got interested in musicals when I saw Hepburn and Astaire in Funny Face (1957). My logical reaction was to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952). The story is extremely smart and funny - two great silent stars having trouble to pass through to talkies, Lina Lamont is the great, special treat. My problem with it is that years went by and I continued to study musicals.It seems to me that all numbers are recycled versions of other movies. The titled song first came up in Broadway Melody of 1929, and was quite popular in the 30's and 40's. And what can be said of Good Mornin'? I'm sorry! I know that for most people that song finishes up with Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds laughing out loud in a couch, but for me it's Rooney and Garland selling a song in Babes in Arms (1939). I've Got a Feeling You're Fooling only reminds me now of Robert Taylor, and Would You brings back the Jeanette MacDonald in San Francisco. As for Make Them Laugh, Freed himself was ashamed of that - I mean, could he more obviously have copied Cole Porter's classic Be A Clown? In the end, Singin' in the Rain might be considered the greatest musical ever because of its extremely original story, but definitely not because of its musical numbers. I think that, at MGM in the 50's, that title might as well belong to The Band Wagon (1954), Minnelli's underrated masterpiece starring the greatest dancer of all time (Astaire - it's not an argument, Kelly will always be second best and everyone knows it) and Cyd Charisse (a much more interesting leading lady than Reynolds, who I always found annoying).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might very well be true, at least in my opinion. I've seen this film twice in it's full length, and both times, I repeated the same words over and over again: "THIS IS Unbelievable! HOW DID THEY DO THAT?!" Singin' in the Rain is perfect; it is not only a spectacular school example of how a musical should be made, but is also the most romantic film I've ever seen; love is in the air when Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds interact. To focus on the "smaller" characters, I've never seen anything like Lina Lamont and Cosmo Brown; the mere line said by Julie Hagen, in that wonderful, unbelievable voice: "What do they think I am? Dumb or something?"! And amazing Donald O'Connor as the hilarious Cosmo who dances up the walls and pulls stunt-tricks I'd never imagined; what would this movie be without him? So, on a rainy day, if you're feeling down, please get a hold of this movie. I am willing to bet you pretty big money that it'll make you feel much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be a waste of time for me to reissue the same old superlatives about the musical numbers, so I will have this to say about the film that has not been said before.This film handles the transition from silent films to sound films. It has a very light-hearted attitude to this. It makes light of the fact that one leading lady can no longer function because she cannot sing and she speaks with a heavy regional accent. In reality, that woman was made redundant because of circumstances over which she had no control. And the termination of her career is about as funny as factory lay-offs. Such things, I am afraid were all too real. Jack Gilbert and Clara Bow were just two of the big stars dumped (there's no other word for it) by the Hollywood studios because their voices did not match their screen images. Emil Jannings and Vilma Banky were on the liners back to Europe because they struggled with their English. On this side of the Atlantic Mabel Poulton's star career was finished because she didn't talk posh enough for a gentile leading lady.So next time you hear Lina Lamont's thick accent, just remember the real people whom Lina Lamont represents.Not so funny now. Is it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Kelly--- dancing--- what else do you need? The acting is a bit rough and the dated feeling of the film are nice forms of ironic amusement, but at that time it must have been slightly 'hip'--- i really get into the pre-psychedelic montage scenes--- when you start to lose your sense of time in the film--- especially all the scenes that are excuses for dancing--- it is a funny way of presenting a story. If I had any children I would feel safe showing them this film. Porn and horror movies are a bad idea to show to little children. ---- A movie like this is entertaining for all people---- I like to think Don Lockwood is in a backstage love affair with a sarcastic and intelligent Lina Lamont--- and somehow she is respected for her class and charm--- while Kathy Selden is somehow an after thought for Don--- ---and did Kramer from Seinfeld get his name from Donald O'Connor's character---</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiering dance scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Musicals, are an MGM speciality. And because they are musicals, MGM were less concerned with acting ability. By not concentrating on acting ability, this permitted MGM to focus on the important stuff which made their musicals spectacular, such as colour,beautiful costumes,elaborate film sets, great songs, excellently sung - although from what I gather often dubbed - and not least of all the exquisite, and spectacular dancing from the likes of Gene Kelly in the classic; Singing in the Rain.In Singing in the Rain,the dance scenes are full of energy, and are well choreographed. Though their styles of dancing are completely different, it seems that Kelly works hard at his dancing, whereas Astair's dancing looks effortless, and thus more flowing in the films in which he starred. But in favour of Kelly, he had to dance with Reynolds in a couple of scenes, who was an untrained dancer, unlike Astair's frequent dance partner in RKO's films, Rogers who was a trained dancer, which could've been to the advantage of Astair. By working with an untrained dancer, such as Reynolds, it could've contributed to the fact that Kelly's dance scenes with her lacked total synchronisation at times, especially the scene where they dance on the film set. However, other causes of the lack of synchronisation in the said dance scenes, could be due to the apparent fact that Kelly and Reynolds had disagreements whilst making Singing in the Rain; or it could be due to time constraints set by MGM, which did not permit the perfection of the said dance scenes.If I could choose a favourate scene, it is that of Kelly executing; Singing in the Rain, which has become somewhat of a cliché in the genre of musicals. Indeed, this classic dance scene has recently been adapted for a television advert, in which Kelly bursts into a break dance.Overall a truly escapist film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw "Singin' in the Rain" at the drive-in at age 4. It didn't do much for me. I saw it again in the 60s and still didn't get it. It wasn't until the 80s that I got it--in a big way. As a musical fan, even as a teenager ("Bye Bye Birdie" "Damn Yankees" and "The Music Man" were my favorites), I've watched "Singin' in the Rain" many times since, turning many people onto it as well. It is a thrill, a laugh, a beautiful dream even of Hollywood, and the damned raindance is the weakest scene for me, made even moreso by its being excerpted about a thousand times. (Of course that's the one I liked when I was 4.) Like "Wizard of Oz", in a class by itself and should be seen by everyone, even or especially those that hate musicals...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I was young, and Singin' in the Rain was shown on television for the first time (I think it was Saturday Night at the Movies). I was enthralled! And when Donald O'Connor performed, "Make'em Laugh," I nearly fell off the couch, I was laughing so hard.The best musical ever made, Singin' in the Rain is a movie that any collector of great movies should have in his or her library. A movie about the Movie Industry, it is a great spoof of Hollywood in the upheaval created by the change from silents to talkies. The songs and music advance the plot and the scenes between the songs are wonderfully written and wonderfully played. Still after all these years, every time I watch it, that first time of my youth is recaptured and I sit there, just grinning.</fullReview>

Laugh-out loud humor, an attractive couple, scene-stealing support from Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell, Cyd Charisse, etc., catchy and entertaining music, lovable characters with depth, a terrific script, and, of course, Gene Kelly himself. His dancing- and O'Connor's- must be seen to be believed. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of musicals. Not really my cup of tea.....However, if you are any kind of movie fan, then you have to like Singing in the Rain. The Song and dance numbers are fabulous (although, I think Gene Kelly's best hoofing is in An American in Paris) but, the movie itself is very funny. I kept laughing during all the trials of shooting the Deuling Cavalier with sound(allegedly based on true stories). Gene's Kelly's story about breaking into the industry is a hoot, too.Why Singing in the Rain is so good is that there's a supreme confidence andexuberance with everything on screen. it defies you not to like it.And I can't. Singing in the rain. Brill stuff</fullReview>

And I don't care much for dancing. What's amazing is how well thisfilms holds up. It's as funny and intelligent today as it was back in the early fifties. And why not?

		<shortDescription>the definitive musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple story that pokes fun at every cliché about film stars and the studios for which they work, Singin' in the Rain has lost nothing over time. The dance scenes with are unbeatable, not that one would expect differently with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor. The music, even if it isn't original (it all appears in earlier movies -- old ones at the time of this movie's creation) always fits. The premise: the advent of sound in the new 'talking pictures' makes all silent movies obsolete as mass entertainment, and a high-budget project that "Monumental Pictures" has nearly completed would be a disaster at the box office unless it is turned into a sound movie. Technical difficulties, including the directional requirements of early microphones, the tendencies of microphones to pick up sounds like heart beats that distract from dialogue, and the poor co-ordination of sound and image create their own problems.Even more, the silent-era actors have to relearn how to talk for best effect. With Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) it's almost a lark, and even the pedantics of voice lessons become a set up for a fine musical dance sequence. The potential catastrophe is that Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) has a voice incorrigibly unsuited to sound pictures, a fact good for both comedy and dramatic tension. But she is the great star of the silent era, she has a big salary, overwhelming arrogance, and a big contract. Even worse, she leaves no question to the question that she poses at one point "What do you think -- that I'm dumb or something"? The solution is to dub the voice of Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) for dialogue and music without Lina "Am I dumb or somethin'?" Lamont knowing what's going on.So the silent movie is given sound and is even extended with musical and dance numbers. But that's not the whole story, and the sockdolager ending has to be seen to believed. It works!Unless one considers &gt;The Wizard of Oz&lt; a musical even though it is more an adventure story, this is the greatest movie musical of all times and is compelling cinema that everyone must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 12/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Gene Kelly &amp; Stanley Donen): Charming and wonderfully made musical &amp; dancing extravaganza with a background built on the movie-maker's entrance to talkies. What makes this movie unique is it's wonderfully staged numbers from "Singin in the Rain" to wonderfully funny songs with Kelly and Donald O'Conner. Kelly has a knack for using props and he does this with wonderful results especially in the use of water for the title track. Oh, if life, we're only as perfect as a musical such as this(then we truly would be singing and dancing in rain, snow, sleet or hail). Movie magic definetly puts us in this place for this feature which is what gave this picture such a broad appeal and will make it last for a long time in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was simply amazing. When Roger Ebert mentioned that this was one of his favourites, I knew I had to see it. I bought the DVD for a meager 10 dollars and watched it. This was great. Gene Kelly is just one hell of an amazing dancer. No wonder he was such a ladies man. He was very slick! There are so many great numbers in the movie aside from the title track "singing in the rain". Debbie Reynolds is terrific as the love interest of Gene Kelly. The plot of the movie is interesting. It involves scandle and intrigue and romance. However, the singing/dancing numbers stand out above all other musicals I have seen. This movie left me feeling great (which I need from time to time). I found my face fixed in a grin throughout the entire film. Few movies have forced my face to contort that way without me realizing it. Ah, if only there were a way I could go back to that magical time when film noir was more in fasion. Now that I have seen my first Gene Kelly movie, I will have to have a Gene Kelly movie marathon! Go see this movie. Better yet, BUY IT. It's a must have for any musical buff, trust me on this one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Definitive Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that'll give you Happy Feet just thinking about it once you've seen it. Quite possibly the purest movie musical ever made, `Singin' In the Rain,' directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, has everything you could want in a musical: A good story, perfect cast, imaginative choreography, memorable music and songs, terrific performances, and a presentation that is nothing less than inspired. It takes you behind the scenes of the movie business, set during the transitional period between the heyday of silent films and the advent of talkies. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, the Tracy and Hepburn of Monumental Studios, which is about to release their latest movie-- a swashbuckling costume drama. But a rival studio has just released `The Jazz Singer,' and overnight the industry is revolutionized, and silent films are just that quickly a thing of the past. To keep up and stay afloat, the major studios need to produce pictures that talk. And where does Monumental start? By retooling their latest big star vehicle (with Lockwood and Lamont) into a MUSICAL swashbuckling costume drama. If it's song and dance the public wants, then that's what they'll get-- right along with the drama of the costume and the swashbuckling thrown in to boot. There's one problem, though; the sound of Lina's voice has the effect of fingernails scraping a chalkboard, and her diction isn't going to land her the role of Juliet anytime soon. The powers that be at Monumental fear they may soon have a `falling' star on their hands. But there's always a solution, of course; and leave it to Don's partner, Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), to come up with it. And it just happens to involve a young lady named Kathy (Debbie Reynolds), with whom Don has just recently become acquainted. And that's where the story really begins.Kelly and Donen (who also teamed up for `On the Town' and `It's Always Fair Weather') certainly know how to put on a show. The name of their game is Entertainment-- yes, with a capital `E'-- and that's exactly what you get. The dazzling production numbers are upbeat and electrifying: Donald O'Connor's `Make 'Em Laugh;' `Good Mornin',' which features Debbie Reynolds (joined by Kelly and O'Connor); a diction lesson by Kelly and O'Connor that begins with `Moses,' who `Supposes his 'toeses' are roses;' and a transporting routine with Kelly and Cyd Charisse. But the highlight is Kelly doing the title song while `Singin' and dancin' in the rain.' And these are but a few of the magical marvels of this film.When Kelly sings `Gotta dance!' you'd better believe it, because he's the best of the best, and he's at the top of his game here. He's a consummate entertainer and a perfectionist, and simply a joy to watch. And with O'Connor next to him you really have something special, as they tend to bring out the best in one another (I submit their `Moses' number as evidence). Also, they seem to genuinely enjoy working together; there appears to be an almost fun sense of spirited competition going on as they dance, and it's an invigorating experience (if this wasn't so, then they've pulled off a marvelous bit of acting). But no one can out-dance Gene Kelly. Period. And he may not be the world's greatest singer, but in this film his voice is in top form, as well.Also a consummate performer, Donald O'Connor more than holds his own with Kelly on the dance floor (and he's at the top of a very short list of those who can), and the sense of humor and personality he brings to the film are invaluable. His energetic `Make 'Em Laugh' number does just that; and while it's funny, it also showcases O'Connor's versatility and gives him a chance to display some amazing moves (how many people-- even professional dancers-- can dance up the side of a wall and into a back flip?). And he makes it look so easy. As Cosmo, he's the quintessential second banana and jack-of-all-trades. He dances, sings, plays piano, cracks jokes, pops up for tech work in the sound booth, and on top of everything else he's an idea man and a general facilitator of anything and everything that needs facilitating. If Danny Kaye had a brother it would be O'Connor; and-- like Kelly-- he's just a pleasure to watch.Debbie Reynolds was twenty-years-old when she made this film, and she's a perfect fit with Kelly and O'Connor. Beautiful and talented-- and mature beyond her years-- she has a kind of sparkle all her own and a terrific screen presence. She can sing and she can dance, she looks good no matter what she's doing, and there's a wholesome, girl-next-door quality about her that makes her endearing. It also makes Kathy a very real and believable character, and Reynolds plays her perfectly.As Lina Lamont, the girl with a voice that could make cats cry, Jean Hagen is an absolute riot. Reminiscent of a character Mia Farrow would create years later in `Radio Days,' Sally White-- though perhaps a bit more dense-- Lina takes the `vain' out of `vanity,' and Hagen brings her to life with a vivid, memorable performance. And it's just another of the many elements that make this such a great film.The supporting cast includes Millard Mitchell (Simpson), Rita Moreno (Zelda), Douglas Fowley (Roscoe) and Kathleen Freeman (Phoebe). If pure entertainment is what you're after, you need look no further than `Singin' In the Rain,' which successfully dispels any doubts that there is, indeed, magic in the movies. Because this movie is magic, a sheer delight from beginning to end no matter how many times you see it. There's been a number of great musicals made over the years, but of them all, with Kelly and O'Connor at the top of their form, this one just may be the definitive offering. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best musical ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite film of all time, and perhaps the best movie musical ever. It is simply wonderful.Set in the era of silent films, it shows the humourous side to what happened when "the talkie" first was introduced. Many huge stars didn't survive the change from silent to talking pictures, which in reality was very tragic. But this movie is far from sad, as it makes the point that being a movie star isn't the only thing in life, there's also true love to be found. And love and friendship is more important than riches and fame.The songs, the choreography, the wit, the comedy, the drama, the romance, the singin' in the rain. No words can make it justice, you have to see it to know, and to get that glorious feelin'. Trust me, if you only see one musical in your whole life, it should be this one.Some interesting trivia: Most songs are original late '20's works of MGM Producer Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and were already classics when "Singin' in the Rain" was filmed.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could any other musical ever be as fine as this one? It's just too great in too many ways. Putting aside for the moment the excellent performances of ideally cast actors doing the best work of their careers, the expert pacing, cinematography, costuming, writing, directing, the terrific arrangements of those terrific songs, and so on and so forth; even if some lucky film nowadays was able to amass all that skill, the results still wouldn't match up.I mean, this is a Hollywood musical made by Hollywood's greatest musical producer at Hollywood's greatest movie studio, written by two of Hollywood's greatest musical writers, directed by one of Hollywood's greatest musical directors, starring one of Hollywood's greatest musical stars...and all this goes into a story about the birth of musicals, inspired by a rarefied catalogue of songs from musicals of that era, written by the producer. How much more convergence can you get? This kind of self-reference makes all movies about movies extra special, but in a musical it's particularly sharp.There are obviously a lot of reasons why celluloid musicals are virtually gone today, and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN might very well be one of them. Filmmakers seem to like perfecting imperfections, and this genre was perfected a long time ago, in 1952. Anything that follows it, good or bad, can't help but be rather anticlimactic.</fullReview>

Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds have a completely believable and undeniable romance, while Donald O'Connor dances his butt off, like no other has on screen. Scene after scene build up into a classic and enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Gotta Dance" drags??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand the user comments saying that "Gotta Dance" drags on! That is outrageous!Not only was Gene Kelly one of the most captivating dancers, but he was an awe-striking choreographer and director as well! The man knew dancing AND how to present dancing!!The sequence tells of the trials of the young dreamer in flawless beauty, like a soliloquy without words, but in motion and mood. The colours in these scenes are like that of an oil painting, beautiful in their brilliance, style, and emotion. Charisse and Kelly bring "Singin'..." to a delight of mood and subtlety; possibly to never happen again on celluloid! Perhaps it is too much a forgotten art form in today's movies, but of its own genre, "Gotta Dance" is a true work of absolute excellence! Does that mean because it is "too ballet" for audiences that it should be said to "drag on?" Open your minds a bit people!!Hollywood will most likely never make films like this again; why "dis" them?</fullReview>

A comical look at a time when silent movies already has a foot on its grave and talkies are giving Hollywood birth pains. The film is full of memorable performances and moments, but the real "killer" is the 'Singin in the Rain' sequence of Gene Kelly. No back-up, no partner, just him with his umbrella in the rain. That will be the most captivating scene of irony in movie history ( having a glorious feeling in the pouring rain ).</fullReview>

Sure, it was an idealized version, but I'll take an idealized 30s/50s over an idealized 90s/00s any day! The characters were great, the singing and dancing were superb, and the sets were gorgeous. The only thing that slowed the movie down was the ending Broadway number. Other than that though, no complaints! A great movie to watch if you're feeling down. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few absolutely perfect films ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is absolutely one of the very few perfect films ever made in the history of the medium. The rapid pacing of the editing, the snappy dialouge, the purely genuine performances, the glorious cinematogaphy, the framing of the scenes, the songs, the themes, etc. etc. all contribute greatly to this film being not only a supremely entertaining picture but also a lasting work of art. I readily admit that I am not a lover of musicals, but this simply works as a celebration of life. Hidden amid the technicolor hues and radiance are a wide assortment of life affirming truths: love the art in yourself, not yourself in the art (Stanislavski), remain loyal and work hard. This is just to list a precious few lessons to be learned. This is also one of the few films that everyone, no matter what age or religious orientation can enjoy, despite a large number of suggestive puns and jokes. Gene Kelley, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds and Jean Hagen as well as the entire cast display what class, beauty and committment are all about in relation to the craft of acting. This is one of the few works of 20th century popular culture that show the best of what man can offer. Don't miss this spectacular work of art.</fullReview>

I can't picture anyone else playing Cosmo. It's ashame Gene didnt win anything for his performance in this. It was just amazing. Everything was amazing! I'm glad to see that the AFI ranked it at #10!

Although it's not generally thought of as a comedy, this movie is hilarious. I'll be on the floor laughing during some parts. Also, this Gene Kelly fellow does a pretty swell job.

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Musical of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest movie musical of all time! "Singin' in the Rain" is justly famous for Gene's immortal dance in the rain but there's so much more to love. Jean Hagen's Oscar-nominated turn as the blond bombshell from hell is hysterical. Donald O'Connor proves himself worthy to dance with Gene in "Moses" and "Fit as a Fiddle" and brings down the house with "Make 'Em Laugh." It's hard not to applaud in your own home after that number.If you see a few Gene Kelly movies (and I advise that you do) you may notice that he always wears his hats tilted to the side in an inimitable way that will always be cool. No one wears a hat like Gene Kelly.There is no other movie that I can pop in the VCR that will fill me with the joy that "Singin' in the Rain" does. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and never lose its magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Celebration of Moving Pictures, via the Musical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is amazing how a movie such as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN can hit all the right notes, epitomize a genre, and paint an important picture of the most innovative of times in Hollywood: the evolution of silent films to talking ones. There are 'films' and there are 'movies', as George Lucas likes to say. This is a 'movie', a popcorn movie, that is filled frame by frame with fabulous performances, beautiful technicolor, and period songs that will be remembered forever. Directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, also its star, this movie musical was made on the coattails of Kelly's previous hit, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, which won best picture of 1951. It was only meant to capitalize on that heavily honored favorite. Not only did it capitalize, it transcended all expectations and has become one of America's most loved and important works of art.The main trio of actors, Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and a young and cute Debbie Reynolds, are perfectly cast in what is really a perfect 'movie'. Their characters work for Monumental Pictures, actually MGM, and the studio boss is "L. F. Simpson", representing MGM boss L. B. Mayer. Silents rule the silver screen, but, this is 1927, and Warner Bros. has released THE JAZZ SINGER, the first ever talking picture. It becomes the craze and "Simpson" wants to jump onto the bandwagon of sound as soon as possible. With this premise, we see how studios changed gears and utilized the new 'talkie' technology. One problem: many of the actors and actresses looked great but did not sound fit for the new regime. Jean Hagen symbolizes the countless actors who lost their jobs because of the new technology. She can't sing a lick and is as dumb as a brick. (Her voice reminded me of "Susan Alexander's" from CITIZEN KANE) Dialogue coaches are brought in and the studio system is revolutionized. Not without some hilarious screenings of poorly synched sound pictures that almost has Kelly's career disappearing.The musical numbers brilliantly relay the movie's story of loss and change, but there is never a sour note. Two sequences stand out. Kelly twirling in the rain, of course, and O'Connor's Chaplin-esque turn in a stunning virtuoso mix of dance and slapstick during "Make 'em Laugh". Watch this sequence over and over. You will not believe your eyes. The grand "Broadway Ballet" scene is wonderful at giving us Busby Berkeley-type choreography and Technicolor illuminates the fake facades of a skeleton-like stage of New York City. The switch from silence to sound is quietly told by the song and dance. The writers even managed to get quite a few rips on the industry as a whole, especially the false relationships presented to the tabloid journalists to boost image. This is ironic considering Louis B. Mayer condemned director Billy Wilder for his dark and bitter take on Hollywood just 2 years before in SUNSET BOULEVARD.Don't miss SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. It ranks alongside the greatest ever made for a reason. See for yourself (and crank up the sound and color) !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Apex of the MGM Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic musical that features superb song and dance numbers woven about an uncharacteristically engaging story. Fluffy as you would expect, but downright heartwarming and as entertaining as any film ever made. Shot in that magnificent color typical of the era.I know there's a Woody Allen movie where his character tells Mia this is the only film he actually owns, and he watches it whenever he gets depressed. Thats a spot on description describing this film's relevance. I personally find Singing in the Rain to be one of a handful of perfect efforts. Set in the 1920s its a loving sendoff of the industry's early years and its transition from silent to talkie. I am by no means an MGM buff, some if not most of them I cant bear to watch, some of Gene Kellys especially since while the acrobatic dancing stuff is always cool, the movies are often just dumb if not annoying. Not so here. Singin in the Rain has a clever innocence which is sadly a memory now in film-making, that evokes laughs and tears and leaves you feeling just a little better about life than before you watched it. Trust me its worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no need to make another statement on the superior quality of this musical of musicals. But what strikes me is that subsequently neither of the four secondary performers (Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen or Cyd Charisse) got the opportunity to develop a top career as a movie star. Nor the unbelievable performance of Donald (have you ever seen such an all-round and perfect comedian?), nor the stupendous achievement of 19-year old Debbie (not being an educated dancer doing what she did in the shadow of a superstar like Gene Kelly), nor the high quality act of Jean, nor the most beautiful Hollywood female dancing of Cyd, got them what they deserved. Apart from a few minor exceptions they had to act in a few long forgotten movies or had to go back to the theater or try nightclubs or TV. What a pity.</fullReview>

Their latest movie is transformed into a musical but for Lina the transition to talkies isn't so easy-she has the most horrible singing voice.But they have a solution to that problem.They dub over her voice using an actress called Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds).There is the plot for this incredible movie called Singin' in the Rain (1952).Gene Kelly (1912-1996) in the lead is just brilliant.The way he sings!The way he dances!The way he acts!He was a star that you can't find too many these days.He wasn't only the star of this movie, he also directed it with Stanley Donen.I have to give credit to other actors too because they really deserve it.Debbie Reynolds (1932-) is wonderful as Kathy.Donald O'Connor, who plays Don's former partner Cosmo Brown is superb.Unfortunately Donald passed away this year to heart failure at the age of 78.We will miss you, Donnie. This movie has the most amazing singing and dancing scenes.Just watch how Gene sings and dances in the rain so cheerfully without a worry on his mind.And O'Connor's performance Make 'Em Laugh is really something. They really don't make movies like this anymore.Some people want to bring the musicals back and that's good.Chicago and Moulin Rouge are two modern musical movies and probably there will be more.But I think the magic's gone.There was magic in the musicals when there were Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.But those days are gone now.Watch Singin' in the Rain and have a piece of the good old times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Musical Of All Time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and I am not merely saying this because I love it..., I am not saying this because AFI says it, but I have watched this film over and over again since I was six, and I have not been able to forget it. It was mentioned at my theater class a few years ago, and it is by far one of the most colorful musical of all time.Who could incorporate more important songs into one musical like they did here? Unlike many musicals that are coming out not, this was originally a movie. The plot is so beautiful, and the songs just nail it on the head.While the film is long... possibly too long for a young child, it is certainly a movie that should not be watched in two sittings. The splendor of the color and the dance sequences are killed when the film is stopped. Believe me. I know this from experience. The plot is relatively simple. Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan) are two legendary silent film stars. A young Debbie Reynolds is a great Kathy Selden, a girl who is trying to break into the film business. Lana Lamont (Jean Hagan), who is Don's stage girlfriend, disproves of Kathy's breaking in, because Kathy is winning Don's affection and love. All at the same time, a movie that Don and Lana have made, `The Dueling Caviler' is not safe. Warner Brothers has come out with their first talkie, `The Jazz Singer' and studios are now converting to sound. Not only that, but they must do so, also, in order for the long-awaited film, `The Dueling Caviler' to be a success. So Don, Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and Kathy decide that the film must be made into a musical, `The Dancing Cavalier'. One problem- Lana's wretched voice. Kathy will have to dub all of Lana's lines and songs without Lana knowing.The film ends with a great finale and all throughout the film the sons are intertwined with great fun. Not only is this film the best film ever, it is one of the most fun!MPAA Rating: GMy Rating: 4-upMy * Rating: 9.5This film contains: Minor Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Only Thing Missing is a Couple of Droogs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the title song to Stanley Donen's Singin' in the Rain. The whole scene, with Gene Kelly joyfully relishing in his love for Debbie Reynolds is a pure and simple delight. Yet, strangely enough, it's Malcolm MacDowell and his Droogs' home invasion, assault, and gang-rape in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange that gives me a pause when I think of SITR.That and the fact that, after it gets off to a rousing, funny, and witty start, Donen and Gene Kelly's musical comes apart at the seams, with one over-long and self-indulgent song-and-dance number after another, eventually causing the movie to become a tedious mess instead of the tender love story it should have been.With all-due attention given to my musical apostasy, I got half way through Singin' in the Rain and started to squirm and harumph, wondering when this damn thing would be over. I started longing for an episode of Don't Forget the Lyrics--at least that's only an hour! SITR just seems to go on and on, heaping on noisy songs, and it's not until the end that Donen and Kelly bring the original story back to its logical start, that of a talented heel who finds character and fulfillment in a nice girl's arms.Singin' in the Rain is a big, bloviating pain in the butt, with one or two great--really great--bits, and a sore butt for sitting through the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic MGM Musical Of Hollywood Silent Movie Hijinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont are silent movie stars in Hollywood in 1927 when all of a sudden the talkies come in, and unfortunately Lina can't sing or dance and sounds like a balloon exploding. Don, with the help of his friends Cosmo and Kathy, hatches a crazy plan to turn their new picture into a musical success despite Lina's shortcomings ...There are certain untouchable movies the Establishment informs us we must like. I agree with some of these choices (Citizen Kane, The French Connection) and disagree violently with others (Gigi, Kramer vs. Kramer). Singin' In The Rain falls somewhere in the middle; I like and admire it, but I don't quite see what all the fuss is about. It has great dancing, some good songs (the majority of which were not written for the film), is very well made and keeps you chuckling. But for me it's not the greatest musical of all time and it's not Kelly's best movie, or even his best musical (that's An American In Paris). It's real strength I think is in the variety of dancing. Rather than either the big glamorous ballroom numbers or good-natured hot-cha-cha hoofing, it has almost every conceivable type of number; a romantic waltz, a crazy tune, a tap duet, a vaudeville stroll, a three-way jitterbug around the house, a big Broadway folie, even a ballet sequence. All of these are terrifically staged and expertly performed - the title song (originally from The Hollywood Revue Of 1929) is of course one of the most famous moments in cinema, but I prefer the zesty Moses Supposes shenanigans and the showstopping Good Morning number with all three leads in top-notch form. The film also has great art direction by MGM's design genius Cedric Gibbons, and the gentle satire of Hollywood's transition from silents to sound is nicely done, particularly by co-star Hagen (who actually dubbed herself in the scene where Reynolds is dubbing her). However, something just doesn't tickle me the way it should about this movie (and many other fifties musicals) - I dig the dancing but the romantic and melancholic aspects always seem phoney to me and pad it out. It keeps coming up with interesting moments though, like the vampy dance Charisse does or just about all of O'Connor's slapstick. It's good entertainment, but I can't help wondering if those who rate it so highly really admire it as much as they say they do. Written by Adolph Green and Betty Comden. Bizarre trivia - there are fascinatingly weird references to this movie in two science-fiction classics; A Clockwork Orange and Alien.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This musical was built around the title song. It was calculated to please the masses, and it does. The three leads all turn in fabulous performances, with some of the best dance moves by O'Connor, and some of the finest singing by Reynolds. Of course the best all around singing and dancing is by Gene Kelley, especially performing the title song. You would probably have to have been living under a rock to have been born in the 20th Century and not seen that scene at some point. Noteworthy in that and many other scenes are the long, continuous takes of song- and-dance numbers. They are beautifully shot with no cuts to interrupt the flow. Ultimately, the film is little more than a bunch of dance numbers with a corny plot to string them together. If that's good enough for you - you'll love it. If you want more substance be it romance, drama or what have you, chances are you'll find 'Singin' in the Rain' little more than a pleasant time-waster.</fullReview>

It has a good cast and great production values, including gorgeous color, but to me, it was just a "pleasant" movie -- not all that funny, and with only a couple of memorable dance numbers: The "Singin' In the Rain" number by Gene Kelly, and the terrific segment with the fantastically talented and sensuous Cyd Charisse. Why she didn't become a bigger star than she was, I'll never understand. Nothing against the also-talented and versatile Debbie Reynolds, but I would like to have seen less of Debbie and a lot more of Cyd. Maybe this is just a movie that hasn't worn well over the years, but to me, it's greatly overrated. All that being said, it's good family-type entertainment, and they couldn't make a musical like this today. Multi-talented performers like these are gone forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O'Connors steals the show!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of musical movies, in general, and this one is no exception. I only give the movie a 6 out of 10, because of Donald O'Connor's amazing dance and movement, and Debbie Reynold's innocence. The focus of my comments, however, goes to Mr. O'Connor. The fact that he spent 3 days in bed resting after "Make 'em laugh" shows how hard this man worked. It is one of the most brilliant pieces of solo physical comedy in any film. Donald O'Connor makes dancing look like walking, it's so natural for him. Gene Kelly dances like the egoist that he apparently was. I love the fluidity of O'Connor's movements, and the contrast is never so pronounced as when they are dancing the duet in the elocutionists office. O'Connor is fluid, whereas Kelly is clearly stiff and wooden and "on". This is what makes O'Connor, and Danny Kaye, so much more professional than the Kellys and the Astaires. They put their efforts into their work, not into their egos. I also can see where Chevy Chase snagged some of his aping techniques that he used so well when he mocked Jane Curtin behind her back on Weekend Update. O'Connor does the job here, behind the elocutionists back - what facial dexterity!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Musical, But Still The Band Wagon is Higher !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No doubt that (American in Paris - 1951), and (Singin' in the Rain - 1952) are the climax of the American musical, but for me I think that (The Band Wagon - 1953) overtopped them both. In many ways; one of them is the coherent meaningful script.Anyway (Singin' in the Rain) remains as more attractive, lively and funny than (American in Paris). Actually the matter of spoofing the allusion of cinema, or even dealing with one of the cinema's ages as a stage of comedy was something this movie mastered enjoyably.The songs with the dancing numbers are all not a great part of the American culture but a great part of the human civilization. I always think of these works as the most colorful, sweet, maybe sexy installments in the mankind's legacy.However the thing that bothered me the most is this case of separation between the songs and the drama. After a while I discovered how the songs were written first then the drama came later to connect them. Although this story was really good and so comic but it's still far from being the perfect plot for all of these spectacular lovely songs. It appears clearly and shamefully while "Gotta Dance" big number where its drama is about loving a star who loves money and being famous only.. Things got nearly nothing to do with the main story arc.(Debbie Reynolds) seems pale among all the gems around her. (Donald O'Connor) was fabulous like a live dynamite bomb ! Yet why I felt that he lacked more lines or situations. (Jean Hagen) as the evil stupid (Lina Lamont) was so talented and attractive (more than the female lead herself !). (Gene Kelly) is floating like a moon in its orbit. The thing about him is that you can't tell he was less shinny in one movie than the other.. This is a thing you might never get to say about him ever; and that's my definition of genius talent with favorable karma. In fact at this very moment he was, as a star and a director, determined to deliver not only the best of him but the best of what Hollywood could deliver out of cinematic musical.It's a treasure from an age where nearly everything was a real treasure. You've got to miss not only that time of innocence, class, politeness, and romance, but also this genre in specific especially when it comes to one of its best. And in our poor days of Action and Comedy falls where everything is supersomething or fart joke (or sequel to both !), and no where to (Cyd Charisse) to dance fierily, or for (Donald O'Connor) to make'em laugh, or to (Gene Kelly) to sing in the rain. MAN, I know that every time has its distinctive marks but now cinematically nobody gets near to singin' and dancin' in the rain anymore !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta Dance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how big of a stick in the mud you may be, this movie will charm you. It's refreshing to see dance used in such an immaculate way. It's more about what feels good rather than what looks good. Watching Gene Kelly dance is like watching a good surgeon cut, all precision and joy. Jean Regan's egomaniacal whiner is classic as is Donald O' Connor's happy friend and Debbie Reynolds gutsy ingénue. His "Make 'em Laugh", done while a set is going up, over and around the construction, is a sight to see. All the numbers are pure fun, especially the creamy title sequence which captures the euphoria of finding that special person and "Good Morning", which is that perfect morning after number with the coach jump. The movie itself is an effective peck on the cheek of the old films, particularly musicals. This is also the best meta-movie ever made or, at least, the most fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Glorious Feeling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Singin' in the Rain" is #10 on AFI's list of the 100 best American films. When I first saw this placement, I was a little iffy. A musical over "Bridge on the River Kwai", "Star Wars", and "Psycho"? I was not convinced. Then i SAW the film, and I realized why it places so high. Movies are made to entertain and make the viewer feel good, and "Singin'" might do this better than any movie ever made. It's not the great songs, the dances that accompany them, or even the gloriously positive ending ("She's the star of the picture!") that makes the viewer feel so good when watching this film. There seems to be a certain something, a certain, well, happiness, to the whole film. Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen definitely did what they set out to do when they made this. Filled with bright colors, unforgettable moments, and utterly touching, human characters, "Singin'" is the perfect antidote for films like "House on Haunted Hill" and "Rollerball"-films which make the viewer feel upset upon finishing them. The feel-good movie of the year in 1952, "Singin' in the Rain" is now considered the feel-good film of the century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the greatest musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dance numbers in this picture are terrific, charged with energy and performed to near perfection by all involved. I can't help but say however, that although the film is good and well worth seeing, it is vastly, vastly overrated as far as the praise and notoriety it has received down through the years. The satire on old time Hollywood is not fully realized, leaving us with what is essentially a thinly strung together collection of set pieces, one of which really comes out of left field and has not a whole lot to do with the main plot . Just like he did in "An American In Paris, another vastly overrated classic, Gene Kelly's dynamic Broadway sequence is a long detour from what we are expecting as far as a cohesive and flowing storyline. It is this kind of dance sequence that prompted his "invitation to the dance" some years after, a film that didn't allow plot and dialogue to get in the way of artistic dancing. Another flaw in Singin' in the Rain is the unauthenticity of some of the musical numbers as far as what the standard was in 1930. As good and as entertaining as the film is, flaws aside, in no way does it hold a candle to the REAL greatest musical ever made, "Kiss me Kate."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential American musical one of Hollywood's finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singin' in the Rain is probably the greatest musical in the history of the motion picture and arguably one of the finest films in general. The movie approaches perfection on virtually all fronts: superbly integrated numbers, breathtaking dancing, inspired performances, and great dialogue -- all wrapped up in a movie-lover's dream: a story centered around the mad scramble of Hollywood studios to make the transition to sound during the late 1920s. Gorgeous color is like the icing on the cake, as vivid reds, blues, and yellows seem to leap right off the screen. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and Jean Hagen are all smashing in their roles; I am doubtful there are more than a handful of films with as absolutely faultless casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three Words Make This Film-Gene, DEBBIE, and Donald.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people consider this to be the best musical film that has ever been made, or ever will be made. I'm one of them. The three leads were absolutely perfect. Gene Kelly never danced better, Debbie Reynolds gave one of her greatest and probably most underrated performances, and Donald O'Connor was never slicker and more witty. The chemistry between the three leads is perfect, Gene and Debbie exude growing love. You feel a REAL friendship between Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown. This chemistry is one of the reasons why this film works so well; can you see Howard Keel dancing in the rain as originally planned? Or someone else besides Debbie popping out of a cake. The music is the best and the dancing is SECOND TO NONE. The most famous obviously is Gene Kelly splashing around in puddles; and is the second most recognizable moment is screen history (first is Scarlett O'Hara's silhouette in front of Tara-with that classic score behind her.) I LOVE Debbie Reynolds, so I really enjoyed "All I Do Is Dream Of You." But my favorite number by far is "Good Mornin'" and this is why: it is the only number to include all three leads. Plus, it's fun to imitate. This is my favorite film after the Star Wars Trilogy. If not for George Lucas, I'd have missed so many classic films, I have to give him thanks. If he never hired Carrie Fisher for Star Wars, I'd have never paid any attention to her mother. Debbie Reynolds is truly a classic work. I'm glad I started paying attention. Thanks George.</fullReview>

The affectionate lampooning of 20's Hollywood is spot on and my favourite scene goes not to the the most famous piece of musical history but to Kelly's dignity always dignity speech with visual highlights of how he's character really made it as a star. I must have seen this movie about 20 times now and I can always sit through another screening and find a new favourite line or scene and that's the mark of something special.I could go on but all I really need to add is just see it 10/10.</fullReview>

After all, it's a film about "making it big" within Hollywood all the while the main character Gene Kelly secret affection is for the up andcoming actress character Kathy Seldon played by now infamous DebbieReynolds who was barely twenty years old at the time, but don't quote me. Idon't blame character Don Lockwood (Kelly) trading in Lina Lamont, played byJean Hagen (who to her credit, played the dumb SQUEAKY talking blonde) wasthe on screen partner to Lockwood who CAYNT stand Lina!

		<fullReview>Story of a silent film hearthrob's uneasy transition into stardom in the "talkie" era is spiced with the cream of N.H. Brown's MGM library crop. The dance sequences are superb, featuring Charisse as the "dream girl". But what really makes the film is the real chemistry and well-developed (within the limited time available) love story. Comden and Green have provided a very nice script, and the photography and directing are excellent. The song "Make 'em Laugh" is a blatant rip-off of Cole Porter's "Be A Clown" (written for the Freed unit only a few years before), and all the other music is from the 30s, so this lack of originality is the film's only real fault.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had put off seeing this movie because of the tremendous amount of build-up it has associated with it. "The Best Movie Musical of All Time" is a large title to uphold and...well...it just couldn't do it. Now, before I get pummelled with rotten tomatoes, I'd like to point out the things I really liked about the film.First, and foremost, watching Gene Kelly dance was very entertaining. He really made it look effortless, and it was so delightful to see a man of his build and facial expressions doing the kind of dancing he was doing. One just doesn't get the opportunity to see that in film anymore, and I think it would still be received appreciatively today.Jean Hagen's performance was hilarious. She was very believable and no "dumb blonde" either (well, of course she was!). To me she was the true scene stealer who gave a timeless comedic performance that will continue to be revered.I think one of the reasons this movie will not be timeless as a whole, however, is because of the Donald O'Connor character. There is no doubt this man was a product of a time when Hollywood actors had to work extremely hard to earn their money (I'm thinking of his dancing solo where he defies gravity) but there is an element to his performance that screams "I'M TRYING TOO HARD TO ENTERTAIN YOU" and it is hard to ignore. I found it to be really annoying, particularly in the "Good Morning" segment, which in and of itself, was a terribly silly concept and situation. Not a funny silly either--more of a preposterous silly.I don't think a film like this could be redone, and I don't think it is supposed to be. It is just one of those films you are supposed to see because it represents a certain time in American film history, and it can be appreciated for some of the things it is missing. Hard work was definitely not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's magnificent, but it's not a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Witnessing the charge of the doomed Light Brigade against Russian artillery, the French general Rene Bosquet famously remarked: "C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre" - "It's magnificent, but it's not war". After watching 'Singin' in the Rain' again yesterday, I'm strangely left with a similar feeling ? it's magnificent, but it's not really a movie, is it? That is to say, although it is on the outset even a movie about movies, about Hollywood and about the making of movies, it's not really cinematic. 'Singin' in the Rain', for all its spectacle, just doesn't do what great movies, in my mind, do and ought to do ? namely, tell a story in a way that is specific to the movie as a form. Of course, the dancing is wonderful, but it strikes me as being a beefed-up Broadway show put on the screen.Don't get me wrong. I love this movie. I absolutely adore it. It's like a birthday party with cake and soda for two hours straight. So, this isn't really offered as negative criticism, at least I don't think so, because I really don't want to speak badly about something wonderful. It's more a kind of puzzlement.What is the specifically cinematic anyway? Well, it's hard to say, as it could be a lot of things, but let's look briefly at one possibility. If you look at Bergman, for instance, (yes, an unfair comparison if ever there was one), you'll find the cinematic in an exploration of the unification of photography and theatre ? the two antithetic sources of cinema. Yes, if you want to play Hegelian, you could say that there is dialectic here. Theatre is the theses ? it's all about the forward movement of the plot in time, it's action-packed, it's a temporal art form. The action is viewed at a distance. We know characters by their actions. The antithesis is photography. Here we have slices of time, extrapolated from movement and frozen in single moments. Photography makes close-ups possible. It allows a different way of knowing people. It lets us look for an essence, a timelessness in them, by way of the exploration of portraits. The synthesis of these two forms is the cinema, realized at it's height by Bergman in movies like 'Scenes from a Marriage', and perhaps above all 'Cries and Whispers'. Perhaps it reaches it's peak (or perhaps it goes too far and turns back on itself) in the relatively unknown 'Karin's Face', which consist of a series of photographs, a montage.The cinematic could be a lot of other things as well, of course. In Fellini it is produced by the way the scenes are linked and cut. But I won't go further with this now.Anyway, Singin in the Rain, despite taking movies as it's very theme, never becomes cinematic. It never moves beyond the theatre. There are hardly a close-up of a face throughout the movie. Those that are there seems either just not important, like the one of Gene Kelly in the beginning, or actually attempts to turn the face into another comical prop by treating it as a plastic instrument, distorting it, actually removing human personality from it ? I'm referring to the, admittedly side-splittingly hilarious, funny faces made by Donald O'Connor.Well, I don't know? I could be way off the mark here, it was just something that occurred to me. In any event, I'm still rating it a 10, because, cinematic or not, it's still magnificent... whatever it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most over-rated film ever? Pure contrived advertising and product placement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most disappointing film I have ever seen.It is certainly not the worst film, but I had such high expectations because of the cast and how famous the movie is.However, as a movie, it is contrived, banal, uninteresting, uninspiring and unbelievable. In fact, none of the movie made sense at all until I watched the special features that contained interviews with some of those originally associated with the movie.Then it all became clear: One interviewee pointed out that the film was created purely as a vehicle to string some promising songs together, as well as to try and recycle a couple of duds that had bombed in the hope they would be better received on this outing.And that is exactly what the movie looks like - a disjointed collection of 'music videos' strung together into a contrived story.Lots of other movies or stage shows have taken the same tack, such as the Abba musical Mama Mia. And while they may be harmless fun, they would not qualify as 'great' musicals in the way that the truly great musicals can - where music and story are brilliantly woven together into a beautiful fabric that is better than either the story or the music could be on its own.It has some merit as an example of an early advertising vehicle, where the threat posed by product pitches in distorting and destroying art was not yet fully understood. But any reasonably critical view of this film at that time should have stopped this poor film and that tragic trend in their tracks.As it turned out, audiences were prepared to accept and even celebrate the mediocre in order to fawn over favorite celebrities. And that wide embrace of shameless-advertising-as-art and celebrity over quality would prove over subsequent decades to be the dominant trend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best film musical of all time?! I don't think so G.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with the expectation that it would have a good storyline that would keep my interest like Oliver, My Fair Lady, or at least Mary Poppins. I was sorely disappointed. This film has been called "the best" film musical of all time. I do not share that opinion.The characters were campy. Gene Kelly was far too happy all the time and it made it very difficult for me to watch him. The dumb blonde played by Jean Hagen was an exception. I found her to be very funny (apparently so did Frank Loesser in that he plagiarized her character in his musical "How to Succeed at Business Without Really Trying".) The supporting cast was fair and Debbie Reynolds was competent but I really see no reason to rave about this musical.I would take Fred Astaire over Gene Kelly any day for choreography. The story is rudely and abruptly interrupted by this ridiculous "vision" that Kelly has where he is suddenly on Broadway or at a burlesque show and this horrible dance sequence that lasted forever, all in the name of his character finding a good ending to their swashbuckling movie. From swashbuckler to Broadway is a bit of a stretch. Speaking of stretch, visions shouldn't take up half a movie in MY book.This movie was genuinely bad. I am sorry that this is considered a classic. I guess we can look for future generations to hail the Beegee's and Peter Frampton for their "ingenious" work when they name "Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" a musical "classic" as well. After I saw "Singin' In The Rain" I could clearly see why the musical genre took a steep dive back then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This picture got it all - a witty and satirical script, great musical numbers, a funny score, and great acting. Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor do wonders together, and Jean Hagen is great as a dumb blonde. The numbers "Moses Supposes" and "Broadway Ballet" are musical treats that is rarely seen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not, there are better musicals out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like usin' the word "overrated" ('cause it always sounds like: "people who loved this movie are idiots"). Still, I seen too many hyperbolic comments about Singin' In The Rain: "best musical ever", "best movie ever"... sorry but I really can't agree.Since my English is quite bad, I'll get straight to the point: as a comedy, it's VERY dated, and quite childish to boot. It's not a complete disaster, some lines are still pretty funny, but everything else is na?ve to say the least - and I think it wasn't so good even in the fifties. Talking' about the "musical" part... two songs are simply beautiful ("Make 'Em Laugh" and, of course, the immortal "Singin' in the rain"), the rest is just good, but not memorable; only when it comes to dancin', the movie shines. Still, some dancin' sequences don't fit with the rest of the movie: if you seen Michael Kidd's awesome work for "Seven Brides For Seven Brothers" (now THAT's a masterpiece that aged well), you can't help but notice it.If you only watched this one, do yourself a favor and try Little Shop Of Horrors, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, West Side Story. They're not just great musicals, they're also great MOVIES, something that can't be said about Singin' In The Rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basically soggy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title song is catchy, and it's doubtless interesting for younger viewers (those under 65) to see why this guy was so happy that he'd get all wet and yet remain in high spirits. The whole thing is so clearly fake that the most impressive thing in that scene (apart from the cunning decision not to use cardboard for the lamp-posts) is the wonderful drainage on the set.Hmmm... you write a tongue-in-cheek review with a sarcastic title, and now the reviews are of course reviewed... well, fair enough, this is not a "useful" review, as determined by fans of the film that have been willing to trawl through and rate the 200 or so comments... but for the average Joe who will probably never make it through to the last pages of the reviews anyway, feel free to make up your own mind -- if you're planning to direct or star in your own musical, it may be compulsory viewing -- there's no denying it is a classic that captured the hearts of a generation or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is actually more to the movie than Gene Kelly's stroll down the pluvial sidewalk.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously, everyone remembers Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) dancing down the street while it's raining. In case anyone's forgotten the plot, it's about the arrival of sound in Hollywood and how it destroyed some people's careers due to their voices. So, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) - who has a scratchy voice - has to get dubbed by Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) - who has a beautiful voice. Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) provides some comic relief.The idea that this innovation ruined some people's careers...that actually has some relevance to the present. Every time that there's some innovation, it shortens our attention spans. The radio, TV, even the Internet...they have all shortened our attention spans. Whereas once we had to use our imaginations about everything and/or go out and experience life a little more, we can now just do everything from home.Oh, well. I guess that there's nothing that we can do about that. I guess that all that we can do is watch "Singin' in the Rain" and wait for Gene Kelly to explain "what a glorious feeling" it is. I wouldn't call it the world's greatest movie, but it is an important part of film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good musical film with great dance numbers,very good color,a good educational story and a cast that looks like they are having so much fun.A great production.Gene Kelly was not as good as Fred Astaire but he still was a great talent and fully displays it here.Could have been a masterpiece with better screenplay and editing.Also,the musical number "Make 'Em Laugh" was irritating and should have been cut.Only for fans of Hollywood musicals and big fans of the lead actors........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's 1 person who hates this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this film is considered a classic among classics, but as a knowledgeable fan of 1920's music, I always thought this film was the most typically bad example of rewriting late 1920's/early 1930's history. Yes, the settings and costumes are more proper to the period than other films, but the arrangements of the music is strictly 1952.Also, I must put in a plug; I have always thought that Gene Kelly was the most overrated Dancer/Actor of that era.So, while I'm sure that my comments won't change anyone else's love for this movie, I, for one, have always thought it was another typical 1950's musical attempt at history with no grains of truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, unfunny, and over-rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother to try to change my opinion, I just don't like this movie. I didn't think it was funny, or entertaining, or anywhere near being worthy of all the accolades. Why do people mention this movie in the same breath as Hidden Fortress or City Lights? It's obscene and insulting. This is no classic movie. This is just a stage musical in front of a camera. And why is that one dance number near the end so interminably long?Musicals and non-musicals should be kept separate from each other, as documentaries are not put in the same category with fictional or "depicted non-fiction" movies. If you want to like musicals, fine, but don't insist that *I* have to like them in order to "appreciate film."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know this is going to be contentious, but I HATED this film. I'm a fan of musicals, but this is by far the worst musical I've ever seen. I only carried on after the first half hour because my wife came to watch (and ridicule) it with me.. otherwise I could not have taken any more. I found it so boring that I didn't care one bit what the ending was going to be - I was ready to go out for dinner, but my wife said she was at least curious to know the ending.It's musicals like "Singin' in the Rain" that help give musicals a bad rep amongst the young IMO - people bursting into cheesy, pointless songs, with ridiculous, goofy expressions on their faces while doing slapstick dance routines that make you want to cringe with embarrassment. It was all so silly - over-the-top acting at every turn, Cosmo's clowning around downright embarrassing, and some of the cheesiest effects imaginable in the dance routines. As far as being a comedy, there's more good humour in the first 5 minutes of Phantom of the Opera than there is in SITR.The only scene of any worth at all is the title song, which is understandably a classic scene. But the film itself is just horrible. It embodies everything I don't like about old musicals. Another "classic" movie I hope I never have to sit through again.UGH. 2/10.</fullReview>
