		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter "What's this?" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What'd this guy look like anyway?" "Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'." "Uh-huh. In what way?" "Just a general way." In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen's finest film. Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, "He's fleeing the interview!" Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife. If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Forgo Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. "You're darn tootin'," they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, "Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW." It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. "Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?" Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it "ought to be really cold tomorrow." Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a blank white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, "Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are." (A perfect day!) There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands."Fargo" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Those Rare Gems in the Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as "Fargo". It's one of those films that you just have to see. William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day. I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film. "Fargo" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved. In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you can't stop watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An instant classic. I must admit what attracted me at first was the wood chipper incident I had heard about but by the time the movie gets there, I was in a totally in a different universe. While the movie does not have anything to keep you glued to the screen (a wicked script, lots of action) you can't prevent yourself from wanting to see what happens next. This is due to the wonderfully portrayed characters. Steve Buscemi's performance as Carl Showalter is fabulous. I love when he is confronted by Shep Proudfoot and tells him to "hey man, smoke a f***in peace-pipe", or any of his conversations with Jerry Lundegard are priceless - "I'm not going to debate you Jerry, I'm not going to DEBATE". My recent favorite is when he storms out of the hideout and says "and if you see Shep Proudfoot, tell him I'm gonna nail his f***kin ass". The Jerry Lundegard character is such a beautiful loser, I don't know where to begin. I especially love his reappearing temper tantrums(slamming the phone book in his office, scraping the ice off the windshield, jumping up and down after his father in law leaves the house with the million dollars) and practicing the phone call to his father in law where he tells him his wife has been kidnapped - too funny. Marge Gunderson is the glue that holds it all together with a performance by Frances Mcdormand well deserved of an Oscar. I thought they might have overdid it a tiny bit with the scene with Marge and the two hookers (too many "Ya's" in it) but otherwise a wonderful, refreshing character in the middle of a bunch of losers. Her character is so honest and persistent, it makes me wonder why I cant find a woman like that - and then I realize, I'm watching a movie and a brilliant one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages. The story is well thought out. The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality. The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent. Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across. Every film course should make use of this movie to demonstrate how to make a very good film without relying on a bottomless budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody seems to know that Fargo is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody seems to know that Fargo is first and foremost a beautiful and very simple love story about two ordinary rural small town American people and secondly a superbly acted crime murder mayhem movie, probably the best that has ever been filmed. Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end. Fargo is as close to capturing and portraying real life as a director and bunch of actors can get. I wish IMDb had a just one time eleven so I could crown it emperor above all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Effort From A Number Of People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure "black comedy." It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three "are a trip." Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, "Marge Gunderson," elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband "Norm" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in "Carl Showalter" (Buscemi) and "Gaear Grimsrud" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances "Mike Yanagita" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reflections on a second viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found "The Big Lebowski" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at "Fargo", "The Big Lebowski", and "Brother, Where Art Thou?" as being the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as "Intolerable Cruelty" and "The Ladykillers", could be proving their peak creativity is behind them. "Fargo" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this out - 8.2 for "Fargo", 8.0 for "Lebowski", and 7.8 for "Brother". For sheer entertainment, "Lebowski" or should I call it, "The Dude" wins handsdown, but "Fargo" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence. Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again. And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose around her. She knows all-to-well that "you know what" happens, but always knows "you know what" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations. I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing. Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in religion playing a part in morality, so be it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joel Coen the director of "Fargo", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. "Fargo" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of "Fargo" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country."Fargo" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FARGO (1996) **** Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Harve Presnell, Peter Stormare. Dark comic undertones and excellent character actor performances dominate this richly macabre crime story gone awry flick by the Coen brothers(Joel and Ethan) involving pathetic used car salesman Macy so hard up for money and respect (not necessarily in that order) that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife for ransom from his father-in-law's vast wealth in a plot-line that unravels with nice little twists and snags. McDormand (Best Actress) is perfect as a pregnant Midwestern sheriff on the case with a no-nonsense and homespun effect with her tactics of crime solving. Great cinematography by Roger A. Deakins accentuates the bleak winterscape of unearthed uneasiness. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Macy, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Academy Award winner for Best Original Screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.Fargo.Surely none of the characters are real life persons but yet I'm not watching a cartoon. None of the dialog seems to be of this Earth, yet I'm not watching a re-enactment of our planet by the inhabitants of Planet KzOrp. So I can only imagine that I'm watching a comedy or at least a movie with an attempt at humor. I mean, what else could it be? It's too preposterous to be a thriller and the characters and the screenplay are too bizarre to make it a drama. I must have been misinformed about this genre of film. Because it has always been my understanding that a comedy had something to do with laughter and amusement. A ridiculous situation could become quite funny, but truly not when the whole movie is ridiculous as well. Same goes for the abominable, hateful characters.If the movie Groundhog Day, arguably amongst the best comedies ever made, was made by the Coen brothers, they would have had the entire village reliving the same day over and over again. And not only that, they would have made every character in that movie be twice as arrogant (Murray), dorky (Larry) and desirable (MacDowell) etc. Its result would be the a monstrosity of a caricature .This movie lacks everything what Groundhog Day makes a good comedy; namely finesse, subtlety and something which makes the viewer not being alienated from the characters and above all, something actually funny going on. (Since when is a kidnapping and a lot of deaths a funny setting? Because Buscemi and Macy are in it?..give me a break, this is hardly Pulp Fiction)For a crime/thriller based on actual fact, it lacks a seriousness and perhaps even respect to the events that have taken place. And the lack of means of time-travel aside, watching Fargo, I was expecting Jeff Bridges to walk onto the set looking for his stupid rug which would have been my longed for queue to press the eject button.So all in all it is not a comedy, it is not a crime/drama/thriller but simply a Coen production. To me it's just an incredibly annoying in-between-genre film which cannot decide what it's supposed to be. Therefore it misses the mark on all counts which make the redeeming qualities of the production (and there are a lot) seem sadly wasted.But it seems to be the minority opinion?the bandwagon ride is so comfy..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Did I Miss Here?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I've heard of the litany of accolades this movie has received. I've heard how this film is a "black comedy" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor. Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs. Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims. The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles. But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash. Sigh. What did I miss here?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been good, but just plain annoying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only classify this film as a missed opportunity. While it did have a good storyline, worthy of a film noir, and some very good performances, especially by William H. Macy (you can almost see him crumbling under the weight of not just his crimes, but his cover-ups as well), it is tainted by the Coen brothers' directorial style. What made it intolerable for me was the amount of "quirkiness" that was injected into every single character, scene, and situation. Taken alone, each little quirk is not a big deal, but after so many of them, one after another, it just gets too much to stomach.Some examples...The title: The movie takes place mostly in Minneapolis (which isn't quirky enough -- that's where the Mary Tyler Moore Show took place, after all), and Brainerd (and nobody would go see a movie called "Brainerd"). About 5 minutes of screen time were set in Fargo, and Fargo has a quirky-enough sound."True" story: Just because a story is true, does that make it a better story? There is both good and bad fiction and non-fiction. So, what is gained by lying about whether a story is true or not? Quirkiness! See, if you believe this story is true, then all this quirkiness must be true too!Names: Character names were given as Grimsrud, Lundegaard, Showalter and Gunderson. Apparently, Scandinavian-sounding names (especially with a double-a) are much quirkier than Pryce, Lopez, Rossi and Sheppard.The weather: The snow and the cold serve no purpose but to make the characters put on parkas and snow boots, which make them look quirky. For instance, when the policeman was talking with the man shoveling his driveway, and had to put his hood up so far you couldn't see his face. Quirky! However, anyone who lives in a cold climate knows that when the sky is that grey and the snow is as wet as the stuff he was shoveling, it isn't all that cold...Accents: Whether or not people actually talk "like that", what's the point of everyone talking like some country bumpkin, even the ones in the fairly large city of Minneapolis? Accents: quirky. No accents: not quirky.Pregnancy: Apart from making the lead character wobble when she walked, and to give her a convenient excuse to throw up every once in a while, what exactly was the point of making the police chief pregnant? Ah yes, another quirk.The old friend: A cop meeting an old high school flame at a bar. Sounds kinda dull, right? Well, let's quirk it up a bit. Make the cop a woman -- no, wait: a pregnant woman. Make the guy Oriental. Make it totally unnecessary to the plot. Now we're talkin' quirky!By the time we get to the end, we're almost surprised that Macy's character sold plain old GM cars instead of Austin Minis or VW Beetles. The whole thing feels like the directors had no confidence in the subject matter, so they slathered on layer after layer of quirks in the hope the audience wouldn't notice.In the end, it just becomes an exercise in frustration, as a movie that had everything going for it just turns you off after one wink and a poke in the ribs too many.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated film, but a good one none-the-less.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FARGO (1996)THE GOOD:--I loved the music in the film. It brought across that small town murder feeling really well, and had a kind of Celtic value to it.--I saw "Fargo" as being a good comedy, as well as a story about how money corrupts good people. As the movie goes along, the characters get into deeper and deeper crap, and why? For a little bit of money, as Marge says near the end of the film. There are some shocking deaths along the course of the storyline, all which have an effect on the audience, as each time someone is shot down it seems like the characters are finding it easier and easier, a convenience to get out of something they don't want to do.--Joel Coen, director, gives the film real character, and sets up some pretty neat camera shots too. My favourite one was when it appeared we were looking at some kind of playground or car park, and then a figure wanders in, the only moving thing in the frame. I loved this shot because it was just so damn clever, and very well set up. It was kind of like an optical illusion. There were a number of other good camera shots and cinematography techniques, often very simple yet very effective.--Frances McDormand won an Oscar for her role as Margie in this movie, and I think it was very well deserved. She was pretty funny in parts, as well as bringing a likeability and sympathetic value to her character (I still think Emily Watson deserved the Oscar for her phenomenal performance in "Breaking the Waves"). Steve Buscemi is wonderful to watch as always, he has so much rogue charm to him, and is just a damn entertaining actor. My favourite performance in the film came from William H. Macy, a very underrated actor, who brought the character of Jerry Lundegard to life in many ways. I loved how he was quite a nice guy, a friendly guy who was just lost on what to do when he wanted money. Macy shows very well the enjoyable, nice guy value to Jerry as well as being a darker character in other places in the film.THE BAD:--The film walks a fine line plot-wise.there doesn't seem to be all that much in this movie really. It has a number of unimportant scenes that I felt the movie could've done without (Marge's old college buddy Mike?). Some of them were funny and enjoyable, while quite a few just dragged the film down and made it boring and slow in places.RATING:7/10 - I appreciated this movie, and it was made well. Perhaps it just wasn't particularly to my taste, I just didn't find it as engaging or masterful as many have over the years. Real good then, yah.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMEND:The Ice Storm (9/10) O Brother, Where Art Thou? (5/10) Pulp Fiction (10/10) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (4/10) Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is one of my favorite films of all time and in my opinion deserves to be in the top 10 films of the 90's. From the onset of the movie, with views of the snow covered North Dakota landscape and the beautiful and haunting music of composer Carter Burwell playing in the background until the very last scene, Fargo never lets up. This film is Joel and Ethan Cohen's masterpiece, a truly original and one of a kind work. Every aspect of the film is handled with the utmost precision and care. The screenplay, written by Joel and Ethan, is in my opinion flawless. The dialog is at times serious and at other times hilarious, but most importantly always real and believable. The screenplay would be worth nothing, however, without the superb cast of the film that truly makes the characters come to life. Frances McDormand is perfect as the pregnant sheriff who is assigned to the murder case involving Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, playing a sleazy kidnapper who is perfectly described in one of the best lines of the film as simply "funny looking - in a general kind of way". The best performance, however, comes from William H. Macy who is absolutely brilliant as a desperate man who has everything to lose. Macy completely envelops himself in the role and captures perfectly the essence of a broken man whose world is crumbling all around him. The final scene in the motel when he is caught is incredibly powerful because Macy makes you feel the pain and sorrow that a man must feel when he knows that he's going to prison for the rest of his life.One of the things that I loved about this film is the colorful characters that are a trademark of every Cohen brothers film. In Fargo, these characters include dim witted hookers, psychopath kidnappers, a very pregnant sheriff, and a lot of snow. No matter how long or brief these characters are on the screen, however, they are all incredibly entertaining and fun to watch. That is one of the reasons that I enjoy films by the Cohen brothers. They have a great style and sense of humor that is all their own. They aren't afraid to be different from the Hollywood norm, and they make films on their own terms. Also, as evidenced by this film, they do a great job of getting the best out of every actor. I personally feel that William Macy and Frances McDormand have never been better before or since Fargo. I urge everyone to see this film and compare it to other great works of the last decade. I think you'll find that its place is right near the likes of Pulp Fiction, L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects and other great 90's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold-hearted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is "Fargo" as much a travesty of regional accents as most "southern" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have written a few reviews on IMDb, and this is the first time I feel compelled to write a negative one. 8.4 IMDb score. Really?Just don't watch this movie. You are not getting those 90 minutes back, and you will really retreat it. Steve Buscemi is awesome as usual, but otherwise the movie just falls apart. The movie is slow, boring, and it makes no sense whatsoever. I understand it's based on a real story, but it's been adapted poorly (or not adapted at all). The side stories add nothing to the main plot (if there is such a thing in this film), and they are added in such a way that make them look like editing mistakes. It actually looks like they mixed their reels and just pasted things from other films. Besides that, there is no conflict. Just a lot of characters that are truly stupid, make all kind of mistakes, and most end up dead or imprisoned.(warning, spoilers ahead)There are several clearly connected crimes. So the investigator, who is a colorless boring character, just plays it exactly by the book and finds the killers immediately. There is just no story. She goes to the crime scene, everything is bloody obvious, so she just makes a few calls, interviews two people, and finds out she has to go to a nearby city. She goes there, and finds the killers who happen to have the car just parked outside waiting to be found. But before doing that, she stops to meet a creepy Asian guy that she hasn't seen for a long time that wants to bang her, but she says no and goes away. Yes, that is the actual plot. On the side, you see a lot of terminally stupid criminals doing everything wrong, a desperate guy that needs money, but WHY is never explained, so he makes a lot of blatantly obvious mistakes and ends up in jail. I can't even begin to explain why the movie is so bad, because it doesn't even deserve much explanation. There is no conflict, no story, no characters. Just a lot of stupid people that kill each other in the most meaningless ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Internally Frayed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coens are masters of the tease. By that I mean they'll find a closely embroidered dress and then goof with its perfection. They'll pull this and that element of the colored threads out so that its frayed, disturbing the scene so carefully constructed by the original craftswoman. Superficially it looks more homemade, more genuine this way. But if you look closely you'll see that what they've done is a matter of orchestrated destruction. Things defined by their distance from other things.Past that point it is merely a matter of whether the teasing engages or not.Their previous movie was not well received. The original garment was a combination of a mild Capra screwball and a 30's newspaper fold of a sassy woman detective. The noir mechanics were made explicit, as were the cinematic components.The audience ? by this I mean the general paying audience ? stayed away. They just weren't in the mood for clever deconstruction, no matter how polished.This is a reaction. Its a wonderful project, just wonderful in its way, but also sad in the implied tightness behind the decisions you see.What they've done is frayed the garment on the inside. Everything is sparse, bleak. All the camera setups are overly simplified, all the emotional mechanics understated. Most of it is buried in the snow.If this movie were made by anyone else, it would just be amusing, a calm sketch of a deliberately uncaffeinated selling itself as if it were a chain of simple products.But it isn't. Its a suppressed visit by extremists pretending to not be extreme. Its Lynch doing "Straight Story" and not asking us to know that over every dusk hued horizon is one of his ragged unreal movies.Because of this, we see small gateways into the world of the Dude, or the Sirens. The unborn child will enter a different world. The postage stamp will fly to a different world (when the rates change).Watch it for the simple garment, a dress covered by a coat. Watch it for the fraying and teasing on the inside, and imagine the colorful embroidery disturbed on the out.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frances &amp; The Coens at Their Oscar-Winning Finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many "offbeat" movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word "inept." Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hideous, hyper-inflated bleakscape of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What galls me most about this movie specifically and the Coen brothers' movies generally is that they all reveal the insipidness of both the Coens and their fans. What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a "bleakscape" - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative. I do delight, however, in the spectacle of reading swooning fans' fawning tributes to the Coens' "films" (and yes, their fans will watch only "films").Utterly unbelievable in the bleak, depressing, and joyless tableaux they offer, the Coen films are the perfect answer to a society full of soulless narcissists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost perfect film in its genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched "Fargo" several years ago, and just last night re-watched it on DVD. I intended to see half of it, go to bed at my normal time, and see the last half this morning. But it isn't that kind of movie. It draws you in, the dialog and editing are so good, you want to keep watching. And so I did. It deserves its high rating.some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you haven't seen "Fargo" yet.Bill Macy is perfect, absolutely, as "Jerry" the car sales manager who can't quite get his life in order. You see, Jerry basically cares only about himself. He has some unspecified debt, his father in law (Harve Presnell) is rich but has a very low, deservedly, opinion of Jerry. So Jerry does the only thing he can figure, through a paroled American Native car mechanic that works in his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs (Buscemi and Stormare) who will kidnap Jerry's wife, hold her safe, until Jerry convinces pop-in-law to pay a ransom, which he uses to pay off the thugs and erase his own debt. Ever the schemer, Jerry tells the thugs he will split $80,000 with them, but really plans to extort $1Million and just give them $40,000. In an early scene to establish character, we see Jerry scamming a customer by charging him for a "topcoat" treatment that he said a day earlier he would throw in free. Jerry was simply a very flawed person.Things go terribly wrong, thugs get stopped at night in the snow, Stormare shoots the cop, plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing the crime scene. Margie (Frances McDormand, oscar winner) is the town sheriff and gets on the trail. She calmly travels to the Twin Cities, interviews people, pieces together clues, finds the hideout near the lake, comes upon Stormare grinding up Buscemi's body, the dead hostage in the cabin. In the interim the father in law gets gunned down, as well as a parking lot attendant. This film is best classified as a very dark comedy. Margie and her fisherman husband are two of the very few normal people in this film, The others - Jerry, his family, the mechanic, the thugs, the prostitutes - are all way off center, and some of the situations and dialog are very funny, within the context of a film where a number of murders are committed. The funniest scene is during the shooting of Presnell, who wounds Buscemi on the right cheek, and he spends the rest of the film with rather large strips of paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding, his hands and coat collar red and blood-soaked. I mean, there's really nothing funny about murder, but the Buscemi character is very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A freezing fable of stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo: ***.5*Fargo is a strange little movie. It is, in my opinion, the Cohen Brothers best film. It deals with a very serious subject, yet somehow it does so without taking itself overly serious. There is a very realistic quality to be found here- The subject matter is dark, yet there is a crack of light shining through always. The conversations are spot on with how they would probably be spoken in real life. McDormands character, the pregnant Marge, is the persistent pursuer but she is not obsessive like so many other movie clichéd 'good guys' are when it comes to catching their adversary. She is involved, but remains detached, just as 95% of real cops will be. You see it clearest in the conversations she has with her fellow officers; husband, and just about everyone else she speaks to. You really feel that she is, as her character says during an interview, just doing her job. This realism is not just present in Marge, but in every character. None are over the top, though the accents are probably slightly exaggerated.Jerry and his cronies are stupid. We never really find out Jerry's original troubles, but we are front row center for the idiocy that follows. There are no super intelligent characters which you find in many other crime dramas. There is only those who have some wits and common sense, and those who are helplessly daft.Personally, I loved this movie. It's quirky; it's real; it's charming; and its just plain fun (though bordering on the edge of painful) to watch this freezing fable of stupidity unfold. I did however feel that the ending was a little rushed, but this is not really a bad thing. I felt that the scene of Marge with her friend Mike in the city could have been removed, and that time could have gone to filling out the ending a little more. All in all, this nitpick is rather insignificant, and does little, if nothing at all to distract from the quality of the movie. I wanted to give this movie a 10, but it is lacking something, i don't know what, which is preventing me from giving it so. I also feel that it deserves more than a nine: 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo is Flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is probably the last American Film masterpiece of the Twentieth Century and the last 25 years. Highly original and imaginative it is a depressing tale told in a dark comic style with flesh and blood characters intricately and smoothly connected with dialog and plot twists all brilliantly conceived by the brothers Coen.Sleazy car dealer Jerry Lundergaard hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped so he can pocket some of the ransom his emasculating father in-law will have to fork over. Through one of his mechanics he gets the name of a low life who might be interested and travels to Fargo to work out the plan. Things go awry from the outset though and soon the cold snowy landscape is littered with dead bodies. Solving the case is left up to a last trimester pregnant Sheriff from Brainerd, Minnesota who initially comes across as a little slow on the draw.Fargo is flawlessly constructed with subplots girding the storyline, enriching characterization and sharply calibrating the suspenseful pace. The frozen north setting is a refreshing change from big city and vacation land locales that dominate feature films and the Coens expertly put it to use to create mood, evoke humor and accent imagery. It is the best use of snow since Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.William Macy as Jerry takes the car salesman stereotypes to new lows with one of the most memorable cloyingly unctuous characters in film history as he dismantles his family in pursuit of wealth. Whether trying to tack on extras to customers or keeping police at bay while surrounded in a motel room he remains steadfast in deceptive practice until the end. As the Sheriff Frances McDormand evolves from small town cop to Colombo subtlety and successfully without fanfare while Coen economically brings more depth and mystery to her with dry comic snapshots of her married life and a meeting with an old school chum. As one of the blundering kidnappers Steve Buscemi is a motormouth of comic complaint while his taciturn, hypochondrial partner played by Peter Stomare (a lot more grounded in reality than the Frankenstein creation running amok in the Coen's No Country for Old Men) is icily terrifying.Fargo is the Coens' best film to date. They fell into a malaise after The Big Lebowski with heavy handed comedies (The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty), dependence on charming movie star George Clooney as well as a flaccid and forgettable foray into black and white (The Man Who Wasn't There) before going Oscar with the slow moving overrated Old Country, followed by the praise worthy acerbic screwball comedy Burn After Reading. Even with their failures they had more to offer than quality work of tamer directors by offering razzle dazzle camera work and original off-beat characters. Taking chances they sometimes pushed the envelope beyond credulity but with Fargo they give us a perfect measure of style and realism with a dark comic soul that is rich in detail and perception of this thing known as the human comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo isn't a thriller or mystery in the traditional sense, but it is still a truly remarkable piece of film-making and screeenwriting.Few characters in American film epitomize the banality of evil as thoroughly as Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry's greed causes him to seek opportunities that he is incapable of handling, commit pointless and easily-detectable frauds, and commission one of the most ill-conceived crimes possible. More significantly, he is only capable of thinking of himself, even as the world around him explodes into bloody chaos due to his own actions. The most telling scene is the one where he tries to reassure his son that everything will be all right -- but like everything else he tells people, it's a lie, and a transparent one at that. In his hands, cluelessness becomes a truly monstrous thing that destroys everyone and everything he should care about.It is the contrast with these qualities that makes Marge such a compelling heroine. A woman who cares about those around her and those she works with, she gives and receives a thousand little kindnesses that repay her tenfold. The murders she must deal with may be a challenge she doesn't want, but she is more than up to it, and displays the determination and savvy, if not the flash and flair, of a great movie sleuth.It is the contrast in these characters, and the others around them, that makes Fargo such a special film.</fullReview>

With Jerry getting pressure from the kidnappers now that thing has gone sour and Officer Marge Gunderson making progress in her investigation, things are far from as straightforward as was originally planned.Getting past the whole `true story' nonsense, this is easily one of the Coen's most polished films as well as one of their most enjoyable. The film opens with a bleak, snowy scene with a great sweeping score and pretty much sets the tone for a film that feels bigger than it actually is. The opening scene between Jerry and his two contracted hoods is really good and is typical of the comic tone that runs all the way through the film. The plot is cleverly written and so much more than another `job gone wrong' thing, however what drives the film is the weird web of unusual characters that we encounter along the way. Setting the film in a part of American with Scandinavian roots was clever as it gives the characters funny accents before you even worry about what they are going to say with them! The screenplay won an Oscar and it deserved it simply for the dialogue and the characters it creates. It is a dark film but it is one that fans of the Coen brothers' universe will find funny.Of course it helps no end to have a great cast to deliver it. McDormand won the Oscar despite only being one of several good performances in the film. Her Marge is funny yet relentless in her pursuit. Macy is as reliable as ever and it is his increasingly frantic performance that is the best of the film for my money - weedy, pathetic and hopelessly out of his depth but funny with it. Buscemi and Stormare are both very good for very different reasons and the rest of the support cast is comprised of many strange characters who are funny. Only the very occasional bit hits a sour note, but this is very occasional and doesn't hurt the film one little bit.Overall this may not be a true story but that is not to say that it isn't fascinating anyway - who says truth is better than fiction?! The roundly great performances do great work with a deserved Oscar winner of a screen play that fills a solid crime storyline with all manner of characters that produce a gripping and funny film that is one of the best and most accessible of the Coen brother films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Films like "Fargo" are why I love the movies", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood. It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific. Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly one of the tn best films of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a great many reasons for the extraordinary success of "Fargo." One of the reasons is the uproar it caused upon release when nosy little reporters found out it was not really based on true events like the disclaimer says at the beginning of the film. Then there was the tragedy of the Japanese woman who went looking for the buried stash of money and froze to death. The press had, what movie characters always call, a "field day" with this story. They overlooked the fact that she had left behind a suicide note and was informed by police the story was false upon arrival in Minnesota, where she was picked up by a worried police officer. She had a death wish.And the other reason for success is, of course, because the movie is one of the best of all films--a true "story" if ever there was one. It's more than a scathing social satire, more than a dark comedy, more than a great drama with a fabulous story filled with irony and coincedences and morals and so on and so forth. It's more than a great movie. It's superb.Marge Gunderson has become a sort of cultural character. People quote her like the Terminator or Charles Foster Kane or George Bailey or Darth Vader. She's so famous that I do not think many people realize Marge essentially comes in around forty minutes into the 98-minute movie. Yet that's what people think of when they hear the word "Fargo"--Marge Gunderson--and so it just shows what an impact a film like "Fargo" made. And not only impact, but the remembrance of characters we love to remember.Marge provides a sort of balance between the wild and the crazy. She is the moral character of the story who juggles the two and tries to keep them from falling. When the film starts to get violent or ironic Marge steps in to sort out the mess. The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, obviously have a firm grasp on the actuality of storytelling as opposed to filmmakers who can simply put a story on screen--ignoring whether it provides any sort of actual storytelling at all.I think we all remember the first moment Marge wakes up in bed and receives the phone call. She drives out to the barren, frosty highway with a view of Minnesota that stretches for miles, and investigates the crime scene of a most brutal murder. Three people haev been murdered: A cop, and two passersby. The villain(s)? Unknown. (Regarding the killer: "And by the size of his feet he looks like a big fella'!")The murders were, of course, all coincedental, having to do with a simple yet oddly complex plot: Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) has debts he is unable to pay, so he hires two crooks, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaeur (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Unfortunately, their plan did not go to...er...plan, and they had to kill three people along the way.The point where Gauer shoots the police officer who has pulled the men over for not displaying the proper tags on their vehicle is funny. And yet when you really think about it, that scene shouldn't be funny at all. But it is. The Coen Brothers know how to make it funny. They are like experts of the dark humor--when Carl says, "Whoa, Daddy!" and has that speckle of blood on his face, I always burst out in laughter. It sounds sick, but strangely, it isn't.The dialogue in "Fargo" is just as excellent as the film's twisty little plot. Frances McDormand rightfully won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge Gunderson. She speaks with the perfect accent of, what the Coen Brothers call, the language "Minnesota Nice"--where people are always cheery, even when they're being mean. It's just something inbred into citizens of Minnesota. And even when the worst things are happening to characters, you're smiling, because who doesn't love to hear, "Gee, golly, gee whiz," throughout a movie, and who doesn't think it's funny?"Fargo" is the type of film you can watch over and over. Sometimes I think to myself that I'm just going to watch a scene or two, but as soon as the credits start the film has my interest and never lets go. It's the odd sort of delightful little film that keeps the viewer's interest for the first time up through the fiftieth time and beyond.The film's plot takes twist after twist and we can identify ever so much with the character of Jerry as all his well-thought-out plans go to waste, causing his debt to become even worse and his life even more ruined than it already is. Steve Buscemi, as Carl, is just as much a scene-stealer as Marge Gunderson (I love to type that name), and Jerry is just as much a lovable character as someone who hasn't hired two crooks to kidnap his wife. That's the secret to "Fargo"--or at least part of the secret. We like the characters, simply because we know they don't really mean any harm. Harm just happens to find them.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Overrated: Still Worth Owning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The whole essence of the movie, in microcosm, is contained when perplexed Mcdormand says to Stormare,"I guess that was your confederate in the wood chipper back there and Mrs. Lundegaard on the floor and for what? For a little bit of money, you know there is a lot more to life than a little bit of money, don't you know that? I just don't understand it?''No, he doesn't, and while I applaud the morality of the movie, a real rarity here in atavist land, the movie takes a naive Socratic view of evil. Socrates held that reason and morality where inextricable. The evil are fundamentally stupid people. Aristotle carried it further, yes they do not really choose evil; they are idiots who mistake evil for good. Sorry, evil comes in all intellectual levels. Grimsruld and Carl are portrayed as a couple of utter morons; one barely has the power of speech the other cannot stop talking for a minute. Yes, I applaud the academy for honoring the movie, I suspect more for Mcdormand's feministic role, in spite of its deeply moral base. The film is severely overrated; it is not even close to being the Coens' best movie MILLER'S CROSSING or BLOOD SIMPLE. Frankly, even THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a far better film. The first big flaw is the running of the Norwegian dialect into the ground; OK, we get the whole yeah, yaah, yeah, thing you think? It grows more and more annoying as the film progresses, look nobody is more anti PC than I am, but do you think it is a tad racist towards Norwegians? I always like the inversion rule; imagine it was used like this for people who were not white? Secondly, the relationship between Mcdormand and her husband is right out of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER. Please, we all had parents. Did anyone's parents behave this lovingly out there? I get it is supposed to be a moral contrast to the depravity of Carl and Gimsrud, it is so nauseatingly idealized that it ruins any verisimilitude in the movie. Contrast could have been achieved with a realistic couple not out of I LOVE LUCY. As a film, besides these esoterics, it is slow, ugly and boring. I just do not find a great deal of humor in a woman being kidnapped, tortured and killed, sorry. Maybe I had a defective upbringing, my bad. The Coen's do their best to make Mrs. Lundegaard as annoying and unsympathetic as they can to attenuate this problem. It still remains. Even when she hides in the shower, it is played for laughs which sorry, being an old stick in the mud, did nothing for me: UGLY. Also, did we need to see the cop's head geyser blood like that? Hurrah for realism, but it is so gross and gratuitous. It was probably put there to wake us up. There are other gross, gory images like Carl getting shot in the face and blood all over it, BRING THE KIDS. The violence does not serve the story; this is the definition of gratuitous. I love MILLER'S CROSSING but the fire shovel in his face? Gee, maybe a little over the top? I am sorry I found the story cruel however it was glossed up; the whitewashing of a woman being abducted, tortured, probably raped, though that is carefully omitted, then killed, I just am so warped please forgive me. It is all those years in church, being trained morally it really made me such a deviant here. The ugliness of the movie, its incessant need to parade gory, excessive violence lessens its value greatly. In a film preaching the evils of materialistic violence it is somewhat comical and hypocritical. It is a boring, phony, overrated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The genius called "Coen Bros"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heard quite a lot about "Coen Bros" but never really got around to watch any of their body of work. When I watched "Fargo" today I was spellbound by the cinematic genius('es). Considering this movie is about 15-years old it would be an understatement to say that their writing and cinematic sensibilities is beyond expression. The characterisation of each actor leaves an impression. For instance unlike other movies in "Fargo" a cop is just not a character, he has a life too, a family and emotions. Unlike a cog-in-the-wheel the writing goes a bit deeper to flesh out the character more effectively thereby making them more true-to-life and connectable.Performance wise, as stated earlier every character is a gem. &#x6e9; William Hacey:: The backbone of the plot and hence he ought to have delivered good in good condition. He delivers to the utmost perfection. Perhaps the best in his career.&#x6e9; Steve Buscemi:: A hidden gem then as opposed to now. And his spark showed way back then. A very natural and gifted actor.&#x6e9; Frances McDormand:: She literally gets into the skin of the Marge.&#x6e9; Harve Presnell:: very regal and assertive performance.The dark humour is plenty and slightly shocking, which is kind of expected. The background music is paced well with the narrative and does linger in the head for a while. Watch it once and you can be absolutely certain to come back and relish the characters all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cult Classic Not To Be Missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good Black Comedy movies are a rarity and black comedies on supposedly real life incidents are extremely scarce. Fargo's creative team including the multi-faceted Coen brothers made it a point to illustrate in the beginning of the movie that all events are based on real life incidents with their unique 'touch' of-course. Fargo is a story about a car salesman who is in desperate need of money and thus he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so that he can get a hefty ransom from his father-in-law (Who is a wealthy man and not much fond of his (son-in-law). Things go wrong when the crooks had to kill 3 people to hide their identity and thus a cycle is started of blood-shed which is investigated and eventually solved by a pregnant female cop who is actually the protagonist or the lead of this movie. Bollywood fans may find this story very similar to the Saif, Fardeen starrer 'Love Ke Liye Kucch Bhi Karega'. Actually Love Ke Liye is an average rip-off of Fargo.The performances are noteworthy especially the female cop played by Mcdormand (Favorite actress of the Coen Bros.) Her expressions are hilarious and her accent funny. I have doubts though if she deserved an Oscar she won that year for this movie, but surely it was a good performance. The car salesman played by Macy leaves a mark on the viewers mind. Steve Buscemi as the 'funny face', loud mouth crook utilities all the screen time he has been given perfectly. Overall, a cult classic not to be missed.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Black Comedy/Thriller from The Coen Brothers...Need I say more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach ("No Country for Old Men") or by their sense of humor (everything else).By all accounts, "Fargo" is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not "Law &amp; Order." It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. "Fargo" is anything but.Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling "Fargo" a crime/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take "Fargo" too seriously.The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). "Fargo" really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on "Fargo," saying that "Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies." While I greatly enjoyed "Fargo," I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story. Still, it's enjoyable enough that it's hardly worth complaining about.While it may not be perfect, "Fargo" is still a very good film, especially if you have a warped sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical thriller with atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Fargo is the kind of movie that appeals to people who have seen a lot of movies because everything is surprising and unexpected. The cop's a woman (Frances McDormand). Pregnant. The perps are psychos of course, but there are three of them and each is a different breed of psycho. William H. Macy is a car salesman who dreams up a scheme to cheat his rich father in law out of a million dollars by getting some degenerates to kidnap his wife. He's a white collar sociopath who always lies whenever his lips are moving unless there is some very good reason to tell the truth. One of the degenerates is a big silent guy (Peter Stormare) who kills people as one squishes bugs. The other (Steve Buscemi) is an ugly little bantam who lies and cheats and kills and steals and whines until finally somebody puts him out of his misery.This is Fargo, North Dakota, where people are country and it's cold and not very sophisticated. The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them. McDormand eats a whole lot of Hardee's and Arby's and greasy dishes from the cafeteria piled high on her plate. She's eating for two. She loves her husband and he loves her. They lie in bed at night and watch TV. She's the police chief. She meets an old admirer in the big city. He's Asian. She is just curious. He is desperate. She has a self-effacing, aw-sucks, I'm not too bright (but I really am) style reminiscent of Tyne Daly in TV's "Cagey and Lacy" from some years back. Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife. One of his duck paintings becomes a postage stamp. They all say "Yaw" a lot.The forlorn cold and desolate landscape of North Dakota is a Americana locale not used cinematically since I don't know when-Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), I guess. The script and direction are tidy without being too flashy. Everything is designed to surprise or bemuse the audience. Even the accents. There is the requisite quota of bright red blood; plenty of bullets puncture flesh and split bone. There's some gutter sex and a few shocking sights (one of the perps stuffs the other into a wood chip machine). All in all it's a slick, carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed. It's clear that Coen and Coen have watched the movies of Atom Egoyan, Gus Van Sant, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, etc., and here pay them the sincere compliment of imitation with variation-or is it the other way around?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Coen brothers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority ? if not all ? of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in ? well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quirky crime-comedy which has much more to offer than what meets the eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words "Two more months", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, tense and hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a 1996 black comedy/crime drama film directed by Ethan and Joel Coen (The Coen Brothers) and stars William H. Macy, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi. Often seen as the film that launched the Coen Brothers successful career, Fargo without a doubt deserves all the credit it receives. The story focuses around a spineless, nervous car salesman who arranges for his wife to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of $80,000 to extort from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, in his desperation for money to repay an outstanding loan. Which ends up going horrifically wrong resulting in a series of grizzly murders. Fargo fantastically blends its sharp wit of dry humour and black comedy with its gruesome, thrilling and intriguing narrative, the two seem to go hand-in-hand perfectly with Fargo having scenes that will have you bursting out laughing and others on the edge of your seat. Fargo also features beautiful cinematography with wide, expansive shots of snow covered landscapes as well as a fitting dark and unsettling soundtrack. Each actor/actress completely owns their character making their motivations and actions clear, as well as relatable. Fargo has but a few nit-picking flaws, such as a particular scene which seems unnecessary to the advancement of the plot and feels out of place, in which Frances McDormand's character meets an old friend. Another is a plot-line which focused around Peter Stormare's character Gaear Grimsrud- not enough of the story was focused around his role as it should or could have been, also another flaw being the slight overuse of the word 'ya'. Overall, Fargo is a phenomenal film, both winning 2 well deserved Oscar's and launching the Coen Brothers career onto a new level, proving they are two of the greatest filmmakers of the modern film era. Not forgetting notifying the world of the traditional (and comedic) Minnesotan accent. Fargo is hilarious, violent, tense and intriguing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, why is the movie called "Fargo"? Maybe it's because that's where chaos starts. For the next 98 minutes, we watch a hapless, smiley, terminally nervous Minneapolis car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), try to settle some debts by engineering the kidnapping of his docile wife and wangling a ransom from his millionaire father-in-law. This scheme blows up in his face after he hires the wrong thugs in Fargo: Steve Buscemi as motormouth Carl Showalter and Peter Stormare as taciturn Gaear Grimsrud. The error soon results in a triple murder, with more deaths to come. And we also watch local super-sleuth Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), the very pregnant police chief of the Minnesota town of Brainerd, as she relentlessly tracks them down.The characters in Fargo are what keep the film going. Steve Buscemi plays Carl to perfection, talking too much and described as "funny looking". His colleague, Gaear is that shady silent type who likes to do things his own way and Peter Stormare delivers his threatening stares in a chilling way. For me, these two were the highlight of the film but William H. Macy pulls of Jerry brilliantly, displaying simultaneously a liar, a thief, a loving father and husband as well as ultimately a good guy whose life has taken a turn for the worse. Frances McDormand comically plays the traditional Minnesota local - good hearted and innocent and is a joy to watch. Fargo is deep, chilling and clever as well as very witty in places and is definitely worth seeing.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To all the Fargo fans, I re-watched it recently after a very long time.I read Ebert and Siskel were watching the movie in a theater and Siskel turned to Ebert and said it is for films like Fargo that he watches movies.Food has so much prominence in the film. Everyone's always consuming food. It made me hungry. Or they are watching TV. But it does not seem to satisfy them.The film is so damn entertaining. Most scenes don't last for too long. It made me wish the director would show me some more about the characters. Especially Steve Buscemi's character. His date with the prostitute was really sad. No wonder, people got together and made a whole TV series based on this film. That's how much this film captured their imagination. I mean, every character in the film could have a separate film about their life.A lot of indoor scenes would be followed by an outdoor one. Each character has some kind of notable mannerism or eccentricity. This is foregrounded. The film has two of the best character actors in William.H.Macy and Steve Buscemi. The acting is exceptional.The film is a great achievement.Best Regards, Pimpin.(10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's more to life than money, ya know?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true story, so says the text introduction which precedes the magnificent beginning of Fargo. The Coens from the offset are determined to present a film that is clearly set in the real world. It's always in the back of the mind of an audience. The sets are meticulous and detailed and certainly lend this false warning credence. Say for example the slow pan over the various messes of painting materials and avian inspiration that introduces the couple of Marge and Norm. It's a very modest and rather cramped home that they live in. Now compare this to Jerry's openly lit and generously spacious home. Their character's respective reactions to their economic status is but one of the telling signs that the Coens weave into Fargo. The casting also lends itself to the realism of the film. Almost all speak in a bumbling Minnesotan accent. For Marge and her associates the film's various events are just another day of their lives. Cinematographer Roger Deakins manipulates the colour temperature of the frame in order to evoke a sense of a harsh icy cold Canadian landscape. The palette is dominated by greys, whites and blues which accentuate the many outside scenes and the character struggles. Take for example the frustration and rage in which Jerry lashes out at the ice covering his windscreen, characterising yet another blunder in his plan. Or the desperation that Grimsrud shows as he tries to crawl away with snow in his face and a bullet in his leg. Perhaps the best example of Deakins' influence is a great shot which contrasts the harsh outside landscape of Fargo with the warmer, cramped interior of Norm and Marge's home. The physical barriers manifests in a division of the frame into two separate elements and creates an effective disparity that illustrates both the cold unforgiving nature and the cosy life that the couple share. "And here you are. And it's a beautiful day." Carter Burwell's Norwegian folk-inspired theme builds up magnificently in the opening scene and chimes in occasionally with a few plucks of the harp and a hint of sleight bells, create a moody and heavy atmosphere much like the weather. For Jerry however, that is not nearly enough. It's a very different mindset which Willim H. Macy manages to display in a masterful performance as the spineless, pathetic and selfish cars salesman. He might be considered the central character; he is the first introduced in a rather innocuous way, presented as mild mannered, timid, polite. It's a very strange line then when we discover of his intentions to pay two criminals to kidnap his wife. Coens present a protagonist in front of us and promptly pull the rug from beneath our feet. But even with that revelation it's not such a clear cut moral view. The character of Jerry is slowly revealed to be more than meets the eye. They first agree on the modest sum of forty thousand split plus a car. It isn't until much later that we find out Jerry is actual double crossing them for a million, not to mention that he is embezzling cars from the dealership as well. The Tru-coat debacle is similarly revealed to be another of his scams. Macy plays the character with a panicked illusion of sincerity, using stuttering mannerism to great effect. His selfishness and self-centeredness is abruptly apparent when he arrives home with groceries and forgets the act of calling in a kidnapping for his own wife. Or when he completely forgets about the effects and impact this will have on his son. There's a great scene where he is arguing with Wade on how to deal with the ransom; Jerry's concern is completely genuine from a normal perspective but within the film is actually for the money. It's a great thematic moment where we truly question his motives. There's another important scene that is often overlooked. The meeting of Marge and Mike Yanagita seems meaningless at first but is the cause for a vital realisation within Marge. She is the bastion for morality within the film, and seems genuinely concerned for Mike if not a little out of her element. Even when Mike tries to get a little too close for comfort (despite her obviously pregnant belly) she waves it away without a second thought. It's not until later on when she finds out Mike was lying the whole time that she realises the moral deceit that she has witnessed. For Marge who hunts criminals all day, it never occurred to her that someone who she is familiar with and as another person in the crowd could have ulterior motives. Grimsrud and Showalter are respectively vicious and cold-blooded. Marge recognises another side of injustice and crime in Jerry the second time around after that lunch with Mike. But even so at the end of the film she still does not possess an understanding of their motivations or been violated by inherently bad nature. She lies in the small room of her house with her husband, celebrating a minor achievement and being content with her life. Jerry in his desperation for wealth is never once shown to be in that sort of lower status or have any good reason for needing to embezzle 320 thousand. It's a fantastic case of shifting protagonists, values and ideals. There's blurred boundaries even between the criminals and the ordinary white and blue collar workers. Consider the ineptitude and disdain that Jerry displays as he is finally caught out by Marge, or the curiously naive reaction of Jean to a masked man approaching her side door with a crowbar. Little details in the acting and direction create plenty of subtext that takes Fargo beyond the conventional definitions of characters and morals. It's a special little film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>its really hard to combine thrilling-crime with comedy. but coen brothers successfully did it. he really have a unique character as a director. most of his movies, intellect-funny, thrilling-crime, and also creative-comedic script. and now in Fargo, he did it again, the way he turn a genre into somekind funny is completely hard thing to do.Fargo, how should i say this. It's simple i think, when you watched it, then you will like it. Every character in this movie take their best part. No characters give a mediocre performances, all of them were just splendid. Steve buscemi is a main star. Every scene when he appeared, always giving a totality and funny-looking acting. He was completely adaptive, giving a villain and comedic act in one piece. Yeah, buscemi is the coen brother's main weapon.Not only the performances, when you see the cinematography, then it will amaze you also. Always takes place at snowy set, this movie was thrilling yet beautiful, what a talented set-decorator.The script was creative, funny, original, and unique. So many word "Yeah" that makes you laugh really hard. It appears that this movie also intellect to serve us a joke.Fargo, definitely one of the best of it's genre (crime-thriller). There are no director that can turn a true-story of fargo into something as enjoyable as coen brother's did. You watch it alone, you will laugh and amazed. you watch it with friends, you will laugh and amazed. You watch it a decade years later, you will laugh and amazed. No doubt !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like very much Frances and that was my motivation to see this movie. It was a great surprise to see that William « Frank » Macy stars also, all the more than his character could be the sober twin of the Gallagers family patriarch. On the other hand, it was a disappointment to notice Stormare as this actor really cringes me with his too much attitude verified as always in this movie. As i have written in my review for « Arizona Junior », the Cohen brothers are the movies cousin of Stephen King as they are really share this taste for the rural America. Here, the country land is all the more put in relief as it's winter time. The story is interesting because it's a true drama that is chilly as it's unbelievable that the husband found such a stupid idea and such bums to help him ! In this strange world, Frances is totally exceptional : i can't really explain but she has the gift to put me at rest, to make me happy and her character is really like this : she smiles to everyone, she is respected by her friends, her co-workers, she has a caring husband and will be soon a mother. It's a really change from the today cops as violent as the criminals they arrest. This Frances recalls Columbo, Dale Cooper, Fox Mulder, the strong arm of the law but with a big heart. She worths truly her Oscar and the movie is really good !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably The Best Dark Comedy Ever Made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Tarantino movies, which happen to have comedic elements, this is the best dark comedy I've seen and the highest rated one on many sites. At first, I didn't see what was so great about this like the way Roger Ebert raved about it. The whole movie is funny from the overly- polite midwestern accents. Reminded me of Canadian accents. But I did not find it to be a masterpiece. Then I tried really watching it, and I never looked back.The film is about a used car salesman named Jerry Lundengaard (Macy) who rigs his wife being kidnapped by two criminals be doesn't know (Buscemi, Stormare) as ransom so he can get needed money from his father-in-law (Presnell) he knows he would not get any other way. The kidnapping leads to three homicides where pregnant cop, Marge (McDormand) does some investigation and is soon hot on all their trails.In the first 20 minutes or so, we meet Jerry then witness the kidnapping and the murders. This start has always been exciting. Then we meet Marge and the story really starts to unfold as she does some detective work and Jerry gets what's coming to him. For some reason, the movie lost my interest when we meet Marge. After we meet her I became more interested with just hearing the people say "yeah!" and "you betcha!" After not watching the movie for a while, I tried really watching it and I finally understood what all the commotion was all about. The story is the one of the most original you'll ever see. Originality is what makes movies great and this has it. What makes the story and events original are the characters. All characters, even bad, are lovable and well-developed, the whole movie is exciting with character-driven twists that add sheer excitement, great morals and some nice filming techniques, all while keeping funny accents with humour so dark that it messes with you. There's nothing not to like. Jerry is probably the antagonist and villain since he was the brains behind ransom and started the chain of events. He is developed so well and there is so much sympathy created for him that the viewer feels sorry for him anytime he is brought down or is seen through. He never gives up and is greatly determined. Marge, the protagonist and hero, is the most original female hero ever. She is as awesome as The Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Nobody wants to see Marge nab Jerry. Steve Buscemi is like a creature that eats away at his boss's enemy. Stormare is kick-ass psycho that plays by his own rules and answers to nobody. Both of them are funny together because they are totally different: a chatterbox and a mute. These, as well as the other characters, are so real and well-developed that they drive the movie. A pure, original character driven story and important morals that arise are Shakespeare-like. Add great filming, odd humour and thrills, you get one of America's best films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is arguably the first film that really put the Coen brothers on the map and for good reason. Everything about Fargo is unique and original, from the beautiful setting to the incredible dialogue mixing together humour, drama and beauty so seamlessly the film is nothing short of a masterpiece.Fargo's story revolves around how several characters lives begin to collide with one another after a simple kidnapping scheme begins to go wrong and body counts begin to rise. But where the film really succeeds is because of the interesting range of characters ranging from McDormand's kind speaking Marge to Buscemi's rude and talkative Carl. All the leads of the film have original and interesting personalities that make them so interesting to watch. Part of the brilliance of this and every Coens Brothers film is that even the small characters feel very well developed. Someone like Norm (McDormand's husband) probably has somewhere around 5 minutes screen time, but in that short time it gives him a unique personality and demonstrates the close bond between him and Marge. It feels that everyone in the film matters or has some role to play, with every character having some impact on the chain of events. A single conversation can change a character's entire outlook of a situation which the Coens make believable through the great writing where we can see why they would be changed by the confrontation. On top of this the film has many moments of both natural and memorable dialogue. Some of it even packs great meaning such as "There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day." Lines like this demonstrate the Coen brothers skill in creating great meaning in their work whilst maintaining realism within the dialogue. Beyond this the film contains many beautiful and meaningful shots mixing a feeling of suspense into the endless roads and blank landscapes that fill the screen. Even the simplest shots of a car driving down the road feel all the more impressive as we see the sight of the headlights shine through the falling slow.The Coens constantly do what all filmmakers should, which is to take risks and try different things. Everything from the setting to the characters personalities is unique within the film. From start to end Fargo is a joy to watch and a true cinematic classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A list of my favorite actors in a film that is both real and completely boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the positive reviews, I really do. The story is non conventional, based on real events that lack the serendipity and skill of movie events. The actors, some of my favorites are in it, play very well. The mix of dread, disgust, contempt and amusement has a nice flavour, too. But the film is too real, too mundane and ultimately totally boring. It's like a heist movie done by idiots, but dangerous idiots at that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, because they just released a series based on it. However, after watching it, I can't bring myself to view the series. The average grade that I give this film doesn't mean that I am indifferent to it, just that it kind of hits mediocrity, but that only because I average good acting and intriguing potential with my feeling of utter boredom after watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Yah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe this film as complex would be redundant in its conception, when really it is a simple story. Although engaging in its depiction, Fargo gives this idea that there is a deeper meaning in it. The opening title sequence claims that this film is based on a true story, when really it's the culmination of many stories the Coen brothers have investigated. When promoting the film, in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose, Charlie himself made a comment regarding the nature of the title sequence, and how it demonstrates how far the Coen brothers will go. It was a joke, and although it was jolly in spirit, the Coen's own take on the title was that it was battle between choosing Brainerd or Fargo. Obviously Fargo won that bout. But overall the tone of the film in its initial portrayal, is that it is a simple film, and the motives of the characters are simple to the extent that they can create a complexity within Fargo that we as an audience strive to understand them behind their own simplicity. As with any Coen Brother's film, there is an inevitable sense of tragedy within the story, and because it is shown in such a casual and forward manner, all we can do is laugh.Taking place in the winter of 1987 at Fargo North Dakota, a pair of buffoons, Carl (Buscemi), a funny looking fella who can't shut up, and Gaear (Stomare) a mute who only speaks when he's hungry, are recruited by an even bigger schmuck. Jerry Lundergard (Macy), although both polite and simple, is two faced enough that he'll orchestrate a scheme to kidnap his own wife in order to extort his father in law, played dog heartedly by Harve Presnell, just to solve some of his financial troubles. Back home in Minneapolis, Jerry works as an executive sales manager for his Father in law, and even after a deal he proposed kicks in, his wife Jean (Rudred) is kidnapped. The sequence although portrayed with some humor, also carries with it an intensity in the moments of terror and panic Rudred shows in her erratic movements of fear.Not too long after the kidnapping, a shooting takes place with three people being killed at Brainerd. By that time, half hour has passed, and then are we only introduced to the protagonist, Officer Marge Gunderson (McDormand). Being seven months pregnant, and carrying a truck load, Margi as her quaint husband Norm (Lynch) calls her, begins her investigation into the Brainerd murders. Marge is both calm and polite in her interactions with others, and even to the extent that she'll simply keep saying "Yah" and "Oh you betcha" when really she's bearing some forms of hostility and disappointment.Although there is some disappointment to her search for justice, there is none within the overall portrayal of the character's the Coen Brother's have sketched in this combination of true stories. Each brings forth a unique level of oddness to the story that they transcends the simplicity of the film. A lot of the exterior scenes show a blank abyss of nothingness in the snow covered roads of North Dakota and Minneapolis, as the camera focus shots merely envelop the white snow during daylight, and even more illuminating during the night scenes, ushering a darker and more depriving tone within the film's more tragic elements. The interior scenes capture a much smaller and closed sense of existence within the simplicity of the characters, and their own understanding of the circumstances they encounter in their lives. One particular close-up of Marge as she contemplates the point of the Brainerd murders, never fully conceiving of why anyone would commit such an atrocity, and for money no less. She then comments on life and on the beautiful day in front of her. The detail of her introspection into human morality gives her greater depth and complexity, as normal as she may appear to be back home with her husband Norm. She questions the motives people have, and this merely represents her innocence, and at some tragic level her own ignorance.As hard as it may be to understand why bad things happen, thinking it is simple merely drenches the curiosity with ignorance and reduces it to a more dismissible manner of existential contemplation. Fargo is brilliant and captivating in its odd sense of normality, capturing a peculiar and equally entertaining depiction of "Minnesota Nice" and the "Sing Song" regional accents. Every moment a character utters a "You betcha", or "Yah", its repetitiveness does not grow to be tiring ,but merely all the more entertaining in its ironic and often cynically delicious theme of Coen Brothers comedy. Over the course of the Coen Brother's careers, from films such as Blood Simple, or Barton Fink, which exemplify much darker tones, they managed to elaborate on the type of comedy they depict in each of their films. In the previously mentioned Charlie Rose interview, they couldn't really explain the comedy they conceive, only that they simply break from the more conventional standards. It's this break that stands out enough for anyone, fan or no fan to recognize within its perplexity. Fargo, as both a comedy and a thriller captures a humorous but brutal murder story that triggers a self-awareness within its protagonist Marge Gunderson, that although she questions the purpose of a such a transgression, she immediately returns to the normalcy of her life, showing very little change from experience. Some would label that as not a poor form of character development, when really it's more of accurate representation of a common folk the Coen's grew up around in the white abyss they lived in throughout their childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ordinary Good Defeats Ordinary Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evil as depicted in films such as "Fargo" and "Badlands" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In "Fargo" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over "a little bit of money" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are "doing pretty good" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying.This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the strength of liking the rather coarse In Bruges I was recommended to see this one, one that had passed me by but trailed for me by the recommender as an even blacker comedy. Being a sucker for black comedies I complied, and found it ingenious and engrossing fiction, but with a streak of nastiness not in In Bruges. Brainerd definitely looked colder than Bruges!Geeky husband (Macy) arranges for two hit men, one dumb the other kind of funny looking, to kidnap his wife so they can all share the ransom money to come from her rich father. Except it all goes wrong - especially for a lot of innocent passers by, which is something I always find difficult to extract humour from as I never know what or in particular who lies around the next corner myself. Some funny alleged Minnesota mannerisms and accents from the cast, the pregnant Sheriff Marge had some of the most whimsical lines and was a convincing eccentric, to this outsider anyway. Favourite bits: Her police outrage when she sees Macy Fleein' The Interview; the funny looking guy getting shot in the teeth and continually whinging about it; trying to guess exactly how Macy's wife met her end, how often Ya was uttered throughout and where's the money buried. Nice photography and the music was atmospheric and excellent too, although it sometimes put in mind 17th century France. I just wish the main characters and their many foibles had been fleshed out a little more, otoh it was all nicely packed into 90 minutes...maybe the rather pointless meeting of Marge with Mike could have been jettisoned?Although redolent of Twin Peaks it's one of the best films from the '90's I've seen from my limited experience, episodic but good and enigmatic enough to bear repeated viewings.</fullReview>

I'm a big fan of Coen movies and most of them are classics (Barton Fink, Millers Crossing, Big Lebowski), but Fargo is a winner.The story is really great (and that joke at the beginning of the movie "based on true events" is really original), the characters are extremely funny (William H. Macy as nervous car salesman, Steve Buscemi as dumb crook, Peter Stormater as silent psychopath, Harve Presnell as concerned father and, of course, Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer) and the music is simply beautiful. The scenery of beautiful snow is also very enjoyable to watch.The movie also has another great thing: it's a comedy, but shown so serious that you forgot you are watching comedy. I know this doesn't make any sense, but overall Fargo is really funny (weird accents, unbelievable twists) and filled with typical Coen's humor. Even the violence in this movie is shown very realistic, but also really goofy (in positive way). This is the most original hymn to the "american dreams". You can't find nothing better than this.This movie is like watching William Shakespeare tragedy in the snow and with a lot of humor. Simply brilliant. Pure masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, quirky movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On rare occasions, a recommendation out of the blue comes along that's spot on. I rented this on the recommendation of the clerk at the video store, and was I ever pleased! When I watch a movie or a play, the first thing I try to do is figure out the story line: what's going on. This one had me stumped for a while, but I finally settled on something out of Shakespeare, and in particular, either King Lear or Richard III. Richard III seemed to make more sense to me: there's enough of Shakespearian blood and gore for most, and yet there are comic overtones that fit right in. I think the writing was brilliant, the score very well matched, the acting superb.If the essence of classical tragedy is that the ending is foregone from the start, then this is classical tragedy. If the essence of comedy is unexpected juxtaposition, then this has elements of that, too. The wood chipper scene is a riot, but you'll have to see the movie to understand why I say that.We watched it on a night when a storm was blowing by: rain on the windows, wind howling, a glass or two of wine. It all worked to perfection. Don't worry if you're scratching your head trying to figure it out: I think that's part of what it's all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky characters, dark humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that's hard to categorize, because, quite frankly, it's so weird. It's innovative and artistic, with quirky characters and an offbeat approach.Dark humor can be difficult to digest sometimes, and that is my one major criticism of the film as several innocents suffer or even die violently. The movie doesn't seem to care, as it scurries along in an effort to showcase its weirdest characters. Sheriff Marge Gunderson (skillfully portrayed by Frances McDormond) is the only character who seems to notice that the victims are human beings. She's the protagonist with a calm demeanor and low key, Columbo style approach to the grisly crime she is investigating. She also serves symbolically as the only force of peace and sanity in this film's bizarre universe.In stark and comedic contrast to her are all the freaks. William H. Macy is brilliant as a car salesman who would try to sell an Eskimo an air conditioner. He hatches a foolhardy scheme involving two thugs to get some quick cash which starts to unravel. His efforts to keep on talking his way through everything reminds one of a guy trying to talk his way out of quicksand. His father-in-law is equally nutty; a zillionaire whose every conversation resembles a board-room style exec meeting with his ever-present business partner.The two crooks are just psychos, perhaps patterned after the two slime balls in "In Cold Blood." One is an idiot who never shuts up and errantly imagines he's the brains of the partnership; the other a mindless automaton who rarely speaks, but the wheels are always turning in his head. When he acts, he is devoid of any emotional response--just like a machine calculating, and reacting with ruthless efficiency.The actors work all of these over the top characters well, and the film delights in bouncing them off each other. The dark humor is at times brutal, but overall this movie is an entertaining watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Compleat Coen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a film wherein the expertise of the Coen brothers creates gold!ALL their films are excellent, especially The Great Lebowski and O, Brother Where Art Thou.The Coens are adept at assembling excellent casts: ensembles if you will. But Fargo, of all their movies, has a magic element: if one ignores those amazingly white settings, the dialogue and characters would sing upon a stage. There is a constant flow, even through the 'car salesman' scenes which carries us into the home: to the seemingly neurotic wife and the (always) oppressive father-in-law. Dare one indicate that the script owes much to European theatre? Well, yes.Part of the charm (and one should accept that this is an EXTREMELY black comedy) revolves around the (almost) patois spoken. Oh, ja? OK. MOST of the charm, however, is based around Marge (Frances McDormand), a very pregnant Police Chief who has a mind like a steel-trap! Given that (at least for the males not within her immediate sphere of influence) her femininity and pregnancy would seem to detract from her investigation, she carries all before her. Marge Gunderson is a wonderful role model. What an irony that McDormand won 'best actress', in as much as her character was up against such powerful opposition. Still, I think the best irony was that her husband appeared to be a non-entity (although amazingly supportive - breakfasts, putting up with her snoring, and always a comforting arm) who, at the end of the film, proved to be a success in his own right.OK. I waxed lyrical. Macey, Buscemi and Stormare complete what is, essentially, a working ensemble. Is this good? You betcha!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True story or not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie, for the same reasons as previous commenters did. I also liked the absence of hackneyed plot devices, such as the McDormand character being taken off the case but solving it anyway, or a turf war between the local police and the FBI.However, I notice that the opening credits say that the story is true, while the closing credits say that it is entirely fictional. For a while I thought that it was a true story, then I realized that the murder of three people, including a police officer, would be taken very seriously. Instead of the case being given to one uniformed officer, a team of homicide detectives would descend on the scene.It would have been better if the makers of the movie had been straightforward about whether the movie is true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy? What comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Includes spoilers)First off, I've heard this one billed as a dark comedy. Personally, I didn't find the film the least bit funny, except for a few humourous bits here and there. I did, however, find this film to be very well crafted, engrossing, and overall excellent in all respects. In short, I loved this film. But I wouldn't call it a comedy...William H. Macy gives an outstanding performance as a car salesman whose plot to get some instant cash (which he desparately needs to get out of debt) goes terribly awry. Equally outstanding was Frances McDormand as the small-town police chief who puts all the pieces together.One final comment: Many people have questioned the scene in whichMarge Gunderson (McDormand) has a drink with an old high-school classmate, saying the scene was pointless and unnecessary. I disagree. (Here's where the spoiler comes in.) Up until then, Marge was taking Jerry Lundegaard's (Macy) story at face value. Then she has a drink with Mike, who tells her about how he married someone they both knew from high school, who died of lukemia a year ago, and he is so lonely now... The next morning, Marge finds out that Mike's sob story was a load of bull, and she swallowed it hook-line-and-sinker. It is then that she starts to suspect that maybe Lundegaard's story wasn't completely on the up-and-up. It's the experience with Mike, and her subsequent discovery that she was easily fooled, that plants the seeds of doubt in her mind about Lundegaard.(Just had to say that.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many people told me that this was a "must see", but I wasn't very impressed. The plot had so much potential and that is the only reason that it was somewhat entertaining.I couldn't get over how stupid every single character in this whole entire movie was. EVERY character seemed to have an IQ below 70. From the criminals to the police officers, all seemed to lack any form of intelligence based on the exchanges of dialog between characters.I think that ultimately this movie is one that should be watched. Perhaps if I watched it a second time I would enjoy it more. This movie is so highly regarded that my first though after watching it was, "Did I miss something?".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An essential Coen Brothers film, and essential in general.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a modern classic film that I implore many film fans to see.Fargo is one of the best written stories ever to be put on film. The story maintains a certain style throughout and this style is effective. The dialogue is plain, mundane, real, but maintains a certain ridiculousness. Of course, this is a trait that the Coen Brothers are known for. But in Fargo, it is shown in full form. The contrast between the characters accents, mannerisms, sensibilities, and their current situations is hilarious. This is how one does dark comedy. Take a story that still works if put in Los Angeles or New York and place it somewhere a bit outlandish yet relatable.Most of the other technical aspects are solid. Most aren't too impressive, but are obviously a step above most films. The score is great as well, keeps the audience tense and is fitting to the story. Of course one can't talk about this film without mentioning the acting. Everyone plays the part well, even down to Scotty Lundegaard. Especially Frances McDormand, who had an absolutely phenomenal performance. She's strong, funny, and brings a lot of life to the film. But like I've stated before, the writing and style is what makes this movie classic. It will forever be one of my personal favorite films, and hopefully it will for you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be heralded as one of the all time great movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know when a movie is an absolute masterpiece, or a complete stinker, they are the easiest to review, hands down. Its the films that sit right in the middle that are hardest. Anyhow, without a shadow of a doubt Fargo falls into the former category. It was good the first time i saw it; now I've viewed it a second time it truly is a masterpiece of gargantuan proportions. There's so much right with this movie... in fact I'm unable to think of anything negative about it at all. The story, first and foremost, is a simple one. Jerry Lundegaard hires two crooks to kidnap his wife, whose father in law will pay the ransom, which Jerry will benefit from. But, like most Coen Brothers movies, nothing goes to plan. The Fact that the story is such a simple one is the first main reason why it works so well - don't necessarily over complicate the plot. Ethan and Joel know this, and in simplifying events, allow us to concentrate on the stunning script, the amazing performances and the frozen Minnesotan country. So events go awry... and we are introduced to police chief Marge Gunderson,Frances Mcdormand,AKA Mrs Joel Coen(who deservedly bagged an Oscar), one of the most endearing cinematic creations in recent memory. In a believable, simple way, heavily pregnant Marge puts together the pieces of a terrible crime gone oh so wrong. Its not that its so believable, nor the comic interpretation of the Scandinavian roots of Minessota, nor even the brilliant performances by Mcdormand, William H Macy (a career best), Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare interwoven with a biting, dark, often hilarious script,not even a marvellous score, no its the way in which, at the end, you manage to feel the way in which good prevails over evil a quite riveting and fascinating affair - even with a body count of 7 people, it never feels overly violent. Humanity wins hands down, and that, coupled with all of the above, means that it is in my book, one of the greatest movies ever made. 10/10 David Ford</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema's most assured masterpiece in the lapse of fifty years ( and I'm not kidding)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of Fargo, you can simply think of a lot of things, but one thing that can be absolutely and undeniably true, it's the utter beauty of this picture. The Coen Brothers seem to be the catalysts of five of the greatest film directors in history : Ingmar Bergman, Andrei Tarkovsky, John Huston, Brian De Palma, and last but not definitely not least, Nicholas Ray. Fargo breathes in the work of these great directors, simultaneously ! It is so much of a level of talent, that it's simply insane, and I couldn't even afford to kid.The screenplay and the story, written by the Coens, seem to breathe three great writers of the 20th century : Fyodor Dostoyesky, Anton Tchekov and finally James M. Cain.God, you cannot even begin to describe the brilliance of structure and style that the film is dealt with. It is as obscure as it is breathtakingly shocking. The acting of William H. Macy is completely at it's peak in this picture, and even today the man is a considerable and magnificent acting genius. Macy is absolutely divine, in portraying the most bleak and opportunistic of cowardice, in the role of this car salesman. He is perfect in this role, as he might not have in the lapse of six years, since 96 at the eve of release of Fargo. But on the downside of things, he has suffered immense type-casting, if you can take the example of another movie The Cooler, in which he plays another meek character. (He should probably hire a better agent, but very good agents are hard to find) He comes off as a second Bob De Niro, in this picture.The greatest scene and probably the most gruesome scene is the wife's kidnapping. But for now, let's explain the whole universe, which is Fargo. The film opens in the eerie beauty of winter, in harsh snow-falling of Minnesota, located in a small town. Jerry Lundergaard played by Macy, is a car salesman who wants to plan his wife's kidnapping and ransom with two stone-to-death pathetic and amateurish career burglars. He does this in the goal of getting is father-in-law's life insurance of 40 M, as a scam and sharing fifty-fifty with the kidnappers, played by Steve Buscemi, and Peter Storre (or something) That's all you get from me, and I don't care what you do on any given week-end, just watch this brilliant movie. Go every where, find this dang movie, own this dang movie. Me, I've probably seen it 20 times already. Move your butt for this movie, just run to get this movie. I don't care if you're drunk, stoned or something, find this movie, you shall not regret it.Well that's enough out of me, and that was a film expert's advise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty clear to me that you have to know a lot of the ins and outs of movies to enjoy a Coen brothers movie. But unfortunately if you don't your left bored and bemused. Now I can appreciate this movie has some top-notch acting. Not many will deny that, but there are a lot of movies out there with fine acting. So it needs something else which apparently this movie has, but as someone who just purely wants to be entertained and left thinking "wow", I was let down. Nothing shocked me, the ending didn't give me goosebumps etc. There were scenes (such as the one where the female cop talks to her old Asian friend from school) that I can't for the life of me work out why they needed to be there.So if you've been to film school or just simply have good knowledge of how a movie should be then by all means check this out and enjoy, but otherwise I recommend you stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dose of comedy and thriller!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, and Steve Buscemi. When I first saw this movie a few years ago on VHS, I had noticed the information notice at the beginning stating that this was based on a true story from 1987. Now I know that this picture was NOT based on a true event from what I learned a while back. How misleading that is. Anyway, the movie is about a young man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by Macy) who works at an auto dealership and hires two guys to kidnap his wife so that he can pay off his debts (his wife was wealthy). Jerry Lundegaard is the kind of guy who was very stupid and not really honest in his ways. Anyone who is in tremendous debt that hires someone to have a relative or relatives of theirs kidnapped and/or killed in order to pay off his or her own debts is surely asking to get themselves landed in prison. Right after Jerry's wife is kidnapped, he comes back home to find that his wife is not there and "acts" like he's worried and concerned. His concerned feelings are very phony and all he wanted was to get greedy, just to pay off his debts. To me, Jerry was a selfish guy. I have absolutely NO RESPECT, WHATSOEVER for people who try to pay off their own debts by hiring someone to kidnap and/or kill their wealthy relatives. Then, when he gets in touch with the two men he "hired" to do this awful and sadistic deed some more, things get out of hand for him. The guys demand more money (they're just as greedy as Jerry), they had killed three people on the evening of the same day that they kidnapped the wife (a state trooper who was just doing his job by pulling them over for forgetting to put the temporary tags on this new car was shot, and two passers by who slowed down to witness what was going on were shot as well). Frances McDormand gave a wonderful performance as the very pregnant officer chief assigned to the case. This is a movie worth watching with lots of comical scenes (not the ones of violence, of course) and some dramatic ones as well. It is worth watching. I also like the Indian guy, Shep Proudfoot. He was seen a few times in the movie, but I thought he was funny as well. Check the scene where he gets back at the guy at his residence. That is something!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can be said of Fargo that has not been said before? Fargo is a film that cannot be cornered with any easy definition. The Coen brothers have defined themselves with a style that is unique and refreshing and Fargo stands as one of their masterworks. Equal parts crime-caper, drama and comedy, Fargo takes its audience on a journey where every turn is a breathe of fresh air and every line of dialog is something that you could never translate to another film.Frances McDormand shines in her lead role as the pregnant cop who has a small-town, matter-of-fact way about her that is both endearing and unpredictable, a performance easily earning her Oscar win. William H Macy is as memorable as ever as the car dealer whose ransom master-plan and life spins further and further out of control. And while Steve Buscemi is known for his quirky performances, in Fargo his quirkiness almost seems to make his character appear the most "normal" of the bunch.While certainly not a film for everybody (many in my family still don't know what to make of it) it is an easy recommendation for anybody who wants to experience a truly unique, original film. The barren landscape of mid-winter Fargo certainly hides a spectrum of colorful scenarios that amount to a wholly entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick with a too abrupt ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What more can be said after 487 viewer comments? For #488, all I will say is that, after watching this three times, Fargo is a fine piece of cinema, with an emphasis on a minimalist approach to story-telling and without much in the way of theatrics. The setting is bleak, the dialog is mostly direct and to-the-point, and the characters are well-drawn, what few main characters there are. I thought Steve Buscemi was wonderful as the villain in a humorously sick way. The one negative comment I have is that I feel the movie ends much too abruptly: too many loose threads left hanging. I thought the viewer was entitled to know a little bit more about why Jerry (William H. Macy) would go to such outlandish lengths to raise money as to stage his own wife's kidnapping. The fact that he "owed money" or "got in over his head" wasn't quite enough for me as an explanation since I had kept asking myself during the course of this escapade, "Why? Exactly why is he doing this?" We never really find out except in the most vague terms. All in all, probably my favorite Coen Brothers film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film. One thing it never reveals is why the Macy character badly needed so much cash in the first place. First, this need for cash leads to the fraud with GMAC Financing (early in the film), but then, of course, it leads to the series of events in the main plot of the film.Anyone care to guess what the Macy character did to need so much cash, so quickly? We see no substance abuse or gambling tendencies. I'm stumped.One minor gripe with the film: the "true story" bit. It isn't.

It's brilliantly written and made, and i thought, the scene where Macy's wife gets kidnapped was very powerful, plus i loved the Dark Comedy bits as well!. This is brilliant film making at it's finest, with fantastic story telling, and Oscar Worthy performances, and i say Go see it now!.The Direction is wonderful!. Joel Coen does a wonderful job here, with fantastic camera work, awesome angles, great POV shots, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace. The Acting is no doubt Oscar worthy!. William H Macy is AMAZING here, he is extremely likable, had some great facial reactions, as his character was quite pathetic, but he did an incredible job of portraying it, he is one of the most underrated actors out there, and in my opinion deserved an Oscar for this! (Macy rules!).Frances McDormand is also AMAZING here , she deserved her Oscar, had some great dialog, had a great accent, and while her character was nothing out of the ordinary, it was fascinating just the same!. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as one of the main villains, he can do this role in his sleep, and he was also hilarious at times, i loved him!. Peter Stormare is great here,as the other villain and did his job extremely well. Rest of the cast do awesome. Overall Go See It now it's a masterpiece. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A favourite of mine (potential spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something a little novel about reviewing a film released half a decade ago ? I'm writing this after watching Fargo for the fourth time, not the first, so this really should be preceded by the following disclaimer: Fargo is one of my favourite films - ever.Bringing together an ensemble group of ever so slightly eccentric characters and thrusting them into the epitome of small-town America ? Fargo tells the story of a scam gone wrong ? mainly due to the utter incompetence of its protagonists. On many levels, this is a film primarily about its characters ? the inability of people to communicate, the repulsive ?Have a Nice Day' aesthetic of the nineties and humanity's greatest vice: a constant desire for more money. In this way, Marge ? perfectly portrayed with the correct amount of conviction and humour by Frances McDormand ? is the lead role. She is a woman who likes people and loves their inner good ? shown by her affection for fumbling husband Norm ? and there is barely anything more disheartening in the film than the extended close-up of her melancholic face after discovering the extent of Mike's lies ? this is the point where she becomes disillusioned with people, and this only increases as she comes face to face with Grimsrud.However, Fargo is about a lot more than people and humanity ? and, aside from Marge, there are many protagonists. It is also a film about violence and the inability to escape from violence. Shot against such a beautiful, invariably white backdrop, the red of blood becomes increasingly shocking ? simply accentuating the horror of violence in this small-town society. Characters resort to violence simply because they have no other outlet for their inability to communicate ? Carl shoots Wade simply because he is frustrated at Jerry's non-appearance, there is no possible gain for him in this murder. There is not a bad thing to say about Fargo ? the writing is perfectly spot-on, juxtaposing blackly hilarious lines with extreme violence, Deakins' cinematography is breathtaking, encompassing seemingly endless landscapes of snow-white, and there is not a bad apple amongst the cast. Everything is rounded off with a cherry on top ? the subtle Coen Brothers directorial touch ? the ability to either exploit the funniest thing in every frame or create humour in something that is distinctly serious. Much attention has been given to the auteur status of the Coens, and I do think that Fargo is unmistakably their work - possibly their finest hour in a fine canon of cinema. Just simply perfect.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers always come up with hits (for instance, Raising Arizona) but this time, they bring us to the deep north (North Dakota that is) to showcase a very well made movie with suspenseful scenes, interesting acting and many other things, ya know.The film plot involves a car salesman who is very insecure (played very well by Macy) and who wants to snuff his wife out. So, he hires a duo to kidnap her (the duo is probably the best of the year by Steve Buscemi as a wisecracking killer, and Peter Stormare as a un-talkative killer) and eventually kill her. But what he doens't know is that a pregnant police officer (played in an Oscar winning role by Frances McDormand) is on the case to find out what's going on.This is just the tip of the woodchipper in this creative, ingenious, and wonderful (though odd) murder mystery in Fargo, ND. So, kudos to the Coen brothers for delivering what is most likely the best film of 1996.</fullReview>

Decorations were very nice-offbeat. Acting: Frances McDormand was very natural. She is very good analyzed character of policewoman Marge Gunderson. The mark for acting is 10/10. William H. Macy played clamp and sly man. Went out very truthful but in some episodes were noticeable make up on his face. The mark for acting is 9/10. Evil men by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are very comic. And performance by Steve Buscemi was very outstanding. He played 9/10. Character of his work-mate is very difficult for performing, but Peter Stormare didn't strike to mud by face. The mark for acting is 8/10. Picture "Fargo" came in to golden part of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great American film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the most brilliant, creative, and stylish film I have ever seen. The coen's really out did themselves with this piece of work. It is by far they're greatest achievement as directors and writers. How this film did not win best picture of 1996 is beyond me, and it astonishes me that the Joel coen did not win best director for this. At least the academy recognized the great acting by Francis Mcdormand and the creative brilliance of the screenplay. William H. Macy also did a wonderful job although I believe they overlooked Steve Buscemi, who in my mind is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. But perhaps I am most impressed with the acting of Peter Stormare who portrayed an excellent cold-blooded character. Everything about this film is great. The acting, the locations, the story, and the accents. I give this film a 10/10 and its well-deserved. Thank you Coen brothers for adding a masterpiece to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super film with a super lady (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people ? some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years back? What I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn? I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper. It's the scene where the fun and games stop. You really know what these characters are capable of. And the coldly efficient killings that follow are brutal in how simply they're directed. Too often directors try and tell you how to feel. The Coens just show it, and it's a technique that, for me, is far more effective.Another thing that the Coens show are the Minnesota people. Having never been there I have no idea whether the accent is accurate, but it's an interesting portrait of a society. Everyone is so damn polite. Even when a parking attendant is getting threatened he's still got a big smile on his face. And there's one guy who, matter of factly, tells how Buscemi's character threatened him. It's a great scene because it captures the way that people tell stories ? kind of flatly and with little creativity. And at the end they talk about the weather. Brilliant. But setting the story in Minnesota was a great decision because polite societies are often the most violent ? just take Victorian England. Everything gets repressed and it ends up bursting. Plus the snow and the pure white landscape hint at something dark under the surface.However, what lingers most in the memory is the character of Marge. She's the film's moral centre. She's the one who sees through the insanity of what's happening and the one that gives you hope for the future. Indeed, Marge and Norm are comforting figures. They have a relationship that is without mystery but one that is rock solid. They give you hope that sanity will prevail. And I like Marge's scene with the frighteningly needy Mike. ('You're such a super lady and I'm so lonely.') Even in the face of such pent-up madness she keeps her dignity and her composure. She really is a super lady.And Fargo is a super film. I'm not sure I'd put it on a par with The Big Lebowski and it's a bit too thin to be truly great, but it's certainly an excellent piece of cinema.Oh, but I've also got to mention one of my favourite lines in film. When Buscemi is talking to an escort he says, 'Find that work interesting, do you?' The woman's reaction is priceless.</fullReview>

It's great plot and storyline along with amazing performances by Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormand and it's a great thriller. William H. Macy is also really good. It shows how a small, petty crime turns into six people dying and two people being arrested. Some of it maybe be confusing, but it's still a great thriller. To add on to that, I thought it was pretty funny too. To wrap it up, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone younger than fourteen or fifteen, because you see people having sex and it drops the "F" bomb a lot. Also some mild violence, but still a great movie. 9.5/10. For Fans Of: THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR ANY COEN BROTHERS MOVIES</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top Three of all time since the second I left the theater back in 1996? I guess that has always been one reason that I've avoided watching this film in the past year and a half that I have been reviewing every film that I see. The best thing to do, as I did with my other two favorites in my personal cinematic trinity, is describe why this movie is, in my opinion, incredible.'Fargo' is, like many Coen brothers films, the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. In this case, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable, scary and share a half a brain among them, and what was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama, and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow-white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking, and harkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'. One of the funniest things I remember about this film was actually an unfavorable review my parents, who are both movie lovers themselves, gave it before I saw it for myself. It was, verbatim, 'We saw 'Fargo' and it was REALLY dark. We hated it. You will LOVE it.' And indeed I did. I walked out of the theater eight years ago on a cold, snowy night and literally thought to myself, 'THAT is how films should be made.'That really sums it all up in simple, non-flashy terms. And because of my very true adoration for their work, I have described how choosing my favorite Coen Brothers film is like a mother choosing her favorite child. It takes a film that is a step above 'phenomenal' in order for it to shine above all of the other fantastic films they have made. In my opinion, 'Fargo' is and always will be that caliber of film for me. Every other film of theirs have varying degrees of 'great-ness', because I truly love and admire all of their work, but because of its standout performances, intelligent and compelling script, and it's beautiful presentation, 'Fargo' is a four star film, and will always remain on my personal 'favorites' list.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a breath of fresh air. It is inspiring for movie-goers, because the majority of films lack inspiration or originality. Joel and Ethan Coen's masterpiece is funny, sadistic, dark, violent, intense, and true. The setting is cold and harsh, which is perfect for the events that unfold in the storyline. It deserves its place in the top 100 films of all time. The acting is top-of-the-line, as well. Frances McDormand deserved her Academy Award. Due to these facts, you simply must watch this film. The thing that impresses me the most with this film, as with other films by the Coen brothers, is that it portrays what can result from a lie, which eventually explodes and ultimately leads to death and madness. Thou shalt not lie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid movie watcher it came to my attention that I had missed what many consider to be a very good movie, Fargo. I rented the movie and was not impressed. The movie ended and I felt nothing. It was entertaining to watch but not extremely captivating. There was little to no message from the movie. A lot of useless dialog including many conversations about, "He was kinda funny looking." "Yea?" "Yea, kinda funny looking." "Anything else?" "No, just kinda funny looking." This to me is not an intellectual film and the saddest part is, the detective work didn't lead to the capture. It was pure luck. I happened to be driving by and, oh there is the car we have been looking for. To top it off there is one scene where the detective meets with an old friend of hers. There is no reason for the scene and it is quite out of place. In the end the movie is barely a 2 star movie and defiantly not in any top 100-movie list I would ever make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another overrated Coen brothers film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't understand what everyone loves about this film. To me, it wasn't the film itself that was the problem, but the way in which it was told that was the major problem.OK, so the basic plot is Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is up to his eyeballs in debt and comes up with a plan to stage the kidnapping of his wife with 2 criminals Carl Showalter (Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). He arranges for them to kidnap his wife and then he intends to extort money from her wealthy father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) and split the extortion money with his criminal counterparts, but things don't quite go according to plan;********************SPOILERS*****************************************For me, one of the biggest problems lay with the character of Jerry Lundegaard. One of the basic rules of film making is Character Development and this was the biggest failing of the film. We get pretty much zero character development from Jerry - we learn that he has money problems, but we never know why or how this has come about? As its based on a true story, we could probably find this out through Wikipedia or Google, but that's not the point. The Coen brothers should have explained this so that we could at the very least 'connect to the protagonist'.Then there is the ridiculous kidnapping scene; Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) is in the living room watching TV and sees a man with a balaclava approach her house - she sees him for a good 10 seconds but just sits there and doesn't do anything and one of the kidnappers peers through clear glass and looks all across her lounge, but fails to see her stood up in the living room (is he blind??) and then he smashes the door with a baton. I suppose her not doing anything could perhaps be put down to shock. But then it gets worse.......The second kidnapper kicks the front door through (with ease) and then both men chase her up to the bathroom and the 2 men struggle to get through a standard internal wooden door (logically an internal door would be weaker than a front door) yet it took 2 of them and a crowbar to get through the bathroom door, yet one kick from 1 kidnapper sees the front door go flying to the floor....... come on!!!) Then whilst the kidnappers are 'struggling' to get through the bathroom door. I use the term 'struggling' loosely as that would not happen in the real world. Jean opens the bathroom window and hides behind the shower curtain - to make it look as though she had escaped through the bathroom window - (good idea), but just when you are about to think that an ounce of plausibility is kicking into play what happens? She jumps out from behind the shower curtain (for no reason) with the shower curtain attached to her face, falls down the stairs and gets rendered unconscious and the kidnappers take her away. WTF? Why not just stay behind the curtain and wait till they leave? With Jean's initial cunning double bluff they never would have known.Anyway, swiftly moving on to good parts of Fargo and one of the plus points for me was the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). Her and her dopey sidekick did provide some comic relief and some tension to proceedings, but if I'm honest even Gunderson's character and her relevant investigations were a little under utilised.I think the main problem with this film is the way that the Coen brothers have told the story; no motivation for his character's behaviour (expect for money - surely there must have been more to it than that). The way the kidnapping scene was depicted was also preposterous as far as I was concerned.In summary, this had its good moments (mainly McDormand and Buscemi), but it's let down by numerous absurdities and a lack of sympathy for Jerry Lundegaard. The Coens admit themselves that 'many of the events' were based on what actually happened rather than 'all of the events' (which helps to explain the numerous absurdities in the plot - I never did feel that this entirely rang true whilst watching it). This had the potential to be great, but the lack of a decent back story for Jerry Lundegaard meant that I could never connect to his character meaning ultimately that I couldn't connect to the film. This had the potential to be great, but ultimately it was just a waste of 100 minutes.</fullReview>

Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a "true story", which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>YEP! I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count. But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo? Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever. I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh. I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou. I loved Happy Gilmore. I loved Clerks. I loved Dr. Strangelove. I loved Blazing Saddles. So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies. But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents. People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious. Well, they're not. I grew up in the South, okay. I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life. But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot. These are just normal accents. There is nothing satirical about them. They aren't that funny. Get over it.Okay, the plot. Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring? It's an average crime movie. I know crime movies. That's my forte, you could say. My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...). But this movie is just an average movie. The plot is pretty predictable too. I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie isn't all bad. The acting is good. The dialog is quick and edgy. The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice. But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe. If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told. Okay, you still here? Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become. Honestly, I see nothing funny about it. It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers. I liked Evil Dead 2. Gore doesn't bother me. But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper? It makes sense to me. If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA! THROW IT IN! But is it funny? Not really. Is it gory? No. Is it bad? No. But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever? HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting. The acting is the only thing that kept me interested. I love W.H. Macy. All the actors and actresses are good in this movie. But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be? No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no. In conclusion: This movie is an "okay" movie. There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great. I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are. I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies. They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!) People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS: Go ahead, send the hate mail. I welcome it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it was released in 1996, "Fargo" met public and especially critical acclaim and collected several rewards. But I think that if the Prize for the Best Directing at the Cannes festival was absolutely justified, on the other hand, Frances McDormand didn't deserve her Oscar in 1997. William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.What is amazing in "Fargo" are the landscapes, the sceneries and above all the characters. The Coen brothers said about the movie: " the landscapes, the sceneries are an integral part of the movie. They are typical of the Midwest as well as the characters with their sensitivity and their mentality". They know what they are talking about since they come from the Midwest, more precisely from the Minnesota. As a consequence, they must have been at ease by making this thrilling movie.Concerning the characters, they are the subject of a realistic and down-to-earth description. Each of them has a different but not very status-enhancing characteristic: William H.Macy's cues are almost always hesitating, unfinished or unsure, the two gangsters are just silly guys (one of them nearly never talks) and most of the inhabitants including Frances McDormand are narrow-minded. By this way, the Coen brothers wanted to underline their meanness of mind and the fact that they are firmly rooted in their land of the Minnesota.Apart from the characters and although the movie is based on a true story, I am obliged to recognize that the script and the way the movie is designed have nothing new. But nonetheless, the tone is daring, there's black humor cleverly used (notably in bloody moments) that contrasts with a quiet even neutral directing. As for the snowy landscapes, they will later inspire Sam Raimi for "a simple plan" (1998), a movie as successful as "Fargo"."Fargo" is eventually the finest movie made by the Coen brothers and its place in the top 250 is thoroughly justified.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review and I've been a IMDb member for 9 straight years. Fargo is the type of movie that absolutely forced me to write something about it. It has been on my watch list for more than 8 years or so and I have no idea what I have been thinking by not watching it. It's the absolute definition of a perfect movie.Let's start with the cinematography. For me, the snow is one of the main characters here and boy does it fit well. It actually creates this negative background that adds beauty to every scene and accentuates every color and movement. The camera unfolds slowly and steadily so you could take your time and enjoy the beautiful shots.The characters and dialogue. As a big Tarantino pre-Kill Bill fan, this is a little gem. Every third line is an instant classic and is delivered brilliantly. Everyone did an amazing job (Francis McDormant absolutely killed it), nothing seemed forced or out of place and every exchange is hilarious in its own way. There is not one single scene I would cut out or one actor that did not deliver.I will stop writing now because if you haven't seen it, you should do it right away instead of reading this lousy review. You're in for a treat that you will want to watch again and again for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A masterpiece of light and dark by the Coen Brothers.Based on a true story, a car salesman in Minneapolis, MN, Jerry Lundegard (played by William H Macy) hires two criminals to kidnap his wife. Her father is wealthy and Jerry needs the money. However, things don't go according to plan and soon three people are dead outside of Brainerd, MN. The 7-month pregnant Sheriff of Brainerd, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), is soon on the case, and she is very intuitive and resourceful...An amazing story, well told. Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, the story itself shows how the most simple, very-limited-harm- intended crime can unravel, resulting in the deaths of several people.The execution is a work of pure art. The Coens mix incredibly dark plot lines and themes with a lightness and almost frivolity to produce a movie that is simultaneously deadly serious and very funny. There is violence aplenty and some quite disturbing scenes, mixed with folksiness, innocence and humour. In the midst of evil there is good, and vice versa.A haunting score and stunning cinematography add to the tone of the movie.Superb performance by Frances McDormand in the lead role. The Sheriff is an amazing character, an understated, modest hero, and McDormand nails the part. She well deserved her Best Actress Oscar. William H Macy is perfectly cast as the crooked car salesman and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his performance. A true classic, and one of the greatest movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cold-Blooded Comedy of Errors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Raising Arizona" filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have surpassed themselves again with their idiosyncratic dramedy thriller "Fargo" about a gallery of memorable characters. A pregnant female police chief investigates a strange kidnapping case and tracks down a pair of ruthless killers and the Minneapolis automobile salesman who hired them. He learns about these two reprobates from a mechanic at the car dealership where he works. Like all first-class Coen brothers' movies, this police procedural operates on two levels and boasts not only eccentric characters but also outlandish predicaments. The use of an unlikely lady police chief, Frances McDormand, who stands in for the standard-issue male protagonist, sets this superior, often satirical crime saga apart from most entries in the genre. Incidentally, McDormand took home an Oscar for Best Actress as Marge Gunderson. Furthermore, the Coens shared the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Although it won only two Oscars, "Fargo" received nominations for Best Picture, Best Picture, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing." "Fargo" unfolds with an amusing preamble: "THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred." Of course, most of what happens here is strictly illusory. Like most Hollywood movies, "Fargo" is a synthesis of the real and the imaginary. In the article "Rewind: What Part Of 'Based On' Don't You Understand?" author Karl Heitmueller wrote: "Joel Cohen told 'Time Out' that 'if an audience believes that something's based on a real event, it gives you permission to do things they might otherwise not accept.'" Heitmueller classifies "Fargo" and other movies, like "Ray" and "Gangs of New York" as BOATS movies. According to Heitmueller, "A BOATS movie is not a documentary, and while watching one we should be smart enough to take everything we see in it with a big ol' grain of popcorn salt. The problem seems to be that audiences often overlook the words "based on." It's not Hollywood's fault that, amazingly, many people just don't question what's presented in a BOATS movie ? that moviegoers don't stop to consider that it's impossible to know exactly what happened on the doomed fishing boat the Andrea Gale in "The Perfect Storm." The contrived plot involves a cash starved car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey of "The Cooler"), who hires a couple of lowlife criminals, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi of "Con-Air") and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare of "The Big Lebowski") to kidnap his ditzy wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrüd of "Drop Dead Gorgeous"), whose kidnapping scene is hilarious. Jean gets wrapped up in a shower curtain and scrambles about her house in desperation to escape them. Meantime, Jerry hopes that he can force his gruff father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell of "Saving Private Ryan"), who owns the car dealership where Jerry works, to pay the ransom. The father-in-law isn't happy about the arrangement. He would rather hand over the loot to the kidnappers than entrust Jerry with the cash. Indeed, scheming Jerry plans to split the loot between the three of them. Ultimately, Marge investigates, tracking down leads, and questions Jerry. Naturally, everything turns into a comedy of errors, and nothing works out for either the desperate car salesman or his paid abductors. Marge proves that he is no pushover when he wields her service revolver. She drops Garear in his tracks when he tries to run from her. Ace British lenser Roger Deakins' cinematography is a pleasure to behold, and he captures the grim setting of North Dakota with its snow-swept terrain. Some of the violence is brutal. When the two kidnappers are pulled over by a state trooper, Gaear shoots him in the head and blood bubbles out of his head like a fountain. The dry dialogue that everybody delivers is interesting, too. "Fargo" has thus far spawned two made-for-television shows just as bogus as the movie "Fargo." Produced for $7 million, this Coen brothers release generated over $60 million at the box office, making it a fabulously successful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marge's understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this for the first time last night. It's an excellent movie and deserves its high acclaim. Naturally, I wondered what it's about, beyond the plot. It's clearly focused on the contrast between the law-breakers and the detective, but it would be too superficial to conclude that the speech made by "Marge" (Francis McDormand) at the end, and indeed the entirety of her attitude, pregnancy, relationship with her husband, and ways of interviewing people, embody the main opposing philosophy to those of the lawbreakers. My immediate reaction was that she's far from being a typical noir detective, because she's so above it all, is not alienated, doesn't share any of the evil traits of the bad guys, even rudimentarily or incipiently, and, in fact, doesn't understand evil, doesn't understand the chaotic world, and doesn't even try to understand them. The screenplay, to its credit, while making her the heroine also conveys her inability to fathom those on the other side of the law. She has found a way out from alienation in a sort of banality or comfort of married life but it seems bereft of understanding human nature. The film might make many viewers feel equally comfortable at a superficial level that the good guys have won and that the bad guys have, for various defects in their nature and capacities, lost; but if we feel any discomfort with this pat interpretation, it's because deep down the story spurs us to understand more deeply than Marge's understanding.The critic who has propounded a view like this is Jerold J. Abrams in his essay "'A Homespun Murder Story': Film Noir and the Problem of Modernity in Fargo" that appears in the book "The Philosophy of the Coen Brothers". Abrams points out the central behavioral of every major character in the movie is a breakdown in communication with one another. This is indicative of the isolation and alienation of them all. (In his view, this is a modern problem rooted in The triumph of Reason in the Enlightenment over the mythology that's really central to human beings and their cultures.) Marge calls a day beautiful that's cold and snowy. This is an accommodation of her thought to a nature that actually presents us with evil in the form of catastrophes, large inconveniences and often malicious consequences. This is her refusal to confront evil in nature and in human beings and to make a serious attempt to understand it. In other words, it's a cop out. When we see William Macy hacking at an iced windshield or when her prowler needs a start after sitting out in the cold, the actualities of cold, snow and ice come more clearly into view."Fargo" doesn't address the question of evil either. It shows it but doesn't explain it. It doesn't refer it to Fate or Destiny, which is sometimes seen as the force at work in classic noir. It doesn't refer both good and evil to God, as in the Bible. It doesn't refer them to a mechanistic universe in which physics is king and all causation is determined from day 1 and before. The one alternative that never seems to get much play is that non-determinism coexists with determinism. If humans are not 100% machines, then they have a degree of freedom at the core, and so does the universe. The existence of this freedom creates the option of good and evil. Good and evil come with the turf of life and being, inseparable from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great dark comedy you betcha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not I finally got around to watching this movie last night at a midnight movie showing at a local movie theater. I knew going in it was a Coen bros. film, set somewhere up north, that starred Steve Buscemi. Other than that I had no clue about the plot or other characters, or the Oscar wins and high ratings on this site. That being said, this is a good dark comedy, a little on the violent side in some parts, but very well done. CONTAINS SPOILERS The movie is set in a bone-chilling, Minnesota/North Dakota, in the late 1980's, supposedly based on a true story. It is about Jerry Lundergan(William H. Macy), a weaselly car salesman that is having money problems(that is never really explained), who comes up with a plan to have his wife kidnapped and for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom, with most of the money actually going to him. Once the plan is in motion, very little goes right and quite a bit of blood, mayhem and comedy occur. The atmosphere and screen shots are what I liked most about this film. The Coen's did a wonderful job of making you feel the cold and wilderness of the upper Midwest. The camera work was stunning and IMO is what really makes this movie great. The plot itself is good, a little slow at first, but really ramps up as the movie goes on. It is a dark comedy, with humor peppered in just the right amount. Some of the characters are over-the-top with heavy mid-western accents, some are just plain over-the-top. My only beef with the movie is the blood and violence. I think they could have made this movie just as good without the gore. I also think some of the character development was a little rushed, with a few characters adding very little to the story or plot. Overall a beautifully filmed dark comedy, and a must see! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing achievement by the Coen brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This dark comedy based on real-life events is the movie that defined the Coen brothers as the influential filmmakers they are today. With their incredible writings and their wittiness of genre-mixing, these two have made one of the most recognizable names in Hollywood. set in the snowy town of Fargo, North Dakota, this film stars William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, a car dealer obsessed with being wealthy who hires a duo of ruthless criminals Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grismud (played by Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean and exchange her for a large amount of money by her father. Before too long when the plan goes terribly wrong and turns into a bloodbath, this heinous crime gains the attention of a pregnant police officer Margo Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand) who comes into investigation. What comes from this crime story is some amazing performances by a talent cast, a polished screenplay, and some of the most elegantly written characters ever put to screen.As this is a Coen brothers film, instead of conveying a straight dark tone, this film illustrates a dark and gritty story with a touch of humor sprinkled throughout its story. And with no little surprise, the Coen brothers achieve this quite well. From the opening scene, we are introduced to William H. Macy's character who is quickly learn is up to no good, and does compelling job at hiding his mischievousness from his wife and son. Nearly every scene of his presence is unpredictable and leaves you attention glued to him. Macy really stands out in this role and makes himself a good name for playing such a despicable husband and father his character is. The real fun however, occurs during the scenes of the two criminals played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, from the scene of kidnapping the main character's wife to the astonishing climax at the end. The story grows increasingly engaging and dark in the amidst of it's satirical tone, and every scene these two are in hits the right notes, whether they make you laugh or have you shocked to the edge of your seat. These two give such dazzling performances, especially Steve Buscemi who fits just right in his character considering his role he portrayed in Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs'. While these actors nail their roles, the biggest icing on the cake comes from Frances McDormand who gives a strong performance as the pregnant officer who goes on investigation of the crime. Standing as the most charismatic character, McDormand embraces her role diligently and never disappoints. It is no surprise her performance landed her an Academy Award.Fargo is a fun and entertaining experience, and the Coen brothers do a tremendous job. This a film with amazing performances, a spectacular screenplay, and well developed characters that stand strong. It is definitely one of the best works by the Coen brothers, and something every movie fanatic shouldn't miss. I am so ready to see their next film 'Hail Caeser!' as it now out in theaters this week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much good here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is one of the more entertaining movies I think I've ever watched. It's engaging, clever and down right hilarious at times. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a family man and car salesman, with a few schemes up his sleeve. The main being, to have his wife kidnapped so that her wealthy father pays the ransom, where he will pocket half. Along the way he teams up with Carl and Gaear, two of the most hilariously incompetent movie "bad guys" in history. When the plan goes sour Jerry tries desperately to stay out of trouble's way.The best part of Fargo, is the dark comedy aspect. In part, the movie is a satire of small town life. The irony is that even in the midst of a triple murder / kidnapping investigation, everyone remains so kind and polite, along with a very funny parody of Minnesota accents, and the gut-busting continuous description of Steve Buscemi being "funny looking".Comedy aside, the Coens, as always, wrote some very impressive symbolism into their screenplay. The first, being the concept that Marge Grunderson, the police chief, is pregnant. This is meant to show that even a pregnant woman, in a small, snow covered town, can't avoid some of the evils of the world. The second example is the side plot with Mike Yanagita. At dinner, Marge believes and fully trusts everything that Mike says only to learn that it was all a lie. The viewer is supposed to learn that maybe Marge is just a little too trusting of people. With that information, Marge goes back to the dealership and confronts Jerry again after she believes that he was lying (which he was). This character development at such a late stage of the movie, is unique but in this case, it works fantastically.On sheer watch and enjoy-ability, Fargo is a home run. When you work in the deeper level dark comedy and incredible symbolism that the Coen brothers have made famous, you have one of the best movies of the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens most iconic classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo,North Dakota isn't high on many's bucket list. But if you want to see this city turn into the setting for one of the most original and creative crime stories ever told, then sign up for this adventure from Joel and Ethan Coen. This original tale delivers plenty of laughs and lots of shocks. In an act of financial desperation, car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H.Macy) hires two boozy criminals to kidnap his wife so that he may split his wealthy father-in-law's ransom with them. However, everything falls apart due to the work of very pregnant cop Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) and poorly covered tracks. The characters laced with heavy Midwest accents all bring smiles to our faces no matter how evil or stupid they appear. Steve Buscemi, Frances McDorman and Willia H.Macy deliver one of a kind performances that are all memorable from the start. The Coens have crafted a story here with superb dialogue and wonderful wit that only the bright-minded and creative will appreciate, and this will go down as a classic fro generations to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark comedy crime story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inept car salesman hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to get money from his rich father-in-law. Unfortunately he should have hired better thugs as they end up messing the whole thing up, which in turn causes the local law enforcement to become involved. From that setting we get a crime story worthy of being directed by the Coen brothers, full of awkward characters, everyday situations and hilariously dark scenes of blood, gore and rage.The two thugs, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, are what make this film work for me. Usually cinema tends to depict criminals as violent and lethal people, and these two are that as well, but usually these kinds of characters are not depicted to be quite so out of their depth. It is made clear very soon that while these two may have done these kinds of things before, neither is what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. And they're both so idiotic in their own ways. It's fascinating to watch them live their miserable criminal lives and utterly failing at it. And yet they remain threatening throughout the entire film. Not because they're criminal masterminds, but because they're morons with no moral inhibitions.William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman, is also a fun character, who contrasts nicely with the two thugs. He's attempting to become a criminal, but he's even worse at it than his associates and every scene where he needs to pull off any kind conviction about his innocence is absolutely hilarious because? well, you can guess.Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson, the Minnesotan police chief in charge of investigations, has also received a lot of praise for her work. Personally I found her to be a touch boring, though I do admit that my expectations we're a bit too high. She's just so utterly chipper and optimistic all the time that it seems unrealistic. It's a nice contrast to her opponents, but it still means that I didn't find her that interesting. Still, I do like her character on a conceptual basis, and the performance itself is objectively fine. Not just my personal cup of tea.All in all Fargo is a nice watch if you're into dark comedy and can laugh at people being dismembered and people giving into their nefarious impulses. If you've liked any of the other Coen films, you're going to like this one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie 2 years ago and found it to be plain dry and just ordinary. But after watching a couple of episodes from that masterfully done TV series by the same name, my interest in the movie was rekindled.Today, after two years, I watched it again and found the movie to be surprisingly marvelous. All the scenes that I found unfunny became one of the most expertly directed and written humorous scenes. The casting (from main to extra characters) is superbly done. The humor is spot on - just the right amount slapstick and dark. Art direction is wonderful and dark. Every element related to the film feels carefully thought and is executed with equal parts creativity and restraint. I guess one just needs to be a little bit mature in movie-watching to fully enjoy Coen Brothers.Another movie of them - The Big Lebowski was a big disappointment for me. I hate it from my core and have promised myself never to watch it again. But with my changed experience of Fargo, I think I might give it another chance as well. Do watch Fargo after watching a couple of art houses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Those Films You Hope Comes Around Once in A Blue Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie put two things on the map: Fargo, North Dakota, and the Coen Brothers.The city has been around since 1871, and has a fairly interesting history (feel free to Wikipedia it), yet is best known for film that was made in 1996. Pretty sad, actually. You want to have some fun? Type in Fargo to Google and see what comes up. If your experience is anything like mine, then you will see first articles about the newish (and apparently very good; I should check it out) TV show, then the movie, and only third the actual city.The Coens have a fairly similar tale, though they are by now far more well-known across American than Fargo the city. Because it was their breakthrough into popular culture (and earned them their first Oscar), it was many a film-goer's introduction to them. As such, there are a fair amount of people who think that this is their first feature film when it is in reality their fourth.But enough posturing and preparing. Why did I give this film a perfect score? What specifically makes it so captivating? Why is it regarded as one of the greatest films of the nineties. Well, in one sentence, it seamlessly blends comedy and drama without missing a beat, delivering a film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, as likable as it is nihilistic, as beautiful as it is gritty.I think if the Rotten Tomatoes review recap were a little more artsy, it would sound something like that.In 1987, a car insurance salesman, played nicely by William H. Macy, is desperate for money. A lot of money. So he arranges for his wife to be kidnapped by some random criminals in return for 80K and a new car. He will then tell his wealthy father-in-law (who owns the chain of car dealerships) about this, say the criminals want a million in ransom, give them the 80K, and take 920K for himself, so he can start his own operation and start making money his way.Now, if he were competent, this would have been a totally different movie. But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon: The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title: they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us. And after all our quests and ventures, it so often is empty and worthless, which us all dying. It doesn't lull on it like dramatic films can, but rather weaves it into the dark comedy, which makes it all the more poignant.I do not like this film quite as much as No Country for Old Men, but it is a thoughtful, dark, masterfully-written, stunningly-shot, radiantly-scored film that you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see. You will not realize how invested in you are until half the film is already over.</fullReview>

Jerry is in big financial problems and decides to carry out the kidnapping of his own wife in order to extract ransom money from his wife's father. Criminals help him, but from the very beginning of things fall out of control. Followed by a series of unexpected events that will lead to fatal consequences, the team is chased by Marge (Frances McDormand), persistent local police officer. Cohen Brothers are specific for many reasons and bases their admirers from year to year increasing. Their films do not feature special effects, chases and a waste of money during the filming, but the subtle art that is best reflected in the superb directing and original screenplay full of extremely interesting and different characters. Most of the projects are signed to earn a solid sum of the cinema ticket offices, but they prefer to be their bosses, without conditions and interference in the work, which is typical for a big Hollywood studios, which often kill authorial innovation.</fullReview>

"Low-key" is the keyword (no pun intended) in this movie: Score, Peter Stormare's character, John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with Marge. All make the movie great.Wonderful atmosphere (combination of location, score, cinematography and direction), great cast and direction.John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with his wife. It's so innocent, loyal, natural and low-key. I also love Peter Stormare's character. Again, low-key with minimum dialog. He's one of the main villains, but looks so innocent - like a kid at times. He's intimidating by NOT talking and just giving a blank look.Frances McDormand is very good in her role, but IMO it's not worthy of an Oscar. Definitely not for "Lead Role".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is an odd film if you don't know exactly what you are watching before you start. Last year, I watched this movie with my parents, who thought the movie in fact WAS based on a true story, and it was a drama, in the same region as Zodiac. For those that have watched the movie, this is obviously the worst possible way you could watch this movie.Fargo is a comedy in every form, but also a cold (literally) crime tale with a warm centre in the form of Frances McDormand's character, Margie. The main comedy in the movie comes in the questions asked by the viewer: "Why are they doing this like this? Surely there is a better way?" The point is none of these characters really realise how to do the tasks they've been assigned, and fail in the simplest, most embarrassing manner, like watching somebody fall of a bicycle in slow motion. But the more thrilling parts of the movie come when these characters are given the power to capture, harm, or kill.To say anything else would risk spoiling the movie, but know that it is an essential to modern contemporary comedy, in telling a repeated story from a unique perspective.</fullReview>

I like the way the movie moved a long at a certain pace but kept building on the plot and things just kept getting deeper and deeper. Both from the side of the criminals and the side of the law enforcement. I cant say enough about this movie and would like to avoid spoiling it for everybody but I do admit you really need to see it. Some movies don't need a lot of special effects in order to succeed. As we can see in Fargo and more recently in Nebraska.

		<fullReview>The jokes in this movie brilliantly contrast the dark murder scenes. It's a perfect portrayal of a kidnapping gone wrong. Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a struggling car salesman who pays two criminals Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean Lundegaard (Kristen Rudrud), and demand a ransom from her father Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). But when Grimsrud kills a police officer and two witnesses to the crime an angry Showalter his demanding more money from Ludegaard and a higher ransom from Wade. To complicate things for Lundegaard even further, Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is closing in on his crime in a very Columbo style fashion. The movie is both a dark crime thriller and a funny Jerry and George style comedy. It's a great example of what the Coen brothers are great at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just my two cents about the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of the forum posts about this movie (in a board where the public wasn't so greeting) and I saw multiple complaints about the annoying accents, boring story, unnecessary dialogs and so on.I have no clue where does that come from. It seems pretty clear to me that the accent was intentionally exaggerated in a satiric fashion so we get a sense that everyone there is dumb. Therefore I find it fascinating that the female officer whatshername pulled such an extraordinary role in which she shows her wit while being strained by boundaries of her yahs and ohyahs. I really don't understand the negative critics on her ("she acts like she has a stick in her a**). As far as for WH Maceman, I find his looks perfectly suitable for the role (even more than Martin Freeman was who plays a character with an identic personality in the TV show), doesn't he look and act like a real p****? I thought that's exactly what he's intended to do.Also about the dull dialog and story I simply couldn't disagree more. I like that I don't anticipate anything in this movie, interesting action is omnipresent. You can literally enjoy every scene without the eagerness of anticipation for the next one. I really liked that.All in all, I find this movie really intriguing and I rated it with a 10/10 though I don't considerate it as a pure masterpiece but it fascinated me to death so the grade is well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are cinematic geniuses and Fargo demonstrates this genius beautifully. The film blends casual (even mundane) 'Minnesota nice' with the harsh macabre of crime and death. What starts off as a simple crime story slowly adds more layers, becoming increasingly complex as the crime begins to get out of hand. Whilst many films may struggle with such a convoluted storyline, the Coen brothers manage to deal with this in such a beautifully intricate way that prevents the viewer from ever being confused or disinterested but instead the audience can be truly impressed by the Coen's ability to handle such a story and pull it off so beautifully. The success of the film, however, is not entirely thanks to the brothers but credit is also due to the magnificent acting talent. William H Macy and Steve Buscemi both give amazing performances but the true star of the show is Marge Gunderson, played to perfection by Frances McDormand. This film is both great entertainment and beautiful art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coens at their best? Possibly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are in that rare stratum of writers/directors who seem to have formed a genre of their own. (Woody Allen, Hitchcock and Wes Anderson are other examples)The argument over which is their greatest film will never be settled, but Fargo is surely a strong contender. The Coens always manage to create atmospheres that are simultaneously realistic and stylised; rarely comfortable. Here, in the relationship between Marge and Norm Gunderson, there's a rare glimpse of their "cozy" side - and it's wonderfully touching. Outside of that, however, the film is unsettling, occasionally vividly violent, and darkly comic. The gradual disintegration of Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy), as his spineless, cowardly plan unravels, and he flails against the ever-tightening net of his own lies, is a sight to behold, with the Macy playing the part absolutely perfectly - you almost feel sorry for him at first, but your sympathy runs out as the film continues. Meanwhile, Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, one of the most admirable police officers ever seen on screen - this is not a bumbling, dull-witted small-town copper. Nor is she the ace detective with a disastrous home life we see so often. An original, rounded character with depth, a history and a future. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare... well if they've turned in a bad performance between them on film I'm yet to see it. It's a crime drama, a thriller, a dark comedy... but really the best description of Fargo is, It's a Coen Brothers Film. yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was hoping this snowy movie would help on August 1st, since it's too damned hot out and there's probably another 3 months of summer in Glendale, Arizona. Eh, not really.I have only seen this movie once before, I believe in late 1996 or 1997, so it's been awhile. Despite the nearly two decade absence, I'm usually good at remembering movie's specific scenes, plot points and dialogue. Here, I barely remembered 20% of the actions in this. It probably didn't help that I know I got laid that night when I invited my friend over to see this. To my defense, we probably got it on during the viewing.Maybe that was a good thing. It was interesting to revisit this as practically a first time. There's just so much that happens and it made it all seem so real, despite the lie at the beginning of the film that this was a true story. (Extremely loosely based is NOT a "true story" in my book. I could see a horrific traffic accident and decide to write an alien invasion story that involved a car crash. That wouldn't make that a true story. Much like this.)I've never been to Fargo or any of the many towns featured here, let alone Minnesota and though I've heard of "the accent" and key phrases "Don'tcha know" and "Yeeeeeah." I don't think I'd want to visit if this movie was accurate with the dialect. Man, this movie was tough to get through at times with all the Sarah Palin-type slurs. Again, since I've never been to these locations, I cannot verify if any of this is true to the locals. But, dang, if the snow didn't do me in, the talking would.I digress, the acting, tension and incredible script is completely worthwhile here and makes this a recommendation. The fact that it keeps going and going and the less than stellar police keep up with what's happening is probably part of the most unbelievable, but enjoyable parts. Frances McDormand's Marge is a dumbed down Columbo, but William H. Macy's Jerry was the real star here. Have to hate him, especially at his job, but I got more invested in him that the film's award-winning main attraction of McDormand. I think the Coens perfected this movie years later with No Country For Old Men, but they still did a great job with this effort and it's totally recommended.* * *Final thoughts: To give a little background, lazy and unintelligible word usage, namely filler words, irritate the crap out of me. It's unoriginal, unimaginative and worst of all, unnecessary. Thank God for earplugs as definitely need them at my job to attempt to block out all the "Yeeeeeah"s I hear roughly 78 times a day, mostly from one person. Oh, and while we're on this movie, just an FYI, Office Space is much more a "true story" than Fargo was. Apply at a call center, get hired and try to dispute that statement. I'll wait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another jewel from the Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie opens with the words "This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred." I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are "vouched for" by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.The person who unravels the mystery of the crimes is the most unstereotypical of police officers - Marge Gunderson. She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.I've never been to Minnesota, but if the Coens' rendition of that state and its people was as spot-on as their parody of the American southwest in "Raising Arizona", then they have really done their research. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we read the text informing us that Fargo is a true story (which is a lie), we are introduced to the somber music which contains a medieval feel to it, being performed on harp to start, then switching to the use of more strings and drums. This small portion of music is powerful in that it conveys exactly the tone of the movie: we know collectively as an audience that this will be an upsetting story which takes place in a fairly "innocent" location ? Minnesota.Why is this film titled "Fargo," exactly? It is where everything is set into motion. The William H. Macy character (Lundegaard) drives up there to meet the two "villains" of the story who he employs to kidnap his wife so that they may con money from his wife's father. We don't know this right away, however; in fact, the information we're told is only certain bits, so we cannot fathom how simple this rather complex plan really is at first. Making the situation complex for the viewer, however, lets us know that anything can and will go wrong ? and what do you know, it does.While Frances McDormand may be the protagonist of the story, let's talk first about the best talent in this film ? William H Macy. After watching this film, without knowledge of the show "Shameless," I doubt anybody could predict this actor would be a good fit for Frank Gallagher in Shameless ? stubborn as hell, alcoholic, selfish, terrible father, anything but respectable. In Fargo, Macy portrays Lundegaard with perfect execution, a role on the opposite pole of his iconic Frank Gallagher. Lundegaard is a first time criminal, and it shows through the fact that he is an every-day-nice-guy, not very outspoken, and holds in his anger so much that he explodes when he needs to let it out. Macy tackles the overall nervousness of the character so well that he develops perfect mannerisms for the character ? looking down due to shyness frequently, moments of losing control that are just right and not overly dramatic, stuttering, and a stupid smile to retain his innocence despite the horrific plot he carries out, putting his family in danger time and time again. Macy's portrayal is arguably the best performance of the film, yet he lost the best supporting Oscar to none other than Cuba Gooding Jr's role in "Jerry Maguire" that year.Another strong aspect of the film is the character played by Steve Buscemi. Everybody thinks it, and the Coen brothers say it time and time again in their script: Steve Buscemi sure is a "funny-looking fellow." This is brought up at least twice by witnesses in the case ? one prostitute and one bartender, who act as substitutes for the audience, the voyeur, the cinephile who observes and comments, but does not contribute much to the actual story. Buscemi's character is egotistical, funny, filled with rage; he is given authority which he does not deserve as Shep, who put Lundegaard in contact with Buscemi's friend, did not vouch for the Buscemi character. Buscemi is the comic relief to his counter part's scary, more dominating and menacing presence ? he is a giant compared to Buscemi and does not talk unless it has to do with the job they have set out to do. This seems to be one of the only reasons Buscemi has to do practically everything ? he goes alone on the actual "exchange" of the money and Mrs. Lundegaard, leaving only him to have to deal with the near- fatal surprise in store for him. He returns with the money for his partner (though he does not tell him there is much more buried in the middle of nowhere) and he rightfully complains that Gaear did not suffer an injury like him, though his deception is greedy and egotistical. It turns out that Gaear has a greedy nature too, possibly much greedier than Carl (Buscemi) since he thinks a sum of only eighty thousand dollars is involved and his reaction is very extreme.Then we have Frances McDormand, playing Marge Gunderson, the protagonist who does not show up until thirty minutes into the film. If it were not for the presence of this character in the film, this movie would be an extremely depressing story. Marge represents the average Minnesota citizen who finds happiness with the simplicity of family life. She serves the police force as she serves her family ? she is the sole breadwinner for her and her husband Norm, and she is pregnant, yet embarks on this mysterious, dangerous journey to find two murderers in order to put them behind bars. Her short speech to Gaear towards the end of the film is exactly what the film needs ? it is reassurance that we are not alone in this world when we don't understand the evil behind greed which drives people to do the most awful things and strive so far from morality. One final comment is that I love the presence of the character Mike Yanagita in this film. Most people would find this character to simply be a comic relief character, but as my brother pointed out, the fact that he lied about his life and was so convincing about it drives Marge to return to Lundegaard, who appeared to be just as innocent as Mike on the surface. To be honest, I thought this character was simple comic relief on first impression, but this didn't make too much sense to me since it did not drive the story further if that was the case, and I knew the Coen brothers are considered great filmmakers.I very strongly recommend this film to all viewers who are comfortable with watching an R-rated film: it is simply one of the greatest dark comedies/crime dramas ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo (1996): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Harve Presnell: Satire about place and happening starring William H. Macy as a car salesman threatened with bankruptcy. He hires two thugs to kidnap his wife but everything goes wrong. His father-in-law insists on delivering the money and Macy is unable to contact the kidnappers. This all concludes with shock, humour and surprise. Splendid directing by Joel and Ethan Coen who previously made Blood Simple and Barton Fink. Frances McDormand is wonderful as a pregnant police woman investigating the case. She is the one character who lives for right, and her dialogue upon solving the case sums it up with blunt delivery. Macy flawlessly plays a desperate man smitten by guilt. He is clearly terrible at crime and even worse at trying to prevent it. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare play two thugs. Buscemi is talkative and ill tempered but it is his final footage that is memorably shocking. Stormare is more reserved and quiet, which conceals his dangerous tendencies that are defeated by a fragile physical state and strong will of an opposing factor. Harve Presnell plays Macy's father-in-law who adds further complications when he decides to deliver the ransom cash himself. Theme exposes guilt and our ever present urge to hide sin.

		<shortDescription>Combines small town pleasantries with macabre violence, in an absurdly humorous tale of debauchery. Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Independent film makers, the Coen brothers have achieved critical and box-office success with their two-time Oscar award winning film, Fargo. ¬The "homespun murder mystery" is an amalgamation of genres: crime drama, violent thriller, neo-noir, and, satirical comedy. The offbeat narrative juxtaposes small town pleasantries and lightheartedness with macabre violence, in an absurdly humorous tale of debauchery. Critical distance is a key element of ¬Fargo, which is a result of the frequent use of farce in their depictions of "everyday violence in US culture" (Lewis 2002). Through this, an "original social commentary" emerges, amongst the crazy, sardonic, approaches to style and narrative. The cult and spectacle of violence in American society is epitomized in the film, depicted through the thoughtless killings, and most, notably, in the infamous wood chipper scene. The frequent shots of the characters devouring fast food underscores the theme of cheap mass production and the bland consumerist society whilst simultaneously striking a balance between the comfortable, mundane lifestyle of the townsfolk and the bizarre, sinister kidnapping situation. Place functions as a key element in Fargo. The blindingly white winter of North Dakota's Fargo is used "evocatively and satirically", and the folksy dialect of the mid-westerners is exaggerated and distinct. The immaculate, whitewashed setting, and the carefully constructed cinematography acts as a prime vehicle for fostering the outrageous story as it unfolds in perfect chaos. The stylistic device of the 'true story' claim, manipulates audiences into suspending their belief and accepting the film as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A violently funny crime caper is what 'Fargo' might appear to be, but that is really not the essence. The actual protagonist is not introduced until a half hour into the film (something that reminds me of 'Psycho', which did pretty much the opposite). By then, we have met a load of shady characters and mutually uninvolved family members. And things are already way out of hand. It is as if we wake up with Margie to a world of horrors, but her up-and-at-'em demeanor helps us pull through. There is a final moment of utter disbelief that wells up inside her, but the cozy, hopeful finale is nothing short of uplifting.While much of the customs and language of these Minnesota inhabitants may seem funny if you're not from there, but this sort of 'funny' is ultimately in the mind of the beholder. The melancholy soundtrack underlines this, as does the magnificent cinematography, with overwhelming images, such as that little car with Carl and Gaear driving in the distance, under an enormous gray sky, or when Jerry walks back to his car, as possibly seen by Wade and Stan.Some people complain that the Coens' interpretation of the Minnesotans was insulting, probably being Minnesotans themselves? Personally, I don't believe the Coens set out to do that, and that should appear particularly improbable when the final result is such a fine piece of cinema - with a heart. And where are the Coens themselves from, by the way? That's right...10 out of 10, as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brrrrrrr...Cold Hearter Villains in a Cold Hearted Place...Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted this movie did not have all of the kind of stuff I normally gravitate towards. Missing were the car chases, the shootouts and heroes clad in tights and cape. I would have walked away if others had not coaxed me into sitting through this. Am I glad they did. This definitely was not the dud I thought it might have been. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. This potboiler of a murder mystery had me sitting at the edge of my seat from the opening credits. Every scene perfectly introduced...leading the viewer into the next. This is a well crafted story with an outstanding cast. First we have a perfectly shaky and conniving William H. Macy - you just know he is up to no good. Let's face it, this guy has guilty written all over him even when he is completely innocent. And then you've got Marge "You got Arby's all Over Me" Gunderson who just happens to be one clever?(and unintentionally funny) Chief of Police. She is a natural crime solver, with an analytical mind who is bound and determined to get to the bottom of the crime. I know, I know ? it all kind of sounds like a rehash of a rehash of a rehash...it isn't...it gets better. For one thing, "Fargo" is so bitterly cold, nature is naturally more angry than normal. On top of the wind, the cold and the snow...you have these two snakes in the grass...well that would actually be snakes in the snow. These two jewels of humanity (played by Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi (awesome firefighter by the way.)) match the horrible weather conditions. These guys have no respect for life. Sounding good so far? Well just wait. The main star of this movie is probably the wood chipper. It has no lines, no dancing skits or no songs...but it does have a few minutes of fame. If you have not seen the movie yet?just think about wood-chipper and the cool things you can do with it. I won't spoil it and go any farther. What I will say is that I highly recommend this movie ? it is a nail biter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the Coen brothers' best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you don't know, the minimalistly-titled 'Fargo' cemented the Coen brothers' reputation as auteurs of modern cinema. There was something about the film which just simply worked. I've already used the term 'minimalist' once and I can't really think of a better word to use to describe the film.William H Macy plays 'Jerry,' a married man in financial trouble. Feeling he has no way out, he decides to hire a couple of unsavoury characters to stage a kidnapping of his wife. During their first meeting, the two 'hoods' aren't as dumb as they may look and enquire as to why he wishes to 'pay his own ransom.' Jerry's idea is that it will be his rich father in law who will pay and the cash will be split between himself and the 'kidnappers.' What could possibly go wrong? Well... quite a bit, actually. I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film. The film ambles along from one beautifully-bleak winter's setting to the next, as the people go about their (sometimes pretty shady) business.It's fair to say that Fargo is pretty slow moving. Now, sometimes that comes as a drawback, yet here, it just seems to work. Soon a police officer is on both Jerry and the kidnappers' trail, which brings added heat on everyone concerned. And, in my opinion, this is the film's only drawback. Frances McDormand plays 'Marge,' the local sheriff who starts putting two and two together. It was on about the second viewing of Fargo that I realised what I didn't like about her. She was pregnant. Now, my reason for feeling this way is because Fargo is a pretty dark affair ? you won't know who's going to come a cropper at the hands of a madman at any time. However, it's a brave film-maker who dares to harm a pregnant woman. Now, Marge is clearly the only truly 'good' character ? she's smart, kind, clever and likable, but, being pregnant, you kind of know that nothing bad is going to happen to her. This, for me anyway, took away a little bit of tension from the 'chase.' But, that's just a minor gripe. If you like your crime films slow and bleak then you'll be one of the many who've enjoyed this. The Coen brothers have made plenty of good films since (and a few slightly more forgettable ones), but this one is definitely their finest hour. And, I've managed to come to the end of the review without managing to mention Steve Buscemi ? he's in it too. And, as always, he's great ? just in case you needed an extra reason to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical. McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays "Margie" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her. The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, "I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv." She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. "Oooh" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. "That's a good one," says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head. The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes. Marge also has a core of steel. Watch the scene where she gets information from a menacing suspect by reminding him, with almost motherly concern, about all the trouble he has been in with the law, and the fact that he is actually in violation of his parole. She cracks him like an egg without ever loosing her smile. All actors concerned give great performances. Steve Buscemi brings his pitch-perfect snide larceny to the table, playing one of the kidnappers; and Peter Stormare (who once played Hamlet in an Igmar Bergman production) utters perhaps 15 words in a terrifying performance as the other kidnapper. And, of course, William H. Macey couldn't have played it Better. His Jerry Lundegaard is so full of stress and fear, you can't watch him without squirming. I have read where this film has been criticized for making fun of the people of Minnesota, poking fun at their accents and manners. This is not true. The Coen Brothers grew up in Minneapolis, and this is their homage to their own people. The folks in Minnesota may talk funny to the reviewers watching movies in New York and Los Angeles, but this film in no way makes fun of them. At the end of the day, Marge and her husband are happily going to sleep in their bed, in love with one another and content with their shared life. How many other couples portrayed in a Coen Brother's film can make this claim? How anyone can watch Marge Gunderson in action and think the Coen's were making fun of her is beyond me. Like Marge, they are simply enjoying their own intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In anyone else's hands, "Fargo" would be a very ordinary movie. Thank god for the Coen Brothers...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best movies are the ones that not only tell a good story, but make you think about yourself. They can be inspirational stories that make us strive to be better, or cautionary tales to make us more aware of things to look out for in life. Alternatively, they can make us think about who we really are ? this is where "Fargo" comes in. In anyone else's hands, "Fargo" would be a very ordinary movie, telling the story of a series of crimes and a detective who tries to solve them. In the hands of the Coen Brothers, it's a gory and often hilarious look at criminal life in cold Minnesota, and the oddball characters involved in it.The focus for the first third of the film is Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman played superbly by William H. Macy, who is in need of money, and hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that he can take some of the ransom money. He's a brilliantly written character, who gets far too nervous in the tricky situations he's stuck in, and always tries to recover as things don't go his way. As things go wrong for the criminals they are forced to kill a number of witnesses, which gives them even more problems. This brings in the film's main character, pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who is calm and polite in her investigations and fascinating to watch. McDormand manages to steal the show brilliantly, with her awkward facial expressions at times and perfectly placed one-liners at others. It's difficult to see anyone else playing the role.The script of the film is so sharp, but it's rare that the Coen Brothers don't deliver that for us. Why does the film make you think about yourself though? Because of its violence and the way you react to it. When Jerry's wife is being kidnapped, she hides in the shower and then runs along the hall unable to escape from the shower curtain, eventually falling down the stairs. It's brutal, but it's so ridiculous and so well shot that it's also kind of funny. The criminals, especially Buscemi's character, are so idiotic that their mishaps, including Buscemi being shot in the face, also make you laugh. The thing that really makes all of this click is the setting, the wintry town of Fargo, its bizarre residents and particularly the accent. There is one scene where Marge only says "Yah", but does it in such a way that it can't help being funny. They're ridiculous without being too simple, and constantly watchable."Fargo" is a relatively brief movie, at only 98 minutes long, but it uses every second to its advantage in painting this brilliant, funny and bizarre story. It shows all of its actors, and its two directors, at their very best, and doesn't let up for one moment so that you are always willing to go along for the ride.</fullReview>

The story and focus dramatization were developed well; it was able to emphasize the thriller aspect as well as at the same time presenting the quirkiness of the story in the characters. We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story. Macy and McDormand performed their roles well; they managed to keep me interested in seeing what's next for them. While the quirky pair of Buscemi and Stormare can bring a few laughs into the horrific tale told here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a movie with a very well done and likable style that definitely made me think about. With its clever plot and its enjoyable script, Fargo does not disappoint. Set between Fargo, North Dakota and Brainerd, Minnesota, the movie comes off with a very strong sense of a small town. This may be because of the excellent performances delivered by William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and Oscar-winning Frances McDormand. Though the movie is very much so a drama, I found myself grinning at many comical scenes in the movie. The accents are great, Steve Buscemi is a great villain, and William H. Macy is perfect as a man struggling to keep afloat above the debts he owes. The movie is about Jerry Lundegaard, a man facing a mid-life crisis due to the debts that loom over him. To get out of debt, he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife in an effort to trick his father-in-law into paying a ransom for his daughter back. The 80,000 dollars in the ransom would be split between Jerry and the two criminals. But things take a turn for the worse when blood is shed and Jerry makes the unfortunate mistake of trusting criminals. Fargo is clever, unpredictable, and bold so I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hires two bumbling criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and force his hard father-in-law Wade Gustafson to pay the ransom. Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frances McDormand at her Oscar winning finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a great movie but not only that it is also the best movie of 1996, the movie tells the story about a man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) whose inept crime ends up falling apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the tireless police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gundersen (played by Frances McDormand). Based on a true story the movie itself was a true masterpiece of the police movie genre, in which it compares to Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and many more. Director Joel Coen can make a classic out of each and every movie him and his brother Ethan Coen can make together. Frances McDormand gives the best performance of her career in this crime, comedy, thriller, masterpiece. This truly should have won the 1996 Oscar for best picture instead of The English Patient because Fargo required a lot more entertainment than The English Patient did. Also this movie is not only a great movie but it is a Coen brothers classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the greatest film of the 1990's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers' screw with the audience from the get-go with their 1996 Best Picture nominee Fargo, widely considered their finest work amongst a filmography that can be compared to that of any of the greats. Claiming this to be based on a true story when it is in fact anything but, the Coen's cement Fargo's twisted and now highly recognisable quirkiness from the first second, only for us to transported into this strange and oddball world of funny accents, eternal snowfall, wood- chippers and kinda-funny-lookin' criminals. In fact, the movie is not even set in Fargo at all. We glimpse it briefly before moving onto Brainerd, Minnesota, where the tremors of a dangerous arrangement are played out with violence and greed.Car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), in a desperate attempt to make some quick cash to fund a real estate deal, hires two hit men - Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) - to kidnap his wife and split the ransom money paid by her wealthy father Wade (Harve Presnell). With the deal arranged, Jerry makes a final plea to Wade for investment, only for Wade to accept. Jerry tries to call the kidnapping off, but it is too late, and soon enough Carl and Gaear are leaving a trail of murders behind them. With a triple shooting at Brainerd that leaves a state trooper dead, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is called in to investigate the crime spree.What the Coen's, cinematographer Roger Deakins and music scorer Carter Burwell created with Fargo is a film like no other, where a giant statue of a lumberjack carrying an axe looms over the film like some unconventional deity, and the characters are equally as mocked as they are warmly captured. With their small-town ways and strange, chirpy Swedish-American accents, not many of the characters in Fargo seem to notice the darkness that has crept into their town, and seem content with planning fishing trips, shuffling along the buffet table, or discussing the weather. The accent works like a character itself, a portal into these character's lives. You've most likely quoted "you betcha!" or "oh, geez," in homage at some point if you've seen this movie before.Fargo also treads dangerously along the black comedy line, somehow making a man being blended through a wood-chipper hilarious and throwing us off course entirely with Marge's bizarre and uncomfortable catch-up drink with lonely friend-from-school Mike (Steve Park). But the Coen's have always done that, and probably never more successful than with this. The cruelty that the Coen's inflict on the rather loathsome characters seems somehow just, and offer a truly lovable character in Marge, one of the Coen's greatest creations, and wonderfully performed by the Oscar-winning McDormand. This is a masterpiece, a defining moment for Joel and Ethan Coen, who have created a haunting, strange, dark and very funny noir, and possibly the greatest film of the 1990's.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Macy does an outstanding performance as Jerry Lundegaard,if you read the trivia for this movie you will see that Macy fought hard for this role because he felt so strongly that he was the prefect choice for the character,and that is so true as I could not imagine anyone else as Lundegaard.I was so impressed that they managed to develop the characters and make such a detailed story with really no plot holes in the space of only an hour and a half,it didn't seem like enough time for such a complicated story,but the Coen brothers managed it perfectly.Fargo is an absolute classic film that I would recommend to all moviegoers.Based on a true story about a crime gone wrong as a husband pays henchman to kidnap his wife in order to get his own half of the ransom money from his father in law.

		<fullReview>Hands down, an undisputed modern-day classic about Police Chief McDormand unwittingly on the trail of kidnappers for a seemingly unrelated triple-homicide. Macy is terrific as the wannabe-mastermind behind the kidnapping (his own wife, no less, in an attempt to squeeze ransom money out of his wealthy father-in-law Presnell) but quickly becomes in over his head when the scheme gets more and more dangerous for the odd-couple kidnappers Buscemi and Stormare. Lots of great minor characters on both McDormand and Macy's sides of the story. A refreshingly unconventional crime story driven less by the plot and more by the black-comedy, making the movie as equally intense as it is funny without getting too melodramatic.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers consistently give us great cinema. And they give us movies that aren't just good, but memorable. While this film isn't their best, it definitely comes off as disturbing and memorable. Even though the opening credits state that all events in the film actually took place, the entire film's plot is fictional. Which works well in the Coen bros favor. Making us get more invested in characters and events that took place.The Coen bros greatest strength has always come from their script, and this film is no exception. The writing and directing work perfectly together. Even without any huge actors, each of them give good performances, although I don't know about the idea of Midwesterners being this weird. I realize the Coens grew up in Minnesota so they have first hand experience but the accents were kind of overdone, and at times made the characters come off as stupid. With that being said I really enjoyed what Frances McDormand did with her character. She comes off as really the only likable character in the entire movie. And truly deserved the Oscar she received. William H. Macy was good as well but near the end I wanted to punch him in the face.I wonder what the T.V series will be like. If they go the route of remake I don't think it will work, but if you just say it's within the same world the Coen bros created, then I think it works great. I am glad to hear the Coens are at least producing. Maybe have the series take place in Fargo this time? Back to the film, I think it's a re-watchable film because of the dark humor and impeccable writing, even with the sudden violence. I wouldn't put the movie in my top 5 Coen bros movies but it was significant in helping them reach the top of directing and writing in film.7.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coen Brothers have always fascinated me and most recently, their Inside Llewyn Davis was amazing. To be honest, I watched a Bollywood spin-off of this movie first, so the effect was milder at start. But as the plot advanced, I was taken aback by the sheer narrative style &amp; gradual drama.William Macy's character triggers the whole plot which goes awry when a pair of psychopaths fail to remain discrete at the job at hand. The crime involved is ultimate and it doesn't stop till the end of the flick. But the whole show is stolen by Frances McDormand, with an amazing accent &amp; air. Even her psychology comes into the picture. It captures the old country &amp; down-town lifestyle in a perfect capacity, telling a story of a gruesome happening.Great performances, marvelous music and score, fine cinematography &amp; good direction are the main factors why Fargo excels. It employs a mild narration to tell a grave chapter; that life can be so maddeningly terrible at times, in general of course.BOTTOM LINE: A fantastic film. No wonder it is considered best in its genre.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOViolence/Gore: Very Critical | Sex: Strong | Smoking: Mediocre</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think of Fargo as the underdog of cinema; the unassuming, easy-to-miss crime thriller when released that went on to be recognized for its intricate and investing plot, powerhouse displays of acting, and keen regional nuances. The film has now gone on to ? dare I say ? be something of a classic for the mystery genre, producing several quotable lines, memorable setups, and even a TV show, set to debut later this year.Reviewing a classic is always touchy territory for two specific reasons. The first is that many people have already seen, reviewed, analyzed, and formulated an opinion on the film in question and writing a positive review seems like reiterating all the same points people have done for years and preaching to a disinterested choir. The second is that it's a struggle to find something to talk about in said film that hasn't already been talked about many times before, resulting in a review or an analysis that seems to become groggy and repetitive.With Fargo, however, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in where I stand and what I have to say about it. Explaining the film's story in writing or aloud may find a way to muddle itself, but I'll push through to give the basics. The story involves a crooked car salesman named Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who works at a Minneapolis dealership. Pressed for money and fighting desperate times, he negotiates with criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), whom he meets on a trip to Fargo, North Dakota, to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) in exchange for a 1987 Oldsmobile Ciera and $40,000 of the $80,000 ransom. Jerry, in a slick move, plans to inform his wealthy father-in-law and boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presenell) that the ransom the crooks are asking for is $1,000,000 with the intent of pocketing most of the money.This plan soon turns disastrous by circumstances that should not be spoiled. However, when things go awry and people end up dead, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a quirky, Minneapolis cop with a thick accent, gets on the case and is determined to imprison the dirtbags behind these murders. What we get, though, is an exercise in terrific filmmaking in several areas, from acting, pacing, and depictions and the satirizing of a region that do not tread on mean-spirited, simple-minded jabs for humor. At the core of Fargo is a performance by William H. Macy that needs to be seen to be believed; it's a true performance that spawns mixed reactions, as he sometimes portrays a character we can side with, and other times, portrays one we can't help but loathe. Macy's scenes with Buscemi and Stormare are wonderful too, as all the actors bring something to the table: Macy brings his controlled nature that can often be seen as troublesome, Buscemi brings his outrageousness, and Stormare brings his collective mannerisms.The Coen brothers, Joel (the film's director) and Ethan (the film's co-writer and sole credited producer), could've stopped there and had a great film, but they continue on, with a windy, but completely investing storyline predicated off of plot and wild twists and turns. Normally, I criticize films that make too heavy of an emphasize on story and not enough on character. Instead, the Coen brothers make each individual character distinct in someway, be it their mannerisms, what they say, or even how they say it. This is where the attention to detail for the region comes in. Frequently, the Coens make dual note of the typical niceness Midwesterners tend to possess, as well as the moralistic goodness they provide through their often thick and monotone accents.The Coens turn Fargo into a hilariously observant work, complete with great pacing, Roger Deakins' impeccable cinematography that never fails to capture locational beauty, making the Midwestern snow shockingly appealing and lovely, and just the benefits of a great story. It's the kind of film that would make a great introduction for people in other countries who have never seen an American film, rather than the abundance of blockbusters and low-rent sequels, don't you think?Starring: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Frances McDormand, Harve Presnell, and Kristin Rudrüd. Directed by: Joel Coen.</fullReview>

If his father in law just gave him that money we would probably not have the film. I think it was crucial part of the plot.We are witnessing resurgence of this film into 10 hours series. I really think this film deserves to be developed further after all the success he achieved.Since I spent some time in West Michigan, I know the mentality of those northern states of the USA.

		<shortDescription>Would make an odd, grim but surprisingly good Christmas movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is the story of Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) who hires two criminals (Bescemi and Stormare) to kidnap his wife. When blood is spilt, however, things spiral out of control. What is scarcely believable about Fargo is despite its outlandish plot, it is actually a true story.White is the predominant colour and it is initially quite dazzling. It isn't common to see quite so much on the screen. The bitter chill of the air can almost be felt but alongside this is the coziness and reassurance of the interiors. The people are the opposite, warm and fluffy on the outside but all played with an underlying menace, like they could break at any moment. The giant fictional statue of Paul Bunyon epitomises this, it is no doubt meant to be a figure of hard work and community spirit but the camera lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time until it becomes ominous.For all intents and purposes, this is a Coen Brothers re-imagining of a classic film-noir, a "film-blanc" even, both thematically with its humour visually with the ice. The sense of place is very strong, the accents are turned up to eleven, there is a lack of social diversity and the only minorities represented are unstable. The close sense of community gives it a polish of friendliness and safety. The performances are delivered with ham as well so despite the genuinely horrific events, they are by no means as affecting as they could be.Fargo is an odd film. It is gruesome yet friendly, bitterly cold yet somehow warm, horrific yet somehow family friendly. Though it does not quite reach the atmospheric heights of No Country For Old Men or the comedic heights of The Big Lebowski, what is perhaps most interesting about Fargo is that it would make a deliciously sadistic yet surprisingly cuddly and neat Christmas film. Hot chocolates at the ready.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's cool about "Fargo" (and there's plenty here to like) is that the crime-solving police officer is a woman -pregnant, no less- and on one treats her any differently. Marge Gunderson's a great character, and kudos to Frances McDormand for bringing her so vividly to life. But in and of itself, "Fargo is a great crime movie, full of quirk and memorable characters (gotta love the Minnesotan accents), and darkly hilarious from beginning to end. The blinding white snow lends a great atmosphere to the whole thing. And no one involved in the crime is altogether bright, so you know this thing's going to go South in every possible way. Buscemi and Macy both play terrific losers (you just want to wring Macy's neck, he's such a sad sack), and the movie is full of Cieras! A loser car to go with the movie's pack of loser criminals. It all makes for one terrifically entertaining movie. And that image of the socked foot sticking out of the woodchipper is one for the ages. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is well-titled, since the region as a whole, up-front and friendly to an absurd degree, is a major character unto itself, albeit stuffed to the seams with the Coen brothers' infamous wrinkles and eccentric dashes of character. That it all feels so strangely authentic (our auteurs grew up in the area) only makes it even harder to turn away; it's the unimagined point in time and space where Strange Brew meets Reservoir Dogs. Offset by the cordial, affable nature of the general population, this film's frequent forays into spontaneous bloodshed and calculated, if bumbling, barbarism are downright hypnotic. Despite fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare (the most visceral villains, scumbags with neither principals nor reservations) and William H. Macy (the real monster), the floor belongs to Frances McDormand. She thoroughly owns the screen as police chief Marge Gunderson, a pregnant ball of contradiction whose peachy exterior masks a tough, no-nonsense detective's intellect. Dense, rich and pointed, with an impressive appreciation for small details, this is a loaded hundred-minute ride that's most definitely in the argument for the Coens' best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Ode to Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, in a nutshell, is about a lot of nasty things that happen in a deep, dark, slow cold world, and how this sleepy town, locked in time and beauty and its own atmosphere responds to it in its own way. However saying JUST this is sacrilege and I am doing no justice to the masterpiece whatsoever.The key is atmosphere.Take the never-ending cold bleak landscape starkly contrasted with constantly dripping bright red blood. This captures the mood of the film in such eloquence, that little else need be said. Killers, victims, accidents, cops and corpses, all converge on this little known town's highway, and what fate is doled out to everyone is juxtaposed against this brilliant backdrop as a silhouette, almost like the senseless bloodbath and atrocious accidents that occur plus all the deft detective work are means to this end, somehow adding up to the white expanse as an answer. To me, this concept is nothing short of fantastic.And then, the cast. Frances McDormand is undoubtedly the crowning glory of the whole piece as far as characters go, a striking picture that can be conjured up in an instant in memory - contained, affected, with a singsong accent and very pregnant. Everything she goes about is so characteristic - her pace, her actions and the way she emotes is all reminiscent of the cold and sleepy bleakness around her, and makes a sharp impression in the whole experience. In a way, one could say she seamlessly blends into the atmosphere and is like one born of it, furthering it in its own slow grinding way. Also deserving an honourable mention is Steve Buscemi, in a perfect portrayal of an agent fruitlessly battling against the natural order and shape of things - a perfect example of how small irregularities in this ingrown world have a way of ironing themselves out. He plans; he plots but ends up in a wood chipper, while the snow engulfs all.But one of the most effective and mind-blowing aspects of the film is the soundtrack. It is pretty much evident how much background score contributes to the totality of a film, and I have always been a believer in soundtracks that have different versions of a predominant motif which serve as the signature for the film, rather than an eclectic mix of contemporary music. A good soundtrack is something that evokes powerful snapshots from the film when it plays in your mind. For me, the distinctive, haunting bleak bagpipe like slow rendition of the Norweigian folk song "The Lost Sheep", or natively "Den Bortkomne Sauen" is the landscape, the mood, the events - everything. The film artistically keeps returning to the piece in a way that leaves an indelible impression. It is like topping, a summary, everything you wanted to say about Fargo. And boy, how it does hit the final nail in the coffin...The picture in my mind when I hear it is that of the lone car driving away into the vastness of snow on the highway. That's when things are done and resolved, and all is said and understood.~cinecopia.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Mise-en-Scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without "original" being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world "food chain" per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen.The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1.A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results.The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity.Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing. What other film could you sit through a storyline rooted in stupidity besides Fargo?Rating: 10Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing.8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On Marge's pregnancy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in "Fargo," but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in "Fargo", and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Bloody Funny Movie. Sher Is. Yaaaaah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true!The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic.This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota. Yaaaah. That was funny fer sher. Yaaaah.I forgive the Coen brothers. It's actually good that this wasn't really based on a true story. It makes the movie easier to laugh at. (7/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most bittersweet pictures I've seen. Bitter, because I always felt it's a rather bleak and disturbing affair, but rendered sweet thanks to the colorful group of characters and their amusing banter (which is nicely emphasized with all those accents they have there, don'tcha know?). Parts of this film are pretty amusing, but parts of it are pretty sad. The whole affair is a funny-but-sad case.This story is pieced together from a couple of real-life cases, but populated with fictional characters. It's a pretty simple set-up: a man arranges to have his own wife kidnapped, hoping to weasel money from her father in the form of a ransom. What should be a simple and painless situation becomes a total disaster, because nearly every character thinks they know what they're doing and they think they're so hot, but they're all really inept. A series of mishaps and bad decisions causes a cascade of murders and a rather tragic outcome. Well, heck, the final scene is one of the bloodiest and messed-up things conceivable. As crazy and funny as it is to see things deteriorate over stupid mistakes, it is a sobering reflection on crime, greed, and humanity overall. I think the cop sums it up well at the end, for after running through the situation, she asks, "and for what? For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Dontcha know that?" All that being said, I feel the story does take one too many random tangents. A lot of screen time is spent on the cop's personal life, which never really has much relevance to the case. I suppose it's perfect for showing a little more humanity on screen, and to contrast directly with the other guy's family. However, I do believe these extraneous scenes slow down the pacing a lot, and sidetracks from the main story.This film has good, straightforward photography and editing. Acting is effectively perfect from the whole cast, and the writing is good. This production uses very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Carter Burwell's music score is haunting, dramatic, and beautiful all at once.This film has garnered its share of acclaim for darn good reasons. I always believed it could be a tighter film, but it is still well worth seeing for its great cast, its distinctive dialogue (complete with accents), and its ability to instill feelings of amusement and sorrow.Recommended.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crime Drama Done Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers really deliver this time with Fargo, a murder story with quirky overtones and a flawless script that really sells the character interaction in an otherworld reality of sorts. Don't write the acting off for no 'big names', the actors all play their roles to perfection and sell the script with their excellent delivery of at times almost comical lines that still fit in with the dark drama atmosphere which gives it an undeniable creep factor. Stripped down Fargo is still a crime drama but it is one done right. With stellar acting and a script to match it adds a quirky creep to the dark story. Everything fits together in a world unfamiliar yet normal in this homespun murder story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisite example of superior film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a film a film by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. The film is about the a very simple crime going horribly wrong. The film opens with Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, entering into an arrangement with Carl Showalter, played by Steve Buscemi, and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Peter Stormare. The arrangement is for Carl and Gaear to abduct Jerry's wife, Jean, and hold her for ransom. The deal is supposed to involve no violence, and they are told they will get $40,000 in addition to a brand new vehicle. This should be a fairly simple plan, as Jean's father clearly has the means to pay the ransom, but this simple plan goes horribly wrong.This movie, as almost all, has multiple themes. Jerry's problems all develop due to his spinelessness, ineffectiveness, and general inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions. One of the themes of the film is that there are consequences of hiding sin. Jerry has a serious embezzling problem, and frankly it is never explained where he is spending this enormous sum of money. The movie elaborate that he is in immediate need of at least $320,000 due to GMAC discovering money he stole. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he constructs this insane plan to have Carl and Gaear kidnap his wife and hold her hostage to get his father-in-law's money. Jerry is so ineffective that he doesn't even show up on-time for his meeting with Carl and Gaear. Instead of admitting to his father-in-law that he stole $320,000, he tries to arrange a real-estate deal with him. Instead of planning through this business deal properly, his father-in-law assumes Jerry just wants a finder's fee for bringing the deal to him. This is further proof of Jerry's extreme spinelessness and ineptness Jerry is so incompetent that he fails to talk his father out of dropping off the money to the kidnappers. This is a disastrous consequence that results from the fact that he is concealing the theft of the money and his plan to cover up the theft. Jerry's entire plan for the crime was to take $1 million from his father-in-law, and give the kidnappers he hired $80,000. This idea is completely ruined when his father-in-law takes the money to the kidnappers instead of Jerry. Jerry further causes pain by ineptly allowing Wade to go through with this. The consequence of this is that Wade is killed by Carl, and an innocent parking lot attendant. These are direct consequences of Jerry being a bungling fool.The further theme of the film is that sin quickly escalates into greater sin. Carl and Gaear are engaged in the crime of kidnapping Jerry's wife, and they quickly escalate this. The initial choice to take part in this evil activity causes a state trooper to stop them. Gaear then kills the state trooper, but there are witnesses to this that unluckily decided to drive by at the wrong time. Gaear then kills those witnesses. Thus, what starts as a simple non-violent abduction turns into a triple homicide. This is just the beginning of the cycle. The triple homicide creates further despair when Carl kills Wade and the parking lot attendant. This shows the continuing cycle of crime creating more crime. The cycle continues when Gaear kills Jerry's wife and Carl. This cycle of crime creating more crime doesn't stop until Marge, a police officer, confronts Gaear as he is stuffing Carl into a wood chipper. Overall, this film is quite strong. It shows a superior effort went into the film. It is very effective at conveying its message. It is well directed, well edited, and highly effective. On the negative side, I question the point of hiding Jerry's motive for stealing all of this money. Explaining his scheme to steal money from GMAC would also be appreciated. This film is only 98 minutes long, and thus, has more than sufficient time to explain Jerry's motive for stealing this money. I do not see how this helps accomplish the film's ultimate intent. Other than that, I would say it is a very strong film. Overall, I would rate it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Our local car salesman needs cash bad,, but instead of simply asking his father-in-law he decides to hook up with these two well we say bumbling idiots to try and kidnap his wife in hopes that his father in law will pay a very handsome randsom. this movie has so many plot twists and turns , and wow the chipper/shredder scene never ever seen someone get killed that way,, what a horrible way to go if you ask me.. the characters in this movie are memorable, there aren't many movies today that I can get tired watching, I can watch this one over and over and never tire of it.. I guess everything just came together perfectly for this movie,, I've always wanted to go to Minnesotta, Or North Dakota , wherever this was filmed, and I love snow,, so really this picture had everything for me,, i'm a big Steve Buscemi fan and he didn't disappoint whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Crime Drama/Black Comedy and One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Mesmerising Classic Masterpiece Of Cinema From The Coen Brothers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is one of the greatest films ever made,a Classic Masterpiece of cinema that mixes Crime Drama and Black Comedy. Filled with brilliant direction,a great cast,a wonderful script,beautiful photography and an unforgettable haunting score,Fargo is The Coen Brothers and filmmaking at it's best.Set in Minnesota 1987 and Based on a True story,Fargo tells the story of Jerry Lundegaard(William H. Macy),a used car salesman who is now in debt and owes money. Feeling desperate,Jerry hires criminals Carl Showalter(Steve Buscemi)and Gaear Grimsrud(Peter Stormare)to kidnap Jerry's wife Jean Lundegaard(Kristen Ruddrud)for ransom. But when things go wrong and people are killed,Jerry,Carl and Gaear and the killings are being investigated by pregnant cop Marge Gunderson(Francis McDormand)and things become more chaotic and out of control.Fargo is an unforgettable Classic Masterpiece that came out at the right time for The Coen Brothers. After the critical and Box Office failure of their hilarious and underrated big budgeted period Comedy The Hudsucker Proxy,The Coen Brothers decided to return to the low budget roots of their first film Blood Simple and make Fargo an amazing film that was critically acclaimed,won multiple film awards and became one of The Coen Brothers career defining and greatest films. Fargo is one of the reason that cinema and filmmaking is such a great art form because Fargo right from the start gives you a film that will have you glued to the screen with it's themes of greed,death and violence and the themes and film experience for Fargo never loses it's power after the film is over. What also makes Fargo an incredible film is it's great mixture of Crime Drama with Black Comedy mixing serious things like murder and kidnapping and combing it with morbid Humor because The Coens are masters at taking serious things that are not supposed to be funny and making them hilarious. The Black Comedy in this film is very funny,surprising and unexpected whether it's the films characters their dialog or the situations the characters are involved in and the Comedy is original and bleak and you will never look at the Midwest the same way again. The Cinematography by Roger Deakins is beautiful,haunting and effective giving the Midwest and Minessota a great scenery and wide landscape despite all of the truly horrible things going on throughout the film. Deakins amazing and flawless photography also makes the snow and Winter atmosphere just come off the screen and when a character is walking in the snow or the cold you as the viewer feel like you are right there in the snow. Marge Gunderson is a great character and maybe one of the greatest and most interesting and fascinating characters in film history because she's so likable and optimistic and loves her job as a cop. You would figure with her being big and pregnant that Marge would take a vacation off but Marge continues to do her job like it's nothing. What I also love about the Marge character is that the film shows two sides of her in the film her personal life as a wife dealing with pregnancy and loving her husband and her professional life as a cop and her professional life comes into play with this film. When the violence and death happen all around under Marge's nose she cannot understand why all of this violence is happening. Marge's optimism view is an interesting contrast to the Horror,danger and violence happening in throughout the film. Marge is another classic creation from The Coen Brothers. The quotable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen(which won the Oscar for best original screenplay)is outstanding and perfect,with The Coens giving each of the films main characters funny and memorable dialog and using Minnesota language and dialect/accents and words like yeah(or 'Yah')and quotes such as "you betcha" over and over again. Another great screenplay by The Coens. The violence in Fargo is harsh,brutal shocking,disturbing and at times darkly funny and matches the films grim tone and will definitely surprise viewers. The ending of the film sad,disturbing and at the same time hopeful and optimistic especially hopeful for the character Marge. A wonderful ending.The whole cast in the film is brilliant. Francis McDormand earn a Best Actress Oscar for her excellent performance as Marge Gunderson,with McDormand bring optimism,humor and great depth to the role. A great performance. William H. Macy is wonderful as Jerry Lundegaard,a car sales man in debt. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as Carl,a fast talking criminal. Peter Stormare is great and intense as Gaear,Carl's partner that's a man of few words. Harve Presnall is amazing and funny as Wade Gustafson,Jean's Father. Kristin Ruddud(Jean Lundegaard),Larry Brandenburg(Stan Grossman),John Carroll Lynch(Norm Gunderson),Steve Reevis(Shep Proudfoot),Steve Park(Mike Yanagita)and Tony Denman(Scotty Lundegaard)give good performances as well.The Direction by The Coen Brothers is brilliant and masterful,with The Coens always moving the camera with close-ups,zooms,over head and shooting from the snow filled roads from a distance giving the film beautiful visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is amazing,powerful,epic and intense and matches the film's tone and every scene in the film. A mesmerizing score from Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Crime Dramas,Black Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Fargo,a brilliant and flawless Classic Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and deserves to be in any film lover's collection. Highly Recommend. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold, Sterile and Morbid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't know what from the film the Coen brothers claim is true or could be juxtaposed with actual happenings or actual people, but to comprehend that really does not take away from Fargo being a great movie, whether how true or fictitious it is. When a financially troubled car salesman hires and makes a deal with two people to kidnap his wife as a ruse to get his wealthy father-in-law to cough up money, you can already predict that something could go wrong, especially when these two people aren't the most professional.While the movie can be oddly humorous, it really adds a strange dynamic effect when coupled with its winter setting, in that it gives a sense of desolation that is reflected in Jerry Lundegaard's life and really adds a lot more weight to the morbidity that carries on and escalates throughout the beginning of the film to the end. Fargo feels like a very morbid movie to me, but to add in some of the most quirky humor really makes the movie feel very idiosyncratic in that it seems incomparable to other films, with all of its distinct characters and its very strange, cold and sterile atmosphere. While Pulp Fiction does do a good job of combining humor and morbidity, I think I have come to favor Fargo a lot more.What I love about Fargo is how distinct every major character is in the movie. The writing that went into him, coupled with each actor being able to breathe life into their character and giving them their own unique quirks was one of the things that kept me glued to the screen. From the mild mannered behaviors to the Minnesota accents, the characters come off very authentic in presenting a very regional film. If I would have to give a nod to any one performance in the film, it would have to be Frances McDormand. From her mild mannerisms to her unintentional humor, Marge was the foundation of the story and McDormand further accentuated that with her superb acting in that she makes her portrayal feel so authentic to its region, believable and at the utmost, human. To witness all the events in the film and to react the way she did is commendable, to say the least and I think that Marge Gunderson has got to be one of the coolest female characters on film that I have witnessed and I cannot praise the Coen brothers enough for writing such a great non-stereotypical female character.Fargo may be a simple story, but I think that it's simplicity is what I really love about this film. I watched enough films from the Coen brothers to deem them as very unique in their style of telling stories that feels so different from other directors. Fargo basically sealed the deal for me. With its unique characteristics, it feels very surreal in a morbid sense. I have never described a film that way and I think that shows how special this film is. If you want to watch a film that has character, then watch 'Fargo,' because it definitely has a whole bunch of that.</fullReview>

Trust me and the thousands of people who rated it as high as it is. I've watched Fargo a couple of times and each time it fails to bore. The first time you'll watch it you'll be captivated by the story which seams unbelievable yet so credible. But after that you'll get to enjoy that great characters that the Coens managed to create. I'll tell you one thing, Marge (Frances McDormand) is one hell of a woman. The toughest boss of the movie. Plus you'll have plenty of laughs realizing the simplicity of average Joe American (and if you're not a local, their accents).And if you carry out my advise and you have enjoyed this movie(which you will), you should give Blood Simple a try</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Soon at the beginning of the film we see the phrase "based on a true story." After watching it, I made a large network research about the history and I didn't found anything. Only later I realized that it was just the first joke of the movie..... HA.The story is set in 1987 at Fargo, in North Dakota. When Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) a manager of a car dealership, see himself in a delicate financial situation. Then, he plans the kidnapping of his wife Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) and makes an agreement with two marginal. The unnerved Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and the sinister Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), where both would win a new car and half of the $ 80,000 that would be paid by the father of Jean, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell), an arrogant and stubborn rich man. But a series of unforeseen events, it creates just the beginning of a triple murder. And the a pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) tries to solve the case, which continues to cause more deaths.The beginning of the film, there is the certainty that the viewer is facing a drama. What it is, only with black humor from beginning to end, with the Coen style. For some that it is the first time watching from the Coens it may seem really weird, but who is already accustomed with, it may be facing a small masterpiece. It was with this film that the world saw the talent of these two brothers who can write a black comedy based on a drama. Very entertaining and intriguing from the very beginning and a agonizing and exhilarating soundtrack. The strongest point of the film is that not only focuses attention on the line of murders but also with all the characters around her. Leaving them quite fun and relatable, each with fantastic performances.Frances McDormand is superb and fully deserved her Oscar; William H. Macy as well with a superb performance. At the beginning I didn't look like much of his performance, but over the film he manages to deliver a performance worthy of a nomination. But the biggest surprise of the film in the level of performance was truly Peter Stormare with its sinister character. Making a marginal and intriguing look, putting the viewer almost close to a lunatic.A real small masterpiece from the Coens. Very entertaining and intriguing from start to finish with really well written characters, all with hell-of a performances. A superb writing and directing in a movie that is simply fantastic, with a final message really chilling and thrilling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is why I love movies. It is dark, funny, exquisitely scored and features some of the best acting performances I have ever seen. I will not give any spoilers to those who have not been fortunate to catch this classic, but watching the caper unfold and progressively get worse and worse is one of the most arresting experiences I have ever had in cinema. The plot revolves around Jerry Lundergard (Macy) hiring two thugs (Beschemi and Stormare) to kidnap his wife. He plans then to get the ransom from his over-powering father in-law and escape the crushing debt of both financial and emotional proportions. Of course nothing goes as planned and the caper takes deeper and darker turns. If you are a fan of the Coen Brothers I would put this at the top of the list!</fullReview>

It is a typical Coen brothers effort, actually it is one of their best in my opinion. Although it states in the titles that this was a true story I don't believe that it actually was.

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect when I started watching Fargo, but was unprepared for the romping ride it took me on; Only after I watched the movie and found out that its a Coen brothers movie did I go - ahhh... that explains so much.The casting of the movie is near perfect with William H Macy as Jerry, the classic bungler who triggers the tragedy of errors that ensue as he hires a couple of small time crooks to fake kidnap his wife, but really the show belongs to Frances McDormand as Marge - the police chief of a small town in the mid-west. Oh - and yes, the obligatory casting of the ever stellar, Steve Buscemi (really - why is he not in every movie?).Based on true events (edit: just found out that the term is very loosely used here), the movie is set in mid-west, USA and the Coen brothers make full use of this happy occurrence. The residents of a small town have their comfortable routine of shoveling snow - which, going be recent reports, is pretty much all one does in Minnesota - disturbed by a triple homicide by out of town criminals. Disturbed is an over statement as it doesn't bother them enough to even spit out the gum that they've been chewing for a week; Led by the heavily pregnant police chief - Marge. Oh Marge - Luckily this movie was before Christopher Waltz came and was not made by QT else Chris would have been all over the role even it meant being a pregnant man, but I diverge - Luckily, Marge is played by Frances who knocks it out with aplomb. All charm and ma'am but cold steel when required.The Coen brother tradition of characters dying unceremoniously out of turn is celebrated in Fargo as well. See, this is what i like about Tarantino and Coen brothers type of movies - not only are they memorable in whole but even their constituent pieces are individually remarkable. There is a sense of celebration of the art of making cinema; It has an artistic purity. But - I diverge again. Where were we ? Ah yes - The camera work is fresh and the dialogue indulgent with some hilarious extended exchanges conducted only in varying intonations of the word - "Yeah". Even if you haven't spent time in Minnesota, as I strangely have, it is still bloody funny to watch.This then, truly is a delicious concoction - parts Coen brother zaniness, parts Tarantano'ish violent indulgence, on a base of a Guy Ritchie plot of criminal incompetence, completed with superb performances and inspired casting.</fullReview>

The most amazing thing here are the always lovable characters. You're gonna commiserate with those who are lost and find sympathy in those most crooked. They are all well casted, perfectly played and most importantly real. the dialogue is what keeps this movie witty till the end. The little exchange of words between the characters is amazingly written. what starts off as a well thought out plan spins out of control very quickly but it wont catch you off guard. its a movie definitely worth watching for all its traits- writing, directing, characters, dialogue, the cold scenery. its one of those movies that leave you with a feeling of time well spent and art very much enjoyably consumed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, if not entirely but to a large extent relies upon its plot. The screenplay is engaging till the end. The acting is good by all and extraordinary by some are some of those reasons why the film is one of the best. The story of the film which revolves around a kidnapping case which started to take unexpected turns is without any flaw. It is darkly funny at times. The actors have done it very smoothly. The setting, cinematography, and cast everything has been good in the film. The brothers have taken the advantage in the beginning by saying that the story is taken from a real incident, thus making the audience more cautious and interested. The story has a number of twists. Performance by Francis Mcdormand as Margie is one of the exciting parts of the film. Her acting is the major force behind the darkly comic nature of the film.

		<shortDescription>Brilliant But Brutal Crime Noir Set in the Quaint North-Midwest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Coen Brothers offering, one of their best, seems partially about two worlds juxtaposed. The setting is basically the cold and quiet places of the North Midwest. The people here are friendly, congenial, and basically trustworthy, very different from folk in cities in warm-weather climates. Darker urban-crime-like forces infiltrate these quaint and unassuming towns, roads and lakes.The main plot surrounds the hair-brained idea of a down-on-his-luck car salesman-manager in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jerry Lundegaard played very convincingly by William Macy, to have his wife kidnapped. His wife's father is wealthy, and even owns the car dealership where he works. Lundegaard believes his father-in-law will put up $1 million as a ransom. However, Lundegaard will keep most of the money and give only a fraction to the kidnappers, as payment for services rendered.But, as it turns out, the two guys hired by Lundegaard, played with right-on-the-money deadpan by Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi, are inept low-life incompetents who are about as professional at engaging in criminal services-for-higher as a Texan would be at ice fishing. They stop at motels and hire prostitutes without realizing they could be traced if anything goes wrong. Buscemi's character constantly shoots off his mouth, unconcerned that it might draw unneeded attention. And the "silent" mute-like partner, who has less lines than the Terminator, is gun crazy.From the get-go Lundegaard also doesn't have all the cards in the game of life. He's a rather sleazy car salesman, telling potential buyers an out-the-door price on the phone, then tries to gouge them for more money when they come in to buy the car. And he has somehow "loaned" himself car dealership money from erroneous sales. But it doesn't end there.Lundegaard gives the thugs a brand new car from his dealership which will be engaged in the plan, but he forgets to take off the dealer plates, use other license plates, and place tags on the plates. As car sales manager, you'd think he'd know better but Lundegaard is obviously not as quick witted as the thugs he hires. This error turns out to be crucial in determining how events unfold when at a turning point in the film, a local cop stops the thugs in the car because of its faulty tags. Thereafter, nothing goes as planned for Lundegaard, his wife, his father-in-law or the two thugs when Marge Gunderson, a detective from Brainert played by Frances McDormand in an academy-award winning performance, begins investigating the case.Fargo is a kind of urban meets rural noir. Unlike other urban noir by the likes of the Coen Brothers, Quinten Tarantino, and others, the pace of Fargo is more slow moving. We see panned shots of exteriors and interiors with references to the environments where these people reside. Long snow-clad fields, lakes, and trees. Paintings of loons and other wildlife adorn some of the interiors. The people are helpful but low-key, sometimes talking about a coming storm. In this beautiful white landscape, red blood stains the snow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great slice of Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coens reign in their penchant for stylisation in Fargo. The story is told in a pretty straightforward way, they let the characters drive the film. This is a good decision on their part as both the writing and acting are superb, while the pacing is great. It's part comedy, part crime film. And completely successful at both. If I never knew differently I would have easily believed that this was an adaption of an Elmore Leonard novel.There's no doubt that the crime genre brings out the best in the Coens. The labyrinthine plotting and complex character connections of these films allows these guys to display their mastery. In Fargo, a crime does not go to plan and spirals into something else and no one knows what the others are up to. This is extremely similar to the plot framework of the Coens debut Blood Simple. Fargo is in some ways a reworking of elements of that film but with a wider palette. Where it deviates most is in its inclusion of a lot of comedy. But unlike most straight comedies the humour is very funny here. Most of it is derived from the well-constructed characters but perhaps the funniest single moment is a sight gag - Jerry has a solemn talk with his son about keeping quiet about the kidnapping emphasising further what a weasel he is, he then shuts his son's bedroom door to reveal a hilarious poster of 'The Accordion King'. It's such a bizarre and strange poster for a teenage boy to have in his room. It does indicate though that Jerry's son is maybe a little strange.As well as being a crime film, Fargo is also a good example of Americana. There is a real sense of place. The small town Minnesota feel is accentuated by the characters, whose specific accents and habits are depicted in some detail here. It reminded me a lot of Twin Peaks, with its mixture of a serious crime with the goings on of ordinary and eccentric small town Americans. The landscape is important too, with the snowy Midwestern expanses beautifully captured.Like always the Coens somehow get superb performances from their entire cast. The brilliant screenplay helps of course but there is no doubt that the acting is of a very high calibre. Frances McDormand has attracted a lot of deserved praise for her portrayal of a deceptively upbeat pregnant policewoman but this film is full of excellent performances. William H. Macy underpins the story as the pathetic car salesman; it's a terrific performance of a three dimensional character. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as the out of town hoodlums; Buscemi is particularly good, stealing any scene he is in. While Harve Presnell is also excellent as the no nonsense Wade Gustafson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who is convinced that he has a brilliant business plan that will ensure the life of his family, but there is one problem, he needs $ 750,000 that he, of course dosn't have. His wealthy father-in-law has repeatedly refused to help him so Jerry hatches an ingenious plan of kidnapping his own wife, after which he would be richer by $ 960,000 ransom which will be paid by his father-in-law and the kidnappers will get $ 40,000 and a new car that he stole from his own company, while kidnappers (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) are convinced that the total ransom is $ 80.000 and that they are sharing half of profit with Jerry. So, Jerry thought that plan, which includes kidnapping of his wife (which should be done by people unknown to him), car theft in the company he works for, extorting ransom from his father in law, fraud of kidnappers and if all goes according to plan the purchase of a large plot for $ 750.000 dollars and opening a parking is ingenious. But it all went wrong when shortly after making a deal with kidnappers he decided to give up from his plan but could not make a contact with the kidnappers who needed minimum time to turn this easy job into chaos. On the other hand we have Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), who as head of the district police department is investigating murders that lead her to Jerry and kidnappers. Marge is pregnant, sweet, intelligent and capable police officer who represents typical Minnesota resident. This story about easy non-violent crime that has grown into a bloodbath is presented with a large dose of humor, primarily through caricature characters. Even the description Buscemi's character is funny-looking guy. However, the characters are wonderfully characterized and memorable, just like their dialogues, which are often filmed in one shot what was possible only because of the brilliant acting (especially Frances McDormand, who was also awarded an Oscar for this role) and the phenomenal directing of Joel Coen while his brother Ethan took the role of producer. Although it was said at the beginning of the movie that it was filmed on a true story that is not true, but just a marketing trick by the Coen brothers. The truth is that almost all the events in the film took place in Minnesota in second half of 20. century but separated and unrelated. Coens collected few bizarre stories and urban legends and incorporated them in Fargo, which has become one of the best films ever made. Phenomenal photography, soundtrack that is almost perfect for this story, cold and snowy atmosphere that swallows the viewer, memorable characters, powerful dialogues, brilliant directing and superb acting. Simply, every element of this film is excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that can't be duplicated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are extremely good at what they do, and it shows. I've been meaning to watch this all year and finally did, but no matter. I didn't expect the accents to be so strong, the story to be so intricate and the mercy to be so absent. Well, they aren't known for being reluctant when it comes to violence, but geez. Anyways, I can compare this to "Identity" in terms of uniqueness and appeal, and since I don't think either of those movies could be duplicated. William H. Macy is good as a desperate dolt, Steve Buscemi is kind of too crazy for me, but the real star is Frances McDormand. She wore her belly with pride and spoke with such confidence and style that you couldn't help but love her. The shock ending wasn't as much of a shock as I was hoping, but it didn't hurt the movie at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two iconic shots toward the end of Fargo, both featuring Peter Stormare's character, the reticent, cold-blooded criminal-for-hire, Grimsrud. The first finds him reacting shockingly to the revelation on a daytime soap opera he's watching that one of the characters is pregnant. The second discovers him, as does the film's very pregnant heroine, Officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), forcing the leg of his newly deceased accomplice, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi), through a wood chipper. Both shots are emblematic of the film's continual interweaving of the humorous with the macabre, and both reveal how the black comedy of Fargo, which is as oddly frightening as it is gut-bustingly funny, is achieved. Grimsrud's intent reaction to the soap opera revelation occurs right next to the carelessly discarded, motionless body of his kidnapping victim, Jean Lundegaard, and right before Showalter bursts in with a bullet-torn face. Jean Lundegaard's likely murder and Carl Showalter's facial wound have both resulted from a botched scheme engineered by Jean's hapless husband, Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry, who looks and speaks like a leprechaun, possesses the qualities of a leprechaun's evil twin; he is as unlucky as he is selfish and stupid. But he has the air of middle-class decency about him; earlier, he joins his wife in earnestly scolding their son for using foul language. Apart from a minor plot (he intends it to be a "no-rough-stuff type deal") to kidnap his wife and collect the ransom from his father-in-law, Jerry appears to be the workingman head of a warm, happy household: close, comfy, and cozy?much like the tube sock that still quirkily adorns Carl Showalter's foot, as the rest of his leg grinds its way down into the bloody, snowy abyss beneath the wood chipper. The disturbing violence in Fargo draws additional unsettlement because it disturbs representative objects and scenes of domesticity: soft, comfortable clothes, a routine traffic stop, a suburban parking garage, a housewife knitting while she watches a daytime talk show, and the most representative symbol of domesticity: a proclamation of pregnancy on a daytime soap opera. Like the slightly sub-standard American English dialect spoken by most of its characters and its slightly sub-classical Carter Burwell score, the Coen brothers' slightly off-center crime dramedy works beautifully; Fargo makes us laugh uncomfortably and cringe, as extraordinary crimes infringe on ordinariness. We cringe, but we don't look away; this film is extremely entertaining and, therefore, extremely, though disturbingly, watch-able (and re-watch-able).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fargo" (1996) starring Frances McDormand shows megalomaniac business types and wonderful white-out snow scenes rarely seen in movies.The Coen brothers did a great job in introducing movie viewers to a behind the scenes portrait of a ruthless, big business owner megalomaniac (Minneapolis, Minnesota large car dealership owner "Wade Gustafson" played well by Harve Presnell) whose ruthless and brutal treatment of his son-in-law and his own daughter explain the background causes of the entire story the movie presents.The Coen brothers also present megalomaniac business and gangster leaders (not much difference ever, it seems) in other movies of fame they did, including "Raising Arizona" (1987) which shows retail furniture store chain millionaire "Nathan Arizona" (portrayed by Trey Wilson), and also "Miller's Crossing" (1990) which shows "Leo, the Irish gangster political boss" played well by Albert Finney.In "Fargo" (1996), we meet Minneapolis millionaire automobile dealership owner "Wade Gustafson" played by Harve Presnell (famous as a leading man Broadway stage and movie musical solo vocalist with a full head of dark hair in his youth not seen in "Fargo" where he is bald and no longer young.)The "Wade Gustafson" car dealership owner keeps his son-in-law who works as head salesman in the car dealership on a very short leash, and humiliates him constantly and openly.The son in law (played by William H. Macy) reacts by concocting a foolish plan to take money his rich father-in-law won't part with, and using brutal criminals to help in his (the son-in-law's) scheme.It's a sad story, but "what goes around comes around" in an odd, ironic way. Both the father (Wade Gustafson played by Harve Presnell) and his married daughter end up dead by the end of the movie when things go wrong, and the son-in-law's goofy kidnapping/ ransom plan doesn't work.This movie shows great snow scenes almost never seen in the movies.Wintertime Minnesota and white-out road conditions are presented, and the photography is breathtaking.The mid-west/ Great Plains USA northern states in cold, winter, snowy weather is hard to photograph, and Hollywood film makers almost never try."Fargo" (1996) is a happy exception.The movie shows the life, environment during winter months, and local culture and typical personalities of "little guy" people in Minnesota where retail store and restaurant diner cashiers reply with the stock phrase "Thanksa bunch!" along with other cheery, chirpy one or two word greetings."Minnesota nice"..........you have to see this movie to get one of the few portraits of it available anywhere in movies.The opening and closing shots (well, almost the closing shot...the absolutely final scene shows protagonist "Marge Gunderston," played by Frances McDormand, having quality time with her husband) of the movie show trucks and cars during nighttime snow conditions plowing carefully and slowly through the dark Minnesota night, all presented with movie music composer Carter Burwell's wonderful orchestrated dirge theme music.....epic and almost Wagnarian.---------- Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG Actor.Email Tex at TexAllen@Rocketmail.Com Visit WWW.IMDb.Me/TexAllen for movie credits and biography details.See "David R.

		<fullReview>I totally agree with the critic James Berardinelli, especially when he says in the conclusion: "The absence of viable characters limits any dramatic impact, making this more of a laid back, lightly entertaining experience than a fully immersive one." This more or less sums it up.Otherwise a very good depiction of "inside America", its contradictions and the simplicity of it's people (the police interview with the two hookers is memorable). A good film, excellent story (reality always beats fiction, it is amazing what can happen in real life), but the simplistic, one-sided characters depicted diminish the overall effect of the picture.</fullReview>

If you are interested to watch high action and pace you will be disappointed. This movie draws a calmly and different style (No speedy and close action sequences)Watch it peaceful mind you will enjoy very well.</fullReview>

Jerry hires two offbeat criminals to kidnap his wife in order to receive ransom money from his wealthy father in law. The trio plan on splitting the $1,000,000 they demand, and in return, Jerry's wife would be returned safely. However, when a police officer (Frances McDormand), begins to uncover a trail from the two assailants, the plan begins to unravel.

		<shortDescription>"Funny-lookin'"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1990s the younger generation of independent filmmakers gained their prestige with some odd movies, movies that were both grim and noir-ish but with an almost nonchalant twist of comedy running through all the nastiness. This was the kind of picture in which the Brothers Coen specialised. Fargo is among their purest expressions of that type, a grisly thriller set in a snowbound Minnesota that, despite its inherent darkness, comes across as humane and affectionate.While the New Wave-influenced directors showed off an abundance of technique, the Coens and their generation have tended more towards minimalism. There's an elegant simplicity to their approach, with few camera moves or obvious artifice. That's not to say the Coens were directing on autopilot. The camera may not move but there's a lot of thought gone into those static shots. We see a beleaguered William H. Macy at his desk while cars rushing by on the freeway behind him seem to mirror his nervous jitters. In the opposing shot of the indignant couple, the array of statuettes makes it look as if the whole room's ganging up on him. It's a kind of meaningful shot composition that is actually rather witty. This triumph of the image over technicality allows the Coens to really bring out some detail. Many filmmakers may attach a camera to the front of a car for a bit of high-speed action, but in Fargo we have such a shot pointing down at the road surface in the headlights, picking out every little crack and grain. The Coens have really painted a world with palpable texture.But just as character seems to live in the very landscape of Fargo, it also lives in the actual characters, brought to vividness by a cast that's at just the right level of quirky. What's neat about Frances McDormand is that she is comical without actually doing a comedy performance. Other than a slightly strained accent, its all done in very genuine timings and expressions, which stops it slipping into farce and weaves it well with the movie's more unpleasant moments. William H. Macy is full of twitches and mannerisms, but he just manages to pull it inside the realms of believability. And Steve Buscemi too is straddling that delicate line on the edge of reality. In short, the people that inhabit the world of Fargo give us this impression of normality stretched to its limits, but normality all the same.Unlike your average thriller, Fargo is not exactly a tightly-constructed ride of suspense and excitement, but this doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and engrossing. Rather than seeming to have some grand theme or focused structure, it's as if the screenplay just grew organically out of a number of elements. Like many works by the Brothers Coen, Fargo is rich with the weirdness of America, with ominous statues of local heroes and checkout girls grinning vacantly like a taxi driver from Total Recall. Brilliantly offset by a doom-laden and very Nordic score from Carter Burwell as well as a sprinkling of familiar American hits, it scampers smoothly from one mood to the next. This isn't a big movie by any stretch, but it in its constant, delightful diversity, it seems to be part of some large and tangible world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of a scam gone wrong, because of the incompetence of its protagonists. This film is about its characters inability of people to communicate and humanity's greatest vice, a constant desire for more money. A great shot in this film was the extended close-up of her melancholic face after discovering the extent of Mike's lies. This is also when she becomes disillusioned with people, and this only increases as she comes to a face to face later in the movie. This movie is also about more than just people and humanity, its also about violence and how far would someone go for money. The value of life is strongly seen in this movie. The cutting style in this movie is definitely one to be remembered at its tranquility and detailed way of placing these pieces together just right in the film.</fullReview>

Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place.</fullReview>

As a pregnant women and having to carry a life in you, but see it being taken away right before your eyes is the most powerful part of the movie. I could go on and on about how making the character of Marge pregnant is what made this such a powerful crime film, but it's really so obvious.Pregnant and all, Marge is still a relatable character to anyone. Another great part of this film was the ascents. Each person did it so well. It's sad that things such as the crime with the Ludengaard's happen for whatever reason commonly. It always ends tragically. Money is the root of all stress, but should not lead to such disastrous things especially betraying someone you at some point considered family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a beautiful piece of art. Though it shows Minnesota threw a New York eye, it shows a funny piece of self being. The film has wonderful acting by William H. Macy, Frances Mcdormand,and especially the hysterical Steve Buschemi. The film was filmed on a budget of a mere 7 Million Dollars only 13 years ago. It has a few known stars and was filmed almost all in Minnesota and North Dakota except for a few scenes in a set. The film is a short flick, 99 Minutes. But in that time changed Hollywood's perspective of film. Just for a note, the humor I say is mostly comedy drama, because only a few murders happen, but when they are really funny. The filming is beautiful, from a scene in a bar, to a scene in the middle of a field. For 7000K, that's pretty good. Yes this film is better then Avatar or any film in that concept. The acting is brilliant, the story hilarious and superb, and the setting and area is excellent.Story- 10Cinematography- 10Acting- 9.9Budget- 1010/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Joel and Francis Coen, Fargo was released in 1996. Set in Fargo, North Dakota, it star William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard. Jerry arranges to have his wife kidnapped so his father-in-law will pay the ransom. This is definitely not my type of movie, but it was well done. There were some graphic bloody scenes that are stomach churning. The acting by Macy, Frances McDormand as the police officer and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare were very well done. The setting of the movie is a perfect setting for the cold-blooded killings that happened. The movie has what I would call expected gore. For example, as McDormand was creeping up in the woods behind the house and heard the wood chipper going, I wasn't surprised to see the foot sticking out of the chipper (though incredibly gross by the thought of it!). I really enjoy Steve Buscemi and how he added a bit of sarcastic humor, even though he is a criminal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Coen brothers experience and I love it. The film begins with a screen with writing on it and it says that this film is base on a true story but to find out it's not. After seeing you would believe it. The film delivers a lot a verisimilitude and does it well. I appreciated the editing techniques used. When some scene changed the screen turns to black and for a few second stays black. My favorite technique was when Carl (Steve Buscemi) is beating the TV trying to make it work. Then the camera zooms in and the TV is working properly but when the camera zooms out, its present in the room of Maggie and her husband. I really got I kick out of the cops in the film. The way Maggie and Lou interact when investigation the first murder scenes with the cop and the witnesses is comical. They take a serious situation and make it kind of funny. The film is full of comedic relief. I like that aspect of the film; it was dark and funny at the same time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen one other Coen Brothers film but after seeing it I am definitely intrigued and am going to see many more. The combination of comedy and crime was just perfect in this film, the directors balanced the comedy, violence and suspense very well. The movie was not predictable so while I had some idea of what might be coming up next, I was completely sure and it kept me entertained for the duration of the film. The acting done by the whole cast was great each character was extraordinarily normal. The each had their own oddities but also seemed like people that you might run into in your own town. This aided in the comedy relief which was necessary at certain point especially during the wood chipper scene. while it was quite alarming there was one moment that changed the whole scene. Frances McDormand's character is yelling to the man stuffing the body into the wood chipper and when he does look up she point to her hat with expression of shock that the man could be so dumb as to continue after he had noticed her. The camera work also captured my attention. The shots that panned across the desolate landscapes really gave me the feeling of being there. The sudden zooming on character's faces during pivotal scenes sucked me right into the movie and allowed to me to feel what they were feeling. I did not expect too much from this film at first but it really surprised me, I thought it was very well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the first Coen brother film I had seen and now want to see more. They did a great job verisimilitude or making everything seem real. When the bar owner shoveling his drive way has the conversation with the cop, I could have swore that neither of them were actors and there just happened to be a camera there. The film has a very simple vibe where nothing dramatic ever happens that often yet when it does happen it makes it that more dramatic which may sound silly and obvious but if you watch the film you'll get what I'm saying. The film has the wonderful mid-west vibe to it which the over exacerbated accents really add too. It adds this great humor to the film which really helps you get through all the slower more informative parts of the film. Not only that but the story it self is all over the place leaving you thinking there no way this simple pregnant women can solve this murder. Yet when it all come together for her you get to really see how she just slowly but surely figure out every little detail to the case. Then they add mystery too it because they never even address the money once the only character who knew it was there died. Great acting, great plot, great story and all the other things I address's add up to make this one of my all time favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing...I have seen it multiple times and it never gets old. Although the movie may seem slow paced at first the fact that it's so over dramatic and funny makes up for the pace and I think the pace adds to the movie because it is set in the midwest and that's just how people do stuff there...they take their time, they are in no rush. The over top accents are a defining feature of this film. It's remarkable that the actors were able to learn them and do them so well they really add to the film. The cast in this movie are really phenomenal and they really play their parts and make the movie work. Also, the Coen Brother's really made this movie great they always do a good job with coming up with ideas that have never been done in movies and make it there own. They are great director's and this is one of my favorite films they have made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anybody familiar with this directing duo, this movie needs no introduction. Many consider Fargo to be the Coen brother's finest work, and I heartily concur.Even though the movie is entitled Fargo, the entire movie is set in Minnesota, making full use of the goofy Minnesota-slang, adding to the dark comedy. Dialogue is what makes Coen brothers movies so special, so authentic, and this movie is no different.There's the frankness of the police officer "He was funny looking / In a general way," or the clever use of punny double talk. "Oh I think my lunch just came up. No, it's just morning sickness," as Maggie Gunderson (played so eloquently by Frances McDormand) says after examining a dead corpse with a bullet in her head. But overall, it's the pace and in-depth nature and believability of the world that draws you in and rewards multiple viewings; being able to catch subtle character nuances on subsequent screenings is very fun, especially with Coen Bros. movies.And last but not least, this movie contains two actor-defining roles, as to my mind Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and William H. Macy (Jerry Lundegaard) have never done finer work than they did whilst filming Fargo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a dark comedy that was directed by the Coen Brothers. This movie is basically about one harmless event that Jerry Lundegaard plans out to get money. He wants his wife kidnapped by two guys because hes to afraid to ask his father in law. Jerry's little idea to get money ends up becoming bigger then he could imagine. Innocent individuals end up getting killed along the way in this small town of Minnesota. In the end Jerry loses everything that was important to him just to get some money. This movie shows the audience that people will think of any ways to get money even though he never meant for anyone to get hurt. I thought this movie was an okay movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Fargo from 1996 is a thriller directed by the Coen Brothers. This is not a typical thriller, more a dark comedy, one based on the twisted truths of what one man was ultimately capable of. Jerry's unimaginable decisions when he found himself stuck in a bind illustrate the twisted extremes a human can go to in pursuit of money. Jerry is the executive manager of one his father-in-laws car dealerships. Although his wife comes from a very wealthy family, Jerry does not have the close relationship; one he would need to be able to ask his in-laws for money. When he falls behind on his bills he comes up with the genius idea to have his wife kidnapped so he can cash in on the ransom money. He thinks his plan is fool proof, but it ends up hiring two dangerous men, more dangerous then he could ever imagine. His meeting with Carl and his eerily quiet friend end in multiple homicides, including a state trooper, Jerry's wife, his father-in law and even Carl. Margie, the chief officer involved in the investigating the kidnapping and the other homicides is seven month pregnant. Margie is a simple lady from a small town and she is very good at what she does. Margie suspects Jerry has something to do with his wife's disappearance almost immediately. His nervous twitchy demeanor catches her attention. Fargo is a seemingly slow paced film and builds without the need for dramatic music or the typical serial killer, but is still able to make you jump or squirm. The Coen brothers are brilliant in the way weave different horrible true stories into one amazing film. They show the intensity that a person can feel when they feel trapped in a corner with no way to go. Margie follows the clues and ties together seemingly unrelated events that all tie together in the end. One seemingly controlled act spiraled out of control leaving Jerry with noting in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers go along way to catch the essence of what life is like in a town without much crime or power. The acting is flawless with Frances Mcdormand leading the way as a pregnant police chief who is smart enough to see that something out of the ordinary is happening in the country parts of Minnesota. The whole way that the Coen's had Mcdormand and her partner access the murders and go about finding out more about it is absolutely hysterical. I am from Minnesota and many of the characters sounded a lot like the cousins and grandparents I have in the country in Minnesota. The "you betchas" and other lines are key to the realism of the film. I truly appreciate the most important part of the film though. The versimilitude and the ability of the Coen Brothers to go to extreme lengths just to show you, that in life in order to be happy and satisfied sometimes you just have to be grateful for what you have. That is why the downfall of the car salesman played by William H. Macy is so disturbing because all he had to do was ask for help and be grateful for the family that was left for him at home. The atmosphere and the depth of shots to show you the wilderness of Minnesota is breathtaking and at times you can almost feel the breeze of the cold Minnesota winter as the movie carries from scene to scene. Overall, this was one hell of a Coen Brothers film and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dark American comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fargo' is a refreshing film. The audience is thrust into this spoof of a crime movie, full of goofy accents and eccentric characters?which are oddly spot on to people in real life when you think about it.These Midwesterners are not all apple pie. They are sinister and complex. The people of small-town Bainerd, Minnesota treat the triple homicide (and growing) nonchalantly. In fact, there are really no hysterics that are expected to accompany a murder spree anywhere in this movie.The movie makes you question your reaction to things. You laugh during violence and gore and you almost feel guilty for your unusual and 'immoral' reaction. The movie has a quiet beginning, a loud body, and a quiet ending. 'Fargo' is truly an enigma and a fantastic movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first time in weeks, I saw a movie I knew nearly nothing about going into. All I knew was the incredible praise for this picture, and literally nothing more. Except for the wood chipper scene.The story starts off simply enough. A man requiring a somewhat humbling amount of money for a business investment hires two goons to kidnap his wife and split the ransom with him, due to the fact that his wife's father is overprotective and very wealthy.Well, they do kidnap her, but due to not putting their plates on their car, supplied to him by the man that hired them, they get pulled over, and the venture turns murderous. This puts a pregnant cop, played by Frances Mcdormand, on the case of these murderers.I refuse to reveal any more, as I am afraid I have already revealed too much. The movie is outstanding and consistently intelligent, setting up very complex conflicts that are not directly explained to the audience. We have to actively understand what is happening to appreciate why some of the characters are so distressed.This is a thriller at its purest, maybe the best of the Coens' works. Some have labeled it a black comedy, but I don't find too much amusing about this very dark, but very brilliant tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers, who are the directors and writers of Fargo did a swell of a job! Both of the Coen Brothers Joel and Ethan were the directors of this film, even though it wasn't credited that way.The film itself was nicely paced and smooth flowing, making the writing of the script good. I had the opinion though that there were some extra scenes that did not really have any part to the main bases story line. The way the script was plotted it always had you wondering what would happen next in the line of bad happenings.The camera angles, setting, and lighting had all to do with making Fargo even better. With 180 degree shots, panning, zooming, really caught the settle moments that really triggered emotions. The film was shot in Minnesota, during the winter time, giving all the scenes a low key lighting, or natural light.Every little thing about this film was unique, confirming it to be a classic film, and memorable for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fargo" feels, smells, like real life. Only more interesting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is a clear example of how cinema may sometimes be too good for real life.During it's running time, we get real-life experiences that deal with family, ambition, mental weakness, tragedy, romance, and even comedy."Fargo" is an interesting mix of the fore-mentioned emotions and through a clever plot, excellent acting, real life mannerisms, and brutality we get one of the most complete movies ever made.The acting is sui generis, solid. Frances McDormand's role should be praised by the people around North Dakota because of the accent, the typical words, and more. Still, if you are not familiar with the region like me, you can still recognize the tremendous job by her. She's credible and delivers performs perfectly many emotions. William H. Macy steals the show and you end up feeling pity for him. Excellent! Steven Buscemi is always a treat to watch. I enjoyed his psycho performance. Peter Stormare is scary alone and should be considered as one of the most feared cold blooded killers from the 90's.The settings are claustrophobic even if we talk about a highway! You can feel the tension and fear when the psychotic duo kill the cop."Fargo" is a roller-coaster of emotions. It will scare you at some points, make you feel uncomfortable, sad, angry, preoccupied, etc.The merit about it is keeping a real life like vibe during it's running time and throwing some typical expressions from the region. After all, the movie is about a female cop investigating a murder. But thanks to a solid script the movie deals with more thematics that derive from a thing that went wrong.Fantastic movie.</fullReview>

Both movies deal with the results when average people get mixed up with unfathomable evil and violence. And all for just a bit of money. The Coen Brothers have created a movie that's strong from beginning to end. I really can't think of a single thing about the movie that I would change. I loved the ending. The music was top notch. The setting was perfection from the accents to the scenery. Every actor fit their role like a glove (Marge has to be one of my favorite characters in a movie, ever). There was just the right balance between the light and dark elements of the film. I absolutely loved it all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a dark crime drama. There is some subtle Coen Brothers humor mixed in, but ultimately it's a story about bad people doing a bad thing, and a good cop investigating it. The Coens' masterful direction somehow seems to convey two perspectives at once, as you can clearly see the action through Jerry's (William H. Macy) eyes, but you can also see it through Marge's (Frances McDormand) eyes: two very different viewpoints.The Minnesota culture in this film adds a lot of charm, and Frances McDormand was wonderful in it. Still, I found it hard to sit through the gruesome violence and the generally evil attitudes of the criminals depicted. But after it was over, I thought about it for days, relating to the various characters in my mind, especially Margie (Frances McDormand).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had watched "No country for old men" quite some time ago. There are these similarities between the two movies. Both have a cold blooded killer, both are set in vast unpopulated lands where crime can really go unnoticed. Both are from the same house of direction, of course.10 stars for Frances McDormand. Her acting was confident and yet nervous as would be in her character's situation. Both her and Macy's acting was animated to an extent - his because there were secrets he wouldn't reveal, hers because it was her way of getting information by identifying with people. Both of them acted well.The fact that FM actually commented about being a character actress more than a movie star earns her my respect. I will remember her at least for that quote and this role.The two accomplices also acted well and gelled into their characters.Overall, this was a much above average movie with great direction and a good story.</fullReview>

Buscemi and Stormare are hilarious as the kidnappers with opposite personalities. Macy is perfectly cast as the schmuck who hires the kidnappers.

		<shortDescription>Not for the dim witted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of Coen brothers movie making is the lack of exposition - i.e. characters overtly explaining their motivation, intent and even their obvious activity to the typical dim witted moviegoer. Thus the commentaries such as "lack of plot" or "was it a comedy or a drama -or what?" or "I don't get it" are common.The best movies ever made have little or no exposition - the viewer must interpret what they are seeing. Most movies categorized as "comedy", "drama", "love story" etc... are typically not quality films or they could not be categorized so readily.Comparing this to Raising Arizona is shameful. Both are excellent - but very different. Most who say the enjoyed Raising Arizona but couldn;t "get" Fargo probably didn't "get" Raising Arizona either. But there was enough slapstick like comedy and explosions to entertain them.Not every scene in a movie must move the plot forward. The Coen brothers often utilize seemingly irrelevant scenes (Margie and Mike having lunch, Carl and the hooker at a night club) in their films. These scenes add a sense of reality to the film, real people do not live one track lives but rather have multiple things going on at once.I loved this film!</fullReview>

The humor is in the way the talk comes across like Margie interviewing the two hookers, the cop who was called out by the guy shoveling the snow and the dialog between Carl and the iceman badguy. The few who stand out are Margie and Jerry. Now Jerry(William H. Macy,)is sometimes not convincing (very superficial) in some of the Ransom scenes with his father-in-law but he is a great actor.The humor conceals some of the brutal (supposedly real story that happeneed in Minnesota in 1997)enactments of what happened. The movie is riveting as all good movies are. Even the last few scenes where this petite and pregnant Sheriff has this monster behind barbed wires, are funny and then normnan and Margie cozy up- when he says for the final time "I love you Margie" it does't sound so mechanical as Norman had said few times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to say exactly why... but this movie is FANTASTIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is not a straight up thriller. Nor is it a straight up comedy. It is not a drama, a romance, an action flick, or a story of redemption. What makes it so difficult to gauge is that it does not slip easily into one film genre or another. Perhaps that is why I see more threads about Fargo devoted to why this movie rocks or why it sucks than to any other movie. Some people go into it expecting a comedy and are disappointed. Others go in expecting a riveting thriller and also exit displeased. Those who go into this film simply expecting a great movie, however, will leave having watched one of the greatest pieces of art offered in the 1990's.I generally (but not always) agree with Roger Ebert's reviews and never more so than with his recap of the Coen Brothers' first true masterpiece, Fargo. He says that the movie covered a variety of genres before ultimately emerging as one of the greatest films he'd ever seen. I would have to agree. After being encouraged by a friend to see this movie, I saw it not knowing exactly what to expect. I laughed, I was tense, I sat on the edge of my seat, and I finally ended up rooted to my seat, stunned, as the closing credits rolled. I have not seen The English Patient, the Best Picture winner of 1996, but I doubt it came close to Fargo in cinematic greatness. Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me unlikely that any film of 1996 could have been more original and astounding than Fargo was.The driving force behind this film is the script. It is at once funny and haunting, set up by a proclamation that the story is "based on true events" (not true). As these words appear at the start of the film, followed by the opening scene, you can already see that Fargo is not your run-of-the-mill flick; it is unique. The script is full of twists and turns; I will not spoil them here but suffice to say that a cop pulling over two attempted kidnappers turns a somewhat strange situation into absolute bedlam.The "somewhat strange situation" is that Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy in an Oscar nominated role) has paid to have his wife kidnapped by two lumbering criminals (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi in his best role to date) in order to garner a large ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. Of course, this ludicrous plan goes horribly awry, and the policeman scene mentioned earlier sets off a chain of events that leads to numerous killings. Eventually, the heroine, Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand in an Oscar winning role), arrives on the scene to deduce what has happened.Fargo never lets up for a second. It draws you in from the first scene and yanks you from side to side during its 98 minute running time. The dialogue is pitch perfect, as the Coen Brothers capture their native North Dakotan dialect to a tee, and the script flows seamlessly from one scene to the next. The movie is entertaining from the start but really hits its stride when Marge enters the scene. Three great actors- McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi- are all truly at the top of their form in this film.Fargo is unlike any movie around. It is a comedy, but it is also a thriller. It is an action movie, but it is also a slow-paced, methodical movie. It rolls a bunch of genres into one. If you asked ten people to describe the movie in one word, you'd almost certainly get ten different responses. Actually, maybe that's not true. They may simply respond with the word "Fantastic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To collect money for an investment, Jerry (Macy) sets a fake operation up for the kidnap of his wife, but it doesn't go according to plan.The Coen brothers have made a name for themselves over the past twenty years and this 1996 film, written and directed by the pair cements them into the highest class of different and brilliant filmmakers.The unusual plot opens with "This is based on a true story" when in fact it isn't, which will set the tone for a bizarre but highly intriguing viewing, made even more strange as the plot unfolds and the direction and cinematography are established.This whole ideology of kidnapping gives the Coen brothers a great chance to dive deep into their unknowing way of thinking, and is expressed through some wonderful artistic direction to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.The opening scene with the police cars driving towards the camera coming straight out of the mesmerizing mist is breathtaking and the different use of shots and a diverse approach to tell the tale will always surprise you in a consistent and exciting narrative.Macy (Magnolia) gives an Oscar nominated performance as Jerry Lundegaard a man who wants to succeed and his belief is in two criminals who he agrees to divide his earnings with, once they have successfully kidnapped his wife. Macy's portrayal of the nervous and unlawful man makes something out of the plot, and with his personal issues, do we see a real man with real problems and a real life situation in our hands, with some perfect realism with a consistent use of colloquial language to add consistency.Frances McDormand (Mississippi Burning) delivers an Oscar winning act as Police Chief Marge Gunderson, a professional on a mission to solve the case. Her performance is one of the finest by a leading actress you will ever see in the crime genre, and this is no exaggeration, but possibly in the last twenty years.Steve Buscemi (The Big Lebowski) gives a crazed portrayal of Carl, a crazed man out for money and will stop at nothing to get it. Having these diverse characters gives the film depth and a great sense of realism, which was vital to achieve.As good as the performances are, it is the Coen brothers who are the stars with a consistent well written plot and some fine diverse direction to make an ultimate realistic crime drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true landmark for Film-making! Perfect Materpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I re watched Fargo, and I have to say, without giving too much, it is impossible to not LOVE this film! Fargo is such a brilliant piece of film-making! The script was written with such intelligence. It's mixture of black comedy with crime and drama is so original, it is a pity why films like this cannot be done these days. To just explain the greatness of Fargo is not enough. Unlike other 'so called' masterpieces out there, Fargo's genuine emotional appeal cannot be described. It is enough to just watch the film. Yes, it is disturbing, sometimes a little too much, but that mixed in with amazingly memorable characters, makes for a truly amazing ride. It is a simple kidnapping movie, but the way events fold out, and unfold themselves are so bizarre, that it is even original(something that is hard to grasp these days).A strong part of this film is the acting. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a character that is sometimes mixed with fright and worry, and Macy gives such a well done performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormware are great as the two kidnappers, Buscemi actually giving a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. But the greatest performance has to come from Frances McDormand, who plays her character of Police Chief Marge Gunderson so well, mixed with quirkiness so well, this is a true landmark for acting. Usually dramatic performances capture scenes, but McDormand captures every scene with her charm. One of the best performances of the 90's. Mixed with the acting are the strong sides to the film. The cinematography is so real and gorgeous, the film editing flawless, the music score so originally made, they all enhance the experience more.All in all, Fargo is a perfect film. It has a lot of themes inside of it, and they all come out sooner or later. But unlike theme-filled movies, this is a joy to watch. This is what films should be. They should entertain, but also react strongly to the audience and enhance us in different ways. This is Joel and Ethan Coen's best films. There is no way they could beat this. It is just difficult to describe how truly great it is. And unlike most 1990's famous films, Fargo is not overrated in such a way that people call it to be so 'important'. Fargo is, after second thoughts, the best film of the 90's. It is also one of the best films ever made, in the aspect that it is, after all, one little joy of a film! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for me, there's always a shot in every Cohen brother movies that you're not quite sure what you are looking at or what's going on. In Millers' Crossing it's the moment the guy was about to lift up a chair and beat up G. Byrne in the warehouse. In Lebowski, it was the human painting thing. In Fargo, it's one scene shot square from the top of the parking lot looking down.It seems these are almost intentional ? But only the Coehns can answer that.Each movie try to evokes and entice certain feelings. for me, Fargo, seems to try to contrast the warmth of some characters against the coldness of others, namely the murderers. How the cold ones can range from resisting to truly unfeeling (such a word?) by nature; and the warm ones live and find warmth, not in themselves but mostly in others, or relating to another that can relate to.did you get that?</fullReview>

It aims to be both homey and exotic, and pretends to be true." - Ethan Coen Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is a car salesman who urgently needs money. Out of desperation he hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, his intention being to extort 1 million dollars from her wealthy father. But in typical noir fashion, his plan falls apart.This is another tightly wound neo-noir by the Coen brothers, but like David Lynch's "Straight Story", it's also a reactionary piece aimed at its audience. Lynch followed up the critically derided "Lost Highway" with "The Straight Story", a film which pretended to be homey, realistic and "straight", when in fact it was a disturbing tale filled with hidden horrors and disguised menace."Fargo" likewise pretends to be a straight story. After audiences and critics scorned the ridiculously cartoonish "Hudsucker Proxy", the Coen's released the more somber "Fargo, presenting it to their audience as a film based on a real event, and using subdued camera work and a great deal of restraint to lend the film a sense of authenticity.But as Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) learns when she meets her old friend Mike Yanagita, things shouldn't be taken at face value. So though touted as a "serious film" based on a "factual event", "Fargo" is really an exercise in seeing how FAR the Coens can GO (hence the title) without cracking up laughing. The film pretends to be based on a true story, when in fact it is a work of fiction borne from the playful minds of the Coens. Virtually every scene is skewed or warped, filled with moments of repressed humour, ridiculous mannerisms and laughably named characters. The con, or joke, is how far the audience is suckered into accepting the on screen follies. This sort of audience contempt would reach nihilistic proportions in the Coen's later films.8.5/10 - A slick slice of neo-noir, not as inventive or daring as "The Big Lebowski", but its simplicity allows it to reach a kind of lean perfection. Still, the film has two flaws. Firstly, all these formalists (De Palma, Mamet, Leone, Tarantino, Coens - Hollywood's reigning post-modernists) always serve up reheated seconds. "Fargo" thus works more as a slick photocopy or parody of noir, all the imperfections airbrushed and whittled away by history, the Coens more interested in reproduction and ironic distance, than tapping into something genuine.The second flaw is the Coen's increasing nihilism. Art's all a big joke, either an unknowing prank on the audience or an invitation for artist and audience to, in tandem, mock the follies of the schmucks on screen. The Coens pretend to deal with tragedy, but rarely do they tap into any kind of affecting sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens' top achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a tendency not to compare the Coen brothers to other directors, seeing as they are among the most unique filmmakers in the world, but it is fair to say Fargo is their Pulp Fiction: a work of startling originality (in fact, their first truly original screenplay, rewarded with an Oscar) that showed they could do more than merely revisit classic genres, so brilliant the Academy chose to overlook it (the Best Picture award for 1996 was infamously given to The English Patient). It's a playful, exhilarating and shocking piece of cinema - the brothers' masterpiece.The film's playfulness is exposed in the very beginning, as the opening caption states "This is a true story" (which, of course, it isn't). After that, it's straight into the action: three men talking in a diner. One of them is Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car dealer whose financial troubles have led him to the hiring of the other two, Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare). They are meant to kidnap Jerry's wife and ask his father-in-law Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom which will be split in half between crooks and employer. However, just like in Reservoir Dogs (which also starred Buscemi), the best laid plans get screwed up beyond belief, resulting in a bloodbath that contrasts nicely with the snowy surroundings.While Carl and Gaear keep getting in trouble and Jerry has to pretend everything is all right, the cops intervene as well; specifically, one cop, Marge Gunderson (the Oscar-winning Frances McDormand, aka Mrs. Joel Coen), whose natural kindness and determination make her the ideal choice for the job despite her being eight months pregnant.Marge is one of the best film characters of the '90s, and undoubtedly the Coens' finest creation: whereas the protagonists of their previous movies were clever reinterpretations of genre types, she is a flesh-and-blood human being, with real emotions and a heart of gold. Her unique status as the only really good person in the film adds to the several endearing traits of McDormand's humane, warm performance. She is the audience's guide in a darkly humorous universe, populated by dishonest con-men, funny-talking prostitutes (the accents are supposedly of Scandinavian origin) and the psychotic Gaear, played by a career-best Stormare, whose double act with the fast-talking Buscemi adds to the in-joking since he is the only real Scandinavian in a movie full of fake Swedes and Danes (Lundegaard and Gustafson).The unique setting of the film (apparently, the Coens' home region) plays really well to the brothers' knack for funny names (apart from the ones that have already been mentioned, one should remember that of Marge's husband, Norm "Son of a" Gunderson), quirky characters and sudden, brutal violence. The result is a once-in-a-lifetime blend of thriller, comedy and horror movie, the best film of 1996 and a milestone in (post)modern film-making. It may not be a true story, but why nag about that when the Coens' imagination is much more satisfying?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brother's masterpiece of the 1990s is Fargo, an incredibly twisted, sick, yet funny and quirky story about a kidnapping plot gone wrong. William H. Macy is spectacular as the befuddled yet conniving car salesman Jerry Lundegarrd, a man trying to make his way in the world but decides to do so by having two not-so-smart henchmen kidnap her. From here, everything that can go wrong does and we see all that Jerry thought was going to work turns out to come and bit him in the butt.What really is memorable about this film is not only the great performances by Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare but also the amazing settings the Coens gave themselves to set each scene up to be exactly as they wanted it. Collaborating with the genius that is Roger Deakins, they give us a bleak and ugly landscape that sets the tone for the rest of the story. This is certainly the type of movie perfectly watchable in the dead of winter, especially if you live in an area where snow is constantly looming above. The writing is nothing short of incredible as it moves flawlessly from each characters' situation until it all comes together in the end. Certainly one of the best films of the 1990s, if you are at all interested in the Coen Brothers, this film represents them best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers' highly acclaimed film delivers on all levels. Its written superbly, features Buscemi, Stormare and William H. Macy all giving three very good performances, perfect use of these character actors. The whole atmosphere and feel of the movie is great. I think the Coen brothers did a great job of combining comedic and dramatic elements to make this story fun, entertaining and work best for the big screen. I highly recommend this any fan of cinema, as it does add an original spin to the idea of a crime/drama. Well done by the Coen brothers, though its not my favorite film by them, definitely a great film.---IMDb Rating: 8.2. MY Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

Macy) is a car salesman who's hired two kidnappers (Buscemi &amp; Stormare) to kidnap his wife. The kidnappers will be given a ransom for the returning of Jean, the ransom is being payed by Jean's father, who's very fortune.As in most of the Coen's films the main point is "MONEY".All the actors does a great performance and by doing so it gives you the a more realistic feeling. There is no disappointment on the directing part since the Coen brothers are masters of directing.The movie includes their excellent humor which is being lift up with 200 curse words. There for, i can pretty much sum up that this is a classic Coen Picture and it will always be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful story can be a source for a great movie. However, in the hands of a great director, a powerful story can be elevated to a masterpiece. Without any doubt, Fargo is a director's movie, for the most memorable things about the movie are the little idiosyncrasies. There is an undercurrent of humor throughout the movie that brilliantly contrasts with the moroseness of the story. The movie, like most of Coen brothers' movies, has over-the-top acting performances that keeps the movie interesting. This is typical of how Coens approach most of their movies and if you have a taste for it, this movie is a treat. In short, a intriguing story peppered throughout with trademark humor and noteworthy performances makes for very entertaining watch. Also, the background score is great. You could read a lot more into the movie, but even if you do not, it still remains extremely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked "Fargo." It is a very good movie, with a great deal of originality and spectacular performances by Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand definitely deserves her Oscar, although it's a bit tragic that Macy didn't get one, since he gives the better performance (although I emphasize that both performances are spectacular). The film also presents an interesting contrast, with complications, violence, and sin on one side, and simple folksy down-home humanity on the other. It is this contrast that makes "Fargo" difficult to categorize. Crime plays a central role in the story and yet it's not a crime story, thriller, or mystery. The scenes with Frances McDormand are laugh-out-loud hilarious (and she is a true master of the art of awkward smiles for awkward moments), and yet the film is not a comedy (not even a black comedy). It's a different kind of film altogether.And yet, I can't quite join the critics in calling this "one of the greatest films ever made" or "the best film of 1996" or anything like that. It is a very good movie. The Coen brothers are talented filmmakers. But, when I watched "Fargo," I felt like something was missing. I can't quite put my finger on what, though. There's just some je ne sais quoi that's missing from this film.Maybe I felt like the link between the violent plot and the comedic plot was not strong enough, that they were connected, but not strongly enough. Maybe I thought the movie was driven too strongly by the characters and not enough by the plot. I usually love character-driven stories more than plot-driven ones. (The character-driven films of Martin Scorsese, especially "Taxi Driver," are probably my favorite films). Yet, maybe I was looking for a bit more plot in "Fargo." I really don't know. But there's something that's preventing "Fargo" from being one of the greatest films of all time, and I don't know what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is the Coen brothers' version of a series of true crimes, mixed together to make one of the most compelling thrillers to hit the big screen in years.Why it is called Fargo is beyond me. Fargo is only where the antagonists meet for the first time, everything else happens in Brainerd pretty much. Maybe it is the point of origin perhaps? Or maybe "how FAR they will GO?" ... That was bad, yes I know.Anyway, what we have here is a compelling film about a simple plan gone horribly wrong. The story revolves around Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) an execute sales manager at his rich father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell)'s car dealership. Lundegaard is financially in trouble and calls upon Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis) to get together some guys to help kidnap Mrs. Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud). When a deal with Wade's accountant, Stan Grossman (Larry Brandenburg) falls through, Lundegaard hires 2 thugs: Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that Wade will pay the ransom to get her back, and then afterward, Lundegaard will split the ransom with the thugs. Trooper Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is hot on their trail throughout the film despite being 7 months pregnant.The music score was top-notch (although I hate using that word). It set the mood for many scenes and did so while being very simple and not overly flashy.Fargo is a fun movie and will stick with you long after watching.9/10.</fullReview>

The writing was spectacular, the acting was great (I love the accents), the direction was masterful; overall, it's a great movie. I especially love Francis McDormand's acting in it. She was great as the heavily pregnant police officer. I love the line "I think I'm gonna barf." Plus, I also liked William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi. They did a great job in it as well.Furthermore, I also digged the scene where Steve Buscemi was being put in a wood-chipper, piece by piece. Oh, it was so disgusting, yet it was so well done. And to hear that this was based on a true story, it shocked me. I never would've expected this to be a true story. Anyway, it's a good movie. Rent it, and if you like it, buy it, and if you don't, then oh well. You gave it a shot, and that's all that matters.I love this movie, and I will be more than glad to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another commentator has described this movie as one he never wants to end. And you can't say fairer than that. It slyly draws you in with its understated style, and acting that is so perfectly believable, you become fully absorbed in the details.Whoever dreamed-up the idea of a small-town heavily-pregnant female police officer turning detective and unravelling a hideously brutal series of crimes, that culminate in a confrontation with a wood-chipping machine? It's the sort of weirdness that happens in real life rather than the all-too-often implausible movies.We watch a succession of scenes that trail each other like the sets from an opera. Small-town American life in winter in captured with a wonderful phlegmatic simplicity. People just get about their business, whilst meanwhile something monstrous is unfolding.William Macy plays the husband who hires a couple of ruthless goons to stage his wife's kidnapping as an extortion plot. But neither have the wit or wisdom to do it right. Steve Buscemi &amp; Peter Stormare play those goons.Frances McDormand is the WPC who is landed with the job of finding out what's happened. She is neither a graceful nor a pretty woman, and proves once more that females don't need the face and figure of Pamela Anderson to make truly deserving contributions to cinema. Well done, the Coens, for realising this. The little dalliances between herself and her artist husband are touching and funny, and one wonders why other couples cannot be so mutually respectful and accommodating in real life.The sub-plots are supported by funky theme music that segues each along at an unhurried pace, gradually wandering into weirdness, and contrasting their loving normality to the final nightmarish denouement.And she tries to make sense of it all in her simple small-town way. It's such a nice sunny day after all. And just for some money...It's hard to tire of this movie. For all its black humour, it's a personal pleasurable experience. I really ought to give it 10.Watch it yourselves if you doubt me. Or read the other comments.</fullReview>

After the things get a bloody twist in a shape of a dead highway officer, officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) begins to unravel the case. And this is where I have to stop talking about the plot, as it would really ruin the film.Frances McDormand does a stellar job as Marge, who is trying to understand the case and is in a place in her own life, that has made her to wonder where it all will lead. She's a head of her own police department, pregnant and steadily married, but still she seems to wonder, if there might be something else out there. It's hard to say a bad thing about the rest of the cast either. Coens have done a great job in gathering a great cast and the film flows along withing its own logic, and never breaks it. The illusion stays intact to the end and you never question, at lest during watching the movie, why things go the way they go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a very good and intense film from the Coens that does a great job of keeping the viewer hooked on the screen. My favorite of theirs is still No Country for Old Men but this would definitely be a close second. It's filled with action, suspense, blood, and even quite a bit of dry humor here and there. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you definitely need to check it out.The story is brilliant with a lot of twists and turns and things I didn't see coming. The acting is utterly amazing but from William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and the rest of the great cast, you shouldn't expect much less at all. The action and blood are great also and I just loved the entire tone of the film in general. This is one that I will probably end up watching again and again.See this movie if you like the Coens or crime dramas in general. i daresay that you will have a great time doing so.</fullReview>

There are also some strong parallels between the scam that's carried out in the main action and the scam that Mike attempts to perpetrate on Marge.

		<fullReview>How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top 20 of all time. 'Fargo' is like many Coen brothers films: the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. You can relate it to their Oscar winning film this year 'No COuntry for Old Men' in some ways.Fargo is arguably the Coen Brother's best movie (though personally I think it's their second-best, after No Country For Old Men). I was pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of the storyline, as many movies concerning crime are often too fast paced and reliant on plot twists. Instead, Fargo's plot develops more through the characters than through what is actually occurring on the screen. The characters themselves, especially Jerry Lundegard, are very well thought out and work in perfect unison with the simplicity of the story. There are no hard-boiled, cynical detectives here, just a simple policewoman who uses basic techniques to outwit her inexperienced counterparts.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable and scary but share a half a brain among them. What was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking and hearkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.'Fargo' is one of those movies you watch a dozen times a month then forget about it for a few months. After the few months, you pop it in again and the whole movie is brand new again. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly. Out of my 200+ DVD movies collection, Fargo is one of my most watched (along side my Martin Scorsese collection).</fullReview>

Examples of this include the bartender's "crazy down there by the lake" story, and the infamous wood-chipper scene. The ending is very satisfying, as the bad guys get what they deserve, and life goes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straightforward but powerful, "Fargo" is classic tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is one of those crime films that doesn't actual attempt to mislead you anywhere. It doesn't need to rely on Hollywood twists and that's the look of a truly great story.The film follows the consequences of William H. Macy's character Jerry's choice to hire two men to kidnap his wife so he can pay off other debts. The plot is simply how this spins out of control and turns into something tragic.Balancing out the tragedy is the simply yet wonderful character of Marge, the pregnant policewoman played by Frances McDormand. She has no dramatic dialogue or scenes that demand a great deal, but she plays her character with such charm and simplicity that she is easily the most likable character in the film. Thematically, it seems as if Marge is representative of honor and hope in how she does her duty with the former and symbolically in her pregnancy for the latter.The Coen brothers create an aura around this film that seems somewhat contradictory but effective. The snow gives it a distinct feel of innocence, but the blood taints it. You feel like with all the violence, your heart should be racing, but the Coen brothers have shot the film in a way that it simply builds interest and/or concern for the characters in the film. The setting is very subtly of great importance."Fargo," simply put, is probably one of the greatest tragedies of the modern era, almost Shakespearian in a way in how it probes the mind by showing simple people in a difficult situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers seamlessly weave the hilarity of American plainness within a story of a greedy, selfish man who hatches a plot that goes completely awry in this masterpiece. They capture the dreary scenery of this winter plain-land flawlessly mix the dark humor with a pretty violent story, all the while keeping their tongue firmly planted in their cheek. It pokes fun at these characters and their lifestyle while also creating a magnificent story out of them. You can see that the Coens truly loved these people and put dedication into creating this world (that was inspired by their actual life in Minnesota) and had a lot of fun mocking it all while paying tribute to this sort of sub-culture. The score and cinematography are easily some of the best I've ever seen (as is the film). It's also creepy how much I relate to Gaear Grimsrud. I feel like we have so much in common and were I in his situation I would act the same way. He also managed to draw the most laughs out of me. It should also be mentioned that the performances from the four main actors (McDormand, Macy, Buscemi, Stormare) are all grand. It truly is a film that only gets better and better with each viewing. This was my tenth and I've never loved it more.</fullReview>

Instead of asking his wealthy father-in-law, he hires two goons, Carl Showalter (played by Steve Buscemi, whose Oscar nomination is hiding somewhere,) and Gaear Grimsrud (played eerily by Peter Stormare,) to kidnap his wife, and split the ransom with him. After Gaear and Carl kidnap Jerry's wife, a cop pulls them over for having no tags on the car, only DLR plates, that Jerry gave them. When the cop asks Carl to step out of the car, Gaer blows the cop's brains out, then kills two witnesses who were just driving by. Now, pregnant police Chief Marge Gunderson is on the case.I loved this film, but it did one of my pet peeves in a movie, introduces an unnecessary character, Mike Yanagita, I really didn't see why he was necessary.</fullReview>

The story is said to be based on true events with the stipulation that the characterizations are exaggerated for comical effect. The film has an eclectic mix of drama, crime, humor and black humor. The film is well-shot and has an effective score.The film has solid performances. William H. Macy creates a compelling character as the desperate salesman Jerry Lundegaard. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are interesting as the quirky yet dangerous as the kidnappers. Frances McDormand also has a notable turn as the no-nonsense and practical yet simple Marge Gunderson.The story starts off well and the crime story generally retained my interest. However, I found that the script got diverted at a number of points and was less effective than it could have been. A prime example of this was the scenes related to the character of "Mike", which were unnecessary and distracted from the main story. The film's satire of how trite people can be is clever at points, but becomes tedious with repetition. However, Chief Gunderson's speech toward the end of the film was well-written. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality of "Fargo" to be up to its reputation despite its positive points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am asking the question myself that how ominous place Minneapolis is. After I had seen the collapse of connection bridge of Minneapolis lastly on TV's, I had chance to watch this film.-spoiler- The film mainly describes a tragedy that happened in Minnesota in 1987. According to that a car sales manager needs money to found a new job. He chooses an incredible way to obtain the money of the father - also he is his boss - of his wife. He gets in touch with two tramps by means of his master and the facts take progress. I can't explain after that because I don't wanna you to lose your excitement about it.Such tragic facts exist all around the world. But, I think most of them wouldn't draw attention as Fargo, if they were realized on theaters.Starting with this natural scenario, I think, the spectators couldn't leave the screen even just one second. The director already created a movie that's harmonious with this scenario.I think there aren't many words to say for Steve Buscemi. Like always he lets his abilities speak.His appearance exactly fits with the role. But more than him, I admire the performance of his partner who is Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud. Whatever necessary for playing a maniac, he displays and does his best. I think there is an interesting point to talk about it. The leading role players' names remind me Scandinavian people's names. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and Presnell as Wade Gustafson are some of them.-spoiler- The main music continues from starting to end, it is good for action. Effects are also amazing, especially shootings of Grimsrud and sparing his friend's foot in wood carpenter.Details from film are so interesting. For example Grimsrud isn't very talkative and that fits with his frightening image. Fargo seems as the suburb part of the city where it is located.After all the comments I made above, the last sentences will be like that: Scenario is so fluent, it makes curious about the end of the film and it is hard to forget.Fargo rises with Buscemi's and Stormare's fascinating performance and it deserves absolutely nine points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often a film comes along that is truly a unique work of a singularly unique story, style and execution as to put it all by itself, unable to be 'classified' and impossible to forget.FARGO(1996)would certainly seem to fit the bill. Just ask 6 people, who've seen it, just what was it about? I mean not just the plot, screenplay or scenario, but what, if any, "message" was there? Was there any little bit of true life experience ? Can the viewer relate to it or see anything resembling our own lives? The film opens with little vignettes of two different households. We see the Gundersons, Marge(Frances McDormand) and Norm(John Carroll Lynch). She is the Police Chief of a small Minnesota Town. She is also 7 months along of being "in a family way." He is an Artist and apparently a stay at home "Mr. Mom" type.The other household is that of the Lundegaards, Jerry(William H. Macy) and Jean(Kristin Rudrud). He is General Manager of his Father-in Law's Automobile Dealership. Jerry is ambitious and loves the Green $tuff a little too much. He has hopes of advancing up the corporate ladder to some kind of partnership. The Father-in-Law (Harve Presnell)tolerates him but has little use for him, shutting him out on a land deal that was basically the Son-in-Law's brainstorm.A bizarre idea for a phony kidnapping of his wife in order to collect a Ransom from the Old Man is hatched by Jerry Lundegaard's fertile imagination. Well, it sounds foolproof, no? We'll see.The of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare combine to form just about the creepiest pair of psychotic killer-thugs ever. Their mannerisms and demeanor are bad enough by themselves, but when together they become the embodiment of evil. They scared me, I mean gave me the creeps and I was a Chicago Cop for 'bout 34 years, worked in some pretty mean streets, too.The "fun" all begins when the underachiever with all the bad debts closing in on him meets with these two Ghouls, and pitches the idea to them. Then, almost everything goes not according to schedule and puts layers of complications upon other layers, etc, etc.It has been said that "If you sleep with Dogs, you'll get Fleas." This is surely an apt slogan for the whole hair brained, cockamamie plot.Thre is an affectionate handling of the Minnesota setting and its inhabitants. The Director and Production opted for using local dialect in the speaking of the characters. The Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan Upper Peninsula inhabitants display a marked influence of their Norwegian and Swedish ancestors speech patterns. So much of their accentuation and slang expressions are direct descendants of the old Scandanavian settlers to this part of the Midwestern U.S. as to deserve recognition, with respect and affection. This Film did just that.But, when looking back at the whole story, once we get to The End title on the screen, we get to see that there is definitely a Morale or two imparted. And after several years and quite a few viewings, I believe that this Shanty Irishman has finally gotten some of its intended bits of wisdoms.We witness all of this outlandish, totally uncivilized and barbaric behaviour being perpetrated by otherwise peaceful law-abiding middle class, "decent" folks. And in this case, we see can the readiness of the Son-in-Law to put his trust in these sociopaths.And even more ironic of a situation, right under our noses from the beginning is the roles of the Gundersons. He is sitting home with his Art while his Wife, while being pregnant and in the 3rd trimester, is out on patrol and pursuing the Bad Guys.See, it's kind of like our cockeyed world!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard is in a financial jam and, out of desperation, comes up with a plan to hire someone to kidnap his wife and demand ransom from her wealthy father, to be secretly split between Jerry and the perpetrators. Jerry, who is not the most astute of individuals, hires a couple of real losers from the frozen northern reaches of Fargo, North Dakota for the job. Then things begin to slip from bad to worse as Jerry helplessly watches on.Before I say anything, I would like to say I've seen the edited television version, so I don't know if it is different from the theatrical version. When I watch this movie, it says it is based on a true story and after I finished watching it, I had a hard time believing it, but still, it was a fantastic film.This whole movie is like a kidnapping plot gone wrong. Although there are some dark subjects in the film, there were some pretty funny moments (that's why calling it a comedy thriller). Like any great movie, the script for this one is written really well and the characters aren't one dimensional.I like the dialog so much, that I just love it! I never really thought dialog could be written this well. The characters are fantastic! You, or I, can fall in love with every one of them, just because of those well written lines.This isn't your ordinary kidnapping film (or maybe it is. I haven't seen that many). This film looks so original and different in a kind of way. It's also very heartbreaking and I also liked how the movie ended. It felt complete and satisfying.William H. Macy's performance is really weird but was really good. It's probably because of the weird personality. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare performances were subtle, but not bad. And my favorite character of all is played wonderfully by Frances McDormand.This is one of the best movies ever made. The whole movie was shot really well and the dialog was fantastic. The characters were lovable and the whole movie was really satisfying. Watch it, people. I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.</fullReview>

This is one of those movies that when you move and you pack up all of your stuff, you make sure you can find it so that you've got a "safe one" to watch when you can't find anything.I saw this for the first time as a second run movie and my parents kept raving about it. I reluctantly agreed to watch it and I wasn't disappointed at all. All you had to do is say it was the same guys that put together Raising Arizona and I would have been on board, sheesh! Having only visited the Midwest and never lived there I cannot personally vouch for all of the clichés in this film but some of it was so funny. I always get a laugh out of the "Ya's" in this movie when the two ladies are being interviewed.William H Macy was very convincing as a corrupt auto salesman. I've met too many like his character and it's just funny to see that on the big screen, especially the "I'm just gonna go check with my boss" bit. Funny stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of character study, this film is only rivaled by a few other movies in the last 30 years. Perhaps "The Godfather", maybe "Patton" and a very few others would approach a par on level of character study. Each one was superb, and right on cue. The dark comedy timing was excellent, in addition to the extreme nature and behavior of those involved, and of course the flawless flow of the story line.William Macy's character portrayal makes one despise him immediately, for being an idiotic childish fool (while in real life Macy is an intelligent gentleman); and Frances McDormand's character is priceless as a very sincere, and very ethnic Norwegian cop. These, in addition to the entire cast, make this movie one of the most memorable of all time. The film's presentation is suspenseful, gripping, and entertaining from start to finish, mainly because of the strategy of the story, in addition to the built in environmental effects it possesses. This feel is further emphasized by the musical accompaniment and timing, and fine acting and reacting within a rather provincial setting.Obviously, part of the comedic aspect of this otherwise horrific story is Macy's incredibly audacious hatched plan to begin with, and then the subsequent abilities of everyone else around him to respond according to his own character. In addition, Jerry Lundgren's behavior carries (and causes) the story's unfolding of events in an unbelievably believable way. But, just out of curiosity, where could one ever find such a collection of extreme personalities and behaviors coincidentally converging on one place at the same time? I suppose something similar happened 11 years later in "Smokin' Aces", but in a different context. But even then, that (Smokin' Aces' character development) was not as intriguing.In addition to McDormand's very deserved Oscar in this film, it is not incomprehensible that Macy, and others, could have or should have received nominations as well. For anyone who hasn't seen a very involving and entertaining movie in a while, buy the DVD of this one. It's a winner in every way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fargo" is a true story. Quoting the first writing that comes up on the screen when the movie starts, the events depicted in the film took place in Minnesota 1987, although at the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred. "Fargo" tells about a man named Jerry Lundegaard who's in a desperate need of money. So he comes up with an idea to kidnap his own wife, hiring two thugs for the job. Jerry's wife Jean has a father who's rich so the plan is that the father, Wade Gustafson, has to pay the ransom for his daughter, which Jerry will make profit from. Jerry makes a deal with the thugs and carefully plans the whole thing, but things don't go quite as he thought they would.The amazing thing about this film is that it's really a true story, so what you see from the screen is pretty much what has really happened. It's tragic and it's sad. The screenplay's written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and the movie's directed by the other of the two brothers, Joel Coen. What comes to the screenplay, it's very well written, but in my opinion some things could have been left out. I won't go to the details, as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Although there are those unnecessary things in the screenplay, the movie's still very interesting and detailed throughout. Directing has this nice flow, capturing images of cold landscapes, a coldness, giving the movie this darker edge, which is really like this sort of a background essence of the movie. It's pretty hard to explain, but it's important and necessary for the film itself.William H. Macy plays the role of Jerry Lundegaard and I must say I'm pretty damn impressed of his role performance, one of his best performances yet to date for sure. Macy's one of those actors who can really look believably nervous, which again gives the whole character this huge credibility. His just perfect for the role. Frances McDormand plays the role of a pregnant local police Marge Gunderson, which granted her an Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Leading Role. I agree on the fact that she's amazing in the film, but I really liked Macy's performance much more. There's still one role performance to mention and that is the role of Carl Showalter, other one of the two thugs, which is performed superbly by Steve Buscemi. That is by far Buscemi's best role performance yet to date and I've always honestly thought that Steve's more of a comedian sort of type, but the role of Showalter is a perfect example that he can do drama as well, though the character's is actually hilarious in certain parts of the movie, cooperated nicely by Peter Stormare in the role of the other thug Gaear Grimsrud. Stormare's performance compliments the whole performance of Buscemi, and to me Stormare is always enjoyable, no matter what the role was."Fargo" is, all in all, a great movie. It's thrilling, very well progressing and it's filled with great characters performed by fantastic actors. It is definitely a thriller/drama to watch if you're looking for something consisting of those genres. It's exciting, it's serious and it's a fine example how true stories should be translated on the big screen. Very nice indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the highlights of American 1990s cinema, FARGO has a lean, often violent, but mostly hilarious script, as dazzling as the snow which fills so many of the movie's frames.Cosy in bed with husband Norm (what a perfect name!), with baby on the way, everything is as it should be for our investigator Marge, unforgettably played by Frances McDormand. Then the phone rings. If it isn't a brutal crime, it's a crazy guy she used to be at school with. Marge finds it all incomprehensible. But out she goes, with seemingly effortless courage, trying to level the world out when it goes off kilter.There are many echoes of Ealing comedy in the Coen Brothers' work, and FARGO's bungling bad guys could easily have come from the pen of William Rose, who created THE LADYKILLERS. It's no wonder Joel and Ethan went for a remake.The icing on the FARGO cake is an excellent score by Carter Burwell.A wonderful movie.</fullReview>

Macy) is a perfect idiot, devoted to the money, loser and mediocre. Steve Buscemi's character is practically brainless, but we touch the acme with Peter Stormare's character. I've never seen a more boorish person: he never talks, but on the other hand his gun is always in action, and he's particularly cruel with his victims. Luckily there's Marge, the firm and REALLY funny pregnant policewoman played by the wonderful Frances McDormand: she deserved every prize she won and was nominated for. A perfect indie movie: maybe you'll not remember it for his production design, but the emotions you felt during the screening will be unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny how the simple word "Yaaah" sounds so dimwitted in the movie, yet turns out to be one of the few affirmations of normalcy in a maelstrom of frenzied lunacy. "Fargo" is the quintessential film of how a bad idea can only get badder (worse?) when put in the hands of inept bunglers who can just about taste a big payday. What happens to them is a sort of poetic justice, but there's nothing as lyrical or pretty as poetry going on here.Here's a movie where you can't picture any of the principals being portrayed by anyone else. It's the perfect meld of characters, dialog and situations that domino from one disaster to another with eerie precision, and the unsettling feeling that yes indeed, as nuts as it all is, this is something that could actually happen.For whatever reason, I haven't seen a lot of the Coen Brothers pictures. I came across "The Big Lebowski" a couple of weeks ago, and decided to catch this film today to keep the streak going. I'm suitably impressed by their quirky characters and bizarre, colorful plots to keep on going. Bitingly original, they leave one somewhat disturbed, but curious for more.Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi are stand out in their roles here, but except for a few brief minutes shared by Macy with each of them, their characters never really appear together. Chalk it up again to the story tellers who move things along in spite of the hapless Jerry Lundegaard, someone we can all relate to whenever things we can clearly see in our head just don't quite turn out the way they're planned. Poor Jerry, he never even came close; kind of makes you wonder how he ever became the executive sales manager.Say, I wonder if Gaear (Peter Stormare) got his inspiration from Paul Bunyan?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a wonderful piece of art. Everything, from the camera-work down to the plot and the characters is just perfect.If I have to choose one out of the many, it's the character of Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) that really makes this movie stand out among the other crime movies you might have seen.This guy is so... well... recognizable! OK, he makes up a scheme to kidnap his wife, that's not what a "normal" person would do. But he is so recognizable with all his small lies. The funny thing is that every small lie of his comes on top of the big pile of all the other "small lies" he made before. At a certain moment, all the small lies combined result in such a big lie that he can only desperately hope to keep it up with his "acting". And the "acting" in this role is brilliantly done by William H. Macy...Of course the characters of Marge Gunderson and the two baddies are also nicely done, although I don't think that the baddies here are so much different from other bad guys in other movies.Also a big thumbs up for the general scenery in this movie. The snowy landscapes feel like they are almost meant to be a direct answer to the classic western-movies that made American cinema famous for a large part.I'm not American, so I can't give any real opinion on the accent/dialect that is used by the characters. However, even for a non-native speaker, the humour of these characters' accent is clear enough, just because it sounds so different from the "English" I was taught at school. You find dialects all over the world. People speaking dialect are often the subject of jokes by others. It's really nice to watch a movie where a certain dialect gets such a prominent place. It reminds me of Trainspotting (only in this respect, though).I'm giving this movie a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that just blows me away every time I watch it. Fargo is truly an amazing accomplishment. As per usual for the Coen brothers, the characters are unique, interesting, well fleshed out, and the dialogue is great. The acting is top notch as well, most notably by Buscemi and McDormand, although the rest of the cast is great as well. The thing that elevates this movie above most others I think, is how smoothly it alternates between the comic and the tragic. The dialogue is filled with great comic moments only to all of a sudden shift to a dark and gruesome scene and then right back to the comic. The Coen brothers are my favorite directors and this is my favorite from them. That should give you an idea of how much I love this film.I know a few people that don't like this movie simply because of the northern accents used in the movie. I don't know what to say to them, but it's a shame really, because I find the accents just add to the humor of the story.</fullReview>

The strengths of this film lies with the screenplay, story, and the actors. Combined together, you get a classic dark comedy. Of special note are actors Frances McDormand as the pregnant Officer Marge Gunderson who spearheads the murder case that this film revolves around. She lives a very stable life with a happy and complacent marriage to her husband, about to have their first child. It's as if this role was created for McDormand, for she is a pleasure to watch. Also kudos to William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi who are great in their roles too. Without giving more away, all I will say is go see this film.

Think of their dialogue: (Phone rings) "Jerry Lundegard" "Are you alone?" "Well...ya" "Do you know who this is?" "Well, I've got a pretty good idea. (happy voice) How's that ciera working out for ya?!" Both characters are totally captured in one brief phone conversation. Think how Macy got that sad puppy-dog looking down face when the guy starts calling him a liar because the car came with that Trucoat. Perfect. Macy also had the excellent dialogue with Wade and Stan Grossman, so there's that. And the opening scene when you see him talking to Buscemi about the kidnapping is incredible, so there's that too. SO Macy made the movie. But what elevated it to a whole other level was the inclusion of the scene with Margie and Mike. I mean, what did that have to do with anything? And yet it was genius. Think of some Mike's lines: "Well, it's a Radisson, so it's pretty good." "She had..leukemia." "She fought real hard, Margie." "You're such a SUPA lady!" Mike should have received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Heck, he shoulda won it! I highly recommend that you watch this film. And watch it a bunch of times. It gets better with each viewing. As Stan Grossman has been known to say, "It's pretty sweet."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest films of the 90's was this beautifully quirky and darkly suspenseful thriller from Joel and Ethan Coen.Minnistota man hires some thugs to fake a kidnapping with his wife, but the foolish team quickly fouls things up and a small-town policewoman is about to uncover the crime.Recalling a lot of the elements of the Coen's debut thriller Blood Simple (1984), Fargo also proves to be a unique and smartly told drama/thriller. The story is more complex this time, with an even larger band of colorful (and often dim-witted) characters. Fargo is one of those rare films that has a little bit of every film genre in its story. You have film noir, slick comedy, suspense-thriller, parody, and even small-town drama all weaved into one terrifically amusing gem of a film. The direction is wonderfully well-done, as is the beautifully atmospheric music score.The cast of this film is excellent. Frances McDormand is perfectly lovable as the films rather unlikely heroine, a pregnant small-town cop. William H. Macy is subtly funny as the films desperate conspirator. Steve Buscemi is a stand out as one of the idiot kidnappers. The rest of the cast is also solidly good!A masterpiece of a movie, probably the Coen's best, that's a true must-see for all film fans!**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is one of the greatest films of the last 20 years. The story is very basic. A kidnapping case with a very dedicated detective. However, the intricacies of the story for example: A pregnant Woman detective, the husband masterminded the whole kidnapping and the unique setting of the mid-west make this film unique. Ethan Cohen did an incredible job of making the movie so brutal and cold. You can feel the dark tension while watching the kidnappers in the car as well as the cabin. All the performances were great but Frances McDormand and William H. Macy were the best. Frances McDormand performance was remarkable as the detective and deserved the academy award. She was the constant moral individual in a setting of immoral people. Macy's performance was equally impressive. One aspect of this movie that sets the haunting tone is the score which was was perfect for the movie. If you like drama's you will thoroughly enjoy this film.</fullReview>

After body is being found eager pregnant police officer (hilarious Frances McDormand) opens investigation about the matter...I was laughing my head off because The Coen's humor is so dark and twisted. The Danmark in heritage was funny in Finnish point of view. "Jaa" comments were hilarious over and over again. Also the bright cold weather gave an exotic touch to the usually hot Hollywood-scene.Another Fargo-like movie is "The Big White" starring by Robin Williams and Holly Hunter but the movie isn't as good as "Fargo". Though worth watching if you liked the freezing scenery of "Fargo".</fullReview>

Macy and Frances McDormand, in her Oscar-Winning role, perfectly characterize, if not stereotype a little, the thick-accented North-Westerner. William H. Macy excellently portrays Jerry Lundegaard in such a way that we admire his determination and care enough for him and his crazy plight, but not too much, so when we see Jerry get his final retribution, we aren't too upset, and know enough to know that he got what he deserved. Frances McDormand comes off as very likable and admirable as the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson. She is portrayed as a smart cop, and very stern when it comes to her job. But she is also gentle and safe, perfectly exhibited in the final scene of the film. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare have in this film what I call 'Anti-Chemistry' as the comically notorious Carl and Gaer. Anti-Chemistry is when we have two characters so different, that they create very interesting chemistry on screen, proving that opposites attract. Steve Buscemi, in his Oscar-worthy role, is hilariously annoying as Carl, butting heads with Peter Stormare's chilling yet blunt portrayal as the sociopathic Gaer. Next is the writing and directing. Definitely deserved the Oscar it won for Best Original Screenplay, it unfolds as Film Noir, but the Coen brothers, knowing better, set the film in the most un-Noir setting imaginable: Minnesota. This interesting twist allows the Coens to insert dark humor, which plays off perfectly from the simple and dim-witted sounding people from which the film takes place. I'd like to briefly note the Score, which wasn't nominated for any special awards, but I think it's one of the best film-scores I've heard. The employment of fiddles and violins give us a very small and closed feeling, but it becomes quite grand and epic, matching the seemingly small aesthetic of both the music and the film, giving it much more meaning to what's happening. Overrall, excellent crime caper/black comedy, with great acting, writing, and cinematography to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie About Family and a Study in the Evils of the Human Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry has it all. A great family that he does not appreciate or value in the least. He is willing to sacrifice all of that for money.His primary motivation for marrying his wife is her father's money. And when that is not enough for him he risks her life to get more.Frances McDormand's character is like good looking into evil and self-centeredness. Just her pregnancy alone is symbolic of life in the face of death and evil. Also, the loving relationship she so values with her caring husband is a stark contrast to Jerry's values and motivations. She is police officer, concerned with justice and good. He is, of all things, a car salesman. His motivation in life is to make a sale, even if it means lying and betraying the trust of his customers.The scene with the Chinese friend of Marge furthers the family values theme. Here is a guy with no family. He is so desperate for it, he is willing to lie about his so called "wife" having cancer to gain sympathy from Marge. He stalks women and goes about finding love all wrong. He doesn't get it. Love cannot be won by manipulation and force.The men who Jerry hires to kidnap his wife are sociopaths. And the film makes the statement that even a guy like Jerry, who may have never resorted to this kind of behavior, can fall prey to his own selfish wants. He has dipped into this underworld and then realizes later he made a big mistake.I gave it 9 stars out of 10 due to one very annoying aspect. The product placement in the film is over the top. I thought it cheapened an otherwise great film. The "It's a Radisson, so it's pretty good," comment was what really got me. Product placement seems to be the trend nowadays, but do the actors have to comment on product too?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never enjoyed a more down to earth film with all the actors playing their roles to perfection. The entire film takes place in Minnesota, and having visited that state and driven through their snow storms, this is mostly what you are going to see as a good background. Frances McDormand,(Marge Gunderson),"City by the Sea",'02, plays a pregnant Police Chief from a small town where a triple murder takes place by some very bad dudes who kidnap a woman. Marge portrays a very local down to earth person, not too smart by appearance, but smart as a tact about her police business. There is lots of blood and gore and the way the murders are committed will put chills down your spine. Excellent film to watch and enjoy from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Works as both a thriller and a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>---Spoilers--- The Coen Brothers are famous for many comedies and other types of movies such as "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "Blood Simple," and "The Big Lebowski." Their most famous one is "Fargo." "Fargo" is their thriller and dark comedy that takes place in a small town. The story line is about a man named Jerry who lives in a small town and tries to get his wife's money by hiring two criminals.I didn't understand "Fargo." There were many moments or confusion or vagueness, like all the attacks on one of the criminals. Perhaps this was a technique to build up suspense. Or, it could have just assumed that the audience would be able to understand it. Either way, it seemed unclear to me.Yet, even if it's a confusing thriller/black comedy, it succeeds in both.I heard that a good thriller needs twists. Well, "Fargo" is full of them. It's full of violence, and uses the violence to further the thrills. It also uses the shocking twists to make the audience jump. For example, when Jerry gets the phone call from Carl, it sends a chill through the audience's spine. There are also the psychological moments, where the audience is kept at the edge of their seat by asking "What's going to happen next?" Take the part with the car lot. The audience knows that Jerry is lying, and we also know that Marge doesn't. So? what's going to happen next? Is she going to find out? Is she going to get shot? Is she going to leave? It also works as a comedy. I think it's because of the funny accents (Darn Tootin') but it sure works! I found "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" funny, and "Fargo" seems too also work as a comedy. Just remember that one scene: "What does he look like?" "Oh, kind of funny looking." "How so?" "Oh, in a general kind of way." It's funny...isn't it?Overall, I hardly understood "Fargo," but if you want a thriller that has millions of twists, this one is for you?if you could understand it.Good: Entertaining, thrilling, funny and millions of plot twists Bad: It was kind of hard to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A portrait of the dark side of Minnesota.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I did not find this movie to be overwhelmingly entertaining. There are one or two funny parts, a few thrilling parts, but mostly it would be considered a drama, if that. The movie wasn't BAD, but it really wasn't that GOOD either. There are some unexplained parts of the movie, such as how William Macy's character, Jerry Lundegaard, became SO financially desperate; what EXACTLY happened to his wife, Jean, played by Kristin Rudrüd; or how Carl, played by Steve Buscemi, and his insane mate Gaear know each other. I think a more realistic film would show how the criminals are still human and would explain in better detail why they continue to "deal" with their problems in such an erratic way. Do not get me wrong, however, I think the actors were most convincing and did excellent jobs, but I thought the writing could have been better.</fullReview>

I thought the acting was great too. The scene where car sales manager (William H. Macy, a great actor) is getting interviewed by an investigator about his book-keeping, the way he performs acting so scared because he knows he's guilty, while trying to not show his emotions to the investigator... that is incredible acting. I don't know if Macy won an award for his role, but his acting really stuck out in my mind. But actually, excellent acting all the way around. I just love the way he keeps trying to act innocent, you can't really tell if he is lying or not, even though the viewer knows the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie but overrated. Loses power as it goes along.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: I am not one who hated Fargo. I can see, watching this, just why it is considered as such a great film. But I also think it's overrated. I was disappointed when it was over and don't think it is nearly as good as many have said. Here's why.First the positives. In the beginning and part of the middle nearly everything is positive. And I do mean everything. The performances were great. The landscapes were breathtaking. The musical score was phenomenal, among the best. The movie was compellingly atmospheric. The story was interesting and the dialog was superb. The movie is clearly superior to many other films. It sucks you in from the beginning and there is so much power to the movie, from the opening, that one is on the edge of their seat waiting as the movie gathers momentum.And that is why I did not love this. It gathers momentum all right. But it goes nowhere. The whole time I was watching this I was waiting for an incredible ending, for something along the lines of The Usual Suspects. But it never happened. It's not that the film is bad, it's just that it is so powerful from the beginning, but it never develops into anything at the end. The movie ended so suddenly I was still waiting for another half hour at least. At the end, I said to myself: is that all? The movie promises something big but it doesn't deliver. I thought maybe something would happen with the buried money, with maybe some kind of "twist", SOMETHING. There were all these "little things" seen throughout the movie which I filed away to myself, thinking they would somehow be very important to the storyline later but their not. Instead the movie became a mish mash of fights, gory murders, and.....that's it. Toward the end, there was to much an emphasis on violence and not enough on anything else. (Though the movie's violent throughout, in the beginning and middle there was also an emphasis on the story.) The speech that Mc.Drmand made at the end was powerful but the end as a whole was nowhere near the rest of the movie.I'd compare it to watching a really good movie and then finding out at the end it was all a dream. I personally do not like those type of films either. But this was similar because we, the viewer are lead to think a lot more is going to happen that what finally does. Even the scene with Jerry getting arrested, although I'm glad he gets caught, could have been even more powerful. The film just ends, leaving the viewer to think:that's IT? I Personally thought Fargo was a 10 of 10 at TIMES. But I felt it really needed something more to give a feeling of completeness which it did not have. I know many, if not most, think it's a 10 of 10 but I'm just not in the majority here though I agree the movie had certain great aspects for me it definitely was not outstanding.In closing I'd say, the dialog, the acting, the musical score etc were terrific but the movie's shortcomings really became apparent toward the end. The movie left a bad taste in my mouth and though I can absolutely see why many love this so much I was disappointed. My vote's 7 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtly effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got a chance to see, well, most of this movie. I missed the first few minutes, but now understand what all the acclaim has been about.It's easy to look at Frances McDormand's performance and draw the superficial conclusion that this is going to be some silly comedy, especially if you saw her in Raising Arizona. But there's a much deeper story here, some very profound collaboration in terms of the "meaning" of the story and the way it is brought to the screen.There are plenty of comedic elements, including the "dumb and dumber" kidnappers and William H. Macy as the desperate loser. Some of the dialect may or may not be laid on a tad too thick -- endless streams of "yah...yah...yah...". Still, the essence of the movie is felt in the scenes where McDormand is patiently driving her police "prowler" through the never-ending snow. Especially at the end, when she remarks, "...and it's a beautiful day." For the moviegoer who is unfamiliar with the colder, quieter parts of the country and the people who inhabit it, it can take awhile to sink in. This story is about the decent folks all around us, the ones we never see on Entertainment Tonight, who live quiet, unassuming lives and still manage to elevate themselves to lofty heights by virtue of their simple understanding of what is right and what is wrong. McDormand's Marge Gunderson is 7 months pregnant, and yet she slogs uncomplainingly through the snow to examine crime scenes. She risks her neck daily; yet, she cheers on her painter husband when his portrait is accepted by the Post Office to be depicted on a 2-cent stamp. She is listening to an old boyfriend's sob story one afternoon, and shooting a wood-chipper murderer in the leg the next.This really is an awesome film. Take away the bombast and testosterone in CSI or 24, and this is what police work is really all about.CR04</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie. It has a great plot, story, as well acting and directing. The Coen brothers have made hit after hit after hit and most of their movies are simply masterpieces. Fargo is no different. With a great blend of thrills and comedy Fargo in my opinion offers something most movies fail to offer and it succeeds on every level. The film is perfectly cast. McDormand as the police office was hilarious. Just the way the talk and the lines the characters say makes this movie worth it. It's as if they don't take what they're doing seriously but you know they do. This is right up there with Raising Arizona, Blood Simple, The Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou as a Coen Brothers classic. Over all the film is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is Why We Go To Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers To me the interesting thing about the movie is the introduction, about half way through the movie, of the Gunderson family. Until that point, the movie was a very well done thriller, reminding me strongly of the Coen Brothers' first film, Blood Simple, in the way it followed the long, obvious unraveling of a crime, every little mistake being far more obvious to the viewers than the characters. And then suddenly, the movie has a moral center to contrast the darkness of the plot.At first Margie seems to be almost a cartoon rather than a person, but what you realize over the course of the movie is that what she is is human: good at her job, loving to her husband, kind to her coworkers and subordinates, just... nice. And she wraps up the crime at the end with a great little speech emphasizing the human view, without us even realizing that it is that... For a little bit of money. And here you are. And it's a beautiful day. And, well, I just don't understand it. Now that you put it that way, neither do I.This is a movie that is almost uniformly excellent; the cast, headed by Macy, MacDormand and Buscemi, is perfect - I cannot think of any other actors who would be better for the lead roles. The script is spot on in the way it sees and develops its characters, and the way people actually talk. The Coen Brothers' taste for the quirky qua quirky is much more muted here, but it still adds just the right touch of the other to keep the movie riveting. And the cinematography catches the vast empty whiteness of the northern winter perfectly.Everything that brings me to movies is in here: great acting, great dialogs, surprises, amusement, shock, beauty, harshness, humanity.</fullReview>

Well, it just keeps you in front of the screen, waiting to see what happens next. And you will be surprised, believe me.

		<shortDescription>My Review of far go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is one of those movies you watch a dozen times a month then forget about it for a few months. After the few months hiatus, you pop it in again and the whole movie is brand new again. The "True Story" Focuses Around Jerry Lundegaard, a loving husband who is down on his luck financially. Through a friend, Shep Proudfoot, he hires two mischief men to kidnap his wife. The father of the wife is real well off and it is Jerry's idea to exploit that. Jerry's plan is to have his wife's father pay the ransom of a million dollars for his wife, but Jerry would keep all the money except for 40 thousand which is going to the kidnappers. The plan goes wrong early in the movie and situations get more complex than they already are."Fargo" is my favorite Cohen brothers movie. The greatness of "Fargo" surpasses even "The Big Lebowski" in my book. I recommend everyone watch this movie even if you are not a Cohen Brothers fan. The great thing about the brothers movies is that even if you don't share their same sense of humor and don't laugh once, the movies they make still hold up with their great stories. But if you do share the same sense of humor, the comedy is just another layer of greatness. Fargo has everything; suspense, a good story, humor, brilliant acting and a score that accompanies the visuals perfectly.Steve Buscemi, and William H. Macy put out top-notch performances as usual. Out of my 200+ DVD collection, Fargo is one of my most watched (along side my Kubrick collection)</fullReview>

I remember I liked the film back then...however I recently saw the film again, and I like it even more. In my opinion, "Fargo" is the perfect example of a dark comedy. Although some scenes may be more serious and even graphic in some cases, there were a few times where I laughed out loud...especially due to Steve Buscemi's character. Frances McDormand gives an outstanding role, as does William H. Macy. And the team of Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi gives the movie what it needs to be my favorite film of 1996.

		<fullReview>I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The twisted Coen brothers Joel and Ethan made a good movie here, so good it's ranked #84 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list. William H. Macy is a car salesman who plots to have his wife kidnapped so he can collect the ransom. Unfortunately, the nitwits he enlists for the kidnapping are both nuts and one is a bona fide psychopath. As with most Coen films the plot is a Rube Goldberg contraption where whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Macy is sucked into a surreal situation. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police woman who investigates local murders and eventually gets involved in the plot. Fargo is part very black comedy and part horror film. The film is really good at mixing the very mundane everyday life of Frances McDormand with the extremely twisted lives of the kidnappers which gives the film a real scene of menace. There is a scene at the end involving a wood chipper that is really unsettling. Steve Buscemi is unforgettable as one of the bug-eyed kidnappers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry(William H. Macy)is a poor car salesman who goes to the drastic measures of hiring a couple of goons(Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that her wealthy father can pay the ransom and Jerry can split the profits. Problems strike the plan after a pregnant cop named Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormand) takes over the case. Taking place in a desolate town in North Dakota, one can not begin to describe the brutality of this once peaceful area.The idea of the crime seems so simple but is enforced by the complexity of this frighteningly happy people who are solving the crime. The brutality is given a horrifyingly humorous outlook and makes the movie what it is today. The movie exceeds into the criminals minds and then shows the views of the cop trying to solve the case and the fall guy who is in way over his head. The lighting is absolutely wonderful and really sets the mood with the snowy setting. It gives the movie a dark mood that just scares you when you laugh it. The breath is shown in the air in almost every conversation adding to this effect. The acting was tremendous. I can't and won't even begin to describe the performance of William H. Macy. Overall, the movie is one of those classics that you can admire repeatedly.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my absolute favorite movie of all times. It's the kind of film you can see over and over. It's the kind of film that can make you cry in unexpected places, like at the end, around the 3rd or 4th time you've seen it. Part of the greatness of this story is that it grows out of the location and characters where the authors grew up, around Fargo, South Dakota. The characters are another important part, because not only are they interesting people, but they represent a cross-section of common attitudes about justice. Jerry sees justice in terms of financial and personal advantages. Gaear understands justice as always doing what is necessary to survive, given his criminal life style. Carl defines justice as being in the right (probably like most of us). Finally, justice to Marge means no harm done so that tomorrow will be better.The snow is a metaphor for purity or perfection, against which backdrop, the conflicts of the world must take place.</fullReview>

Frances McDormand plays the very pregnant homicide detective which remains the most important well played character in the movie even though we see her in the very deep center of the movie. The simple accents, quirky characters, and tiny jokes hid the film away from its darkness. If not for those things the movie would far from a comedy. The wood chipper sequence, the cruel laugh Carl screamed when Gene fell in the snow, and of course the idea of kidnapping your own wife. The movie also was funny because it didn't try to be. For instance when Carl was being beaten up by Shep or when he was shot in the face or when blew a fuse on the parking man. The movie was made in a way that seemed funny yet mixed it in with death. This film is great, made well, written well, and extremely funny.</fullReview>

They brought tons of intensity to the film, especially Buscemi, who I think is a fantastic actor and McDormand's performance was pretty funny with her Minnesota accent. She seemed like a down to earth and kind person in that movie, which I really liked in her role. Peter Stormare and William H. Macy also had good performances too.

		<fullReview>Director: Joel Coen, Script: Ethan and Joel Coen, Cast: Frances Mcdormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Kristin Rudrud, Harve Presnell.This might just be the Coen brothers at their best. This film is funny, suspenseful and at times shocking. I just recently saw Raising Arizona again and although it is also a great film I think I prefer the dark comedy and 'film noir' elements of Fargo. Set in the heartland of Minnosota, this film is about a sales manager (Jerry played by William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble. He tries to con his rich father in-law out of a large sum of money by staging a kidnapping of his wife for ransom. He hires a couple of thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to do the job but things don't go quite as planned. People end up dead and now Jerry is in all kinds of trouble. The local police chief Marge (a very pregnant police chief played by Frances McDormand) gets involved in the case.I thought the Minnosota location in winter time was a perfect setting for this kind of film. It represents middle America turned upside down! Frances McDormand was great as the small town police chief. She was very funny and did a great job impersonating the Minnosota accent and words--yaw! Steve Buscemi is good as usual. Even as a tough bad guy his nerdy self still comes across! It is funny how he can be a absolute nerd like he was in Ghost World and a total bad ass in this film yet pretty much act the exact same way! This move is very violent and unsettling at times but it is offset somewhat by Marge and Norm (her husband). They offer some normalcy in this film. We take comfort in them.This film has the offbeat characters that the Coen brothers are known for. The excellent setting and cinematography, black humour and suspense make this film a must see. One of the best films of the 90's. A modern classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Issues, not many</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Fargo is that there aren't any substantial characters. Everyone, from the overwrought Jerry to the methodical Marge, is a pure caricature. None of these people are particularly interesting or sympathetic, and watching their exploits becomes a detached experience. By the end of the film, you're more interested in how the filmmakers choose to tie together loose ends than whether any particular individual lives or dies. In the past, the Coens have managed to create characters worth caring about; such is not the case here, and it greatly diminishes Fargo's effectiveness.Born and raised in Minnesota, the Coens know their home state, which accounts for their ability to reflect reality there (which is like unreality for most of the rest of the country). People say things like "You're darn tootin'", "aw, geez," and "what the heck". Knowing how strange the talk of Minnesotans will seem to the rest of the world, the Coens intentionally play it for deadpan comic effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie I've ever seen. I was so mesmerized by its atmosphere it felt like actually being hypnotized by the end of it. I guess I've seen it some 4-5 times by now, and it never fails to produce the same gamut of various emotions. It is the cinematic equivalent of Salvador Dali's artwork: unpredictable, magical and completely out-worldly in a very worldly way, if it makes any sense. I don't think there's a movie that even remotely resembles this one in any way. It's not just a matter of actors, or the music, or the storyline: it's all these factors combined in such a wondrous piece of art. Absolutely brilliant in every imaginable way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Few that Stands the Test of Time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a beautifully shot, simple morality tale that doesn't hit you over the head with its own nature. I watched it again tonight after a two-year hiatus and am as struck by it as I was when I rented it in 1999.The repeated comments I read from non-fans of this film are: "It's BORING! It's TOO SLOW! It's NOT FUNNY!" Well, it's true, there are none of the following: Bruckheimer-style car chases, explosions, gratuitous balloon-like jugs, pratfalls, or jokes about bodily secretions. And this was never, ever meant to be a comedy. It was billed by some as a "black comedy," yes, and even that incorrectly for my money, but by definition that is not the same thing. What it is, is a study of the good and the bad that can exist right under our noses in the most benign of places. That's it. It has the bonus of lovingly drawn characters that you can't help feeling you've met...and an understanding of what that part of the country is like. If you've never lived there or don't have any family from there, you're probably not going to get a true sense of HOW true to life it is.Speaking of characters, I think that Marge Gunderson still ranks up there to me as one of the iconic film images of bravery and kindness...whether she's encouraging her husband's banal hobby or confronting a bad guy, she's a waddling, unswayed symbol of integrity. And it takes considerable skill (by both the Coen Brothers and Ms. McDormand) to make us buy it. Her husband is a warm spot too...he starts out as a laconic Midwestern guy, short on sparkle or sex appeal ? until he turns out to be a beacon of love and goodness in a brutal world. One of the great film marriages, ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top ten films of the 90's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 90's couldn't get stranger could it? We had white people who wanted to put Ebonics in school testing, a Jew in office (Joe Libermann) who labeled violent video games to TV programs (TV-Y7, etc.), educated people who blew up a bomb in a building (Oklahoma bombing) and now a movie of strange proportions that not only have effective us, but brought new innovations to attacking people. "Fargo" is a movie directed by the Coen Brothers, for which we know what their themes are in every movie: eccentricity.The film starts off with Jerry Lundergard (William H. Macy), a cheapskate car dealer who cannot give out a correct answer to everything he is doing, now he wants to fake a kidnapping of his wife in order to receive money from his father in law; so he hires two bumbling thieves (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, while one of them tells him to ask money from the wife.So now the thieves are on their way to Fargo, North Dakota where after Jerry and his kid are gone, the thieves break into Jerry's home and kidnap his wife and going on a spree killing people left and right. The cop behind the case is Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) a pregnant wife who goes from city to city asking people about information and finding grizzly scenes after another.As much for acting in a Coen Brothers film, I admire everybody, but the one I cherish the most is Peter Stormare's character in the film, for which he is silent but deadly and the reason why Marge is after them in the first place, because of the mess his character made. This is not only one of the best films of the 90's, but another masterpiece from Ethan and Joel Coen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Moving Minnesota Murder Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard, a Minneapolis car salesman with big money problems, hires a couple of thugs to kidnap his wife and hold her rich father to ransom. He'll then split the money with them and pay off his debts. Unfortunately things do not go to plan, seven people end up unnecessarily dead and Marge Gunderson, the unstoppable Brainerd County Chief of Police is on the case.This is a dramatic enigma of a picture in the classic Coen Brothers style - on the surface it's a straight crime drama about a pathetic loser whose get-rich-quick scheme backfires in a colossal way. On the other hand, the characters are so off the wall that at times the movie is more of a satirical comedy. The wintry Minnesota / North Dakota locations are crucial to the atmosphere, as are the Scandinavian "yaah" accents, in a film all about coldness of character. The cast are fantastic, with Macy and McDormand diametric opposites of selfishness and sincerity and Buscemi and Stormare as goofy yet terrifying killers, who redefine the word stupid. Featuring extraordinary beautiful photography by Roger Deakins and a terrific spare score by Carter Burwell. Whilst this is not as flashy or visually inventive as some of their other films (Miller's Crossing, The Hudsucker Proxy), this is perhaps the Coens most personal and acutely-observed movie (they grew up in Minnesota). It's not really an enjoyable experience, but it's a memorable one, and if nothing else, Marge's warmth, intelligence and polite good nature is a ray of beauty in a cold and desolate landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Keeps You Off-Balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something almost mystical about the pacing and plot turns of Fargo. It really is something of a unique film; it's hard to compare other films to it. Those unfamiliar with life around North Dakota land will be especially intrigued, because it is a slice of America that Hollywood routinely ignores. The lifestyle is not only captured on film by direct means, it is captured indirectly simply through the pacing and erm... Color? Angles? Way?.. the film is shot. It puts you there.But you won't be focusing on that, you will be focusing on the riveting plot and performances of every actor in the film. You will experience the feeling of North Dakota along the way, but it is not the chief commodity of the film. If there were an Academy Award for the person/people who do casting for a film, this is one that should have won that year. From largest role to smallest, everyone is amazingly perfect.My only complaint with the film was how it was originally billed. It was billed as based on a true story. That must have been some sleazy move by the studio to help promote a film they felt would otherwise go unnoticed, because the film is not based on any real life story at all. The people are all very real and believable, as is the plot, as is the place. But outside of the place, it's entirely fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another victory for the Coen brothers! They bring reality to the movie with a low budget and how! The main-reason, that I found, this movie to coming across so strong is its constant hold on the real elements of the script. The annoying repetition of the word 'yeah' in combination with the thoughtful consideration for the things that a real person would do in reality, make this film rise out above the rest even with just a small budget. The cast form a coherent link between the story and how its told despite the horrific reality on which it is based. The truth of the matter is that Fargo with the Coen brothers' extreme precision to detail is in all respects a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in the theater, I felt the way I imagine people must've felt when "The Wizard of Oz" premiered in 1939. Or when Gregory Peck first appeared on screen in "To Kill A Mockingbird" in 1962. Or the first appearance of Hannibal Lector in "The Silence of The Lambs" in 1991. The incomparable Frances McDormand's performance as Margie is the stuff of film lore. She hits every note right. Insanely funny but never really clown-like. But also benevolent and tough, without doing a personality 180. It's legendary.Everything else about "Fargo" is utter cinematic perfection. No filmmakers on Earth can tell a story like the Coens. It's the perfect mix of dark humor, creepy atmosphere, and genuine humanity. It unfolds flawlessly. Every artistic tool in the Brothers' box is perfectly utilized. It's their magnum opus. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never think of Minnesota the same again after seeing 'Fargo'. 'Fargo' is based on the fascinating true story about a loser car salesman (William H. Macy) and his ill-fated attempt to strike rich by paying two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, so his father-in-law (Harve Pushnell) who's one of the richest men in the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota would pay off an $80,000 ransom. The car salesman would then split the money 50/50 with the kidnappers after getting his wife back. This all went terribly wrong, and a pregnant police officer (Frances McDormand - in her Academy Award winning role) started to put together the pieces of the puzzle. 'Fargo' is the film that tells this story, and the Coen Brothers (Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Raising Arizona) do an incredible job telling it. 'Fargo' is the perfect blend of suspense, drama and dark comedy, and will have you on the edge of your seat in suspense one moment, and the other moment in hysteria. The acting is terrific, especially Frances McDormand who received her well deserved Oscar as the kind, funny and perceptive police detective solving the three homicides that are committed by the two kidnapping thugs during the course of the kidnapping. William H. Macy is perfectly cast in his very best screen performance to date as the nervous and oafish weasel car salesman, that should have won him the Oscar back in 1996. Steve Buscemi is amazing as the violent, twisted and scrawny kidnapper with a scary temper. His performance should have gotten him an Oscar nomination, no buts about it. Buscemi also provides us with one of his best performances in 'Fargo'. Peter Stormare does a decent job as the stone-cold villain partner of Buscemi, and The Drew Carey Show's John Carroll Lynch is sincere and funny during the very limited screen time he has. Harve Pushnell also provides great work as always, as the rich and selfish father-in-law to Macy's character. The directing and writing are most likely the two best qualities of the film and should have gotten The Coen Brothers double Oscars (instead of just one for Best Screenplay). Roger Deakins gives us amazing cinematography as always, and 'Fargo' has a powerful musical score. If you haven't seen 'Fargo' already, you should definitely rent it, and if you have seen it and don't own it, buy it on DVD now! The special edition DVD includes a documentary about the true incident entitled 'Minnesota Nice', interviews with the Coen Brothers and Frances McDormand, audio commentary by the film's cinematographer Roger Deakins, a trivia track, a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, movie trailers of the film, and more. 'Fargo' is an excellent motion picture, but not for everybody. If you're offended by graphic violence and don't find any humor in it, chances are you will not take a liking to 'Fargo'. So, if you are a member of any anti-movie violence organization or anything like that steer clear of 'Fargo'. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #48</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers do not write a movie based on a situation but on the setting and its cast of characters. Although we are not in Arizona anymore, the story shift to another world....far up north. We are still speaking English, but it is far from how they talk in the rest of the country. The characters create the situation and create the entertainment. When looking at a story and asking yourself, what comes first, the plot or the characters? When it comes to the Coen Brothers, the characters create their plot. Considered by many to be their best work, Fargo is unique and far beyond good. It is a movie made before its time for an audience who doesn't totally understand it. Yes, this is a drama / mystery, with moments of comedy and also a thriller / modern day horror movie with realistic monsters. With a French New Wave style, Fargo is perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two Coen brothers movies that stand the test of time after repeated viewings. There is the neo-noir Miller's Crossing (1990) and Fargo. Far from what went on to win the Oscar for best picture (English Patient), this film is a smaller, more personal tale of tragedy and violence in a place you'd least expect it.The Coens are sometimes criticised for their work being too cold, sometimes distant and too intelligent for the audience. Well, they never seemed to be that in-depth to me, instead they also seemed to create really enjoyable movies. Fargo is a really fun movie to watch, although I can understand it might be a little difficult for some to watch - the contrast of comedy and violence is quite extreme in scenes, but I didn't have a problem with this.Fargo is cold and distant in one sense, being that is is set in the beautifully frozen Minosotta. The story is the usual Coen "noir" set up - and always the Coens give an edge to the story. The Coens are "...like a goddamn twist!" as Leo said in Miller's Crossing. William H. Macey giving another great performance plays the husband who hires two inept crooks, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife, so he can get the ransom money from the father of his wife, Harve Presnell (who is so stubborn is good).This story reminded me of the Coen's love for double crossings, mishaps in the plan and tragedy - themes we have seen in Miller's Crossing (deception, double, triple crossings) and Blood Simple with murder, adultery etc. Fargo has refined this technique, as the themes are woven into the tight narrative and amusing atmosphere.Being a relatively short the film, the story really does truck along well, never really becoming boring - unless you are not in tune to the Coen brothers wit and style. For every violent scene (and believe me, there are some!) there is a funny one, like the infamous "He was kinda funny lookin'..." dialogue.The performances are fantastic, Macy being brilliant, and McDormand on top form as the pregnant cop Marge Gunderson. Seeing as we don't see her until half an hour in, her presence is powerful, just subtly burning up the screen. Buscemi and Stormare are a great duo as the two hapless crooks who are carrying out the plan for Macy. Stormare is just chilling, with his cold as ice stare, and Buscemi neurotic and hilarious. Even the bit part actors give great performances, just adding to the reality of Fargo. The accents were thought to be the main source of the comedy, but they are genuine accents! I loved it.The music by Carter Burwell is haunting and cold, just like the land it accompanies. Cinematography by Roger Deakins is some of the most inventive and fresh stuff I have seen in years. The fact it is more original than the "David Lean" homage, The English Patient, is another pointer to argue why this film didn't win Best Picture. A disgrace.Possibly one of the best films of the 90's.Is it the best Coen brother's movie? "You're darned tootin'!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Brilliant Coen Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the Coens for many things; it is especially for the unique vision and quality they put into their brilliant movies, but it is also for their uncompromising study of the darkest side of Mankind. Ever since they debuted with the superb 'Blood Simple,' the Coens have explored the worst in man's soul and psyche, the horrible things that makes him tick in disturbing ways, the things that leads one to violent, pointless things like kidnapping and murder. 'Fargo' is their darkest movie second only to their disturbing debut. A saving grace this movie has which the other didn't have is basically the dark humour in the right moments to lighten the tension in the air.Like 'Blood Simple,' the story is straightforwardly simple and linear: Jerry Lundegaard, in the middle of personal problems the viewer never figures out exactly what they are, hires Carl and Gaer, two inhuman criminals, to kidnap his wife Jean so his father-in-law will pay a ransom, a part of which will go straight into Jerry's pockets. It sounds too simple to be interesting, but 'Fargo' is really one of most gripping thrillers I've ever seen! The first half hour unfolds smoothly as one would expect ? Jerry's plan working just perfectly to avoid innocent deaths ? until an unexpected incident turns everything upside-down. Like Carl tells Jerry, "the circumstances have changed." And this is when Marge, the most unlikely sheriff to investigate a triple murder ever, comes into the picture and the movie reaches the heights of greatness and perfection.This movie is built on two very simple, well-achieved things. Sure, one can go on about the outstanding cinematography that captures the snow-white landscapes of Minnesota so beautifully, the smooth editing, and the Coens' use of the camera. But 'Fargo' owes its quality to an intelligent screenplay and a wide range of outstanding performances. The dialogue ? clear, subtle and economical ? transmits volumes of information in just a few lines; not a line is wasted or fails to humanise one of the characters. The story is so fast-paced within the first ten lines we already know what everything is about. Most movies don't really start until the end of the first half hour to comply with the three-act structure device of the plot point. Relationships are established quickly: one immediately gets the sense Wade thinks Jerry is a bumbling fool who can't handle too much responsibility; one sees Jerry doesn't like Wade just from the way he feels uncomfortable in his present. Carl and Gaer's relationship is built on the fact these two men know nothing about each other and have nothing to talk about, as Carl points out to Gaer; the former is the biggest chatterer around, the latter is silent: in essence, these are two complete strangers who just got together to pull of a kidnapping and get money. The quality of this screenplay is also evident in the way the Coens transmit so much information visually: so many things are left unsaid because strong images fill in the holes for the viewer. In the end, this screenplay is the one of the best and most economical screenplays ever written for modern cinema! The performances are consistently great, too! William H. Macy captures the pathetic existence that forms Jerry so well! His lack of determination, his little mannerisms, his idiolect, his hesitation, cravenness, his sense of insecurity; Jerry might just be the greatest human failure in American cinema and Macy played him brilliantly! Frances McDormand is also perfect as the unusual heroine ? a pregnant small town sheriff looking for two criminals responsible for a triple murder. McDormand plays Marge wonderfully with all the local innocence inherent in the character, her good manners and strength, so opposed to Jerry's weakness which becomes his doom. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are well-cast as two cruel, greedy, ruthless criminals who recklessly kill and hurt people just for the ridiculous sum of $80,000. Human greed was never so well portrayed as in 'Fargo.' Stormare is great even though he remains silent throughout most of the movie; but Buscemi is just electrifying! He shines in every scene he's in, whether it be when he's collecting the money from Wade, when he's getting his ass kicked hard or just when he shows glimpses of his cruelty like when he snickers at Jerry's helpless, hand-bound, blind-folded wife trying to make her way across a frozen landscape. One last great performance was Harve Presnell's as Wade, the determined father-in-law who spells doom for Jerry.'Fargo' is consistently perfect throughout its 90 minutes: it's a small, but very intense and fast-paced movie. It's not as gripping as the Coens' debut, the movie which to me strikes more similarities with this one than any other Coen movie. But this one isn't as violent, there's also a fantastic dark, acid humour in every scene. The scene where the hulking Shep Proudfoot beats the crap out of a naked Carl is priceless! Like 'Blood Simple,' I originally didn't enjoy 'Fargo:' it took me a few viewings to finally love this movie; today it's one of my favourites! I'm constantly watching it on DVD, marvelling at the small details that make this movie so consistently good. It's another great movie for the Coens in what is an otherwise perfect career!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** The weird kidnap plan in the movie "Fargo" was hatched at the "King of Clubs" bar in Fargo ND. Ex-cons Carl Showalter &amp; Gaear Grimsrud, Steve Buscemi &amp; Peter Stormare, meet with Brainerd Minn., The home of Paul Bunyan &amp; the Blue Ox, car executive Jerry Lundergaard, William H. Macy, in this half-baked plan to kidnap his wife Jean, Kristin Rudrud. All this in order to secure a $80,000.00 ransom from her dad Wade Gustafson, Harve Presnell, who's one of the richest men in Brainerd.Jerry and the two hoods were brought together by a mutual friend ex-con Shep Proudfoot, Steve Reevis, who not only spent time with both Carl &amp; Gaear in the Stillwaters State Pen but also works as a car mechanic at the dealership that Jerry is working at and who his father-in-law Wade owns.Like the off-the-wall misfits that they are the plan goes to pot as soon as it's executed with a bungled kidnapping of Jean and later that evening the murder of a state trooper, James Saulke, and two windlessness who happened to come on the scene, J. Todd Anderson &amp; Michelle Suzanne LeDoux, by the somewhat unstable Gear. Jerry needs the $40,000.00, his half in the deal, to replace money that he embezzled from the car dealership that he's working at. As the movie "Fargo" go along it's marry way it, the money that Jerry embezzled, rises to almost $400,000.00. After the murdered bodies of the three victims of Gaear's rampage are discovered the police chief of Brainerd Marge Gunderson, Frances McDormand,is called into the case. Marge slowly gets all the evidence together and puts it in place thus cracking the murder/kidnap mystery wide open. Marge is a lot like TV's Let. Colombo, at first you don't for a moment realize that she's a policewomen much less the Chief of police in Brainerd County.Later her street, or lets say country, smarts and bulldog determination makes you as well as everyone else watching the movie believers long before the film "Fargo" is over.Homely looking with an enormous appetite, due to her being pregnant, Marge slowly gets to the bottom of the murder mystery by zeroing in on Jerry who she felt was keeping some very important information for her. He doesn't realize that a car, a tan Ciera that was spotted at the murder scene,is missing from his car lot and that one of his workers Shep was in cohorts by phone with the two ex-cons! Shep received a phone call from the bar-motel where the two were staying at.Jerry tries to be cute even with his fellow partners in crime by upping the ransom to one million dollars without them knowing about it and insisting that he deliver the goods,the one million dollar ransom, by himself; so he can keep most of the money to cover his string embezzlement's at the car dealership. The entire scheme backfires when Wade insists that he handle the ransom pay-off, after all it's his money, that leads to him to getting shot and killed by an outraged Carl who was in turn is shot in the jaw by Wade before he died. At the hideout with Gaear and the kidnapped Jean, Carl also tried to cheat Gaear out of the Million by giving him only $40,000.00 of the ransom, It's hen when Carl finds thats Gaear murdered Jean and ends up getting split in half and murdered himself with an ax by his insane partner. Meanwhile Marge closes in on the gang and has Jerry on the run and out of the state, he's later arrested by the cops at a motel in Bismarck ND. Gaear is also captured by Marge as he tried to hide the evidence of his crimes, the bodies of Jean &amp; Carl, by chopping them to pieces with a wood-chopping machine. Even though the movie "Fargo" has it's share of thrills and excitement it also has it's touching moments too. One of the most moving scenes in the movie has to do with Marge meeting an old high school friend of hers at a local Minneapolis hotel restaurant Mike Yanagita, Steve Park. Mike goes into a whole song and dance about him working for the Honeywell Corp.as an engineer and how he lost his wife Linda, who Marge also knew from high school, to leukemia. Unable to talk anymore Mike begins to break down right in front of the startled policewomen sobbing uncontrollably. Later Marge found out that Mike was never married and doesn't work for the Honeywell Corp. and has been living with his parents since he left high school. If Mike was honest about his feelings to Marge, as well as any of his other friends, he would have easily gotten the sympathy that he wanted instead of being a phony to both Marge as well as to himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "other" characters in a Coen Brothers movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather than expound on the excellent review of Robert Maxwell (above) I'll just say I like the way he points out the finer qualities of a Joel and Ethan Coen movie. To a "t" as a matter of fact.I always like to think of Coen brothers movies this way though, and the brothers are consistent in this, they always have two extra characters in their film. One is the scenery or the look of the film. The other is the dialog; specifically accents or dialects.This was true of their first, Blood Simple, with stark flat Texas scenery and the dialog heavily laced with Texas twang/drawl and their last (as of this writing) Intolerable Cruelty equally laced with the beautiful scenery of Southern California and the rapid fire language of attorneys. I especially enjoyed "Puffy" von Espy's testimony.============= possible spoiler =============I suppose what I admire most about this particular film is that they not only pull off the desolation of the upper Midwest in deep winter they also manage to capture the simple (yes even seemingly stupid) yet forthright people that inhabit that region of the country. And yes though the two criminals are the most colorful and interesting of the characters one has to admire the police chief (played by Frances McDormand) who is not only female but eight months pregnant. She commands a great deal of consideration and respect from her men who remain pleasant, caring, and totally dedicated to her and the performance of their jobs. Even her husband, whose claim to fame is being selected for his mallard painting which is to be printed on the three cent stamp, seems to understand just how truly exceptional his wife is, and in turn, becomes truly exceptional himself.Is Marge dainty and fragile in her condition? Not at all, yet she is one hundred percent female just the same.William H. Macy performs beautifully as the John Q. Milquetoast husband who just can't seem to do anything right.Harve Presnell is convincing as Jean Lundegaard's business-man father.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are credible as two bumbling, rather stupid, and completely deadly criminals.Only Kristin Rudrüd seems to have an almost non-part (no speaking, but plenty of screaming), but hey, this is her first film. The screams, reactions, and fear were well done.It's a strange little movie, but interesting and well worth watching for that reason; just like all Coen brother's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen...I had high expectations, and got so disappointed. What is so great about this movie ????? It's so strange and not funny at all, and the genre was supposed to be crime/thriller...did not see much of that. This movie seems to be a movie that tries very hard to be funny, but it just isn't. The characters are too annoying, too animated to really be funny. I can't understand why this movie is on people's list over the best movies ever.However, I do know that a lot of people like this movie, but I will never know why.The actor playing Jerry Lundegaard doesn't really come across as very talented,he just irritates me, and make me wish I didn't see the movie.I was thinking about the last scene of the movie, with Norm and Marge in bed, and I kind of thought "hey, maybe they are trying to tell us something. Maybe it is good to be good, at least you are happy. But if you are a criminal everything will go wrong and you will be unhappy". but hey, what do I know, I really really didn't like the movie, and I will never recommend this movie to anybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is one of those films that, if it is on, I have to sit down and watch. No matter how many times I have seen it, this film still enthralls me. A very bleak yet funny account of a botched kidnapping, in which a used car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, in order to fleece his rich father in law. However as the plan becomes reality, all that can go wrong does, and a series of tragic events unfold, which spells doom for Lundegaard and sets off a slew of collateral damage, which tears apart a tiny north mid-western town. The small everyday nuances that the Coen brothers seem to relish exploiting in this film, and the innocence of these good hearted small town folk is what gives this film it much needed sense of reality. A sense of reality which a film like this needs in order to stand out and to have any impact whatsoever, and this film has tons of impact. Frances McDormand is excellent as Marge Gunderson, the quirky yet intelligent Brainerd police officer that is investigating several murders near the town of Brainerd. Unbeknownst to Marge her investigation will lead her into Lundegaard's web of kidnapping, murder, and betrayal. And what she discovers will test her emotional and moral strength. Near the end of the film, you can see the emotion and the pain in her face as she tries to comprehend what she has just witnessed and as she realizes what incredible evil men are capable of. What is worse is that it was all for a little money. As Marge says in the film "There's more to life than a little money, ya know. Don'tcha know that?"Most of the laughs come from the way the people talk and interact with one another, which if you are not from the mid-west or northern great lakes area can be pretty amusing at first. But after the shock of the accents wear off, Steve Buscemi's "funny looking, little guy" character as the bumbling foul mouth thug is funny until it becomes just mean spirited and then tragic. Peter Stormare plays a stoic and frighteningly calm murderer and sidekick to Steve Buscemi's character.The film is great and overall very entertaining, but one of the things That I love watching every time I see this film, is watching William H Macy's character place the noose around his neck and watch it slowly tighten, until he has no more room to maneuver and is suffocated (figuratively speaking) by the lies he tells and then the lies he tells in order to cover up his original lies. Overall a fascinating film with an intelligent script and great performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and interesting thriller by the Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out in 1997, a Norwegian movie-critic wrote that "This is the film that makes Quentin Tarantino look like an amateur!". After I read that line, I felt that "Fargo" was either going to surprise me, or just make me mad. It didn't really do any of those things. And even though there was something original about it, it was clearly that it couldn't compete with Tarantino-masterpieces such as "Pulp Fiction" (1994) or "Reservoir Dogs" (1992). So I couldn't say that I liked it. But after this....the Coen-brothers came out with another film called "The Big Lebowski" (1998), which is among the best comedies I've ever seen, and has become one of my favorite films. So it was easier to watch "Fargo" for the second time. And after all...it is a pretty good film.This film takes place in Minnesota, and we meet Jerry Lundegaard, who is a family-father who works at a car-firm. Jerry seems to have a bit of a money-problem, so he decides to rent someone to kidnap his wife, so that his rich father-in-law can pay the kidnappers AND (without knowing it, off course) Lundegaard a whole lot of money to free his wife. Lundegaard think this is a plan that's going to work without any problems, but as the kidnapping begins, so does the complications.There's many reason to think of Quentin Tarantino when watching this film. It's a film where the characters and the dialogs are in focus, and over all it has elements that you don't find in the average American films...just like Tarantino's works. Quentin is known for borrowing (or stealing, as many prefer to say) from other films of different genres, then putting it together and blessing it with is own personality and originality. That's something the Coen-brothers also are doing.When basing your film on characters, you need good actors. William Macy is doing very well in his role as the scatterbrained and pathetic Jerry Lundegaard. Steve Buscemi and Swedish actor Peter Stormare are memorable as the two kidnappers who are doing their part of messing the plan up. Frances McDormand, who received an Oscar Academy Award for her performance, plays the pregnant police-officer Marge, one of the most cosily persons I've ever seen on film...a very good performance. As for the rest of the cast, they're all doing pleasing jobs in their roles as all the funny characters you find in this film."Fargo" is a thriller filled with a very black kind of humor, and that's probably what I like the most about it. As the story goes on and develops, it provides many intense and thrilling scenes and moments, also strong violence which tops itself during a famous and bizarre part of the film's ending. But at the same time, it has me laughing my way through it all. All the people and characters that shows up and the situations they're in are so absurd or ridiculous that I just can't stop laughing at times. Actually, the film as a whole is just peculiar enough to be appreciated by someone who wants to watch a crime-thriller which is a bit different, and has something extra to offer.I have yet to see any of the films that's being regarded as the Coen-brothers' real masterpieces..."Miller's Crossing" (1990) or "Barton Fink" (1991), but "Fargo" is definitely a film one shouldn't miss out on. It's thrilling, original, very funny and over all a quality film, though not a masterpiece as many wants to label it.8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you see that a movie maker has a lot of talent? Very simple: give him or her a small budget and an unknown cast to make a movie with. If the film is still any good, than you know you have found someone with more talent and brains than the average of today's Hollywood directors. Well, the Coen brothers, certainly seem to have the talent, because "Fargo" is more than just worth a watch. It has a good story, very nice acting as well as drama and some excellent humor to offer. They don't have to rely on special effects to make this movie work, the story, the direction and the acting have done it all by themselves.Jerry Lundegaard is a hypocritical and dishonest car sales man who has a big financial problem. At first he doesn't know how to solve it, but than he has a great idea: his father-in-law is a very rich man, so Lundegaard decides that he will have his wife being kidnapped by some criminals, who are real losers. Her father will pay a lot of money to get her out of the hands of the criminals, he'll collect all the money and give a part of it to the criminals. The rest he will use to pay his debts with. But than everything goes terribly wrong and Lundegaard can do absolutely nothing about it to stop it.Even though this may not be the most original movie I've ever seen, this still is one of the better. One thing that I'll always remember about this movie, next to the good acting, directing and story, is the immense amount of snow: it all looked so cold that it almost made me dive into my closet to find an extra sweater. I give this movie an 8/10. I really had a good time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Funniest black comedies, and one of the most well directed thrillers ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is an excellent film and it's one of my favorites. Everything about this movie is great, from the score, to the tragic plot, the dark comedy, the editing, directing, and the performances. The comedy of this film is something that is perceived differently by everyone, some think it's hilarious, others don't get it, and some don't see why it's funny at all. All of the comedy is hilarious, but it takes some thought to understand certain things.The plot is quite simple. A car salesman(William H. Macy) is in debt and needs money that he can't receive, so he hires two thugs to kidnap his wife, forcing her wealthy father to pay a Ransom. Quickly, everything about his plan goes completely wrong, resulting in the deaths of several people across Minnesota, caused by the kidnappers he hired. On the trail of the thugs is pregnant cop, Marge(Frances McDormand). The characters are simple people, but they are very memorable. William H. Macy is excellent and very believable as the over extended car salesman, it's no wonder he was nominated for best supporting actor. Steve Buscemi, who is one of my favorite actors, is great as the kidnapper, Carl Showalter, who is trying to get money by all means possible, Frances McDormand is very deserving of her Oscar for her performance as the pregnant Midwestern cop. Another memorable character is Gaer Grimsrud(Peter Stormare). He is Carl's psychopathic associate in crime, and he is very quiet. Peter Stormare is very good, he makes a convincing sociopath, which is a difficult role to play.The plot is simple, and there aren't any BIG twists that many people look for in movies, but that is part of the beauty of this film. The Coen brothers were able to weave a story of a kidnapping and murder into a film with a simple, but very involved plot.The editing is very good, especially considering how visual the film is. There is one scene about an hour into the film that is very well paced and suspenseful, and a lot goes on in that scene as well. All of it is perfectly guided by the editing.In my opinion, this film never gets old. The humor always stays funny, the dialog always stays clever and entertaining, and the plotting always keeps me interested. This is a gem of American cinema, and I hope you enjoy it the same way I have enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Fargo was an excellent movie. Frances McDormand was perfect and deserved her Oscar, the plot was well put together, and the pace flowed well. However, I have to say that this film is just a little bit overrated. It is an excellent comedy, but when I first saw it, I was expecting a little more. It was hilarious (those accents), however the ending was weak and I don't think it was an Oscar caliber movie. I also can't see why it is on the top 100 films of all time list according to AFI. It was like 90 or something. Comedy wise, it's right up there, but poignant films such as American Beauty, Almost Famous and Traffic are much more deserving of being on a 100 Greatest list. I can see how it is popular, but it isn't "that" good. Overall though, it was very enjoyable to watch and it is a cult classic.9/10...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, Literate Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard, a Minnesota car salesman with financial problems, has come up with what he believes will be a foolproof way of extorting money from his wealthy father-in-law, whom he dislikes. He arranges for two petty criminals to kidnap his wife Jean and hold her for ransom. The idea is that Jerry's father in law will pay the ransom, which will then be split between Jerry and the two crooks. Unfortunately, the plot misfires. After carrying out the kidnapping, the crooks' car is stopped by a policeman, whom they shoot dead in order to evade detection. Matters then get out of control, as the two inept kidnappers desperately try and cover their tracks in an ever-worsening spiral of bloodshed.Although it details grisly events, the film is closer in tone to a black comedy than a crime drama or horror film. Much of the grim humour arises from the incompetence of Jerry and his two associates, who see themselves as successful criminals but in reality are simply losers, out of their league when they try to pull off a major crime. Unlike some black comedies, however, the tone of the film is not amoral or cynical. The moral order is upheld by Minnesota's own avenging angel,Marge Gunderson, the pregnant female small-town chief of police responsible for investigating the series of murders. At first sight the homely, home-loving Marge seems to be a slow, plodding rustic hick, but her determination and painstaking police work eventually prove to be the downfall of the evildoers.I was interested to note that the Coen brothers are themselves from Minnesota. Although I have never visited the upper Midwest, it was clear to me that the film has a strong sense of place. The film is set in winter, and there are some eerily beautiful shots of the snow-covered Midwestern landscape. Even to a Brit like me, it was quite clear that the area has its own distinctive dialect- the word "yes", for example, is normally pronounced as "yah", presumably a result of the district's German/Scandinavian heritage- and that this dialect was being used in the film. Another factor that added to the atmospheric feel was the haunting music composed by Carter Burwell.The film has an intelligent, literate script, and the acting is always of high quality. I was delighted that Frances McDormand won the Best Actress award for her portrayal of Marge- delighted because this was a deliberately unglamorous role, about as far as one can get from Hollywood's standard Charlie's Angels image of female crime-fighters. William Macy was very good as Jerry whom he portrayed not as a criminal mastermind but rather as a harassed, middle-aged businessman desperately trying any scheme, however crazy, that might ease his financial worries. The two criminals were also well played by Steve Buscemi as the neurotic, garrulous Showalter and Peter Stornare as the sullen, taciturn Grimsrud.I am not too familiar with the work of the Coen brothers; of their other films I have only seen "Intolerable Cruelty" and the disappointing "Miller's Crossing". "Fargo", however, is a marvellous black comedy and work of a very high quality. In my view it was unlucky not to get the Best Picture award for 1997; I certainly preferred it to the dull and overlong "The English Patient". 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful illustration of the absence of intelligence in criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evil is interesting. Fargo shows us, in stark terms, the futility of trying to pull of the Perfect Crime. If you study The Darwin Awards or DumbCriminalActs.com, you find that the criminal mind is so arrogant as to think that nothing can go wrong with their "well-laid" plans. And, when an auto sales-manager who thinks his manhood rests solely in how much money he makes, sets out to commit the first violent act of his life, we get a good insight into how everything can go wrong and WILL go wrong. Jerry's plot to kidnap his wife thru surrogates, thwart his father-in-law's overbearing personality, lie to his confederates about the size of the ransom demand and then profit in six-figures all comes to nothing, with a trail of dead bodies that don't immediately point to the real culprit. We learn that Jerry is no smarter or deliberate than any other felon in the big house when we spy him trying to fool GMAC about selling some non-existent cars, then trying to pocket the loan dollars. Jerry's evidently been in the trade awhile and knows better, but he's confident that he can put one over on those dopes at who loan money for a living'(not bloody likely). Now that the GMAC plot is failing, he goes ahead with a much more ambitious and dangerous scheme and let's the petty crooks he met abduct his wife from her home. We wonder if, left alone awhile longer, Jerry might feign madness and machine-gun everyone he knows in order to cover up his earlier sins. It's the honest, steady people in this wicked world who make a positive, lasting contribution to life as we know it. They're represented by Police Chief Margie Gunderson, her loving husband Norm, as well as her local cops, the bartender at the Moose Lodge, etc. My grandparents are all from Fargo &amp; Bismark, and I'm glad that someone finally made a movie where everyone TALKS NORMAL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent apres la lettre movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is about a man, Jerry Lundegaard, in my opinion Macy's best performance ever, who simply needs money. Therefore he decides to hire two men, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, to kidnap his wife. To get her back an amount of money must be paid, partly by Jerry's father in law. One Half of this sum will be paid back to Jerry, the other half to the kidnappers. A brilliant way to get yourself some money, isn't it? After having kidnapped this wife, things go terribly wrong for our two kidnappers. So wrong that, at the end of the movie, almost all characters are involved in the problem.During the first thirty minutes of this film I thought: 'What kind of crap am I watching now?' This feeling faded away during watching the movie. Only after the movie however, I realized how good the movie was I just had seen. Only then the real kick besieged me. I call this the apres la lettre effect. Realising only after the movie how good it was.The movie is so good because of the total credulent acting of Buscemi in special. We all know he is a genius at playing queer roles, but this is the absolute top. Very good and witty acting by Frances McDormand to, and not to forget the quiet and mysterious role of Peter Stormare.10 out of 10</fullReview>

The setting in the snowy, cold landscape makes the movie even more chilling than it already is.

		<fullReview>Just when the ultra-ironic, ultra-violent thriller seemed to have been done to death by Tarantino and his acolytes, along came the Coen brothers to breathe fresh life into the genre. David Mamet-favourite Macy is wonderfully weak and wicked as Jerry Lundegaard the Swedish-American car-salesman whose attempts to mastermind the perfect crime - the kidnapping of his wife - go horribly, violently and hilariously wrong. For a start he has hired two trigger-happy crooks, the verbose Carl (Buscemi) and the taciturn Gaear (Stormare) to carry out the kidnapping. Pretty soon people are starting to get shot and this attracts the attention of the smart, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand, who deservedly won an Academy Award for her tough, funny, touching performance). With its central plot strand of the well-planned crime spiralling wildly out of control, the film investigates similar territory to the Coen brothers' brilliant debut Blood Simple, but Fargo is a more assured work, lighter and more layered. The cast, boasting at least three scene-stealing performances (Macy, McDormand and Buscemi), are on top form. The film manages the neat trick of trumping Tarantino by not merely being filled with laughs and slickly handled, literally visceral action sequences, but also presenting rounded, recognizably human characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-SPOILER ALERT-!!!!!With the release of Fargo the Coen brothers have once again established themselves as top-of-the range film directors, who can produce expertly crafted, well plotted, and hilarious movies. Fargo might be full of blood and considered unsuitable for anyone younger than 16, but it's so over-the top at times, that you can't help but laugh. Not that this is a bad thing. Too often we're exposed to thrillers that take themselves too seriously and revel in the dark light they cast upon themselves. The cast is excellent. Once again William H Macy provides a stunning performance, this time as the crafty -- yet mild mannered -- Jerry Lundegraad. Jerry works as a car salesman and as the movies starts, we learn that he's in a slight bother (as usual). He's so hard up for cash that he hires a pair of dim-witted thugs to kidnap his wife in the hope that her rich father will pay the ransom, and Jerry can get a sizeable profit from it. Predictably things go wrong on a titanic scale, and by the end of the movie, most of the main character's have been reduced to rotting carcases.What makes Fargo irresistible to watch in the end is it's spellbinding photography, as we're exposed to scenes of snowy America, and the interesting and amusing characters. All in all, if you've not seen this movie, you're missing out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is the Coen brothers' second best film (the Big Lebowski is just too funny so I have to put that as #1). Probably the best film of 1996, it tells the story of a simple kidnapping plan that goes wrong in almost every way imaginable. Oscar winner Frances McDormand shines as the pregnant police officer assigned to the murders surrounding the crime, and William H. Macey steals the show as the man who initiates the kidnapping. Coen regulars Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare give good performances as the two kidnappers. Directing by the Coens is also superb. The barren winter landscapes on display build up a good lonely atmosphere and make the fact that all these murders are happening believable. Give this movie a chance, it's one of the best of the 1990s... and it's all based on a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>spoilers The Coen brothers are con men of top pedigree. They tell you that Forgo is based on a true story but it isn't. They mix up all the producing, writing and directing so you don't know who's doing what. They even throw in a fictional film editor for good measure. But isn't that what film-making is all about ? using the camera to trick you into believing what you've been show.Fargo shows how magic can be created out of ordinary everyday things. A car salesman scraping snow from a windshield in a snow-covered parking lot is not exactly someone that you'll stop even for a second to look at. It just so happens in Fargo that at this point, we have identified so much with this particular car salesman (William H. Macy) that his every little frustration sends vibrations through us.When I pressed the play button of the DVD for Fargo, I was thinking that I was in for a suspense ride like as Se7en. It didn't take me long to realize that this was a completely different kettle of fish, and I liked it. Telling the story exactly the way it is happening, without hidden twists, the Coen brothers show how they can still throw a surprise at you at every turn. When police woman Marge (Frances McDormand) suddenly bends down beside the overturn car with a shot victim inside, as if she suddenly sees a clue, it turns out that it's morning sickness. Towards the end of the movie, approaching the hideout of the two kidnappers (Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare) whom the audience just saw in an argument, what does Marge (and the audience) see ?? one of them just about finishing grinding something through a wood chipper, picking up one last foot (still in a neat white sock, with the sole facing upwards) working hard to push it down. You're at a lost whether to feel indignant or to burst out in a hilarious fit of laughs. Another amazing thing is that while most good films got you empathising with the hero and/or heroin, the Coen brothers got you empathising with the whole lot of them in Fargo: the good (McDormand), the bad (Macy) and the uglies (Buscemi and Stormare), whenever its their turn on the screen. With the kidnappers, Buscemi and Stormare provide black comedy in the highest order. Macy is reminiscing of some of the clever criminals in Hitchcock's movie who has a sort of sardonic attraction that watching them scheming and plotting, you identify more and more with them. But it's McDormand who, appearing in less than half of the running time of the movie, convincingly won the Best Actress Oscar. (Macy was nominated for best supporting).The few understated scenes between this earthly, pregnant policewoman and her artist husband carry more love and tenderness than all the stories in Lost Actually put together. But then, this ever smiling, ever courteous investigator can be awe-inspiring. Watch how one simple change of expression on her face sends the car salesman to flee. Fargo is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking back. While the gory violence comes across as more comic than brutal, there are hidden chilly situations. The encounter with former school-day suitor Mike Yanagita starts out quite funny and ends a little soggy. But it's the subsequent phone call which reveals the truth that sends a shudder down your spine. Fargo is full of wonderful surprises that delight those who can appreciate.</fullReview>

Balance is achieved in every part of the construction of this film, and that is what makes something so fantastical, believable. I've watched this film several times and cannot find any mistakes yet.

		<fullReview>One of the best movie of 1990s. Great acting by all the lead players.The snow shown in the movie adds chills to the dark storyline. Peter Stormare wins the show. The steely snakelike stare and cold bloodedness of the character he played in the movie propelled him into limelight. Buscemi is at his best.Funny and witty as ever.

		<shortDescription>Movie Making at It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers let their talent shine in the movie masterpiece. The casting couldn't be any better in the 1996 indy movie. Francis McDormand and William H. Macy shine in the gem. McDormand received a well deserved Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson. I can see no one else able to do such a great job and able to make the character so funny. Fargo was hands down the best movie of 1996 (against The English Patient, Jerry Maguire, and Independence Day) and from all the movies I've seen, about the last original movie made. Think about it, what genre is Fargo under, comedy, drama, crime, thriller. It is all of them. And now that the 90s are over, I can say Fargo is the 3rd best of the decade (#1 Schindler's List, #2 Forrest Gump) and deserved more at the Academy Awards, William H. Macy showed what he do and made a huge impact. Seeing him now in Door to Door and The Cooler it a matter of time before he gets his Oscar. With the Coen Brothers at their finest, this is a movie for all to see. AFI #84. 10 out of 10RECOMMENDED: The Pink Panther (1963), A Shot in the Dark (1964), and Blood Simple (1984)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I sow Fargo I wonder; has this really happened. Bacause, in the starts of the film it said that it is a true story. With the odd characters it did'nt make any sense. But the second time I saw it, it was a much better film, cause I have seen on the internet that this was not a true story, but just ironic meant by Choen. The first time I saw it I did'nt know it was a comedy, cus I thought it was a true story. I gave it a strong 7 on the rating. Almost 8. This is perhaps one of the top 10 movie I have ever seen.Thats good. I really like the sweeping style of the film! The music is great. Allright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is in a financial crisis and he comes up with the idea of cooperating with a couple of wee criminals from Fargo, North Dakota to kidnap his wife and demand his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom so he can split the money with the kidnappers. His father-in-law is later shot dead by the abductors because he shouldn't even be the one who go see them. Then they gunned down a cop and two witnesses on the highway- things go inevitably wrong. The heavily pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is in charge with investigating a case about a stolen vehicle, which leads her to a visit with Lundegaard. Gunderson is about to uncover a chain of bloody crimes.'Fargo' is a gripping, dark film and indeed, in a way, it is a comedy because at times it makes you laugh. Frances McDormand and William H Macy were quite brilliant, Steve Buscemi is funny and his quiet partner (unfortunately I can't remember or locate his name) is even funnier. The whole movie leaves you freezing, literally, not just because of the setting, but also because of the plot. I admire the Coen brothers' work, such as 'The Big Lebowski', which is very different from this one, but is dead hilarious.</fullReview>

Marge was great, and I am glad to see she was rewarded for her performance. The hookers at the bar...the kidnappers...and the bar owner everyone was just this side of "off" and yet so real I couldn't help laughing.

		<shortDescription>the coens at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the coens, and when I saw this movie this christmas, I was not dissapointed. As a 14 year old, one might think this movie's subtle humor and nuances and relatively relaxed pace may bore my agegroup, but I believe that this movie has a little something for everyone. SPOILER!!!!!! From the beautiful scenery and ND/MN winter, to Steve Buscemi's fateful scene of being fed through the wood chipper, this is truly the coen's masterpiece. Frances Mcdormand does a beautiful job as margie, the (very) pregnant cop in perpetual marital bliss. She does a great job throughout, culminating with her "for a little bit o' money" righteous speech. William H. Macy, one of the most underappreciated actors in hollywood in my opinion, does an extraordinary job exploring the complex role of a desperate man pushed to a seemingly innocent crime, the whole time with a heavy northern midwest accent. The Coens pepper the entire thing with wonderfully subtle humour, from Mcdormand's talk to an old high school classmate to many quiet bloody jokes. The brothers directing is as usual outstanding, their intuition shines through. My favorite character of this movie is Steve Buscemi's. His foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, just me character is one of the best roles I have seen in any movie in my life. There's simply no way to describe his masterful performance that will do him service. the cream of the crop. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frances McDormand - Best Oscar speech ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unbelievable that even after Frances McDormand showed us what speeches ought to be like, people keep making silly Oscar speeches after another. However, I must confess that although I did like her, at the time I didn't really understand why she won an Oscar for the acting in Fargo.Now after all these years, I think I know. Frances McDormand adds and essence of comfort and balance to this violent story, and that is not what every person can do. Certainly not many who have been soaked in Hollywood.I truly admire that she's a type of a person who can walk up to the end of the red carpet and say that it's great that five women were given complicated rows. That she appreciates the Academy not for recognizing her, but for acknowledging their work. That instead of trying to squeeze in all the unknown names in the world, she made it short and simple by saying that the director made an actress out of her, the husband made a woman out of her, and the children made a mother out of her.I am thankful for having humans like Frances McDormand be acknowledged in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this was supposed to be a comedy, it was very dark. And quite violent. At first, the only thing funny about it was the exaggerated Scandinavian accent everyone seemed to have.As time went on, the movie was funnier. Mostly because of Frances McDormand. As hard as I tried, as annoying as I found her character, I couldn't deny she gave a great comic performance. And toward the end, she showed she had dramatic ability too.William H. Macy was pretty good, though sometimes I wondered what happened to his accent.Some comic highlights for me (hope none of these are ***SPOILERS*** , but they might be):-The scene where Marge and her partner first begin investigating a triple homicide -A cop interviews a man clearing his driveway-Two bimbos are interviewed in a bar-Jerry's conversations with the man from GMAC who doesn't believe the cars on which a loan was made really exist-Carl's partner ignores him even though Carl is covered with blood Overall, though, I had real problems with this movie. If it had been a straight mystery or a straight comedy, it might have been better. But it was too inconsistent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple plan ends terribly wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie brought to us by the Cohen brothers, who are the same people who brought us `The Big Lebowski.' It's a story that takes place in the winter setting of North Dakota, where a man comes up with a plan to get some quick cash. The basic idea is to hire some guys who will kidnap his wife and ask for a ransom. He will get the ransom money from his very wealthy father in law and split the money with the kidnappers. I am not going to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen this movie. I will just say that his `simple' plan goes terribly wrong and leaves a bunch of causalities. o This movie seems pretty simple, but has allot of shocking moments that will add to the greatness of the movie. You have a great cast of characters that portray their roles well. There is a `simple' storyline that produces many thrills and chills, yet still keeps it flowing at the `simple' pace. I was one out of a million people who had not seen this movie in full. Here it is seven years after it came out and if you haven't watched it, you should. Take a load off. It is a very good movie brought to us by very reliable storytellers.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the deepest films of recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How glorious it was to watch this movie again. I must have seen this movie at least twenty times already and I still don't get tired of it. I always see something new, enjoy laughing at jokes I know by heart, the enjoyment one can get out of this film is limitless...if one can allow themselves a bit of twisted humor.The movie is loosely based on real events that took place in Minnesota back in 1987. (I'm not referring to the character's names because they are clearly not the same people in real life). A man (William H. Macy) hires two guys (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife while he makes his father-in-law pay for the ransom. It's a far-fetched plan to begin with, but as the characters carry this plan out, it seems that the powers that be are making sure that this plan ends sour. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong for the kidnappers. After they kidnap the man's wife, they end up killing a patrol officer and two people who just happened to pass by. Enter Francis McDormand, a very content and very pregnant police chief, who is called in to investigate the crimes.As this film carries on, we see a pretty clear juxtaposition of McDormand's character and how happy she is with her life being the way it is and how the kidnappers and everyone else involved in that plot become more and more greedy. Everybody that values money over life here seems to get their come-uppance. The kidnappers, the man, the kidnapped wife's father, everyone who places their own importance over anyone else's seems to get it in the end. For those of you who haven't seen this film, don't worry, I won't spoil the hows, just the whys.On one side, it's a suspenseful thriller. At a second glance, the nuances of this movie's twisted humor shine. At another glance, the film looks epic in it's scope of a snow-swept terrain. But at the center of this movie is how getting carried away with the "American Dream" can become tragic.The performances of Francis McDormand, William H. Macy, and Steve Buscemi are the real treats among this uncanny cast. McDormand's certainty and steadfast nature make for a perfect center point for the film. Macy plays his down-trodden loser to perfection in this movie. Buscemi makes a permanent career for himself here as the perfect weird little guy to put in any film.But the biggest character of the film itself is the bleak and chilly scenery of the film and it is vividly brought to a life of it's own through cinematographer Roger Deacons, proving that he is the best living Director of Photography. Never overplaying the colors and using the natural lighting to stand out on it's own, Deacons frames and fills each shot to eerie perfection.One thing that the Coen Brothers do so well is how they portray their characters at the farthest end of their rope. The characters in this film are pushed so close to the edge that it becomes both hilarious and chilling to watch the events unfold. This movie asks the audience to find humor a train wreck, not allowing the audience to blink, but allowing them to take the situation with a grain of rock salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen's mainstream breakthrough is still one of their best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers movies thrive on irony so it's very apt that after their attempt at a big Hollywood picture 'The Hudsucker Proxy' flopped they went the opposite way with 'Fargo' and it turned out to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Because this movie was such a popular success it's easy for long time fans to overlook it while praising lesser known Coen classics like 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Barton Fink'. But the thing is 'Fargo' deserved the success because it's a very fine movie and still one of the best things they ever did. I've seen it four of five times and every time I do I slap my forehead with a "hot damn! this is GOOD!". The acting in 'Fargo' is almost like a master class, especially from Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand is of course married to Joel Coen and co-starred in the brothers debut 'Blood Simple', but her performance as Marge Gunderson, one of the nicest cops in cinema history, really made people sit up and take notice. This is Macy's only Coen movie to date, which is a shame, because he relishes dialogue and they come up with some of the best since Macy's mentor David Mamet. Steve Buscemi also gives a comic gem of a performance as an inept kidnapper hired by Macy. It's no surprise that the Coens have worked with him so regularly, he's just great. I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the most recent one I've watched, so that means this week it's 'Fargo', a brilliant movie that shouldn't be missed by any film buff. If you've seen it before, watch it again. It's the kind of movie which deserves repeated viewings.</fullReview>

As the "one line summary" says, it's one of my favorite films, because of it's humor, story, scenery, score, memorable dialogue and accents, and acting. In fact, Frances McDormand brought home an oscar for this one, and deservedly so. William H.

		<fullReview>I don't have too many comments on FARGO (well-dissected here by others), other than to say that it's one of my favorite American films of recent years, and the definite high-water mark for the always interesting Coen brothers.One of the most successful aspects of FARGO is its' agile blend of styles - modern film noir thriller, dark comedy, Americana-flavored drama, and the Coen's genuine affection for the regionalisms of America - shown here in the oft-commented-upon Minnesota accents - is on beautiful display. And - unlike some other of the Coens' films - I never got the feeling that they were looking down on their characters (which is usually true in identifiable 'regional' film).The cinematography is unforgettable, making the bleakest of Minnesota's famous winters into something eerie and gorgeous (the opening scene will go down as a classic), and the razor-sharp black humor (my favorite scene: the parking deck "Where's my daughter?" scene, which is both brutal and very uncomfortably funny) is flawless throughout.

		<fullReview>Americana with snow as Film Noir.Lies and evil will be exposed. The film shows all that, "we don't put up with that sort of thing here." Paul Bunyan is the icon, at the ready with his ax; he looms over these peoples lives -- ready to "cut down" nonsense that would threaten those who live in peace with love.The TV on in the background talking of an empty egg when Jerry Lundegaard's wife is kidnapped represents a home without love. You will be cut out -- empty in history. Conversely, it is obvious that Francis McDermand's character is full of security and love. (Her belly is full with child.) Moreover, in the last scene where the murderers have it out, the subtle oracle -- TV -- heralds news of a woman with child. The meaning is soon revealed as all of the "bad guys" get their due. They are cut down and out -- an empty egg. The "good" life is upheld in Paul Bunyan's territory and their solid way of life is preserved.</fullReview>

The story is gripping, interesting and almost funny cause of its weird sense of laugh and dramatic. The actors are superb, the music is genius, the directing and writing is perfect-and threw this; we get Fargo.William H. Macy plays the main character as Jerry, a car salesman that does some dirty business with some dirty men about getting her wife away for some days and pay some dirty b****rds, called Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.Well, the thing is; the movie is all threw genius. The cold, lonely fields filled with snow and frost is simply so...its gripping sort of. Frances McDormand plays the role as the the female officer also perfect. Blood gets spilled and its also funny; scenes where the two crooks walks right into Jerry's home and kidnaps his wife is so..odd that it gets funny actually, and there's more; but it is peculiar fun.The main melody is very nice, the viola playing soft and a beautiful melody is really great and fits perfectly into the movie's cold and dark mood. There also happens dramatic things: as when Buscemi and Stormare gets stopped by a cop with the kidnapped wife in the back, Buscemi tries sorting it out but then Stormare blows his head off, and then Buscemi walks out and starts dragging the body away, but then a couple of car lights is seen in the dark..ops! Well, this gets to something bloody too. Or the Fargo-scene number one at the finale as we see Stormare packing the body of Buscemi down in a woodchipper and blood all over the snow and place, really dirty!Joel and Ethan Coen is a couple of brothers that knows more about movie making then most others, they make films that are stunning, as for example MILLER'S CROSSING, THE BIG LEBOWSKI and O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? They're all sort of weird, but very good. But this one; takes the cake, its thee Coen movie. Based on a true story, the movie has follows the history correctly except that they've changed the names of the persons involved.STARS: ***** 5/5 (its one of those movies)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts like a story from the bible: A man travels through the desert with an offering. He concludes a deal with dark forces in Fargo. From then on the story winds down like a clockwork; everything that happens afterward is just bound to happen, there is no way out. Yes, human willpower has its limits - this seems to be the central message of this seemingly so Unamerican American movie.Live can be beautiful though, the thoroughly content police officer Gunderson proves it amply. She is happy at the thought that her husband carefully paints wild fowl for three cent postage stamps. Those who take strenuous exercises in trying to write down car serial numbers illegibly for a dumb scheme that will not work in the end are the less fortunate of this planet.I hope the Coen Brothers created officer Gunderson with the thought of a sequel already in mind. She would offer herself to it wonderfully. I would very much like to see how the Coens tackle the sequel issue. Why not send the Gundersons with the offspring somewhere on holiday (Morocco perhaps, like Jimmy Stewart in The Man Who Knows Too Much) where something happens? I am looking forward to that movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the blackest comedy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant piece of work, made by the Coen Brothers, who are known for turning out good (if bizarre and sometimes shocking) work. This is a thriller with shockingly graphic violence, and humor as black as coal. It is made even more shocking by the fact that the movie was inspired by true events. A sleazy but mild-mannered car salesman who hires a couple of criminals to kidnap his wife with the intention of keeping most of the ransom provided by his father-in-law. Things turn bad when one of the kidnappers shoots a State Trooper and two witnesses, leading seven-months-pregnant Brainerd, Minnesota Chief of Police Marge Gunderson to investigate the killings.The cast is stellar. William H. Macy, as the hapless car salesman, gives arguably his best performance. Frances McDormand won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge. Steve Buscemi, in one of his best roles from his mid-nineties crime movies, plays loud-mouthed, inept, "funny-looking" Carl Showalter. Peter Stormare, as the silent, stone-faced psycho-partner of Buscemi, is positively chilling. Unlike every Coen bros. movie since "Blood Simple," Fargo takes a more serious, less bent look at things. And the hilarious regional dialect, which can be obnoxious at times, adds humor and culture to the isolation of the setting. One thing that makes little sense is the title. The first scene takes place in a bar in Fargo, ND, but the meat of the film is in Brainerd and Minneapolis. Rating 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is the first Coen brothers movie to really attract some critical and box office success and the first film to start attracting the attention that the Coens' should have been getting all along. Fargo is yet another of their twisted fairy tales that can be watched over and over and you never get tired of it. Coen regulars Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare, and Steve Buscemi all do a fabulous job. William H. Macy does his character so well that this role will follow him the rest of his career. The sets and scenery perfectly portray the bleak midwestern landscape. Like other Coen films, this movie blends seriousness and humor to keep the mood light and keep the film from being a bland downer. There are better Coen films out there but this remains one of their best. Bottom Line: It's a great movie and one well worth buying. If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers.I think it is unique that a film as simple as this one has so much to say. It is presented unlike any conventional film you will find in the genre. Most screen-writing conventions require that each scene advance the plot and develop the characters. This is precisely what this film does, but to call it conventional would be a malapropism. The brilliance of what the Coen brothers have done here is the way they wrote scenes that contain the insight and density of a great novel then presented them on film in the simplest possible way. All the actors gave some of their most memorable performances of their life. Indeed, the characters themselves are not the type to be forgotten easily. You have a quiet psychotic, a selfish weasel, a dishonest and dumb car salesman, a grumpy father-in-law and a smart and honest police woman. What an ensemble! And each character is put in situations where their most basic characteristics are shown. For example, Carl (Buscemi) is seeing a show with an escort and he calls the waiter, who doesn't respond. He then says to her `What is he, deaf?' ?Fargo' quite rightly deserved the Oscar nomination for best film editing, as well as all the Oscars is actually won. A lot of scenes are covered from only two simple angles, and establishing shots are very basic set-ups next to the road. This sounds like the way ?A Simple Plan' was shot, but in ?Fargo' the cuts are exceptionally well timed. Sort of like musical notes.I don't think it is easy for people to validate any criticism they have of this film. It is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen. I wish more people would recognize it as the underrated masterpiece that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pilot lives on Trio.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since there's no IMDb listing for the "Fargo" television spinoff that never made it to air, I'm placing my comments for it here.The Trio network's "Brilliant But Cancelled" series is hosting all sorts of interesting pilots, including some odd but intriguing shows like one with Adam West called "Lookwell" and this dramedy that follows the still-pregnant Marge Gunderson, now played by, off all people, Edie Falco. I don't know what network turned down this series (it had a CBS vibe), but, based on the one episode produced, I'd say it had a lot of potential.The pilot follows Marge as she investigates three crimes in small-town Brainerd: a rather bloody murder whose evidence consists of home-made shell casings and size-8 footprints in the snow; a stolen boat and possible insurance scam; and a missing, frozen corpse. The latter two turn out to be connected, as the son of the dead guy stole his father's body in order to give him a Viking funeral, which apparently requires the body to be burned on a lake in a wooden boat. The murder investigation seemed underdeveloped, but I missed five minutes of the hour-long show while making dinner so maybe not. The show ends with Marge giving birth in an abandoned building with Deputy Lou at her side with husband Norm looking in through a window. (Lou is the same actor as in the movie, but Norm is played by That Guy from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN. No, not Aaron Eckhart - the other one.)"Fargo" the Pilot wasn't great, but how many first episodes are? (Look at how dull "The Seinfeld Chronicles" is.) The same beautiful music score used in the movie is here, and the show captured the same darkly comedic tone as the Coen Bros. Oscar-recipient. Falco's Marge was nearly identical to Frances McDormand's (she didn't seem as intuitive, though) , and the folksy accents and charm were abundant. I even spotted someone that should be a bigger star, and maybe would be if this show was picked up. He was sort of an Anthony LaPaglia lookalike who played the younger brother of the guy who stole his dad's body. His first scene is of him learning of his father's death, and his near-silent interpretation of the tumult of emotions inside him was heartbreakingly precise and real. I couldn't take my eyes off him. Who is this guy? Unfortunately, Trio didn't air the closing credits of the show, so his identity remains in limbo. His character may not have been a regular on the show, but surely he'd move on to bigger things had the pilot been aired. A shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family values film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, Fargo, is the Coen brothers "family values" movie. Who really comes out happy in the end? Marge and her husband. They have an untraditional marriage with Marge as the stable breadwinner and her husband the artist, but seem blissfully tho' undramatically happy(Read: ignore the TV ads and just live as if there were no media by which to judge oneself). Gunderson's father-in-law undervalues his son-in-law, who lives down to his expectations. I got the impression that the father-in-law's disapproval causes Gunderson's actions more than Gunderson's actions caused the F-i-l's disapproval. People do tend to rise or fall to meet our expectations. Gunderson places less value on his family than on success at any cost, as does his father-in-law, who undercuts Gunderson's idea and co-opt his project. He has no concept of caring for another person's self-esteem and giving the other guy credit where credit is due. For christ's sake, this is his daughter's husband and the father of his grandson! Marge's old high school friend is devastated by life, and in the hotel bar we see Marge flustered for the only time in the film. Why? Because dysfunction is a mystery to her. Marge, Midwest solid, does her job, supports her husband's artistic ambitions (and is rewarded when his stamp design wins the contest), earns the close-to-the-vest respect of her Minnesota peers, catches the bad guy with little drama/melodrama, and all while 50 months pregnant! Talk about affirmation! Life is good if you value what's lasting and true - family values - and do your best. In the prowler in the end, we see Marge confused by the motivations of such as the thugs. Goodness cannot conceive of dysfunction/evil,nor understand the dysfunctional/evil. (One exception to the theme might be the poor sod who gets blown away doing his job working the parking garage. God is unpredictable.) Blessedly, though I am a Texan, I was living in St. Paul, Minnesota during the first run of the film and got to experience many local's reactions to it. I believe the movie is a paean to the values I found to be quite pervasive in St. Paul and in Minnesota-generally. Also the ambiance in the movie was so evocative of my experience of Minnesota winter. The weather IS trying to kill you. One must stick to the basics to just survive. Another insight: Macy plays his character as though he were an eight year old boy - his blundery lies, his naive attempts to exit the window and hold onto the door jamb when being arrested, etc. Watch his performance with that in mind. An actor has to have something to "play" and I think that's what Macy does with this part.All in all: what a fable and morality play for our times. One of the best films I've seen - and I've seen 'em ALL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Money against ethic values once again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the film based on a real story and facts, I was asking myself where the man would like to arrive in certain societies. Love for your wife and/or husband, for your children, parents, other relatives an close friends is always more valuable than any money. The main man in the film, Jerry Lundegaard, was able to organize an act of kidnapping his wife with two gangsters in order to get half a million US$ for him and another half for the gangsters. The result was fatal at all, his wife and father-in- law killed by the gangsters and he himself discovered and caught finally by the police. This Lundegaard had no ethics, no love for anyone including his son, and no brain at all. The idea of making and presenting such films is really, it probably may help some people (with brains) to think about and not to kill or burn themselves and their families for money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A CLEVER DARK-HUMORED THRILLER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie of abundance. First of all, it is abundant with fabulous acting by people, neither of whose names, I was familiar with, when I saw the movie: everybody is perfect in the movie. Each one of the actors fits perfectly for the role assigned to him/her. Secondly, it is abundant in innocence: Though the deeds of the villainous characters are contemptuous to the highest degree, they, along with of course, the `YA' -ing Frances Mc Dormand seem as lovable as Winnie The Pooh! Thirdly, it has an abundance of brilliant photographic shots: The shots, mainly capturing frosty harsh landscapes, in every mood, from every angle, are not only awe-inspiring, but also perfectly fit the downcast and stolid mood of the movie.Above everything else, the movie is more abundant in subtlety, more than anything else. This flick is supposed to be a thriller. But, it is more humorous than it is violent; though it's few violent moments are really shocking. However, even in the violent scenes, there is a delicate humor, hidden somewhere in the scene. Though done deliberately, the movie is fraught with subtle humor, which gives the flick, a charming personality. The acting is brilliant, in the manner that just the straight faces and controlled emotions of the actors are enough to make us laugh, in the most serious situations. A prime example of the kind of outré humor in this movie, is the scene where Steve Buscemi, a crook, has a business-like conversation with a prostitute while hiring her for the night, in which he asks her whether she gets job-satisfaction in this profession or not: all in a manner, which seems as if two company executives are discussing the NASDAQ!Seeing Marge Gunderson, (played by Frances McDormand) a beady-eyed seemingly innocuous sweet and homely cop, solve the crime with the encumbrance of pregnancy, is quite a change to the quintessential smart-aleck cop who arrives at a solution, in a trice over a cup of coffee. Every character, be it the crooks - hyper-talkative Carl (Steve Buscemi) and funereal Gaear (Peter Stormare) or the avaricious and confused Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) and his na?ve wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) or the super-cop `Margie' and her hubby, has this little goofy innocence, which adds to the humor of this anomalously dark and comical thriller.The clever mélange of the unique set of characters made to act in an even more unique way (especially the `YA'-laden accents), the outrageously subtle humor, and the grossly funny violence make the movie, humorous and subfusc, all at the same time. A movie, way far from the ordinary, FARGO deserves a heartening applause.Rating-10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average cops and robbers movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard of the movie and it's Oscar success, but never known anything about it, I watched with an unusual lack of preconception. I didn't really know any of the actors by name, although many I do recognise visually and that probably helped me keep an open mind. If Meryl Streep played the lead then somehow I would have expected something specific, but in this case what emerged from my TV was a real curiosity and a darkly charming one! It's an apparently serious film but laced with some wickedly dark comedy and tongue-in-cheek sequences. The characters are great,they have depth and human interest, even the silent hit man! The acting is naturalistic and deadpan, the casting is spot-on perfect. Despite several huge shocks along the way the fairly simple and uncomplicated plot moves quickly and effortlessly to a rather satisfactory conclusion.In many ways thats a surprise in itself and yet at no time is this a flashy or overboard piece of movie making,it's restrained and controlled, and all the better for it.And it's great entertainment. A credit to all involved. The opening shot of a car approaching in a near white-out sets up the snow-bound feel of the movie. The bleak, frozen wastes of Minnesota have a slightly other-worldy aura about them which adds immeasurabley to the overall atmosphere. The towns of Fargo and Brainard in winter seem like frontier outposts and the action which follows has a strong Western overtones. Frances McDormand is quite brilliant as the pregnant local police chief, Marge, with a home-life so prosaic and a delivery so earnest that you swear you must have met this woman somewhere yourself! Her ability to be funny without apparently trying is such a refreshing change from the "Friends" style of comedy (say your line, pull a face and wait for the laugh before resuming)that now riddles Hollywood. And her dialogue is brilliantly written. The peculiarities of the Minnesota accent where it seems everyone has a Scandinavian name and says "oh yahh" are played to the hilt (sorry to any residents reading this if I sell your state short, I'm from England so please forgive my lack of background knowledge). The scene in which Marge interviews two hookers amid a chorus of "ohh yahhh"s is hilarious. Only one thing in the script annoyed me, the constant and repeated reference by one character to another by their names. How many times did the Brainard cop, who discovers the initial dead bodies, call his chief "Margie" ? In Every single line, virtually. That was the only flaw. In real life people on familiar everyday terms don't keep using each other's names in that way. It's a trick straight out of bad soap-opera where the idea is to make the viewer remember who everyone amid the cast of hundreds actually is. Otherwise this was a brilliantly written, acted, directed and photographed movie. If you havn't seen it, rest assured it's not at all what you are expecting!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hero with a Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo comes with the works. A wonderfully original and quirky script by Joel and Ethan Cohen which at the same time is more accessible, sensible, and down to earth than any one of their other films. Fargo is not a cult classic it is a mainstream triumph. With precise and vivid photography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption, Kundun, Dinner With Friends, The Hurricane and numerous Cohen brothers' films). Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. And relatively unique editing that was actually written into the script, at times the Cohen brothers employ hard cuts to black which breaks up the rhythm and extraordinarily makes you think. However, it is really Frances McDormand's performance that gives this film its strength. In my opinion a strange thing has happened with Fargo. From time to time there is a film that is a great film, but catches on for the wrong reasons. Many people talked about Fargo as a comedy which it certainly was not despite a comic touch that exists throughout the Cohen brtohers' work. Others went around acting like fools saying ya, oh ya, you bet, and real good then, as if the unusual accents were what made the film distinctive. What makes this film brilliant is not the funny accents, the quirky characteristics, the offbeat manners. For me the greatness of this film is revealed in the last couple of scenes. (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) When Marge finds Grimsrud and is put in harm's way by doing her job I can not think of a more gripping anxiety filled scene. Honestly when was the last time that there was a chase scene where you were really emotionally invested in what was taking place? Then in the car when Marge talks to the automatonic Grimsrud you are glad and relieved that for once with all do respect to Dirty Harry that it is a normal, kind hearted, well adjusted, affable human being who has captured this monster so that we may receive catharsis through her words of insight which are uniquely similar to what most of us would say. It is as if Marge is articulating what we have often thought or even said, but lacked a pulpit to preach from and a congregation to preach to. That scene near the end of the film when we are in the car with Marge and Grimsrud to me is more than a catharsis though, it is an indictment of the loss of American values, it is an indictment of our seemingly insatiable appetite for gratuitous blood and mindless violence, and our propensity for greed. When Marge says, 'and for what for a little money. There's more to life than a little money you know,' you feel as if something has been restored and lost at the same time. Marge would be seen by many as a sentimental character, but that is because the world has grown cynical. Is she oversimplifying in that scene? No she's right and we're the ones who are lost. That is if you believe films like dreams are keys to our unconscious and indicative of our true fears and desires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have been more intense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...with crime movies like Fargo, the thing that usually makes them great is how intense they are. Fargo isn't intense, it's just too cute. It's like a children's film disguised as a crime tragedy. Sure, there are some suspenseful parts, but there weren't enough.Overall it was still a good movie, the acting was grade A from Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.Despite McDormand's great performance, I'd have to say my favorites were by the three criminals: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Macy makes you feel sorry for him as the man reluctantly having his wife kidnapped, he really portrays the 'too stupid for his own good' thing.Buscemi is basically playing Mr. Pink again, but just a little less nervous as the talkative amateur crook Carl Showalter. Though, Buscemi being my favorite actor, I still thought his role was great. Stormare's acting wasn't really the best, but he was believable as the quiet but violent bad guy.Good movie, entertaining at least, 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passafist Reviews Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Following is the 2nd in a series titled Passafist: The Great FilmsThe crime in the Coen Brother's film FARGO has to have been the worst executed crime in the history of cinema. It's flawed from the very beginning. It's a good thing that the movie isn't the same way; it's possibly one of the best-executed films of the last 25 years.I've always been a sucker for strong character dramas. Plot is inconsequential to me for the most part. I always look at it as that added bonus if a plot really grabs me. I just realize that most stories operate on the same seven or eight premises. So it is the characters that save them. FARGO is full of great characters.The film opens in Fargo, North Dakota, at a shady trucker bar. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macey, Panic) is there to meet Carl (Steve Buscemi, Con Air) --a low rent, funny looking crook. Carl is there with another man named Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare, The Big Lebowski), a tall, silent and scary looking crook. Jerry drops off a car and sets a crime into motion. The two crooks are to kidnap Jerry's wife (Kristen Rudrud, Pleasantville) and hold her for ransom. Jerry is trying to embezzle money from his well-to-do father in law Wade (Harve Presnell, Face/Off), who is a real jackass. Needless to say, what should be a simple crime goes terribly wrong. When three people show up dead in a small town called Brainerd, the local sheriff, Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand, The Man Who Wasn't There) get on the case.What Joel and Ethan Coen have crafted here is a drama of such life and scope. It's not simply about a crime. It's about people living their lives at a moment in time. There are scenes in this film that are unnecessary to the plot that are completely necessary for these characters.Take for instance, the intimate scene in a hotel resturant in Fargo. Marge is met by an old high school chum, named Mike Yanagita, (Steve Park, and TOYS). He invites her to the hotel to seduce her. He's so bad at it that he makes up stories to try to win her over. She's so sympathetic, to this mans needs, but also wary of his advances. Any other film, this scene would probably be cut, it sure doesn't move the story along. But it paints a clearer picture of just who Marge really is; it's vital to the evolution of her character. It's perfect.There is another brilliant sequence near the beginning of the film where Jerry has just told Wade about a great land deal he has in the works. He's hoping Wade will give him the money. When the meeting takes a decidedly different turn there is a single shot of Jerry walking back to his car. It's so sad. It's so heartbreaking. You sympathize with and for Jerry. It's reminds me of that scene in TAXI DRIVER, where Travis hangs up the phone after being rejected by Betsey and the camera pans away to the empty hallway, very effective both times. Francis McDormand is perfect as Marge. She embodies even the pregnant suit she wears through the entire film. I don't know why Marge has to be pregnant; the film would work without her being that way. But that again is one of those small character beats that makes FARGO a film worth watching.Another interesting device the Coen Bros. use is a small title screen at the beginning stating that the film is in fact a true story. In all honesty it isn't. But what that allows the film to do is work in the realm of the real. Sure the film is a work of fiction, but still there is a feeling of authenticity that little title allows. Honestly the first time I saw FARGO, I thought it was a true story, and I believed it throughout the entirety of the film. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make great crooks. In any bad film these two characters would be bumbling idiots. Neither one is terribly smart, but there is certain finesse to there performances. I particularly liked the early scene where Buscemi's character Carl tries to stop talking to show Stomare's Grimsrud he can play the silent game. Of course Carl can't shut up, so he winds up talking to himself.After reading this review your probably thinking this is a drama. But the AFI listed it as one of the 100 greatest comedies. How does that add up? Well, life is sometimes really funny; sometimes you hear a joke and you can't help laughing. FARGO is a comedy of situation. Marge for instance is a naturally funny person, so she'll tell a joke. She's sweet and good hearted and so are the people she works with. So naturally funny things will happen. FARGO is a great movie. Well worth 95 minutes of anyone's life. It's a slice of life comedy, set against a gritty and horrible crime. It's a human character study. FARGO is one of the best movies ever made. I love FARGO.GO SEE FARGO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguity in characterization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie a lot, but what I liked best was the ambiguity in the characters. Jerry is a jerk, and probably inherently larcernous. One suspects that the reason he needs money is to feed a gambling addiction. He is more weak and fecklessthan malevolent, and although he sets this carnage in motion, he is notultimately responsible for the turn it takes. His wife is much the nonentity and certainly does little for his self-esteem. Their kid is also a loser,, but he does appear to have some redeeming features.The father-in law is a real jerk; I was really uncertain of the degree until I watched him and his financial guru cut Jerry out of the parking lot deal. However, he certainly doesn't deserve to get shot.The two kidnappers are great studies in abnormal psychology, the Marlboro Man isa classic psychopath. The nerd is a classic loser and screw-up trying to act like a tough guy. One suspects he has been brutalized since childhood and mostespecially in prison. The Indian, the two hookers and the escort service cutie are really well done. You can't help feeling sorry for them. The pregnant lady sheriff is almost perfect. The reviewers from Minnesota say the Scandanavian accentsare bogus; why would the director do this in a movie with a lot of realism? GTM</fullReview>

He's a really lamentable figure, andprobably tied for best character in the film with that of Frances McDormand, who uses sensibility and "Minnesota nice" to bring justice to the guilty.Of course, the whole Scandinavian accent thing is really overdone in this film, but to good effect. It lends a level of absurdity to every character who uses those mannerisms...a level of absurdity that's present in most real people, even though they try to mask it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best. Movie. EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers be here.I first saw Fargo around 7 months ago, from that day forward it has been my absolute favorite movie. Fargo is accessible, because it's the story of an everyday guy (Jerry) who needs money, so he hires a couple other everyday guys to kidnap his everyday wife, who end up shooting an everyday state trooper, and so on and so forth.I choose not to view Fargo as a comedy, even though it has quite a few funny moments. I see Fargo as a story of real life. When you think about it, Fargo is one of the most realistic movies out there. It's the Hamburger Hill of thrillers. Like I said, Fargo is about people who aren't really smart (well, except for Marge I guess) doing things that aren't very well thought out. And there isn't a whole lot of drama to the things they do that make them more exciting and less realistic. For example, Marge doesn't fight off 20 ninja assassins in the field where she finds the dead bodies. Jerry doesn't pull out Uzis and have a 10 day standoff with police in the hotel at the end of the movie. Marge's husband (even though I love Fargo I can't remember his name) doesn't win the stamp competition. No, Fargo shows what life really is like, without a whole lot of needless drama. And yet, somehow, there IS drama, in the imagery. Like when Jerry is walking to his iced over car in the building parking lot. The scene is shot from above, and for a few seconds it looks like it's a picture because of the stillness until Jerry walks into frame. Or when Steve Buscemi drives into the airport parking lot to steal new plates for his car. Or when Marge shoots at the fleeing Peter Stormare as he runs across the frozen lake. Fargo's drama comes from compelling imagery, and not suspension of disbelief.Yeah, that didn't make sense, but you can pretend it did.</fullReview>

You've got the good guys, living in happy little families and caring for one another, and then you got the bad guys, drifters, loners having to pay for love.The dialogue is real, all the turning back on yourself, repeating yourself because you thought it would be funny or appropriate the second time. The "minnesota nice" dialogue, always trying to deal with confrontation by being nice and friendly.The performances make it real, well deserved for Frances McDormand as Marge "you betcha" Gunderson. Buscemi is great as the bumbling thug. And Macy also is great as the salesmen hiring two men to kidnap his wife.The funny thing is though, it's not a true story. The Coens said that they couldn't find a true story real enough, so they made one up. So real infact, that a woman gave her life because she believed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>fargo does it up right. quality dialogue. stark imagery. relatable theme. throw in some off-beat humor and steve buscemi and youve got an enjoyable flick. i mean come on now, hes kinda funny looking. too many people have been commenting that fargo is an irrelevant and illegimate movie. fargo knows exactly where it stands on the snow-covered tundra. it is not some incredible myth like paul bunyan or some halarious comedy like raising arizona. fargo is a poignant glimpse of the world we live in, ripped naked, and presented bare. we still have far to go to do this world justice. but well get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film filled with an incredible script and brilliant performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo isn't exactly an exciting idea. Sure there's a lot of conflict, but it doesn't shock or grab the viewers attention. So the Coen brothers decided to fill it to the brim with an excellent script and very sharp performances. And it worked. Fargo succeeds in nearly all levels of film, the direction, the writing, the acting. Frances Mcdormand won an Oscar for her portrayal as a small time cop, her performance is both sweet and effective, utter perfection too. William H. Macy lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. but I strongly felt Macy deserved it. Every little detail on his face is so perfectly acted out, you know this character and feel him. Steve Buscemi is good here, but isn't exactly oscarworthy. The script keeps a tight net on all characters, and the direction was good too. The only real flaw with Fargo is that some scenes feel out of place and the acting sometimes falls apart. It's rated R because there are a couple of heavy sex scenes, quite a bit of graphic violence, and some swearing. The only reason I give it this score is because of personal choice. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Coen Brothers' Movie and one of the Best Films Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the brilliant duality of "Fargo." You can watch it as so many claim it is to be intended, as a comedy, and thoroughly enjoy yourself (I especially love when Marge is interrogating the girls from the bar). However, was this really how the film was intended to be viewed? This is an inherent problem with many Coen brothers' films. Their movies are always so lovingly filmed, meticulously crafted, and beautifully photographed, that you are often shocked that they seem to treat their characters and stories with such a light handed and often mocking touch. "Blood Simple" and "Miller's Crossings" were the dramatic exceptions (no doubt, these are not comedies) and "Raising Arizona," "The Big Lebowski," and "Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?" operate at the other end of the spectrum (these are all great comedies). All of their other films fall oddly in between. This "Fargo" is probably the strangest as it claims to be inspired by true events and follows many of the same dramatic twists as "Blood Simple." Yes, I think we are supposed to laugh at the accents, and Jerry Lundegard (as played so brilliantly by William H. Macy) is so inept at everything and such a weaselly prick you can't help but laugh. But "Fargo" is also operating on some higher level as an archetypal battle between good and evil (law abiding citizens making an honest living and criminals killing for money). I have no doubt that Marge Gunderson (the pitch perfect Frances McDormand) is supposed to be viewed as a heroine of the most noble order. In the end there is justice, and Marge dispenses to our captured killer the moral of it all while taking him away in the police car. "There's more to life than that (referring to money)." Dontchya know? And isn't that the moral we all need to be reminded of in this capitalist society? Dontchya know indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's first start by saying FARGO is one of the best movies of all time. If you don't get it, go back to watching the Ernest series.Next, I'm tired of hearing the complaints that it's too bloody and violent. That's the point (and counterpoint to Margie and other fine Minnesotans). But it is this complaint that brings me to MY point.The creepiest scene in the movie, regardless of bullets in the head or more graphic forms of violence, is where Jerry lies to his son about his mother's situation. Very few of us will experience the extreme violence of the criminals, but every parent should squirm during Jerry's betrayal of Scotty. This heinous activity is done by parents, for various reasons, every day.If you haven't seen it, rent it. If you have seen it, buy it. Watch it again and again. Note especially the camera work where Jerry is talking on the phone to Reilly Diefenbach. Take extensive notes. Listen to the score. Note the lilting, whimsical theme that accompanies an aerial shot of a car driving in a parking lot. Laugh, enjoy, watch it again.At the very least, FARGO is the movie that finally answers the question "Where's pancakes house?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the 1990s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice now and have just bought the video. Having read some of the negative comments on this website, I can only say - you just can't appreciate good filmmaking! It's brilliant, quirky, blackly humourous with great performances and a memorable score. Even after I had seen the film I could hear Carter Burwell's memorable music. The performances of Frances McDormand, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi are all terrific. It's also unusual to see a film set in a part of the US that we in the UK aren't too familiar with. The complaints I've read about the accents are unjustified - the Minnesota accent certainly makes a change after all the NY, Californian and Southern accents we've heard in the past.One more thing - it's allegedly based on a true story which happened in 1987, but the end credits state it's fictional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly after seeing this movie (somewhat belatedly), I heard a local talk show host interview a couple who had just turned out a new translation of Dante's Inferno.One feature of the Inferno that was touched on in the interview was the notion that the fraudulent reside at a lower level of Hell than even the murderous. Then, it hit me. That's what Fargo is all about. Like a glowing nuclear core in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, the grandfather, in all his fraudulent glory, is the psychic de facto ringleader of all the malfeasance that takes place in the movie. At the heart of the banal evil of our minor thugs and would-be high rollers (and, for that matter, "normal" people placidly assuming their roles in a "normal" world) is a local leading man of business, a taciturn pillar of the community.Fargo is a picture of Hell, in the tradition of Dante, a tour de force on the part of the Coens to set this as they did, and one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suburban anxiety, Minnesota style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up 80 miles north of Fargo, I can say that the film Fargo contains many inside jokes that quietly (or not so quietly) remind one that she is watching a movie about that part of the country. And whatever people think of the acting, story, etc., Fargo does capture much of the anxiety that the great plains quietly thrusts on those who live there (you can see this in the way Jean chops veggies), often hidden behind a smile or seemingly polite word.One might note that this is a picture of mostly suburban Minnesota, around the twin cities, not rural. The film may have been better entitled "Edina" or "Maple Grove". Also, the accents, funny as they may be to most outside of the area, sound a little more like southwestern Wisconsin than North Dakota or Minnesota. Phrases such as "you're darn tootin" have never, to my knowledge, been knowingly been said by anyone in Minnesota. But aside from these minor quibbles, the Cohen bros do capture much of the darkness of a rather dark part of the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonder of McDormand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible spoilersFrances McDormand is, in my view, one of the most beautiful women in film. I'm glad she married that geek Joel and got this part. She reminds me of that other Coen lady, Holly Hunter, but where Hunter is a go-getter, McDormand is already confident. And what a joy she is to behold in this film.Just a little while ago I was a part of the group that saw this film as the greatest achievement of the 90s, but now I'm not so sure. After recently catching the first bit of "Barton Fink" on TV again (and after being introduced to Faulkner -- I'll finish reading about Benji, I swear...) I now see that as their masterpiece. Everything about that film, from Turturro's hair to the sound the wallpaper makes to the clever writing on the hotel stationary comes as a sudden burst of brilliance.When the Coens are in their genre-tinkering mode I'm not always a fan. In the moment it's great fun, but afterwards I want to spit. But when they are in their element as filmmakers as they are here, in "Fink" and "Lebowski" they are shockingly good.And let's not forget Carter Burwell's climactic theme!Much has been said about Roger Deakins' wonderful photography, I presume, by people unaccustomed to snow. (Being a Winnipegger, I have to say I'm relatively unimpressed.)Buscemi, normally the delight of any film, is here overshadowed by the Swede (I think) Peter Stormare, the manic stress of Macy and the glorious McDormand. The guy who plays Macy's father is a charm.Charles Taylor, the aggresively stupid critic for Salon says that the characters in this film exist only to be ridiculed. Untrue. Take Buscemi for example. Not only does he die like in most Coen movies, but here he's: beat up, shot in the face, hit with an axe and put through a wood-chipper. Stormare? Only shot in the leg. McDormand? Only observed as she's about to (but never does) puke. Macy? Arrested in his underpants. The Asian dude? Watched as he breaks down emotionally. Macy's father? Shot in the gut. The list goes on.But the Coens don't get any pleasure out of the screen violence this time around. That's "Miller's Crossing," remember? No, here it serves a purpose. Blood looks good on snow.I still think the film is too short, but just long enough. It's the Coens' most realistic movie (for their standards anyway) and you get McDormand as her wonderful self with that toothy grin.What more do you want?4 out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is one of the best movies I've ever seen because it takes tragic subject matter and gives it a sometimes light, sometimes dark, and always subtle treatment that somehow leaves you a little unsettled at the end. You watch the story of this bungling car salesman unfold, watch as we are taken deeper into his sad, shallow and cowardly mind, and see how his "simple plan" slowly strangles him as the circumstances spin out of his control. The body count grows and we get more and more a feeling of senselessness to it all, which the hero sums up so well with her lecture to the criminal at the end. The barren and unforgiving wasteland in which the movie is set is a perfect backdrop to this story of isolation, but the hero's constantly perky disposition is the perfect antidote, a reminder that human nature can be as good as it wants to be.Meanwhile, the movie manages to be funny, with most of the laughs coming at the expense of the goofy lingo of the Minnesota locals and the dorkiness of Steve Buscemi's character.This is a movie that makes a real statement, and keeps you entertained in the process. William H. Macy, Frances McDormand and Buscemi are all brilliant in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of Fargo is nothing new, it is a simple plot with simple characters in a simple environment, and therein lies the brilliance. The Coen brothers have taken this simple story, put it in the simple environment of North Dakota and Minnesota, and created a brilliant portrait of life in these rural places.From the scenes with Norm and Marge conversing in bed to the dialect used, from the mike yanagita story to the food that marge eats, they all create this beautiful portrait of life in these rural areas.Fargo isn't about a murderous rampage of a kidnapping gone horribly wrong, its about the simple lives of simple folk, shown through a crime thriller.

		<fullReview>I revisited this recently and was again delighted with it on every level. Frances McDormand plays the police chief, Marge Gunderson, and plays her to perfection down to the flat Scandinavian accent sprinkled with "Ya's". William H. Macey plays the sleazeball car salesman who is in trouble with GMAC for getting loans on vehicles for which he has no serial numbers. He comes up with the ingenious scheme of having his wife kidnapped for a ransom from his fatherinlaw who is very wealthy and treats his son-in-law as an incompetent. the story takes off from there, twisting and turning in incredible but believable directions, victims dropping like flies. At the core of the movie is pregnant Marge and her painter husband Norm, secure in their domestic bliss. Marge goes out to solve this multiple homicide fiasco, Norm stays home and paints ducks for a postage stamp competition. Some of the scenes are to be seen to be believed and we are shocked out of complacency at times with some pretty graphic violence, and Marge gets her man in the end and does not hesitate to philosophize in the police car at him. A 9 out of 10. Do not miss this one. In my personal top 100 best of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, what's with all the whiny comments about this film? Either you like the Coen Brothers or you don't - no need to get personal!I am a fan, and anyone who thinks they could sit down and write a Coen script over a few beers with their mates should try doing that some time. They are geniuses of the understatement and write the kind of observant blackly humourous dialogue I would kill to be able to write, (not-with-standing improvisational leeway with their always top-notch casts).However I don't indiscriminately love everything they do. Films like 'The Big Lebowski' and 'O Brother' don't seem to hit the mark for me. But 'Blood Simple' and 'Fargo' are so brilliantly real and surreal at the same time I get a total high every time I see them.'Fargo' is just great entertainment as far as I'm concerned. Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are amazing and Steve Buscemi is just always great. And by the way - it's not a true story - they were kidding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hatches an ill-conceived plan to have his wife kidnapped, and use ransom money shelled out by his wealthy father-in-law to finance his solo business venture. Human stupidity ensures that every single element of the plan fails catastrophically.Fargo marks the Coens' acceptance by the mainstream. The award nominations showered upon it and its widespread critical acclaim may have set high expectations from viewers, whom, upon inspection shrug in disappointment, failing to find either the verbal gold of Big Lebowski and Miller's Crossing, or the visual wizardry of O Brother Where Art Thou and The Man Who Wasn't There. Of all their films, Fargo might be the most palatable to mainstream sensibilities, but that does not diminish its qualities as a film.In technical terms, this marks their first collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins after regular DP Sonnenfeld left to pursue a directing career, and it is quite a leap from the stylish tones of Miller's Crossing to the controlled, washed out landscapes of Fargo. Just as impressive, but more understated, the sign of artists fully coming into their own and confident in the key ingredients of their product. The screenplay is a work of art, the verbal sparring and control of language beyond peer, and like the world's greatest orchestra, the cast perform this symphony to perfection. Macy is hopelessly fascinating as the least capable man in human history, and Stormare and Buscemi team up as the weirdest kidnappers ever to grace the screen. People cannot seem to lavish enough praise on Frances McDormand, and it is true that she allows a beautiful character to blossom beyond expectations. The Coens' one concession to mainstream audiences - a likable, grounded protagonist - is one of the most original main characters in cinema.Like all their films, it adds up to so much more than you might think upon first viewing, and serves as an ideal starting point to explore their work. A classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a fine, fine, piece of cinema from a couple of the neatest, slickest and most original directors in the business. Only one thing stops it from claiming its rightful place among the industry's finest - that makes it a great film rather than a classic film - and that's that it's too damn short! Admittedly, it doesn't cut you off with the same degree of frustrating incompletion that, say, 'Unbreakable' does, but to compare the two films at all would be insulting to the Coens. All the same though, the style and quality of the film just makes its brevity all the worse. Frances McDormand turns in one of the finest acting performances of recent years as the just-too-damn-smart detective, and the whole film is staged superbly - the Coen brothers' creation of a very dark movie in a very white setting is slick to the point of arty, but engaging enough to become too over-indulgently picturesque. The film is neat, clipped and wonderfully aesthetic. The comedy is as dark as it comes, but all the same entertaining - you find yourself laughing out loud at stuff you might feel you really shouldn't; it's more of an atmosphere of set-piece humour at times in the film, rather than anything deliberately comic about the script. So hey, maybe I'm being slightly picky about criticising the abrupt end to the film. Maybe it shouldn't really be any longer - perhaps to be longer would be to be make 'Fargo' less well-formed, and that would be unforgivable. I suppose it's just a personal thing - as a tragic product of the MTV generation I was hoping for a more dramatic ending, though the classic 'disposal' scene certainly added a certain uniqueness to the film, though it would be shame if such a fine work were to be remembered for just a woodchipper. Again coming from an MTV-generation point of view, I suppose the one thing this film lacks is a feeling of suspense, an adrenalin rush of some kind. But then a film doesn't need that sort of thrill factor to be good. This is not a film you see if you want the kind of high-octane entertainment that, say, 'Bad Boys' or 'Terminator' will supply. Having said that, I can think of few people who would crack open the beers and watch 'Schindler's List' with a pizza - this is a film treat, an artistic, phenomenally slick and polished work with a well-picked, select cast that features not a single wooden line, and along with McDormand's masterful performance there are fine roles by Buscemi and Macy as the cuss-filled crook and the chirpy-to-the-point-of-irritating loser car salesman who hires him. A great lesson in how to make a film - the plot is very simple, but the way it unravels, as well as the style of the piece as a whole, make Fargo a winner. Watch with a glass of something warming, while in a contemplative, patient mood for best results.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique Sort of Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) needs money to invest in a parking lot. He devises a plan to get it, by which he will have two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) kidnap his wife, and then have his rich father-in-law pay the ransom, keeping most of it for himself. As usual, the kidnapping doesn't go as planned, and a pregnant detective (Frances McDormand) is sent on the case.What makes "Fargo" so great is its total uniqueness. It is almost written as a straight thriller, and it seems as though the comedy makes itself. The little observations about rural life in Minnesota combined with the uniqueness of the characters makes the movie funny. It is this strange blend of comedy and drama that makes "Fargo" what it is. This is probably the best screenplay since "Pulp Fiction".Add excellent performances by all, particularly Macy, McDormand, and Buscemi, to this great script and you have a superb movie. Funny, thrilling, and unique, this is certainly one of the best movies of the 90s.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, there are just some things in life that I will never be able to fully understand. This movie is one of them. FARGO begins with a lie right away, claiming to be "Based on a True Story"- I later found out that this was indeed a lie. *Spoilers*Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) is short on money. So, hiring two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) he tells them to kidnap his wife and to get a large ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. When they unintentionally kill three locals, things turn upside-down, especially when the pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) steps in to investigate.Now, many things are wrong with the film. The biggest and worst thing to happen to the film is probably the god-awful accents that many members of the cast put on. "Is there a payphone 'round here, ya think?", much unnecessary sexuality which is in the movie for no apparent reason. And the film is about a half hour too short. Most films of this genre run anywhere from two hours to two and a half hours long. I thought this was going to be a nice, scary suspense thriller, but even during the sequences that are intended to be thrilling and intense, things just roll along like how they have been during the boring moments. The Coen Brothers even gave it a biting sense of humor to go with the plot that just doesn't stick. It would have been so much better if they had just made it turn dark and scary a few times. But, keeping that happy-go-lucky feel, it just doesn't seem like you are watching a thriller. FARGO: 4/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are excellent filmmakers. Their writing here is so precise and so spot on. "Fargo" was well deserving of it's academy award for best screenplay. And the acting by everyone involved is nothing short of fantastic. I couldn't begin to do justice to everyone's performances, so I won't even try.A lot of people I know don't dig this movie, and I can see why, it's not everyone's bag. It's a pretty normal story, but made great by fantastic writing and acting. I admit I wasn't blown away the first time I saw it, but like most of my favorite movies, I didn't fall in love with it until I watched it a second time."Maybe it's a subconscious type thing.""Yah, that can happen."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is well worthy of its seven Oscar Nominations, this is a bizzare film, in the fact that its quite hilarious when it really shouldn't be. Jerry Lundergaard ( William H Macy ) is a struggling car salesman in the Midwest, and when debts are mounting he has a masterplan..... he hires two thugs ( Steve Buscemi )and ( Peter Stormare ) to kidnap his wife, in an attempt to collect a big ransom pay off from her rich father, according to Jerry, " nobody's gonna' get hurt" ...until people start dying that is. The 'hero' of this film is Marge Gunderson ( Frances McDormand ) a pregnant police officer, who will indeed get her man. The weird Scandinavian Surnames, and bizzare lingo( is this true to Minnesotan life??? ) only add to this catchy black-comedy.Some of the things that happen are sickening yet very funny, this is one 'helluva movie ...you betcha' yah......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are some of my all time favorite directors (along with Christopher Nolan, M. Night. Shyamalan and Christopher Guest). All of their movies are comical and original and in many ways, strange. Fargo is arguably one of the neatest films they have ever made. Here's the synopsis (Warning: spoilers): Jerry Lubdergaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman in debt. He needs the money but his wife's (Kristin Gudrud) father (Harve Presnell) has it and won't give it to him. So he comes up with a clever plan, also a dangerous one, to hire two guys, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife. That way he can get the ransom money from the father-in-law, keep half of it, give the other half to the kidnappers, and pay off his debts. It goes well until Gaear shoots a state trooper near Brainerd (as well as two people who witnessed it) and are now being chased by policewoman Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). Throughout the entire film it is dramatic yet oddly hysterical in places people might not consider funny. Gaear casually chasing and killing Carl with the ax, beforehand adjusting his hat in the freezing North Dakotan weather. When they arrest Jerry after he flees from the Twin Cities. When Marge captures Gaear and tells him in the car "There's more to life than money y'know? Didn't you know that?" The ending is very realistic. In a way it is miserable (at least for some of the characters) but in a way it is happy. This film is beautifully shot (for anyone who has ever driven across North Dakota in any kind of weather, it does feel like you are in the middle of nowhere) and the musical score was excellent. The casting was superb (Frances McDormand rightfully deserved that Oscar). I give it a 10 out of 10. And if you liked this, rent the Big Lebowsky; it is just as good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers have always been my favorite directors. They are about the only worthy protocessors to the almighty Stanley Kubrick.When I first saw Fargo I must admit I was not paying much attention to it.I was talking on the phone with a friend and because of it I entirely missed the magic. A couple months later I saw it and it completely blew my expectations away. The rural setting of Minnesota and its people provide the perfect juxtaposition for this mixed up murder thriller.The endless snowy landscpes and frigid cold create a great mood for a sullen and intoxicating climax. My favorite part of this film was definetly the subtle craftsmanship. The violin music. The editing. Frances McDormand's performance. Peter Stormare' performance. I especially loved the axe scene. It made Stormare almost into a larger than life character. He was Paul Bunyan. And in the end it was a little old pregnant police woman that took him down. This film is about as perfect as you can get. The only action thriller that even comes close to it is Memento. Years from now this will be seen as one of America's greatest Post Modern Films. ***** You're darn tootin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved Fargo. Every bit of acting is great, the script is inspired, the humor fits my taste perfectly (you may not feel the same way), the direction is, of course, flawless (I'd expect nothing less from a titan like Joel Coen), and the music is great (especially Carter Burwell's theme); this film is an example of when everything falls together perfectly and a masterpiece is created.I'd also just like to say that Frances McDormand is the best actress I can think of right now. Her performance in Fargo is one of the best (female or male) that I've seen in a really long time. She was also good in "Almost Famous" (I suggest you watch the DVD version called "Untitled" if you haven't seen it yet, it's a lot longer, but the vision is more developed) and she was good in "The Man who Wasn't There".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dazzling mix of humor and excitement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just recently seen The Man Who Wasn't There, I decided to revisit the Coen Brothers' previous movie, their masterpiece Fargo. After watching Fargo for I guess the fourth time, I can definitely see why it is a better movie. It is filled with so many interesting characters, complete with their mannerisms and quirky lines. The movie is extremely well written, presenting the audience with one unexpected twist after the other. I enjoyed every scene of the movie because of its unique characteristics and moral foundations. Fargo has one of those scores that is very recognizable. Once I hear that music, I instantly remember Fargo like the way I remember Indiana Jones and 2001 from their music. The music flows perfectly throughout the movie, from Jerry's opening drive to Fargo to the wonderful final scene in Magre's bedroom. The movie's plot is centered on a kidnapping plot fabricated by Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) to extract money from his rich father-in-law. He hires two kidnappers through a mechanic from his car dealership. He meets Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) in Fargo and makes a deal with them to split the ransom of $80,000. But Jerry has another plan, he will tell his father-in-law that the ransom was one million, and he will keep $960,000 to buy his own lot and start a business.This scheme appeared simple yet effective-until people started dying. We are then introduced to the most interesting character in the movie, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). She is the investigating officer in the murders resulting from the kidnapping, and she begins a simple and often funny investigation of the crimes. The movie just takes off after that, forming remarkable developments, unexpected turns, and witty scenes played out by a stellar cast. Fargo is a perfect blend of humor, violence, and a great story. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for her role as Marge. Every conversation Marge makes involves a great deal of warmth, and McDormand does it convincingly and even manages to be funny due to her accent and throwing `yeah' (pronounced as `ya') like a volleyball. Marge is very memorable because her scenes are radiant, and the other wonderful characters also complement her. My favorite scene in the movie is when Marge questions Jerry for the second time. As Marge asks her questions, Jerry traps himself by giving nervous answers and behaving erratically. Even though Marge makes no connection with Jerry and the murders, Jerry could not control his neurotic behavior because of guilt and fear. Very few people can make a wonderful movie about simple heroes and pathetic villains, but the Coen brothers pulled it off by adding a great deal of heart and by letting these terrific actors do their best work. I loved every moment of this movie; Fargo is one of the best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think this movie was poking fun of "Scandinavian accents", (they were much more similar to the Canadian accents just a hundred miles or so north, eh!) or was stereotyping pregnant women, Asians, rural people, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Norwegians, North Dakota etc., etc, you really are far too "sophisticated" to be watching movies in the first place!This is one of the finest "black comedies" I have ever seen, (and I am not much of a fan of the genre.) I'm sure that many who have posted negative comments are simply overwhelmed by their own "political incorrectness" during the movie.There are several moments in this movie when it is totally inappropriate to let out a good laugh, but also unavoidable. (When Mrs. Lundegard jumps out of the car blindfolded and tries to escape from her kidnappers through the snow, for example. Its a moment of obvious pure terror for her, but her callous and brutal kidnappers break down laughing and I'm afraid we do too.) That is what makes it so very good!If you don't feel right laughing at black humor, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!And those who critisize the well-deserved oscar of Frances McDormand just don't get it at all. The very pregnant and rustic Chief of Police, Marge Gunderson, whose husband likes to paint mallards and ice fish, may be a little "folksy," for some, but believe it or not, most people in the States aren't actually from New York City or LA! Some of them really do have to jump start their "prowlers" at 4:00 AM in 15 below zero weather.There are actually small town police chiefs just like Marge all over America. And let's not forget that as "goofy" as she may look and talk, when she gets on the case, she is onto the bad guys almost from the start and pursues them with the single minded tenacity of a laser guided missile. I'm sure that there are real cops across America for whom "Marge Gunderson," represented a very realistic portrayal.No, I'm sorry some of you didn't like this movie, but for me it was a surprisingly deep, dark and astute piece of work for an American film. And I place Brainard Chief of Police Marge Gunderson right up there with Sam Spade, Columbo and Hercule Poirot among my all time favorite detectives and I would simply love to see her in action again.If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. Its a solid 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is one of the best films of the 90's. For me, one of the top three of the decade. Most of the actors in the movie gave the best performances of their careers here (including Buscemi and Macy) and the Coen brothers, who could have their place in history justwith Raising Arizona (surprisingly not in the IMDB top 250 at the time of this writing) have here their best film ever.I do not recommend this movie to everyone though, because most people won't get the absurdity of some situations, the very noir comedy or the violence. What I loved about this film is how absurd and unpredictable it gets as the story progresses. It all escalates to a messy, violent climax, that somehow is damn funny.Whoever gave The English Patient awards for best film of 1996 instead of this one is an idiot. I can understand why not everyone liked this film, but still, it was the best that year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo has a right to be so acclaimed; extraordinary events happen to ordinary people. Most other movies sport fancy dialogue that seems to fit every occasion, when in reality most of us are stumbling for the right words. Fargo doesn't do this and yet still comes out on top. Ordinary people are forced into a situation, and when dealing with this situation they treat it with meaningless, everyday, Wisconsin-spun dialogue. A first when it comes to script writing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers strike gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who's seen "Fargo" has experienced something they've never experienced before. The Coens are back and they're better than ever!Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police woman who becomes enthralled in a scandalous kidnapping/murder case involving swindling used car dealer Jerry Lundegaard, who's hiring two buffoons to kidnap his wife so her father will cough up a large ransom.What's so surprising about this film is that it's funny while it's suspenseful. The scenes with the kidnappers have strong language and violence and are usually serious while the scenes with Marge and her husband are quite humorous.I was captivated right at the beginning when I purchased the DVD. It opens to a black screen with white lettering stating that the following film is a true story. Out of respect for the dead, some of the names have been changed. Entirely engrossing but yet entirely not true.Director Joel Coen said later that if you know that the movie is based on actual events, they'll believe anything on the screen, even if it's totally unrealistic.There are so many scenes that are ingenious: the infamous woodchipper scene, Marge and her accomplice Lou discussing the dealer plates on the murderer's car, Marge cracking a joke about a guy changing his name to "J37-2404," and more.Anyone and everyone should see "Fargo" some time in their life, whether it be on television or video, see it! It's extremely inventive, hilarious, and still manages to be gratuitously violent.NOTE: When Buscemi is pulling the dead body of the cop after shooting him in the head and the car's headlights are seen getting closer and closer in the distance, this must be a reference to the Coen's first film "Blood Simple" in which there's a similar scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the "Fargo Fenomenon"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have observed something astounding about "Fargo", which I have intentionally misspelled the "Fargo Fenomenon." Here is my theory, which will surely win me a Nobel Prize for Observations About Film:This is quite a popular movie, but people like it for two different reasons. About half the people fall into the "Great Comedy" category - these people think "Fargo" is hilariously funny, a masterpiece of black comedy. The other half falls into the "Great Drama / Thriller" category - these people enjoy "Fargo" only for the purpose of its drama and thriller qualities. (Note that the people that think "Fargo" is a "Great Comedy" may also appreciate it for a brilliant drama / thriller, but no one in the "Great Drama / Thriller" category thinks that "Fargo" is hilarious.)I myself fall into the latter category - I don't see the hilarity. Someone once tried to explain to me the humor of it - saying there are no punchlines, but one has to look at the big picture to see the absurdity of the situation. That may be the case, but do these observations of its absurdity really produce monster laughs? Not for me, but apparently in other people. I guess I just don't understand it.Anyway, for whatever reason you like "Fargo", I think there is a good chance that you will like it. And if you see my name at the Nobel Prizes this year, I hope you think of the "Fargo Fenomenon"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! This modern classic brought to us by the creative Coen brothers is great for the following reasons:1.) The actors are brilliant, reveling in roles that are interesting to play. Particularly notable are Macy as the feckless Jerry Lundergard, McDormand as the affable, partly pixilated, Chief of Police and of course Buchemi in his element in a role of delicious degeneracy.2.) Dialogue. Or perhaps it is better just to call it quirky conversation, because that's what it is really. You just have to keep smiling at the accents and nonchalant banter, intertwined with telling character development and smart irony. From the cavalier `Ja' interview between McDormand and the two young women who showed the inept criminals a good time, to the priceless parking lot attendant/authority discourse we are treated to a stream of palaver that is amusing and at the same time insightful. We are so entertained that we don't even find it strange that Buchemi's character uses phrases like force majeure.3.) The bizarre circumstances that intersperse the story that are resolved through violence. From the slapstick-like kidnapping scene to the fortuitous highway massacre to the disgusting wood chipper finale, the violence that underlies the generally flat exterior of the characters, is seemingly incongruous. It is however, a reminder that even though the people in this world are somewhat stolid, tumult and depravity pervades beneath the persona. This is driven home in McDormand's expostulation to the surviving criminal near the end.4.) Jerry Lundergard. There are numerous nuances to the film but the most interesting surround Macy. A cashier gives him an egregious simper in a diner, his inept dealings with his oppressive father-in-law lend him our sympathy and his reply to his son, `Just ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya!' makes us cringe. Two scenes with him are very piquant and tell us much about him: the true-coat scam, and the part where he enters his father-in-laws office to discuss a business deal and there is nowhere for him to sit. Simply brilliant!A great movie.</fullReview>

He then hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stromare) to kidnap his wife and get her father, who is rich to pay a "ransom" amount of $1 million. When all goes wrong, a pregnant police officer (Frances McDormand), goes out to find the kidnappers and bring them in for justice. The movie was just great.

		<shortDescription>A morality play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a violent movie; still I am inclined to call it a minor masterpiece. Many viewers disdain violence in movies without making any effort to distinguish the ways in which violence may figure in a story. Deplore, if you like, those movies which seek to portray violence for its own sake, or for titillation, or for money; but know that "Fargo" is not one of these. Rather it has the feel of a Medieval morality play (with a Medieval style musical score, if you needed a hint), wherein the evil-doers suffer the consequences of their actions, and those consequences occur on more levels than meet the eye.Also, know that the criminals are presented in a very unflattering light, are seen for what they are--creepy Neanderthals. The big blond guy, Grimsrud, is sub-human. At the end, the endearing and good-hearted woman sheriff makes a statement to him (and to us) about how his evil actions, even had they succeeded, had gained him nothing of lasting value. In her soliloquy she compares blood money with the value of the joy of an innocent heart ("and it's a beautiful day"), but he doesn't even know what she is talking about. She is speaking to an empty shell--immoral behavior has left him with a soul so shrunken and shriveled that he can't comprehend or appreciate beauty on any level.Oh, this is a little gem of a movie! Its touches of macabre humor--the not-quite-growls of the fearsome father-in-law, the sullen son's musical idol, the unedifying conversation of the killers, the bouncing pony tail on the enthusiastic young prostitute, the TV drama watched by the Neanderthal--provide just the right contrast to the violence. The cinematography and acting are uniformly wonderful. It is indeed a pity that this one lost out to the incredibly inane "English Patient" for the Oscar; it would be unbelievable if we didn't know Hollywood so well.If you deplore wicked behavior, but enjoy wicked satire, see this movie. (But if you are an adolescent male, don't bother--this one's not for you.)Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a very overrated movie.I've seen Blood simple, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, and now Fargo, and I have to say, the first three win big over the last. What I like most about Coen movies is the originality - look at the crazy biker guy in Arizona, or the climax in blood simple, or the the entire movie in Lebowski. Their movies are stunning and ahead of their time.Fargo, on the other hand, is not. In fact, the script lies down so flat it's hard to believe that someone actually made this movie... it simply didn't need to be made. I have to give credit for poking fun at the north midwest - I was born in North Dakota and moved to Rochester, Minnesota and then St. Paul before heading East - but that just doesn't make this a good movie.The premise (guy hires thugs to kidnap his wife and he gets the ransom) isn't original. The criminal hi-jinks (kidnappers shoot everybody and anybody in their way) certainly aren't original. And please, Frances McDormand's character might just be the biggest cliche in the entire movie. Good cop gets the bad guys in the end. There wasn't even any suspense, nothing went wrong... most of the entire movie was predictable. And even though McDormand delivers a fine, fine performance, she's only in the movie for fifty minutes or so!The Coens' unmistakable touches on the film are what save it for me. The humor, the accents, the situational irony are superb. But they can't save the plot, which is just too ordinary.Overall a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, for fine cinematography, a very good score, the realistic accents, and the great ensemble acting. And any movie with William H. Macy in it deserves a good rating, IMO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant doesn't even begin to describe this film. Each character has been drawn so carefully and with so much delicacy that we must be interested. Who can NOT identify with William H. Macy's amazing Jerry and his feeling of being in a hole so deep, you'll do whatever you can to dig yourself out, regardless of how extreme it may be. And then when your hole just gets deeper and deeper, it's just so very tragic. Macy is terrific at playing these types of characters, (and if you haven't seen his 2000 movie, "Panic" shame on you) where he's in trouble and he can't seem to find his way out, no matter how hard he tries. Next up is Marge, played with amazing subtlety by Frances McDormand, who is just a great actress. While she doesn't seem to say ALL that much in the movie, I wouldn't call her character simple by any means. She is thinking. Should we force this cop to talk about everything she's discovering and realizing just because she's in a movie? That's ridiculous. And, here's what I read about the Asian man, and it makes perfect sense. (Warning: This kindof reveals some stuff that I think is common knowledge, but all who haven't seen this great film may not know. Yeah, don't read this without seeing the movie) The scene with them at the restaurant takes place just after she talks to Jerry the first time, and nothing happens. She talks with the Asian man and finds out that all that stuff he had told her was a lie. So then she realizes that Hey! this could be the case with Jerry as well, so she goes back and interrogates him once more, and discovers she was right. There you go. It makes perfect sense. I love the way that the grisly aspects in Fargo are treated as not so much hilarious as they are peculiar and bizarre, such as the kidnapping. It's funny, but in a peculiar way. I think that is the best way to describe this movie. It is engaging, fascinating, to me just plain irresistable, and peculiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is by far the most excellent piece by the Coen's if not any director. Well written with surprising, comic, dialogue that always makes you smile no matter how many times you've seen the movie. Steve Buscemi, as Carl Showalter, gives his greatest performance ever. As does W. H. Macy, playing the first villain I ever really felt sorry for. This is a great movie to see and gets top stars from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo is a black comedy, maybe even a tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning of the Coen brothers film Fargo a sign tells us that we are about to witness a true story. The sign fades to white and from within the white a car emerges. The car tows another brand new, light brown car on a country road covered in snow. The story, in its simplicity, is based on an authentic criminal case: A failed car dealer hires two villains to kidnap his wife in order to collect the ransom himself and thereby solving his economic troubles. But the kidnapping goes wrong and a series of innocent people get killed and soon the police is on his and his accomplices' tails. The man that tows the car is Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman. He's on his way to meet the two villains, whom are the ones to kidnap his wife, in Fargo, North Dakota. The towed car is a down-payment of the kidnappning.Carter Burwells musical score and the snow softly falling down contributes to amplify the fateful mood. The Coen brothers last film, The Hudsucker Proxy (called Strebern in Sweden) was a wonderful story with actors as Paul Newman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tim Robbins. The movie wasn't a success. At least not in the USA. Joel and Ethan Coen refers to the movie as "Coen brothers big flop" and doesn't deny that Fargo is a deliberate step into a new filmable manner, maybe to once get the home audiences approval. Fargo is a low budget movie without any stars and with a modest length of 93 minutes with which the Coen brothers finally have conquered the american audience.Fargo is a kind of tragic comedy. Jerry Lundegaard is an average familyfather who once was every mothers dream that gets pushed around by his wife's father. The kidnapping is as much a way for him to solve his economical problems, as it is for him to speak his mind. When he decides to go along with his plan, it's probably the first in a long time that he takes an inititive. Gaer Grimsrud and Carl Showalter are the villains he hires. The one is the talkative, and you believe he will never end, and the other says less than 15 lines in the entire movie!Together they make an odd couple that only argue when they talk to each other. They are extremely clumsy and it's sometimes hard to believe the ferocious and violent acts that are carried out by them. The people in Fargo aren't evil even though they do evil actions. They're not comedians but they end up in comic situations. The kidnappning is brutal but the events just before, during and after are extremely funny and it is hard not to laugh. Likewise when the hand over by the ransom money end up in a shooting; and instead of blood it's feathers that pour out. Marge Gundersen, the pregnant police officer that with her thick winter clothing looks like a penguin, is the antipole of Jerry Lundegaard. But Marge isn't a person that you laugh at. In difference to Jerry she knows exactly what she is doing and has no problem in dealing with the situations she encounters. Marge is more charming than comic and is no regular movie hero. It takes 40 minutes before we encounter her for the first time. It's the events before, that introduces her.Fargo is a black comedy, maybe even a tragedy. The Swedish actor Peter Stormare makes a great performance as the strong silent smoking villain, Gaer Grimsrud. My advise is to see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' best film (and that's saying a lot!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review contains potential spoilers, but nothing major.The one-line summary above was hard to write; the brothers Coen, always as a team, consistently deliver solid and usually masterful films with their beautiful visual style and amazingly realistic dialogue. Barton Fink and Miller's Crossing are very closely behind this as their best production. However, Fargo's mix of quiet, intellectual comedy and hard-hitting crime thriller is really amazing. The film can be compared to their debut, the 80's thriller "Blood Simple", only with a slightly lighter tone and less disturbing environment; both involve a husband/wife heist gone wrong, only in Fargo it comes together perfectly.The acting leaves nothing to be desired. Put simply, they are up there with the best of the 90's; Steve Buscemi is awesome as the constantly-cursing smart guy behind the scheme; William H. Macy, a loser in just about every role he plays, delivers here in his best performance; and Frances McDormand is absolutely incredible as the pregnant cop on the trail of the kidnappers.Fargo has many classic scenes. In one of the most intense sequences ever filmed, Buscemi's character drags a dead cop off the highway as an onlooker drives by to witness the action. Afterwards, he is hunted down by the other kidnapper and shot to death in the dead cold snow. To see two innocent people killed by a hardened criminal is not only chilling, it's downright disturbing. Many other great scenes precede and follow this one. To list them all would be futile; every scene is perfection. Fargo is a masterpiece and MUST be seen by any serious film buff, and most definitely by any Coen Brothers fan. "A+"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a great film about a kindnapping scheme gone wrong. Macy is the pathetic car dealer who plots to have his wife kidnapped so he can get the reward money for his own greedy prospects. He drafts Buscemi and his silent partner who in my opinion are the greatest pair of comedic criminals. Things go wrong when a body count starts and a pregnant police chief starts an investigation. Macy, McDormand, Buscemi and Stromare. Great dialouge and the locations are wonderous. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the few Coen brothers movies that received a lot of mainstream appreciation. I personally liked it because it was made and set in a part of the U.S. that is relatively alien to most people, the upper midwest area of Minnesota and North Dakota, aside from Mary Tyler Moore. Frances McDormand gave one of the most believable performances ever as a perfectly nice and laid-back, but not a doormat, police chief. It seems that she, her husband, and deputy are the only truly decent and likable people in the movie, while the car dealer, salesman, the kidnappers, mechanic, etc. are all greedy, cowardly, and morally bankrupt, but I really felt sorry for Jerry to a degree because he's one of those just not smart or tough enough to lie his way out of anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I didn't know that this was based on a true story, I would have missed the wonder of this film, and the wonder for me is its "depth and restraint". Not since In Cold Blood (1967), Directed by Richard Brooks (I) Starring Robert Blake, has a film showed such purity of purpose (oops thoughts of "Purity of Essence" - Dr. Strange Love have started me giggling now), depth, and restraint. The story speaks for itself through superb acting and everyone's dedication to accurate portrayals of the personalities behind the story. The direction is clear, clean, and careful, and the editing superb. There is no waste in this film, and attention to detail is heavenly. If it weren't for the control and moderation exercised by all, the film could have wandered off into melodrama with little effort. The story is truly bizarre, featuring an incompetent detestable group of people which is made painfully clear to the viewer mostly through the part of one kidnapper who seems to be the most incompetent of the bunch, yet who also gets so crazed from everyone else's incompetence that he starts literally coming apart at the end of the film. The good guys are working people going about their jobs in a way that we can all relate to. I can't bring myself to reveal even a snippet of what actually transpires over the course of the film. This is, at almost every turn, both comical and horrifying. The incompetence and inhumanity of the criminals and the amateur respondents is both hysterical and horrifying, and the deadpan matter-of-fact behavior of the investigating officers is nearly unbelievable and so continuously unexpected that belly laughs and guffaws will abound. I can't decide which is the more horrifying; the behavior of the bad guys or the fact that I found so much in the film to laugh at. You will laugh, shake your head in wonder, gasp in disgust, and then find yourself laughing at the very next turn. Truly a memorable film and one you might want to own, because you will watch it more than once. I have seen it at least half-a-dozen times and each time I see it, I see things that I missed or comprehend things I didn't understand during the previous viewing. As I said, the film has great depth and generous detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS NOT A TRUE STORY!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Such frustration! Fargo being probably one of my favorite movies of all time, I just had to comment on a few misconceptions, misguided comments, etc.1. This is NOT a true story. That text at the beginning of the film was a joke, part of the brilliant, subtle comedy of this film. So, no these people do not really exist. I mean REALLY! If this hilarious bungled crime actually happened, don't you think we would have heard about it?2. Slow? This movie is not slow at all. It just isn't quick-cut, tons-of-action-a-minute like the vapid films that make $100 million at the box office in one week. And, at any rate, ever BEEN to Minnesota? Life is slow out there. Perhaps the pacing of the film was mimicking the way of life in the midwest?3. The whole Mike Yanagita thing. Why couldn't the purpose of this whole side-story just simply be to add texture to the film, another layer to Marge's character? Unlike some people who took SUCH issue with it, I didn't mind it at all, and laughed my head off at the sight of an Asian man speaking with a hilarious MN accent. People might think that's "Non-PC" who cares. It's called COMEDY.4. Oh, the accents. I dont want to hear it. I work with people from Minnesota, and YES they do talk like that.5. Frances, the Acting Goddess, giving a FLAT performance? It's called S-U-B-T-L-E-T-Y. Please look it up. I know Hollywood doesnt much like subtlety, but once in a while it sneaks in there and the film is better for it.6. Cant this be BOTH dramatic/tragic and comic at the same time? There is no rule that says a film has to fit neatly into one genre! This film IS tragic, it IS dramatic, and it IS very funny. So whats the problem?Oh, yes... And I am one of the many who feel that The English Patient was an overblown, overrated, big, boring epic that did not deserve the Oscar over this little gem of a film that's destined to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hits and misses. (Minor spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, the success of a film is largely depending on to what extent it kept me glued to the screen. Whenever I decide to watch 'just a couple of minutes' while gobbling down a late night snack, and end up watching the whole movie because it is able to grab me by the neck and never lets go, someone has done something right. So Fargo was a very strange experience. It begins very well, with actors giving straight A performances, doing a tremendous job in establishing their characters. Their mannerisms, looks, and voices make these well-written characters three dimensional and fun to watch. The story premise is promising. Loser of the year Macey needs money and his father-in-law is loaded, but because he want to keep his 'dignity', he just decides to hire a duo of loonies to kidnap his wife and split the ransom, to be coughed up by daddy.Needless to say, "Things Go Wrong", to quote a minor Chris Isaak song. Blood is shed and, eventually, the bodies just keep piling up.Investigating all this, is a pregnant and merry sheriff, who loves her Bob Ross-wannabe hubby and just can't figure out why, on such a lovely day, people would want to kill one another over some money.But, keeping Chris Isaak in mind, it never became the wonderful movie I expected it to be.It's a rather meandering movie, and between the many moments of brilliance, there's also a lot of boring stuff, many moments that enables one to visit the john or get another beer without missing anything interesting or crucial. Mind you, I'm not talking about 'slow scenes'. 'Slow' and 'boring' are, as we all know, two completely different things. Sometimes it's necessary to walk slowly to admire the view, to catch the details or to be soaked up by the atmosphere ("Lost Highway"; "Barry Lyndon"). That's good. But when you find yourself in a small room with no windows and start to walk slowly around in circles ("Eyes Wide Shut"), that's when restlessness and boredom start to kick in. This film contains a lot of stuff that could and should have been cut out. For example, the subplot involving the Mike Yanagita character. According to the charming and talented actress Frances McDormand, who did an interview on Dutch television, this scenes were included to show that even her loveable character Marge has her dark side, as she doesn't know how to behave during the date with this old school buddy of hers. Ms. McDormand ended her explanation with the rhetorical question "[Joel en Ethan Coen] are great writers, aren't they?"Well, a truly great writer would have been able to make that point about Marge within the main story itself, instead of having to resort to an additional storyline that sticks out like a sore thumb and momentarily halts the movie.So watching this movie is weird for me. I own it on video and whenever I put it on to watch 'just a couple of minutes', my fingers keep starting to move to the stop button. Every time I'm about to push it, something brilliant happens on the screen and I let go of the remote, only to find my fingers going towards it again a couple of minutes later.*** out of ****</fullReview>

Maybe Coen movies are just not my type...it seems as if they need professional help. I'm not sure why their movies are given such high reward. I have seen better, more entertaining movies that are not as highly acclaimed by the critics. If you are a person who likes easy-flow, easy to follow movies, Fargo and Blood Simple are not for you.

Over the course of the film she faces horrible monstrocities, and she handles herself with a cool professionalism that is rarely seen in female characters. This is one of my favorite movies.

		<fullReview>It's hard to find something new to say about this film after so many comments have already been posted here. I'll own up to being one of the crowd who claim that it's close to flawless.So what I'd like to highlight is this: Frances McDormand's portrayal of the police chief Marge Gunderson strikes me as being one of the best depictions of a wholly good person that I've seen on screen. It would have been so easy for the script to have given her a raft of inner demons to overcome or a corrupt PD to fight or mounds of frustrating paperwork to do. All old stuff - seen it dozens of times. But no - Marge lives a comfortable but not wealthy life, she has a husband whom she loves and who loves her and she possesses the kind of natural trust in people which allows her to be deceived by an old school friend because, heck, why would he lie to her? But Marge is trusting, not gullible; she lives a simple life, but she's not simple; she's gentle with people, but she's not a doormat.It's just so refreshing to find a character who demonstrates that good doesn't equal stupid and that nice guys don't have to finish last.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the movie was released, the Oscars should've came up with a new award: Best Method of Taking a Bullet (in reference to Steve Buscemi being shot in the face).As I watched this the first time, it was hard to believe this really happened. It was hard to watch how violent and bitter Buscemi and his accomplice Peter Stormare were. Stormare's character was worse than Buscemi's, but still. I think William H. Macy should've won the Oscar. He was very good. This is probably the best movie by the Coen brothers. If not, Miller's Crossing. The cinematography and director (Joel Coen) made this movie look real. I also think that the score was brilliant and should've won an Oscar. Nobody seems to agree with me on that, though.The best scene is when Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is in the police car with Grimsrud (Stormare) and she's saying all these things like "There's more to life than a little money....And here you are, and it's a beautiful day. I just don't understand it.", because that's what the movie is all about. And Stormare's simple acting is great. You have to see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The greatest film of the 90's." "One of AFI's 100 Greatest Films." Don't get me wrong...i found some parts of Fargo great...but unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't hold up. I highly respect the Coen Bros. I think Barton Fink and O Brother Where Art Thou? are two of the most enjoyable and most visually appealing films I have ever seen. And from their other films, I have walked away feeling good.In Fargo, however, I was bored and in anticipation of something great. That "great" never came. I thought Frances McDormand was decent,William H. Macy increasingly nervous, but I felt the real excitement was brought to the screen by Steve Buscemi. A staple of Coen Bros. films, he brought such explosiveness to the screen. He should have been nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, b/c he does just that...he supports a film that i felt would have otherwise fallen flat on its face. As i said, though, Fargo did have some great parts, like all of their films do. The hotel room fight between Shep and Carl(Buscemi's character) left me laughing and in awe. The same goes for the confrontation on the parking garage between Carl and another character. So, in conclusion, Fargo decent...Steve Buscemi excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe that people rented Fargo because it was a black comedy and expected Jim Carrey type laughs from it. If you look up the definition of black comedy, you'll see that its not supposed to be "ha ha" funny.Its a cutting study of human nature, showing that people will get greedy for no reason and, kill others with only the slightest provocation. And it happened!!!!!!!! !! !!!!!!The reason Fargo is a great movie, (maybe the best film of the 90's) is BECAUSE its based on a true story!! If you went into it not knowing that fact or not caring, then it would not mean much to you after you saw it. I'll admit that if it were not a true story, it would be a very uninteresting movie. But it IS, and thats the essence of it.I had a friend tell me that he had no problem solving the mystery long before then end. "IT WASN'T A WHO-DUNIT MOVIE!!" I screamed at him. He obviously missed the entire point of the film, and so did a lot of the other people who commented on it here.If you watch a lot of Temptation Island, Dawson's Creek or re-runs of Dukes of Hazzard, then think twice before you rent Fargo.

		<shortDescription>The prototype of an excellent thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning this film reminded me on Sam Raimi´s "A Simple Plan" which I had seen before and which is also worthy to watch, but very soon "Fargo" develops its very own style. The story is about a quite harmless conspiracy that ends in a total disaster. All happens in a small dump called "Fargo", that is snowy and idyllic, where you couldn´t expect anything evil. But the Coen Brothers take a look behind the facade, a view into the depths of the human soul. It all starts with a kidnapping action that finally leads to five senseless murders. It´s a film about cheating, betraying and killing. At last you´ve got the unpleasent feeling that something could be wrong with your own neighbour... This movie is a brilliant mixture between thriller, drama and satire. There are some macabre/funny scenes in it (when Gear "disposes" his companion Carl) and a lot of peculiar characters, what is usual for the outputs of Joel and Ethan (watch also "The Big Lebowski" and you know what I mean...). Of course, "Fargo" is casted with the obligatory Coen-staff, that contains Joel´s wife Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi who´s stealing the other ones show. Perhaps some people might find this movie dull: "Fargo" is no film with big talk and 10000 dead per minute... You have to pay attention on the subtle humour and the little subtleties in it. Take this advice - and enjoy "Fargo"! (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This darkly comic tale from the Coen brothers is arguably their finest piece of work to date. They apply their trademark quirky style to the not entirely original plot of a car salesman who arranges his own wife's kidnapping in order to get the ransom money from his scrooge-like father-in-law. However, the simplicity of the plot allows you to concentrate on the most important part of the film, the carefully crafted characters, each with their own idoesyncrasies that make it a delight to see which strange creation will appear in the next scene.These are perfectly realised by a fantastic cast of actors. While credit must go to the ever-dependable Steve Buscemi as the bungling kidnapper and William H. Macy as the salesman full of frustration and impotent rage, the best performance is by Frances McDormand, who deservedly won an Oscar as the heavily pregnant sheriff trying to solve the crime. The only main female character in the film, she is surrounded by a succession of increasingly more pathetic men, from her househusband, to an old school friend who still lives with his parents. Even the crime itself lurches from one disaster to another as events conspire to make a seemingly straightforward kidnapping escalate into a multiple homicide. The unfamiliar location of Dakota provides some great backdrops and spectacularly barren vistas and the snow somehow adds to the absurdity of the whole situation. Also adding to the comedy element are the unusual local accents which are seemlessly adopted by the cast and if you don't find yourself mimicking a Minnesotan for a few days after seeing 'Fargo' then you really ought to visit a doctor to see about getting that funny bone removed, it's obviously not working right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is hands-down the best film of the 90's, and that's high praise from a decade that brought us Forrest Gump, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, and The Silence of the Lambs. It is one of the bleakest movies I have ever seen, and also one of the funniest. I have watched it many times, and sometimes I feel like crying in every scene, and others I bust out laughing in all of them. Claims that the humor here is morally depraved are off-base because, of course, we only laugh because we choose to. Fargo has the best of both worlds.5/5, 10/10, 100/100, etc...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Desperate car dealer in quest for cash is basically the premise. Crimes are committed. The chief of police is on the case, and she is nobody's fool. FARGO has more twists than a bag of pretzels. It is also one of, if not, the best American made films of 1996. Intelligent scripting. Great also, was the earnest presentation of the peculiar dialect of many folks of Scandinavian heritage, who reside in the "Land Of 10,000 Lakes." Deep, rich character portrayals, without the silly, hackneyed Hollywood shtick getting in the way. Accolades for Macy and McDormand, and a solid supporting cast. Harve Pressnell is a standout, who doesn't "muck" things up. Macy's character literally falls apart before our eyes. Another excellent film from Joel and Ethan Coen. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Southern film at the 49th parallel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film typifies one of my pete peeves, but on the other end of the country. Just like most 'southern' films, with fake accents and fake body languages and fake cutesieisms, Fargo is a film about North Dakota (actually Minnesota) starring people who couldn't find Fargo on a map. True, there aren't very many Angie Dickinsons and Lawrence Welks and Roger Marises to play the convincing parts of North Dakotans. But this thing stinks of overblown accents, almost as badly as Jessica Lang (who is from Duluth!) stinking up the house in "Streetcar Named Desire". It's embarrassing to watch `regional color' films in which parts are played by actors who have never been closer to MInnesota than listeing to "Prairie Home Companion".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful, hilarious, and very dark black comedy about a kidnapping gone awry. The Coen brothers take this seemingly exhausted theme and make a film that is one of the best of the 1990's. William H. Macy is superb as Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman who hires two guys (Buscemi and Stormare) to kidnap his wife. The film unfolds beautifully and we scene after scene of sharp, funny and intelligent screen writing along with a group of fantastic actors. Perhaps the best low-budget film of the 90's, this is a film that no one can miss. Won two Oscars for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress (Frances McDormand).****1/2 /5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got to see this film that seemed much applauded when it first came out in 1996. It was worth viewing. It's a good example of how an action can lead to enormous, disastrous consequences. My only gripe with the film is discovering, while surfing the net, that it wasn't an actual true event with the Coen brothers being rather evasive on the subject. Otherwise there should have been a postscript at the end of the film as others do. I was initially intrigued that it was based on true life, thinking that one couldn't conceive such disaster. Now, if that was only a gimmick, then I think it's a cheap one and one that the Coen brothers need not have used. What do others think? Does truth matter in this way?As to the overall rating, I'd give it a 4/5 for being a well-constructed film and captivating entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished viewing Fargo in a Media class, and I think that it's one of the best that I've ever seen. The performances of the two who play the kidnappers is truely something to be marveled at. On one hand, you have the silent, dark , brooding type, then you get to the other, a loud extrovert who gets so frightened when the first murder of the officer happens, it's just so contradicatry. The whole of the film is centered about the comical thriller aspect of the narration, mainly being omniscient when the scene cuts back to Jerry and Wade, but being balanced between restrictive and omniscient when the kidnappers are featured. If the film has any bad points, I for one, certainly can't see them. Ok, so I may like this sort of film, but it's because it's a change from the usual. It's funny, and scary at the same time, much like Psycho after the 2nd viewing and seeing all the in-jokes. In summary, I think that this film is the best that I've ever seen, I hope that you'll like it as much as me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very realistic must see movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a film unlike most films I have seen in my lifetime. Its level of detail and realism makes the film stand out. The criminals in this movie do an excellent job playing their parts. They are the kind of criminal you see in a variety of movies, the ones who blunder because of their own stupidity, but unlike a lot of other movies I have seen, the actors in Fargo make their ignorance seem so real. Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and Peter Stormare (Gaear Grimsrud) do an excellent job of making their roles believable ones. Sometimes I just wanted to burst out laughing but refrained from doing so because of the content of the scenes. At the end of this film you'll be asking yourself, `Was this really based on a true story?' This film is referred to as a black comedy, meaning that what makes the film funny is the way the gruesome scenes are handled in the film. Overall I'd really recommend this film, unless you have a strong distaste for violence. There is never a slow scene in the entire film; you'll have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time wondering what is going to happen next. The ending is very ironic, and it's something you'll pick up on immediately when you see it. A very well done and must see movie!</fullReview>

Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy)is the classic novice criminal. He is almost to dumb to dislike. Carl Showalter(Steve Buschemi)is the classic career criminal who can't figure out that he is not very good at his chosen profession. Marge Gunderson ( Frances Mcormand) is the classic small town police chief, she seems to be very nieve but you can tell that just like Columbo she always gets her man!

I will comment on the pregnant police officer, which was my favorite character, who had great strength and courage throughout the film. Many of my friends have seen it and bragged greatly about it, those comments were what influenced me to see the film in the first place. They commented on how funny it was, on how good it went together, and the people who were casted in the film. This film did not humor me at all, well maybe a bit, during certain spots. Yet overall the film was directed magnificently, and the plot flowed together well. The film was not to short, but just long enough to enjoy. I don't care for those movies that take forever, and drag on and on. Just beware some scenes in this film where gruesome and vulgar. Well I'm glad I finally rented it and watched it, but I will probably never rent it again. One main thing to remember is that this film is based on a true story. It is amazing what these criminals do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT This was a great movie. It showed to be full of thrill, suspense, some comedy, and many surprises. It was hard for me to believe that it was based on a true story. The film wasn't too long or short it was just perfect. All the scenarios were significant because one lead to the next. It was amazing at what length the producer went to gather all the significant characters to make this movie like Frances McDormand who played Marge Gunderson, the pregnant policewoman with a strong personality. At first when she appeared, I laughed and thought what could she do, she can barely walk. Yet at the end I was impressed at her courage when she approached Peter Stormare, who played Gaear Grimsrud the cool quiet kidnapper, and without hesitation shot him in the leg to arrest him. There were some scenes that were too gruesome to watch, like when the trooper was shot in the head and you could see the blood gushing out of his head. Also the scene when Peter Stormare was pushing Steve Buscemi's body, who played Carl Showalter the other funny looking kidnapper, through the wood chipper. My main point is that this is a must see movie if you haven't seen it before. Trust me, you'll see stuff you would never think you'd see, just keep in mind that the movie was based on a true story!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Seemingly-Simplistic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a wonderfully unusual, extremely well scripted crime film that crackles with strongly developed, yet very off-beat characters, sporadic violence, splashes of dark comedy, and an outstanding ensemble supporting cast.When Jerry Lundergaard (the marvelous William Macy) schemes to have his wife kidnapped by criminals Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare so that he can collect the ransom money from his wealthy father-in-law, everything is planned and set to go smoothly. But this, being a Coen brothers film, nothing goes as planned and eventually everything goes downhill. That's when Officer Marge Gunderson (the quirky Frances McDormand) begins her investigation of the "malfesance."Fargo's greatest attribute is the dead-on, masterful performances of its cast, and not one of them misses their mark. The standout, however, is William Macy, as the none-too-bright husband whose scheme goes terribly awry. Macy perfectly embodies the inept Lundergaard and portrays his frustration wonderfully with such lines as "the heckdy'a mean?" Even after his plans take a turn for the absolute worst, we sympathize with his plight. His scene with his son is such a squirm-inducing one, that for a minute we find him both despicable and we sympathize. Frances McDormand also shines in her Oscar-winning role as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant, determined, quirky, and optimistic detective assigned to unravel this mystery. Buscemi and Stormare are also dead on as the kidnappers : Stormare's dry, mute performance complements the loud, abrasive performance by Buscemi.The scenery is also appropriately bleak and desolate, with the whiteness and dreariness of snow pervading all, from it's opening shot of a single car materializing out of the white of snowfall. It's interesting to see how the Coens have contrasted the bleakness of the area with the colorfulness of it's inhabitants: all seem to be perky, polite, and ever-so-nice.The script is also well-written, with some very original, inventive scenes, such as Macy's car sale to an irate customer, an abrupt car chase in the stinging coldness of Brainerd, and a very colorful conversation with a local regarding some suspicious "lookin fellas." The dialogue is also quite funny at points, and effectively terse at others.Fargo is a film that is a crime film that is engaging without any of the normal elements found in the genre: it has no long, dangerous car chases, no grandiose shootouts, and of course, it has no cliched, stale villains or heroes. It's power lies in its uniqueness, both in its complex story and its down-to-earth, credible, engaging characters, and of course the concrete, dazzling performances turned it by the entire cast. Fargo is a winner, and is it destined to be a classic? In the words of McDormand, "Oh, ya."9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is far and away the best film of the 90s and is number two on my list of all-time favorites. When I first rented it, I had it for three days and watched it seven times. I found it the best black comedy ever put on film. After the first viewing, I had the feeling that I had just watched an Oscar-winning performance and was validated when McDormand won.I saw a comment about "seeing it over and over again" and I agree 100%. I never tire of watching it and speaking the lines along with the movie.But the disclaimor at the beginning of the movie stating it is based on a true story is false. It's only after I watched the credits closely at the end of the movie did I see the statement that the characters were ficticious. Well, Mr. and Mr. Coen, you had me fooled. I've spent far too much time to no avail trying to find information on the original case. You two are too much!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect example of the "dark comedy" genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of this film plays like a comedy. It's very funny in a dark kind of way, especially the deadpan comments of the two crooks and the perfect timing of the direction. Then, all of sudden...BAM...the smalltwon sheriff is graphically shot in the head. You then find yourself saying, "Wait a minute...that wasn't very funny." The movie just gets more interesting at that point, especially when we are introduced to our hero...a pregnant police chief named Marge. Huh? It's neat how this film shows us a thriller played out by simple smalltown folk. William H. Macy does an excellent job portraying a man who is frustrated and can't seem to get a break. And even though he's about to have his own wife kidnapped and scam the hired thugs out of millions of dollars in ransom money, his humbleness and frustration causes us to relate with him, and we feel sorry for him (until the end, at least). The film reminds us all of a time in which we had a good thing planned out and going good for ourselves, only to watch someone else ruin it for us. And on a final note: The accents in the film, although funny, are greatly exaggerated. Many people who live in the region are embarrassed and offended by it. But guess what? Movies have been doing the same thing to people from the South for a long, long time (Watch any movie that has a Yankee actor using a ridiculous "southern accent"). I think it's time for the Midwest to stop complaining, Fargo is one of the best films of the nineties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading comments of other viewers corrobates the fact that Fargo will become a cult classic. Some view it as a cinematic masterpiece; others view it as the complete opposite. Still others view it as a leg-pull. Regardless, the story, acting and reality base of the characters cannot be ignored. It is a black comedy, a genre which generally doesn't lend itself to gut-wrenching guffaws, yet it is also a thriller. It may take a couple of viewings to truly appreciate the brillance of the Coen brothers and of the cast. Locally, Fargo's release and popularity caused another Coen project, "Blood Simple," to be re-released in theatres around town. Watch them both -both are excellent, but Fargo, coming 13 years after Blood Simple, will show that the Coen Brothers have refined their craft, not re-invented it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lesson in film-making 'for some'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well,having watched and liked the film in theaters a couple of years ago,I bought the DVD and watched it again feeling utterly glad to do so.Coen brothers are a remarkable duo and this film should be handed to those some HW producers as a sample of how to make a celluloid a film not some drivel or crap even with a minor budget and not-so-well-known cast.The characters are remarkable yet offset,dialogue simple but convincing cinematography brilliant in its sheer beauty.Peter Stormare (a parallel performance to his 8MM) and Steve Buscemi especially were outrageously great.I don't know the box-office results for this movie in the States but being a European,I occasionally feel relieved to see films come to life like this one and hope to expect some more.See 'Battlefield Earth' with a budget of 70+ something megabuck budget and compare.You will be surprised yet angry.Having the chance to be the no:1 in film industry with unmatched financial power let's hope HW can provide something not only for morons but for people who respect the art of film-making. Simply watch this one...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers brilliantly dark comedy. They assembled an all star cast with two of my favorite actors in the world today, Steve Buscemi and William H. Macy. The movie is quite simply one of my favorite movies of all time. You don't get much better than what these two guys put on the screen with this film. It was robbed at the Oscars, there was no better movie that year than this and you can put that statement in the bank because it is fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is not to understand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the best films ever made and certainly one of my favourites, but I've read alot of negative reviews here. One main whine among commentors is that they dont get it, stating they dont understand why people think it's funny. This is a DARK comedy, a BLACK comedy. The people who say this isnt funny are the same people who said Dr. Strangelove wasnt funny when it appeared.Why is it funny? The main comic quality i found, rests on Steve Buscemi's character ("How the F--k do you split a f-----g car you dummy? With a f------g chainsaw?") that still kills me. It's a display of every possible aspect of movie emotion. Comedy, romance, anger, greed... it's all here. As everyone knows, it isnt for everyone. But some people got it, and thats whats important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, my wife hated it. It is, granted, an acquired taste, as are most Coen Bros. movies ("Big Lebowski" more so than most). One of the things that brings me back to this film over and over again is the realistic portrayal, particularly with regard to the accent, of upper-midwesterners. There's not much more frustrating to me than films that purportedly are set in a locale, yet the characters do or say nothing that people who actually live there would ("Stigmata" is a particularly egriegous example that takes place right here in Pittsburgh). I like the story, like the dark humor, but the characters are the clincher. Oh gee, ja.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie; I love to watch it and revel in the details of a conspiracy plot gone wrong. The pacing of the film is absolutely perfect - it never lags, yet every scene present is significant in some way. While I hate to use a cliche, the movie puts you through quite a ride - one minute you are flinching at a particularly violent scene, the next minute you are chuckling at some banter between two characters.The acting itself is superb; all of the actors who have major parts in the film (Macy, McDormand, Buscemi, Presnell, Stormare) manage to portray their characters in such a way to complement the storyline as it moves forward. None of them "steal the show", so to speak - every actor in the movie put forth a good effort and they all manage to work well within the context of the story. On top of all that, the fact that the film looks beautiful is a testament to the camerawork; it's hard to make endless amounts of white snow look good, yet Fargo does it, time and time again.Everytime I watch Fargo, I am consistently amazed at how well done the film is. The entire movie is perfect entertainment, and the ending, while incredibly violent and dark, is superb; it's a great payoff as well as providing closure to the story.It's almost impossible to believe that this movie did not win the 1996 Academy Award for Best Picture. It was robbed, plain and simple. Fargo is as flawless as movies come, and arguably the best movie released in the 1990s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read so many great comments on this movie, and heard so many good things before I saw it, and I really felt let down.I just didn't get it. Was it a comedy that wasn't funny? An action film without action? I know it was a "true story" that wasn't true...so I just couldn't figure out what the point was.I really didn't care about any of the characters. We never knew the wife well enough to care that she was being kidnapped thanks to her good-for-nothing husband. I never cared about him, since he was such a greedy, stupid, low-life loser. I cared less about the kidnappers. I liked Marge and her husband, but we didn't really get to know them. Our brief glimpse into their life was, for me, very unsatisfying.The only line that made me even smile was the way everyone agreed that one of the kidnappers was "funny looking." This was a comedy? A family is torn apart and murdered over money disputes. This is comical? A policeman pulls a car over and gets shot in the head by the driver? Sorry, too close to reality for me to laugh.Having never been anywhere near Fargo, I can't comment on the accents, except to say they were sometimes hard for me to understand. But that's cause I'm a Noo Yawka.Marge's last line really summed it up for me, "I just don't understand."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading a lot of reviews, I agree w/ what a lot of people have to say. Fargo is a great movie. It's insightful and the extremes in life -good v. evil- are portrayed perfectly. I don't love movies like a lot of people do, but I LOVE "Fargo."I don't like wasting my time on movies that don't give you insight and make you think about things a little more. TV can waste my time fine for non-issues. Fargo is not on the level of a blockbuster in terms of action, but in terms of insight and quality, it is the best.For those that say it was overrated, maybe that's because they're expecting a mega-action movie. Nothing about Fargo is mega because it's so true to life. The extremes in Marge and Norm (extremely nice, genuine) and extremes of Jerry, Carl and Gaer (extremely evil, greedy, calice) do exist in real life and sometimes it's as boring and obvious as in Fargo.Fargo is not for everyone. Some people like to have things in your face. It is my favorite movie of all times, hands down. This is the only movie where I think every scene is so brilliant that it can be interpreted to have higher meaning and significance. It should have won Best Picture, but of course it didn't spend enough advertising $ to promote the movie, so that would corrupt the whole Hollywood industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is brilliant. It is entertaining and riveting in ways that most thrillers aren't. It has some clever observations of Minnesotan's, featuring a delightfully compelling, Oscar-winning performance from Frances McDormand, a funny and totally disarming one from William H. Macy, which really does heighten the intensity, and a hilarious contribution from Steve Buscemi, great cinematography, a triumphant score, and a brilliant, outstanding, oscar winning screenplay, courtesy of the Coen Brothers.The plot, involving a scheme from Jerry Lundengaad to hire two thugs to kidnap his wife and split the ransom money is clever, only one of the thugs turns homicidal, evoking a spree of panic and murder, which bring Marge (Frances McDormand), a pregnant sheriff onto the case.The Coen Brothers create some delightfully twisted set pieces, including a brilliantly cheesy Accordian King Poster, some deadpan scenes including an interview between Macy and McDormand and a muzak that heightens the tension.There are so many words I could use to describe the utter magic that is the Coen Bros. Just see the dern film, yaah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it weren't for the ending, this movie would be perfect. The problem is that it didn't say what happened to the characters before the final credits. Perhaps that's excusable because the film wasn't really based on a true story, but you might feel "left out dry" if you don't like cliffhanger endings. On the contrary, this film was still very good. All the performances were excellent, and the story keeps you interested all the way through. In other movies there will be parts that are slightly dull, but this is riveting from start to finish. What especially made it good is that you'll find a new thing everytime you watch it, much like The Usual Suspects. This had all the qualifications needed for the Best Picture Oscar and it's unfair that it didn't receive it. While it has less humor than earlier Coen Brother's movies, it still stands out as one of their best films, and maybe the best film of the decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo this and Fargo that. All I kept hearing was how good this film was and then I saw the ratings it was given and the Oscars it was nominated for and won and thought to myself, "I must really be missing something." So I go to Blockbuster pop it in and I admit I did have a few good laughs and every now and then I wanted to know what was going to happen next but over all the movie wasn't anything extroadinary. Don't get me wrong, I really don't prefer the $150 million action flicks. I'd pick Magnolia over Independence Day anytime but this movie didn't stand up to the buzz it recieved. Again, I didn't think that the film was bad at all. It was highly enjoyable, the acting was flawless, and I may even watch it again but it fell short of what I expected. Great movie but totally overhyped if you ask me.</fullReview>

What this movie is, is "plain" and "vanilla" and that is what makes it so great. There are no special effects, no "big name" actors.

I have to hand the credit to the Coen Brothers for a wonderful film; however, they were let down by most of their cast.Furthermore, the plot of this film seemed to go around the block because when something worthwhile happened it seemed to end up at a point where it was awful. The ending of the film was a little off-kilter because it seemed that it was forced to end that way.With the talented cast and oscars "Fargo" got, it really should have been better.

		<shortDescription>Fact is often stranger than fiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a four year wait, I finally picked Fargo off the shelf and rented a film that seemed, from many film critic's opinions, and from the Oscars distributed that year by the Film Academy, worth watching. And I wasn't disappointed. This is by no means an action-packed, fast-paced, roller-coaster ride of a crime thriller. But, as the opening credits point out, this is a true story, and the Coen Brothers have respectfully and bravely left the story to tell itself, the way it really happened. And it is this that makes it work. The fascination of being told a true story held my attention through the beginning, and through the building of the quirky characters, and by this time the film had become fascinating in itself. Through the chaotic life of an unhappy, desperate family man lured into staging his own wife's kidnapping to pay off debts, we get a charming insight into the simple but happy lives of the police officers of Brainerd, Minnesota and the chance to feed off the humour created by their unfazed, nonchalant attitude towards life and all that it throws at us, as they amble patiently along the murderous trail of crimes and stumble across the criminals at the climax. This film, for me, didn't need action and excitement. The saying that 'fact is stranger than fiction' held true in this instance. This was resounding evidence of the merit in telling a fascinating story exactly as it happened without the traditional Hollywood dramatisation. Quietly satisfying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story-telling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it again on tape and enjoyed it as well as in the cinema. While it never stirs the spirit or moves the emotions that an epic or even a great actioneer can, it so well-done with a minimum of 'movie-magic' that I was left, oddly, with the satisfaction that a parent feels on seeing a perfect score in the kid's gradebook.There are superficial parallels with that great Coen film Raising Arizona (which Frances McDormand also appeared in) in that a kidnapping is the premise for the story-telling, and that Frances McDormand's small fiesty redhead cop character immediately reminded me of Holly Hunter's (who, of course, used to be the Coens' room-mate). Their partners in both shows are also big gentle slow-witted types, as are the amateurish bad-guy duos. The bleak settings of the Arizona desert and the Dakota winterscape also provide a similar sense of background scale which, hence, enhance the focus on the human element.Fargo is far less self-indulgent in the fantastic humour of Arizona, yet retains the same smart cynicism. It has an eerily realistic European feel, with the natural acting and absence of MTV-style audio-visual enhancements. It generally "tells it as it is", from all the 'nature-of-life' little errors and screwups in most scenes, to the understated closing of the story. It champions honesty, integrity and the simple life, and how a little greed can disrupt the cycle of the good ol' American way of life.Another great movie which Fargo reminds me of is Gorky Park (1983 with Hurt, Marvin and Dennehy), set in wintertime USSR and released back in the days of the Evil Empire, albeit with a different slant, but with a similarly peaceful bleakness in the feel, backdrop and moral-of-story.</fullReview>

Part satire, part comedy, part suspense, part drama, yes, "Fargo" does have it all.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who later appeared in 1998's "Armageddon," steal the show as two bumbling crooks who rendezvous with everything from a hyper hostage to an angry boss. William H. Macy stands out as well, as a frazzled car salesman. Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar."Fargo," in addition to being well-acted, also oozes with style. Yes, small-town movies with a snowy backdrop are usually great.Finally, the script is near perfect. It has some hilarious lines, strangely lovable characters, and preposterous situations that somehow seem ... real.That's the beauty of "Fargo". It will steal your heart (and possibly your wallet) while making you contradict yourself the whole time.FARGO: ***** (out of Five)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt the Coen Bros' best film. Splendid cinematography, a chilling score, clever script, and brilliant performances make this quirky dark comedy a modern classic. Frances McDormand and William H. Macy are especially memorable. BTW to those who say the scene in the bar with Marge and her high-school chum Mikey was unnecessary, this is not so. Mikey tells Marge how he has married and had children, and that her wife had recently passed away. Marge believes her good friend. But several scenes later she finds out that everything he told her was a lie. This makes Marge question the sincerity of Jerry Lundengard when she first interviewed him, because if a sweet good-natured guy like Mikey can concoct such a lie then so could Lundengard. She finds out Mikey lied to her, the VERY NEXT SCENE she returns to the car dealership to re-interview Lundengard who realizes she may have put the pieces together, so he flees the scene. If Marge never met up with Mikey, she wouldn't have exposed Lundengard as a conspirator. This is the reason that amusing scene is so important. Got it? Good. Have a nice day.</fullReview>

But it wasn't a comedy, it was a black comedy. I think that Fargo could have won for Best Picture instead of The English Patient. Sometimes the Academy Awards can be so stupid. My favorite scene in that film is when after Carl and Gaer takes Mrs. Lundegaard to their hideout place, Mrs. Lundegaard attempts to escape and when she trips, Carl says Whoops.

		<fullReview>Someone made the comment that this movie must have been hyped to death for it to be rated so highly, that people must have been brainwashed. I have to relate my own experience. I saw this movie in March of 1996, when it was only in limited release, and there certainly had not yet been any hype, because so few people had seen it. I had gotten a gut feeling from seeing the previews that it was going to be good, mostly from the people involved and the fact that so little was given away in the trailers, which is so rare these days. I drove 50 miles to see this movie on one of the few screens showing it in the country. The theater was full, and it was obvious the vast majority was enjoying it immensely, as did I. So, sorry, the "Brainwashed" theory just doesn't apply here. That only works with movies like "Star Wars: Episode I". "Fargo" was as far from the world of hype as Minnesota is from Naboo. "Fargo"- 10 out of 10, and that's MY opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is one of the best movies of the 90's... It has a terrific cast, with wonderful performances. Frances McDormand won Best Actress, and it was well-deserved. This is one of those movies I don't get sick of after watching it a couple of times, this movie was so funny.If you haven't yet seen Fargo, then you should go out and rent it tonight. You wont regret it, this is a great movie. I gave this movie a deserving 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite movie of the 90`s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of 2 Oscars (best original sceenplay, best actress for Frances McDormand), this has to be cult film makers, The Coen Brothers (Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, Miller`s Crossing, The Big Lebowski), best film to date.Set in a snowy Fargo, North Dakota, and based on a true story which happened in 1987, its the tale of a kidnapping plot, that doesn`t go exactly to plan. Jerry Lundegaard (the brilliant William H. Macy) is losing money fast as a car salesman, his wannabe quick cash schemes catch up on him, forcing him to hire two criminals, Carl and Gaear (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, allowing him to collect the ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. The bumbling pair are forced to kill a road cop and two civillians along the way (one of those those civvies is actually that artist formerly known as Prince, check the end credits for the "symbol"), provoking a murder enquiry by Marge Gunderson, a dizzy but law abiding cop-ette (McDormand). The plot thickens, twists and turns, in the Coen`s inimitable way.My favourite film of the 90`s so far, Fargo is a black comedy "stroke" thriller, which is hard to dismiss. Its true to life story, beautiful photography (thanks to Roger Deakins), wonderful characters, melancholy music, vivid script, and the way it captures the Minnesota way of life, is pure brilliance. A complete story, a complete movie, which never needs a sequel. The language has to be noted, as its one of the key points that binds the movie perfectly, and eases the thriller instinct. "Oh you betcha!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Fargo is truly a brilliant film. It's kinda Tarantinoish, but, you know the Coen brothers doesn't do the same as others. They are geniuses in filmmaking, with entertaining films with good stories and great actors. And the acting is really one of the strong sides about this film. Steve Buscemi, in my opinion the coolest actor alive, and Peter Stormare is brilliant. Totally exceptional. Frances McDormand is a little over-rated though but does give a good performance. William H. Macy is, as always, good as the car sales-man in money trouble. The film is about Jerry Lundegaard that needs money. His wife's rich father won't give it to him so he plans a scam. He hires two criminals, to kidnap his wife, and ask for a big amount of money to give her back. then her father will have to pay and the criminals will get their share of the money Jerry his. I am not gonna tell more, so I won't ruin the film for you. Joel and Ethan Coen shows how a thriller of this sort should be done with well-developed characters, good dialogue and I have to say it even once again, BRILLIANT actors. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great example of realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Fargo in a grand, opulent, and beatifully restored 1920s movie theatre, now used for "special screening" films and the more accessible arthouse flicks. Seeing Fargo was my first time in this theatre, and I return on a semi-regular basis. I am glad to have had such a wonderful introduction, both to the theatre and to the film. In both respects, Fargo is classic cinema: worthy of being seen in the palatial grandeur of the best movie houses, and the kind of movie that is well-remembered when discovering such wonderful old places. Like the best output of the Coen Brothers, this is a remarkable character study relying on dark humor and cold realism (no pun intended) in creating a complicated and troubled scene of human emotions, troubles, and motives. Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics: each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments. The ability to capture the viewer is one attribute of a film that makes it great, and Fargo brilliantly displays that ability in the most subtle and quietly profound ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a thrilling tale of greed that makes you want to be a better person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the title, "Fargo" is insignificant, that's just the name of the town where the story begins.And it's rated R for two short sex scenes and there's also a whole lotta swearing!I rented this thinking it'd be some intense thriller with comedy in it, anyway I guess I was expecting something else because the first time I saw it I didn't think it was all that great. But then I saw it again and Zingo!!! I love it! I even bought the soundtrack.It shows how going against the law and doing bad things just doesn't work. The movie says that greed will get you to awful places. Here's this guy, Jerry, who looks like he's doing okay, only he just wants more money. So he hires two crooks, who are don't mind breaking laws for money, to do something that puts his wife at a big risk! Weird old Jerry loves his money more than his wife. Sure, his wife's father, he's real well off. But he's a jerk, and is stubborn with his money. Then everything goes horribly wrong and people start dying and/or going to jail.And then there's the Gundersons, Marge and Norm. Real simple people who aren't rich and are expecting a child and they both work (Norm has a cooshy job at the post office and also enjoys painting, and Marge is a policewoman). Norm is a great husband, bringing Marge lunch or making her breakfast.By the end of the film you realize that these two folks are happy. And they're the only main characters that come across that way (There's some benign extras, too). All the crooks and jerks aren't happy, they're either mad or panicky or breaking laws and doing bad things and beating each other.Even Marge's old friend from high school isn't happy. Now I've heard some critics say that this guy, played by Steve Park from tv's "in living color", is just a part of an annoying pointless subplot. But this is actually just character development for Marge. She cares about him and his troubles, and is real sorry to hear about how things are for him, but when she finds out he was lying to get pity, she's real surprized. "I just don't understand it""I just don't understand it" is one of the most powerful lines I've heard because how could nice ol' Margie understand all these crooked shenanegans when she knows the truth about things and about getting happiness. Happiness isn't a little money, it's finding someone you love and maybe having a family and not having to run away from the law all the time.I noticed that some of the parts with the "nice people" were kinda boring. Maybe that's to show that these people may be boring, but at least they're not going to get shot or caught by cops or have guilty consciences or anything, so that's fine.Needless to say, it's one of my favorites, and if for any reason you don't like R rated movies, just watch the TNT version--that one's just fine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers can take the simplest plot ideas and weave truly magical movies. Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and the Hudsucker Proxy manage this concept, but Fargo just falls short in some respects. However, that shouldn't detract from what is essentially an extremely well crafted character study.The real key to making this movie work is in the inspired casting. I didn't rate William Macy that much until I seen him in this movie, and he pulls off a performance that really makes you believe in his own predicament and one that should have received more recognition. While the cast are well above average, the movie is really stolen by Frances McDormand, finally bagging a deserved oscar in the process.The only real problems with this movie lie in the pacing, which at times drags the movie down a notch or two. In addition, some scenes seemed out of place and felt added in as a sideshow.Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers always make enjoyable movies, films that while some regard as slow-moving, others can manage to find a depth that is lacking from most movies these days.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One heck of a darn good movie eh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time where big Hollywood productions with incredibly banal characters and plots are dominating movie media, it is refreshing to watch a masterpiece such as Fargo. Everything about this movie is amazing, but what intrigued me the most was the dialog. I'm from a province in Canada that is located directly above North Dakota and am therefore familiar, and sometimes find myself using, the dialog style or accent that was used superbly in this film. Not only is the dialog amazing, but the performances of Bill Macey and Frances McDormand are two of the best I have ever seen. To truly appreciate the accuracy of the screenplay and performances in Fargo you should visit North Dakota or Western Canada someday. I'm sure you'll laugh if you happen to overhear the smalltalk (it's pretty darn cold eh). Besides the incredible originality and accuracy of the settings and characters, the Coen brothers create this plot that seems so out of place in this small quiet community of farmers and shop owners. And yet what makes it so intriguing is the fact that such evil and deceit could occur in such a harmless environment. I recommend that everybody see this movie and appreciate it for the many things (little and big) that it does so well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo inspires a love-it-or-hate-it response. Most on the "hate-it" side can't get past the violence or the northern accents. For me, it ranks solidly in my all-time top ten.Frances McDormand won an overdue and well-deserved Oscar for her role, but William H. Macy is at the center of this film. He plays such a dislikable, cloying worm that the image sticks with me when I see him in other films. But at the end, I still am able to sympathize with him, and truly feel sorry for his decent into the gutter. (There but for the grace of God go any of us).The plot is simple but it is the delivery that makes the movie great. Fargo takes you to a barren North Dakota winter and makes it come alive. The cinematography is amongst the best you will ever see, making interesting and captivating images out of nothing.Pay close attention to the final scene - it is pure genius. On the surface, it seems detached from the movie, but deep down, it is one of the great pieces of character development in film history. In two minutes of "non-plot-related" dialogue, you learn a great deal about the main character - who she is inside.What a great movie. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really love about this movie, as with all the Coens' movies, are the small eccentric touches. The boy in his room, fretting over his kidnapped mother, and with a poster on the wall that says "Polka Kings", and shows a lederhosen-clad accordion player (as well as the accordion and sheet music in his room). But better still are the small roles: the irate customer ("These guys! It's always more!"), Mr. Mohra ("..she says I should call it in, so I called it in. End of story."), Mike Yamagita (Steve Park from In Living Color!), etc. And of course, Frances McDormand's very pregnant police chief with a mind like Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the most appealing character I've seen in any movie.Also, I love that haunting theme music. There's so much more I could say about this movie, but it's probably already been said. Destined to be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, the film isn't bad but it is way overrated. I read Roger Ebert's review on this before I watched it and I was expecting something unworldly excellent and I was wrong. But what else can you expect from a man that didn't like Sleeping with the Enemy, The Guardian, In Dreams, and The Rage; Carrie 2. The film was pretty much a little better than okay. The acting was very mediocre and th script wasn't fabulous. There was little suspense and the characters were people that were ugly, especially that little DORK William Macy. Frances Mcdormand was amusing in some of the scenes because of the way she talked but I was quite appalled about how the police acted in some sequences were very inappropriate and quite unrealistic--trying to be funny and silly as they examine newly discovered dead bodies. The gore at the end is as much as people say and once again the comic in death tone is kept inappropriately. The foot scene was amusing and I was glad to see some the annoying being shot and demolished. The sex scene was amusing , the scene where Frances McDormand was interviewing the two didsy girls was quite funny, but overall the story wan't great. Like There's Something About Mary the story provided a few amusing moments, but that didn't make the film good-just OK. The film was never scary or suspenseful mainly because of the comedic ridiculousness of the situation and I was very glad about the stupid characters fates in this very overrated film. There are much better movies than this and I would suggest In Dreams anyday before this. A bit original yes, but deserving to be on the imdb top 200 certainly not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgo the truth for "Fargo"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mother loves documentaries and films based on true stories. My brother and I brought home "Fargo" on VHS the day it came out, and we watched the film as a family, and when the words "Based on a true story" came up, she declared, "Oh good!" My brother and I just looked at each other smiling. We knew the truth. this was fiction, but we said nothing. I say this without fear of spoiling it for two reasons. Chances are you already knew it was fictional by now, a certain advantage of commenting on the film years later. Secondly, it really doesn't matter. The film is great, any way you look at it. My mother disagrees, she feels that you shouldn't be able to say it's a true story if it's not. Nevertheless, she enjoyed the film.I support the Coen brothers in their choice to have some fun. More of that can be found if you check the credits carefully, you'll see the symbol for the artist-formerly-known-as-Prince exists as a credit for the rather heavyset driver that is pursued by Peter Stromare. An unlikely match, but amusing considering Prince is from Minnesota, just like the Coen brothers are.What is so effective about "Fargo" is that despite it's fantastic content, it never loses the air of believability. I think most people forget about the little proclamation at the film's beginning by the time ten minutes have passed. My mother is not one of those people mind you. These brothers excel at story telling, and it's done so convincingly, you don't question it for a minute.Another interesting aspect of "Fargo" is its wide appeal. I never would've guessed that this would be the breakthrough film for the Coen Brothers. The Hudsucker Proxy was a sheer delight for me, and I consider it one of my favourite films, but it essentially flopped. It is fortunate that things finally turned around for the creative team of Joel and Ethan, with the unanimous success, praise and awards for "Fargo". They have a certain independent spirit that doesn't seem easy to crush. They do things just a little differently, and that's why they stand out as not only thoughtful filmmakers, but also somewhat masters of their own destiny. Marching to the beat of their own drum. I applaud them for it, and eagerly await the next demonstration of their commitment to superlative cinema.</fullReview>

Best movies are from directors Barry Sonnefeld, Quentin Tarentino, Woody Allen, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton and Joel Coen (sorry! no Spielberg) Everything in Coen's movies is out of focus. No sun in Fargo (just real cold snow) no beautiful hero, no stupid music, no predictible scenes. Just originality and a very strange sense of humor (reminds me of Hitchcock). The hero of the movie is a woman: she's not beautiful and she's pregnant! Just think about that : a woman is the hero of an USA movie!!! She's a police officer and she don't know how to use a gun!

		<fullReview>Great depiction of how greed and ineptitude can turn a staged crime into a disastrous tragedy. Well acted and shot, full use is made of the stark, snow filled landscapes of the mid-northern states to the point of surrealism.Maybe the accents were somewhat exaggerated, but the constant use of the 'Jeezes' and 'Yahs' did give a semi-hypnotic effect I'm sure the producers were looking for. It is also very violent, something that happens all too frequently in Paul Bunyan's America. Frances McDermond was great, and deserves the Oscar she got. If I can find fault with the movie it is the scene where the 'old friend' tries to con Margie into starting a relationship. The only possible purpose for such a scene would be to give more depth to the Margie character, but it is mostly distracting. Some other story device would have been more welcome.Though hard to adjust to at first, I found the musical score to be most haunting and builds brilliantly for dramatic effect where needed.A definite 'thumbs up' from us fans whose tastes lean a little toward the bizzare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, and Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess there are two types of moviegoers: (1) those who like Steven Spielberg for his "Jurassic Park", and (2) those who like Spielberg for "Schindler's List." The first group of people would go to a movie theater wanting to shy away from the real world, and the second group of people will recognize reality in a movie if they see one. Fargo struck a cord with me (and I guess, those who nominated it for the Oscars) because it portrays reality in its true, stark, and unabridged form, which is often times as insensible as the killing of innocent passers-by, as confusing as the characterization of Stomare and Buscemi (they are both criminals but very different in their personalities), as as cold and barren as a North Dakota winter. There is no complicated plot, a lot of the events are purely circumstantial (e.g., McDormand's spotting of the Sierra prior to the final climax), and there are too many gory scenes (e.g., the woodchipper scene) and liberal use of that despised four-letter word, but ain't that how life is in reality, especially in the rural areas of the USA?I'm no critic to say whether Francis McDormand deserved an Oscar, but I can certainly say that the portrayal of her character, along with those of William Macy (think about your typical car salesman/conman), Buscemi, and Stomare were very realistic (maybe the reason for McDormand's Oscar) and reflects four different faces of human nature. Within the gripping real-life tale, there are small sprinkings of humor (e.g., when the police asked the whore at the Inn to describe what Stomare looked like, all she could say is that "he is a funny looking guy, who wasn't circumsized") - ain't that how shallow and stupid our behavior is, at times!I had two questions after seeing the movie. First, not having been to the Midwest myself, is that really the Midwestern accent (now I believe it is, after seeing some of the comments here). Second, why would McDormand's husband let her run after criminals on icy roads, knowing that she is pregnant. Maybe, there is a serious lack of good police officers in this country, which is why crime is so rampant! I will see this movie again, but I'm so impressed by the Coen Brothers that first I'll need to see "Raising Arizona."</fullReview>

Others that have enjoyed a brief stay at the top of my list have only managed to do so after three or four studied viewings. But Fargo leaped right in at the number one slot just as soon as the credits finished rolling. This is a flawless film. The dialogue is outstanding, staying just the right side of quirky colloquialism with out sounding too cornball. The performances are perfect (How William H. Macy was beaten into second place by Cuba Gooding for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar is incomprehensible!!). The scenery and cinematography are a joy to behold. And the story is one of the most inventive I've come across. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. If you haven't already seen it, GO NOW!! Hightail it to your local video store and get it immediately. Call in sick to work if you have to, but don't waste another second before seeing this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo - it was okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo had some great acting in it - Frances McDormand, William H. Macy were great, but the whole story was just so repulsive, that I cannot recommend this movie. A person gets put through a wood chipper at the end of the movie. I mean, what is the redeeming quality in that? I mean our whole purpose in life is to leave this world in a better place than it was when we were born. This movie does nothing to promote that idea at all. Sure, justice was done, but did it have to come at the expense of so mant innocent people, like the guy at the parking lot. Why was he blown away? Just for entertainment? I do not find innocent people getting wasted as entertainment. I feel the same way about this movie as I do about "Silence of the Lambs" great acting but the movie dealt with a completely repulsive subject and a completely repulsive main character. I still cannot figure out why that movie won so many Oscars. I am not a right-wing puritan by any stretch of the imagination. But, I cannot recommend either of these movies to anyone. If you want to watch a Joel/Ethan Coen movie watch Raising Arizona. It is so funny. And if you want to watch a Jonathan Demme movie watch Stop Making Sense. But I still think the best concert movie of all time is Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii. Beautiful cinematography, excellent performances. But Stop Making Sense is also an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite films. I have seen Fargo many times, and enjoy each viewing more than the last. The downfall of the flawed Jerry Lundegaard could be the subject of a modern Shakespearean tragedy, albeit one steeped in black humor and outright quirkiness. William H. Macy's character is one of the most intriguing in recent cinema, and he plays the role perfectly. He is fascinating to watch. Frances McDormand, in an Oscar-winning performance, serves as a moral center in a film laden with copious violence and duplicitous, inept characters. Just pay attention to the film's end and you'll see what I mean. I refrain from mentioning too many details, lest I rob the film of its magic, but Fargo is a superbly unique film, a brilliant, dark, and oddly charming piece of work. See it ASAP!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello, I'm Daniel Galvalizi, from Buenos Aires. I am 16 years old, and I want to give my opinion about Fargo. I think that is a great movie. The plot is one of the best plots in the '90s. I believe that Cohen brothers are very smart and talents. They did a very good movie. And the acting of Francis McDormand is excellent. She realy did deserve the Oscar. Well, i guess the all humanity has to watch Fargo, because it is pure art, 100%. Good luck! Bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers stub their toes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo," by the gifted producer/director/writer team of Joel and Ethan Coen, reminds me of one of their previous films which I enjoyed very much, "Blood Simple." Like "Blood Simple," "Fargo" is a tale of crime gone wrong. This time it's a kidnapping plan that spins horribly out of control, leading to several grisly murders. Also, like "Blood Simple," "Fargo" is a comedy. But this time, for me, the humor didn't work. "Fargo" has been described as something of a warmhearted tribute by the Coen brothers to the wonderful people of their home state, Minnesota. No it's not. It's a nefarious assault on decent people whose main offense against humanity, apparently, is that they are friendly and trusting. And they talk funny. I happened to see this film in Washington, D.C., where others in the audience repeatedly guffawed in superior tones at what were supposed to be silly rubes on screen. Several audience members seemed to consider it their personal duty to laugh loudly and pointedly in sophisticated derision at decent, open and honest Minnesotans. And the way they talk. Maybe having grown up in the southern United States makes me particularly sensitive to accent bigotry. I dunno. But I liked the good people in this film, and it annoyed me that the Coen brothers portrayed them with contempt. Warmhearted contempt is still contempt. You've been away from home too long, guys. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is one of those films that becomes an instant classic. Pulp Fiction is the only other one that really hits the mind as another recent film to become so famous. The truth is if you don't like it then you just totally missed the point. There is a lot of humor involved in it that you probably won't laugh at until around the 3rd or 4th time you see it, not to mention how often you'll quote it after that. Fargo is simply an original masterpiece and for those of you who actually insult little things about it... o.k. that proves how incredibly stupid you are and unless you can whip out a film degree I think it's best to just shut the hell up, this is a very entertaining movie that is nearly flawless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a long time I was reluctant to see this film until I learned that it was a parody; at that point, knowing something of the story line, I happily went along. The film gives us a good look at Steve Buscemi, but Frances McDormand simply IS the movie. Without this sweet, soft-spoken and quite pregnant protagonist with an accent all too germane for that part of the US (and well done, too !), this story would go nowhere in a hurry. She is to this film what Gloria Stuart is to ''Titanic''. It took a lot to win-out over the heavy-duty competition in ''Secrets &amp; Lies'', but McDormand took home the Oscar (''Best Actress''). Now, can she repeat it sometime? Buscemi has gone on to give us some super performances since. Enjoy it while NOT taking the film too seriously (rating = 4 stars of 5).</fullReview>

There's a strong morality message interwoven into the tale. But, it's not biting your head off, it is subtle, abstract perhaps? It is beautiful &gt; Dark, Hilarious, Absurd, Gorey, Warm.

This is the film I aspire to someday become fused within, to live with Marge and Norm "Son of a Gun"derson, or the Lundegaards. This is the movie that made me think of movies as a higher art. THE higher art, I should say. There is never a dull moment in this film, and if you watch it with someone who likes to make talkie during the silences, please kick them in the head, every milli-second of silence is vital. This quiet, every milli-second, is crafted to perfection, and is worth any line of dialogue. Although I must say, the dialogue ain't bad.

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly, I think Fargo deserves a lot more praise than it has been given, and should have easily taken out the Best Picture at the Oscars given the competition. This is by far the best film made by the Coen brothers, and is visually very pleasant to watch, with the sharpest, funniest dialogue ever. This is the type of movie that gets better every time you watch, and the people who dislike it simply aren't witty enough to understand the deadpan humour. The length is perfect, and the cast is flawless. Buscemi and Stormare are the best on-screen duo I can recall, and if you think about it, the stupidity of many of the characters simply add to the realism. This is one of my favourite movies, and because it is so off-beat and original, it certainly deserves to be one of the top 100 movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Blood Simple introduced the combination of mood and noir karma from above, the key was in making the first long, the second precise.Arizona went two steps further, supplying the multitudinous desiring mind that makes reality bubble up, Ozzie and Harriet through HI's mind.Miller's tried to do both the karmic noir while toying with 'the world of the mind' in the forest. They made Barton Fink that film about the mind instead, in a most obvious way by that point, rooms mapping to mind, wallpaper coming unglued.So by the time the Coens made this, there was already a clear blueprint of inclinations. Once more a film noir about a schmuck whose desire makes the skies cave in on him. Once more about the life of the mind, the mind dictating egoistic desire and greed, less obvious than Barton. Along the way we get quirky staples, dry gaffe, guns, blood, a satchel of money, to offset the frigid pace in the broad audience's mind.But although Macy's desire makes all sorts of accident and chaotic whimsy bubble up in the world, a softly maintained order straight from Frances' calm Minnesotan mind prevails. The film offers in fact a perfectly centered metaphor of the Coens at work and their larger blueprint. It's a cold world out there, with broken people and human ego and desire creating inane anxieties, but it hasn't numbed the heroine's soul who calmly goes through a narrative, piecing it together, to save a mirrored wife from danger and restore order in the world of the film.It's fine work to see on your first rounds. Methodical, exact, clean, some of the cleanest work you'll see anywhere. But clean logic comes with a tradeoff in unfettered intuition that can slip ahead of you into places you didn't know or can't explain. It takes a parting of this logic to give me the great stuff that go beyond ideas; Lynch's whole career has been a creative journey of this. I miss this here. Still, the entry points are there to see and imagine from. The kidnapping plot as a thought that wafts from his mind before he could keep hold of it, herself woken up in the middle of the night by nightmare.The Coens must have been aware of this fettering. They would drop a bomb on the logical mind with their next one.Noir Meter: 3/4 | Neo-noir or post noir? Neo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This my favorite, and the best Coen film of all time. Even though it's a fairly simplistic story, it has comedic elements of all sorts. Frances McDormand as a pregnant Minnesota cop investigates homicides that are connected to a family man hiring hit-man to kidnap his wife to collect the ransom money from his rich father-in-law.The story is told fairly straightforward, with extremely funny jabs at Minnesota culture, particularly on their accents. The funniest is the jabs at Steve Buschemi being described as nothing but funny looking, really goes to show how the Coens feel. William H. Macy as the husband of the kidnapped woman is a nervous mess in every scene he's in, going out of his way to cover up anything that goes wrong. Steve Buschemi is an absolute riot every time he's on screen, being a bumbling screw up in almost everything he does.This is the best Coen film because it is not only a comedy, but it's a comedy of different varieties. If you tried to explain why these scenes are funny, you couldn't because they're that clever. Very recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a good movie with a specific style but it will undoubtedly leave a few viewers disappointed. There are principally 3 faults with the movie, all 3 of which are story related:1. Fargo opens with the following text: " THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."This is a lie. Definitely in the way this sentence comes over, this is a lie. It becomes evident as you watch the events unfold that they are not a realistic retelling of any specific crime story. The text comes right at the beginning and, as such, sticks in your memory. The directors knowingly put this into the movie and it feels insulting.2. Unresolved plot lines. The main plot is that a guy is conducting several different kinds of illicit activities because he desperately and urgently needs a lot of money. It is never explained why. Sorry, but letting the viewer out of the most important question in the story is both cruel and unprofessional. There is also another more minor point that never gets resolved though the resolution is hinted at.3. The general lack of impact. Despite some fairly violent events occurring, this movie feels very low key and rather slow. It is part of its style and seems to have purpose, but you must be aware that this movie takes its time and for some that time may not amount to that much in the end, especially considering points 1 and 2. When the film ended, it felt more like I just saw an episode of a show rather than an entire movie.Despite these flaws, the story is interesting. It was fun to see the continuously worsening situation of the criminals and the calm and appealing investigation by the protagonist.The movie has a particular style in both the visual presentation and story. The events take place in the winter in the north of the US and the outside is a world of desaturated cold white. It is starkly contrasted by the warm cozy lives of the common people inside the warm houses, with the warm food and the warm friendly feelings. This is also contrasted with the cold dealings of the criminals and their world of misery.At first it feels at first like the world of those criminals is full of intrigue while the life of the main protagonist Marge is mundane and small, but as the movie progresses, the proceedings of the criminals become full of misery and very petty in comparison with the apparently small lives of others. Fargo feels at times warm and cuddly, other times cold and disturbing.Fargo has a unique soundtrack. It is built on a slow tune of strings, a lot of it in medium to lower register, with slow and deep base drum beats in the background and some high pitch percussion. It has a folksy and meditative feel to it. When some sort of action happens, the music either goes quiet or continues with a grave tension but never becomes fast. It sounds quite different from your average movie soundtrack.The performances are great, all of them. William H. Macy plays the desperate car salesman and this guy makes his character looks so skittish, with his nervous smile and the shaking head and the stuttering. He does a near flawless job. Frances McDormand, as the protagonist policewoman received the many nominations for her performance. She has previously played a mom and the role of a homely family woman suits her well and she does indeed deliver a very pleasant humorous performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are the criminals, as is often the case and they are fun too. Peter is a guy who is just naturally extremely unnerving. In this movie he does not talk much or move his facial features. His lifeless expression and composure are just naturally terrifying and the scary impression he gives gets completely justified when he suddenly does something really violent.There is a small complaint about the dialogue. While it is generally entertaining , there seems to be a strange mockery going on as the characters keep saying "ya" a lot, which is "yeah" spoken in the northern accent. I cannot figure out if this is supposed to be joke or just poking fun at the Northerners, but it does get annoying after a while.Fargo feels different than your average film. It is a bit slow but it is a sweet coherent and interesting movie. This movie makes you feel warm inside, despite its violent content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film By The Brothers Coen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.The Coen Brothers truly outdid themselves with "Fargo". Sure they've scored big with other projects like "Raising Arizona", "Barton Fink" and Blood Simple", but "Fargo" is and always will be the film that really stood the test of time as one of the more successful films that the Coen Brothers ever produced. Next to "Pulp Fiction", "Fargo" is one of the best modern day noir film with the Coen formula of tragedy mixed with high prolific humour and violence that will make anyone's blood curdle."Fargo" is one of those obscure movies that has no real negative sayings about it. Based on actual events that occurred in Noth Dakota/Minnesota in 1987, the movie tells the tale about a financially unstable car dealer named Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) as he cooks up a plot to have his wife Jen (Kristin Rudrud) kidnapped. So he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormere) who are kind of short on brains and seem to mess things up all the time. This leads to the local Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) to seek justice on this whole predicament.What makes this film really special compared to other Coen Brothers films is that the script provides a very diabolical dark humour and the dialogue is near perfect thank mainly to the leading performers William H. Macy and the very funny but effective Frances McDormand. The Coens who were from Minneapolis deliberately made the actors utilize these distinct accents and lingo to get the effect of living in the Minnesota, North Dakota area. It may look and sound over the top and maybe annoying at times to some, but believe me that is how the spoke. It is in no way shape or form a cliché.The camera angles truly exhibits artistic integrity like the Coens intend in all their movies and no scene or camera angle is wasted. They even succeed in making more mundane scenes equally engaging to watch. And sure the comedy here is the blackest of all black comedies, there are some lighter elements to it. sort of like what they did in "Blood Simple" and this was proved very effective.The only thing I have to say is go see the movie and bring a buddy or two or more and have a great time watching it. Don't let the generic title fool as not many scenes are set in Fargo, North Dakota. But just by watching the movie I guarantee too you may want to bring a thermos with a hot beverage because this movie will in more ways than one chill you to the bone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Cohen film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of my favorites in my collection. The Cohen brothers always make good movies but this one in my eye definitely takes the cake. The script is gold, so very believable and hilarious. Every single actor in this movie played their parts so well I think H. Macy really did a great job as well as Buscemi.This movie is about a man who needs money so he tries to scam his rich father in law to pay a ransom to two men he hired to kidnapp his wife. The kidnappers hit the road as Jerry is put under more and more pressure.This movie is not only my favorite Cohen films it is in my top ten. Everything about this movie is as close to perfection as you get if you haven't seen this movie go watch it right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bleak thriller with some dark laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the bleak snow covered country side of the American Midwest car dealer Jerry Lundegaard has hit upon a scam to fun a business venture; he pays a couple of crooks, Carl and Gaear, to kidnap his wife; then when her wealthy father pays the ransom they will divide it between them; he also provides them with a new car. The kidnap goes ahead as planned but as the kidnappers drive through Brainerd they are pulled over by a state trooper; Carl tries to talk his way out of the ticket but Gaear pulls out a gun and kills to policeman; then when Carl is disposing of the body Gaear gives chase to a car that drives past the scene and shoots its too occupants. Local police chief, the heavily pregnant Marge Gunderson is called out and sets about investigating the brutal triple murder. It isn't long before Jerry's plan starts to unwind; the kidnappers start demanding all the ransom, Jerry's father in law insists that he will deliver the money and Marge starts quizzing him about the criminal's car.This Cohen brothers' film is a great thriller with a great cast including Frances McDormand, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi as Marge, Jerry and Carl. There are some laughs to be had and these serve to make the violent moments all the more shocking. The bleakness of the crime is brilliantly mirrored by the bleakness of the landscape; flat, snow covered and so overcast they the horizon in frequently invisible... it makes one cold just to look at it! The characters are interesting; Jerry is basically a loser, Carl is somewhat overcome by the events and gets more violent as things spiral out of control, Gaear hardly says a word but acts as though the events are the sort of thing that happen every day and I don't recall seeing a film where the leading investigator was a pregnant woman! This is definitely not a film for younger viewers but I heartily recommend it to any adult looking for a great drama that is a little different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If anything can go wrong, it will...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a movie that depicts the Murphy's Law in total "If anything can go wrong, it will..." Well in this movie it all went wrong.The movie states this is a true story, but that can be argued since the movie itself is completely fictional. The Coen brothers claim that many of the events that took place in the movie were actually based on true events from other cases that they threw together to make one story.The movie's radical turn of events is something that will catch the interest of any audience, as things just don't go as they should for anybody. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. The movie plots have Frances McDormand starring as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief with a sharp and smart mind, who begins piecing together a case where a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper.As Marge continues to put it all together, more people seem to be involved in the case than there should.On the other side of the events we have Jerry (William H. Macy) who has had his wife kidnapped so he can get the ransom money but everything just goes wrong.Kudos to the Coen brothers for a nice screenplay as everything that seems to happen on each shot complements the next, the characters are well depicted and the acting is a strong A+. The movie did have its faults, there were scenes that were totally unnecessary and a lot of people may complement the accents but I found it meaningless.Editing was top notch, directing to me was not so bad but won't award it. The story too had its lapse it took too long to pick up.Coen brothers are no stranger to the Academy awards, their 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? Was also nominated (no wins), their 2007 movie No Country for Old Men won 4 Academy awards and their 2010 movie True Grit had 10 nominations (no wins).Fargo is a drama, if you are not a huge fan of dramas this could bore you, but if you don't mind, you will find it interesting to watch.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazingly Awkward Film!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this for the 1st time, and it was surprisingly good. I actually enjoyed it. I know it's supposed to be a thriller/drama, because it had some brutal scenes, but I couldn't help but laugh at a few scenes because of their accents and overuse of the line 'oh yeah' There were some pretty random scenes, but that's what makes it a good movie. I loved Frances McDormand's performance as Marge Olmstead. She was my favorite character. Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud was very creepy. Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota and hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, due to financial problems. When things go wrong, people turn up dead, and pregnant Chief Marge Olmstead is on the case. I would definitely recommend FARGO!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There's more to life than a little money."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical car shows up in a world of snow. That is how one of the best-written movies of the last 20 years opens. The movie that earned the first Oscar to Coen brothers and made F. McDormand into an international star. Besides, S. Buscemi and P. Stormare performances should not be forgotten either. Fargo is a story about pathetic man's pathetic plan to gain some money. It is set in Minnesota in the middle of the winter. Coen brothers are not afraid to play with genres so it is hard to tell if Fargo is a dark comedy, crime drama or something else. The movie begins in a typical bar where from the dialog between pitiful Jerry Lundergaard (W. H. Macy) and two criminals (S. Buscemi and P. Stormare) we are given the context of the story. Jerry tells that he wants to get his wife kidnapped so that he could get some ransom money from his father-in-law (H. Presnell). The deal is set and the story sets off. As usual, in Coens movies, nothing goes according to the plan of characters and the story falls into absurdity. Firstly, kidnapping ends with a three cold-blooded murders and the start of murders investigation. This is there Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) gets into a picture. She guesses everything right from the start and shines among other foolish characters ("I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou"). From this moment, the story splits into three parts ? investigation by Marge, pathetic Jerry's attempts to fix everything and hilarious relations between criminals. These parts come to one only at the very end of the movie that is both funny and thoughtful at the same time. One of the most significant things that made Fargo successful is the character of Jerry Lundergaard. Jerry probably is the most pathetic man in the whole movie. He is wrong in every possible way and it seems that he cares about nothing but himself (he even forgets how this kidnapping scheme will effect his son). Firstly, he works in his father-in-law's car dealership and is a lousy salesperson who sells cars by telling lies to customers and family life is no better ? it seems that the true head of the family is his father-in-law. When he gets himself in some financial problems Jerry is so afraid of telling it to his father-in-law that he is prepared to steel money rather than ask for it. In addition, he even practices his speech before telling his father-in-law about the kidnapping. As the story goes further, criminals, Marge and father-in-law press Jerry more and more until he brakes down. However, there is one scene in the movie when we can see some humanity from Jerry. It is the scene there Carl Showalter (S. Buscemi) threatens to kill not only his wife but his son as well. Jerry impulsively tells to leave his son away from this and he seems to be very serious about it. Another thing to mention is a hilarious screen couple of S. Buscemi and P. Stormare. They are total opposites of one another. Carl is an annoying "talky" type hothead who does nothing right while Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) is a cold-blooded professional who prefers to act rather than speak. Carl seems to irritate Gaear in every possible way from blabbering about the silence of Gaear ("Two can play at that game, smart guy") to an inability to deal with unexpected difficulties ("I'll take care of this"). It is hard to imagine how these two characters became associates. To sum up, Fargo is a well-written and well-acted story about very interesting and complex humans that makes you laugh and cry at the same time and in the end, we are left with a conclusion said by Marge ? "There's more to life than a little money." These words perfectly sum up the entire movie themes and help to characterize characters by dividing them in to those who do and those who do not agree with Marge's words. 2011-05-19</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I just didn't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will acknowledge that Fargo is, technically at least, a fantastic film. The Coen brothers always deliver fantastically written, directed and shot pieces of cinema, but I just didn't enjoy this one very much. I think it maybe to do with the setting - I know nothing about, nor care for Dakota or its significance. Also the characters - they were mostly appealing, but I just couldn't get in to any of them. There's some wonderful black humour on display here, some suspense, and good characterisation. However I just feel as if I've seen all of this done better elsewhere in individual instances, and I certainly wouldn't compare this to No Country For Old Men, which I watched recently. If I want humour, I'll watch a comedy, if I want suspense I'll watch a thriller and if I want good writing I'll watch Oscar nominees. Though, to me, Fargo seems to be a diluted collaboration of elements that I've seen done better in their specific environment.All in all, I suppose I'd compare my viewing experience to one of someone who is told the twist before they've seen the film - one of the major aspects of enjoyment is ruined from the beginning, and I just really didn't like the setting or characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly conceived and (joke) executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline of this dark comedy drama has been gone over many times in other reviews so I won't labour on about it.Suffice it to say that the overwhelming feeling of biting cold creeping into every part of the characters' bodies is brilliantly expressed. The multiple killings are leavened with a homely - Minnesotan - humour that somehow brings the whole movie together in a way that is typically Coen Bros.The actors worked with dialect tutors to perfect the Minnesota accent to such effect that some of the dialogue is quite difficult to follow yet, strangely, this doesn't matter. The laconic way of talking interacts with the stark landscapes and reinforces the coldness which is so much an integral part of the movie.The acting is almost consistently excellent: my one reservation is William H Macy's portrayal of the lead (anti)hero which to me just slightly off the mark in one or two scenes: I couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way and it isn't a real criticism of the movie as a whole.Bottom line: first class, a movie to watch again and again (As I have!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fargo' is an amazing film. The Coen Brothers once again prove, that they are indeed Boon to Cinema! How lovely to think of, the film begins claiming that it's a true story. But once you begin to read about this super-hit, you come to know that it's fictitious. The Coens give a wonderful answer to their lie, that you itself believe, yep this is my next-door story, of at least that they think about such stuff. 'Fargo' is marvelous dark-comedy crime film, that leaves you awe-struck with it's charm.McDormand plays a pregnant police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals. A grim, violent and rather disturbing subject comes up more as a Revelation, rather than being a depression watch.The Coens at their fiery best. Their Screenplay was complimented with an Academy-Award. Their direction, yes, this was a collaborate effort, comes flawless. Roger Deakins's Cinematography is superb.In the acting department, McDormand is mind-blowing in a role that won her numerous award. She lives her character from start to end. William H. Macy is like never before. The actor is terrific, and nearly steals the show. Peter Stormare is fantastic. Steve Buscemi goes completely over-the-top, he doesn't impress in here. John Carroll Lynch is perfect.On the whole, 'Fargo' is one of those films, where you feel proud to be a Cinema-Fan. It's one of the greatest films of it's time, or maybe, of all-times. A Modern-Era Masterpiece All The Way!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo is both an absurdist comedy and a stylized crime drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a strikingly mature, unique entertainment that plays on many levels... all satisfying. A cash-strapped Minnesota car salesman (William H. Macy) pays two bungling crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife in order to demand a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. But his scheme goes disastrously wrong.The film is an off-centre masterpiece with Frances McDormand in luminous form as a decent, heavily pregnant police chief whose slow, discursive style of speech disguises the sharpness of her brain. This may be the Coens' most satisfying film: a mixture of droll humour, gory murder, quick wit and bumbling stupidity. The snowy wastes make a striking visual counterpoint for the madcap action and jolting violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frances McDormand stars in her Oscar winning role as Marge, a pregnant cop, in the 1996 classic Fargo. Now Joel and Ethan Cohen have done some great films. But of those great films, Fargo is definitely the best. It's the most interesting. All of their films are interesting. They also have humor to them too. Fargo is at times funny, very suspenseful, and very entertaining. I don't know what won best picture in 1996, but I think Fargo deserved it.The film is based on a true story, as it states in the beginning. Except the character's names are changed.The movie takes place in Minnesota. The film is about a business man(played by the always excellent William H. Macy)who teams up with two criminals(played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. He hires these guys to kidnap his wife. In a scam to get money obviously. So Macy's character acts like he is negotiating with these criminals. On their trail is a pregnant cop named Marge(played by the always excellent Frances Mcdormand). Mcdormand does a fantastic job as Marge. So does everyone else in the film. Really, everyone in the film is great. I enjoy films that take place in Minnesota. Such as Grumpy old men, and New in Town. I like snow I guess that's what it is. Fargo is at times disturbing too. Steve Buscemi is very creepy as usual. The performances are top notch as I have said many times, the film is brilliantly shot, the plot is very interesting, I could go on forever. I loved this movie.Fargo: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better and more underrated films of the 90's. An interesting and thrilling crime caper that's holds your interest and it all turns out for the best in the end!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is clearly one of the better films of the 90's probably one of 1996's best. As always I learned with each film I've watched from the Coen brothers even though most of their plots are a little offbeat they still entertain and hold interest. As evidenced from watching this film it proves even ordinary people anywhere can finds themselves caught up in crazy things that involve unexpected twist and turns yet somehow it all solves it's self in the end.Set in the great northern united states mostly taking place in a small Minnesota town it involves William H. Macy as a desperate car salesman who wants money. And he will do anything even if it means arranging a crazy scheme to have his wife kidnapped so he could get ransom money from her well to do father. And that's just what he does when he contacts two stone cold thugs(one who's played brilliant by Steve Buscemi who enjoys having sex with truck stop prostitutes and escorts on the side!) from Fargo, North Dakota to travel to Minnesota to kidnap his wife. As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.Overall "Fargo" is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films. And the performances and chemistry of the cast is super it just proves ordinary people can find themselves twisted up in crazy things only to all have back to normal in the end. Really a unique film that's memorable and very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superbly done Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Minnesotan I love to watch films made here or about Minnesota; films like: "Purple Rain", "Grumpy Old Men", "Grumpier Old Men", "Untamed Heart", "North Country", "Prairie Home Companion", "The Heartbreak Kid" and others. "Fargo", however, is my favorite Minnesota film. It's a typical Coen Brothers film and by far their best! Yeah, they make fun of our politeness and our Scandinavian-German accents. As kids we are taught at home and in school, as well as on the job to always say Please and Thank You, hold open doors for others, wait your turn, don't speak loudly or yell and we rarely use the word Yes, for us it's Ya. Some people were embarrassed by this but most of us are proud of our politeness and our Nordic roots. It's known as "Minnesota Nice." So, as for "Fargo", most of us loved it. None of us talk like the Officer who says, "I'm gonna have ta ask ya ta git outta da curr." That said, most of the characters are spot on. Roger Deakins shows the bleakness of a prairie winter, but also its beauty. Carter Burwell's score has a tinge of Scandinavian folk to it. The Coens make fun of us but we don't mind because they've created a masterpiece in "Fargo". The cast is superb: Frances McDormand and John Carroll Lynch as Norm &amp; Marge Gunderson are the heart of the film. Steve Buscemi as Carl Showalter, Peter Stormare as Gaear Grimsrud and William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard are a fine trio of bad guys. Kristin Rudrud as Jean Lundegaard, Harve Presnell as Wade Gustafson and Bruce Bohne as Marge's partner Lou are terrific. My favorite character of the cast has a small part but plays it brilliantly and is in my favorite scene. He is Bain Boehlke and he plays Mr. Mohra who is the guy shoveling his driveway and who is describing Carl Showalter as a "funny looking guy". I love that scene it really makes me laugh. In spite of its gore, the screenplay of "Fargo" is incredibly fascinating and very entertaining from beginning to end. Bravo Joel and Ethan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers Triumph Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ingenious Coen brothers return triumphantly with this amazing tale of kidnapping gone horribly wrong. I say ingenious because the brothers Coen brought us that gangster masterpiece, "Miller's Crossing". And I say amazing simply due to the fact that the tale told in "Fargo" is based upon actual events that took place in Minnesota.The brothers' odd way of looking at life is reflected in the screenplay from the pair and Joel's comic, slightly off-centre approach to what is essentially a horrifying story of a man's fatally destined plot to get together enough money to support a wild business venture. In the hands of the Coen brothers though it comes across almost like a satire, in which the audience will find themselves constantly laughing - when their mouths are not agape.Editor Roderick Jaynes has done a fine job keeping the story punchy and pepped up, Roger Deakins' cinematography is eye catching and contains some snow scenes you may not quickly forget and Carter Burwell's distinct score adds real flavour to proceedings, though it's not as good as his sweeping, poetic music from "Miller's Crossing". It is the cast that are the real strength here however.Frances McDormand gobbles up the lead role as Marge Gunderson, the local cop who seems to stumble on clue after clue to the disappearance of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) while always maintaining a most infectious demeanour. Even more impressive is William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the weak-kneed husband whose crazy plan backfires more than an old bus and whose silly smile and pathetic machinations dig him deeper and deeper into oblivion. Steve Buscemi is very enjoyable as the weaselly, "funny lookin'" Carl who goes form Mr. Smooth to Mr. Insane as the deal goes from bad to worse to completely nuts. Finally, as Gaear, the menacing, quiet partner, Peter Stormare has us quite convinced he is one guy you wouldn't want to cross. Also stars Harve Presnell and John Carroll Lynch.Monday, February 17, 1997 - Hoyts CroydonThe genius of the brothers Coen shines again in this manipulative, surprising thriller/comedy/tragedy whose many shallow characters give it much depth.Brilliant perfs from McDormand and support bring to life this quirky collection of people, many of whom totally lose the plot when it comes to kidnapping and large amounts of the green. Cinematography in America's white-washed North is fantastic as is Carter Burwell's apt score.The Coen brothers may well be the screenplay kings of the 90's.Sunday, November 23, 1997 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kidnapping going bad : Coen style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coen brothers are known to be one of the most original film making duo working in Hollywood.A lot of adjectives can be used to describe their films and the great thing is that no two films made by them are same. Fargo is a great film as it doesn't hover around neither Hollywood type conventional narrative structure nor sometimes hard to fathom independent cinema style.It is a film in which mystery elements are revealed following a chronological order.Coen brothers have taken proper care of the screenplay as they have added their own material to a real life event which took place years ago.It is not at all a film about mistakes made while killing people. It is a film about human sentiments such as greed,helplessness and dedication to work.All those who like films with story are going to enjoy it.There are no special effects,animation and other high tech elements.What is to be seen in the film is pure emotional poetry-a poetry of human sentiments.The cast is outstanding especially Frances McDormand who makes a good try at being a workaholic pregnant policewoman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvelous a 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Fargo when I was 13 back in 1997. Taking into account my age, watching it could not have been the smartest thing to do. Anyways I've seen it multiple times in the past 10 years. Last night I saw it again and I remembered why I think this a marvelous masterpiece. It is probably one of the best movies of the nineties (and probably one of the best of all time). While I was viewing it, I started to (re) notice what great acting. Macy's character is just a poor scumbag, a loser, a desperate (very stupid) man. He's a failure and Macy's portrays this with brilliance. Frances McDormand's accent will be stuck with me forever, she's just inspirational. Her performance of a Small town police chief is just amazing. The way she moves and talks, her pregnancy that somehow makes you think she's vulnerable, but turns out to be a very intelligent strong woman.We saw a beautiful character, one of those characters that will defeat time (like Vito Corleone, Guido from 8 1/2 or Death form the Seventh Seal, among others of course). The two stupid and completely caricaturesc "hit-men". Buscemi and Stormare are on of those "odd-couples" that entertain even when they're killing almost for fun. As an example when they get to the cabin and Lundeergard's wife tries to flee blindfolded, Buscemis laughter is so sarcastic with Stormare's stare looking as she falls down. It's a magnificent scene of two criminals with no humanity, no respect, real bastards, and we laugh as they do. Those long scene of snow and snow and snow. We literally get immersed in this nothingness, the same nothingness that everyone has in it'soul and mind in the film, exception would be Marge's marriage. Before To begin closing this commentary, I've always liked the music, I think it's also brilliant. So depressive, so tragic, a great enhancer for every scene. The Cohen brothers created a masterpiece and they (alongside the actors) are to blame. Beautiful photography, great directing and a script that contains amazing dialogue makes this movie perfect. That dark humor of the Cohen brothers, gives you a relief as you see people that are decadent and selfish (but most certainly stupid like the 2 criminals or Lundeergard) create schemes and plans to get money, as if money was what you need the most in life. Marge has everything this sick people want, she has a life, a persona, she is intelligent, deductive, full of love for her husband and a baby. To connect this 2 last paragraphs, at the end Marge states (while driving Stormare): "for what? (talking about all the dead people) For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it." That last line could've been said by Garcia Marquez or Shakespeare. She says "and it's a beautiful day" while all we see is snow, and a lonely depressive background, "I just don't understand" she says next. Of course she can't, she can see beauty on a depressive scenery and she has the humanity everyone else lacks off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prairie Home Companion Goes Feral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a combination of Prairie Home Companion, In Cold Blood, Abbott and Costello, and The Great Gatsby.Jerry, through an ex-con (Shep) in his auto dealer's shop, hires two losers he doesn't know to kidnap his emotionally stunted wife to secure a ransom out his wealthy, domineering father-in-law, purportedly to relieve Jerry of some ambiguous financial difficulties, which we have no difficulty believing that Jerry has brought upon himself through his own stupidity and neurotic venality. He thus sets in motion two losers, who buy into the scheme, much as a Florida retiree buys into some new aluminum siding. When Jerry hires the losers, it's invincible stupidity meets invincible stupidity, but the losers live in a native world of casual violence, casual sex, and casual death, a world unfamiliar to Jerry, who lives trapped in his closed make-believe world of suburban Minnesota chirpiness, Lutheran uprightness, and nuclear family happiness.Once Jerry unleashes his stupid plot, he squirms and wriggles as the losers bungle and bully their way into Minneapolis, kidnap his wife, and attempt to collect the ransom. When they're finished, 7 people have died violently, a million dollars has changed hands, 3 hookers have been banged, countless beers consumed, and Jerry ends up in cuffs on a bed in a dingy motel outside Bismark, North Dakota. The sheer incompetence and casual violence of Jerry's henchman attract the law, in the person of the irrepressible Marge ("You betcha!"), who is led inevitably to Jerry's auto dealer office to ask about a certain "tan Cierra" with dealer plates, used by the killers to traverse the great Northern Tundra of winter-time Minnesota to find bars, screw truckstop hookers in cheap motels, kidnap suburban housewives, and extort a million from upper Midwest Masters of the Universe like Jerry's father-in-law. You're darn tootin'! With the exception of Marge, and her univocal husband Norm (who paints duck stamps), none of the characters comes off well. Their overriding characteristic is their overpowering banality and stupidity, relieved in the end solely by mindless, undirected violence. The pathological interaction between the two kidnappers reminds one of In Cold Blood, although these kidnappers are not explored in any depth, their pathologies nonetheless on full display to the modest, introverted personalities of northern Minnesota. Their mere presence attracts interest, and, finally the law. Ya know?The Cohen's brilliance lies in the conception of intersecting Jerry's eminently phony life and character and his petty, overblown and self-absorbed middle class problems, with the casual violence and nihilism of the kidnappers, who although they are perfectly willing to work a deal for American cash have business methods of their own, methods that Jerry doesn't want but to which in the end Jerry casually acquiesces. When Jerry places the frozen body of his now dead father-in-law into the trunk of his car, and then drives into his suburban garage, Jerry's character is writ large. The contrast between the smarmy Prairie Home Companion accents, households, restaurants, and manners of Jerry's world and the brutal, unashamed profanity of the kidnappers -- and their inevitable merger in the character of Jerry -- keeps the plot moving to its dullish, inevitable end.Because no character is great in this movie, there is no tragedy. Its characters are actually embodied emptiness, whether its the slimy Jerry, his stunted wife, the emotionally sadistic father-in-law, the nihilistic kidnappers, Marge's empty-headed police partner, Marge's old high school buddy, or the air-headed truckstop hookers. There is in fact no morality or transcendence anywhere in this movie, except perhaps in the final triumph of Marge's dogged goodness and simple intelligence. The only great characters in the movie are the painters, the Hautmans, against whom Norm competes in the duck stamp competition, but who never appear. Neither does their work. True greatness has no place in this world; it can only be talked about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most cleverly written, subtlety made and acted comedies of all time. A modern masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, "Fargo" is a very simple movie. It has a simple script and dull 'normal' characters. However due to the way the story is written en acted out by its actors, the movie becomes an absolute masterpiece and the power of the movie is in its 'normal' every day characters who are all in one way or another quite idiotic. The movie however doesn't force anything and all of the characters in the movie are portrayed as normal every day persons. Yes, all of the characters have their shortages but in a way, haven't we all? It makes the characters extremely realistic and it makes their actions all somewhat understandable, so we can easily relate to all of them.Even though the story itself might be quite simple, it's still an enjoyable and well written one. It has some good turns and unexpected events. But it really is the subtlety of the story that makes it truly so brilliant. Nothing in the movie feels forced or over-the-top, despite the fact that the events in the movie come across as idiotic and unlikely in some cases.It's not a comedy that really tries to be funny. It's more of a dark-comedy that through its subtle made sequences becomes really funny at times. I mean the kidnap sequence has got to be one of the most subtlety comical sequences ever made, when the kidnappers walk up on the porch, peek through the window but don't see anybody sitting while the victim, who is watching a lame TV-show, on the other hand clearly can. Or when the foot with a white sock is still sticking out of the wood chipper. Or the moment when father and son have a serious talk and afterward when the father closes the door, a poster of the accordion king is shown. It's extremely dry made and it are subtlety directed and acted sequences like these that make "Fargo" such a great piece of comedy and without doubt one of the best movies of the '90's, if not of all time. Every moment in the movie is build up extremely well and even though the movie is slow, it never becomes dull because of the great build up. The biggest joke of the movie is the fact, that despite the claim on the beginning of the movie, this movie is not based on a true story at all. I don't know why but I find this an absolutely brilliant touch from the Coen brothers. Like I said before, all of the characters are in one way or another quite idiotic and losers and they all have their certain shortages, which makes them all very humane and easy to relate with at the same time. The characters certainly are one of the reasons why this movie is so incredibly enjoyable to watch. The accents are crazy and all of the characters are perfectly portrayed by its actors. Frances McDormand even received an Oscar for her role. The movie itself was nominated for a total of 7 Oscars, including Best Picture but it only took home 2, for McDormand and the script written by the Coen brothers. Other notable great actors in the movie are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the almost amateur like kidnappers, William H. Macy as the weak person who hired them to kidnap his wife and Harve Presnell as the tough father-in-law.The depressing and boring white background of the town of Fargo and its environment works perfect for the slow and odd story. It even makes the characters somewhat more understandable. I mean, can you just imaging a normal person living in Fargo? The cinematography by Roger Deakins and the musical score by Carter Burwell all add to this fantastic movie atmosphere of "Fargo".Wonderful directed, build up and timed, with great performances from all its actors. One of the most original and brilliant (dark)comedies ever created. An essential must-see, despite the fact that perhaps not everyone will 'understand' and appreciate this movie its subtlety.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started off really well, but then turned into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went over to my sister's the other night, her and I have the same love and passion for movies. She asked me what genre I wanted to watch and I quote "romance, action, horror, happy, gore..." and I was like "Gore!". It was a Saturday night, it had to be some kind of a scary movie to have a little fun. I had heard a lot about this movie, my sister kept praising it, and a lot of IMDb fans as I can see from the #101 rating on the top 250 love it as well."Fargo" is a great film. The acting is phenomenal, the story, even though my sister said it really isn't true, is disturbing, and the whole movie is just a good one to watch. I want to talk about what the movie is about, but I'm not even sure if words could describe this story. It's very disturbing, this was not meant for children in any way. I know this sounds silly, but before the kidnapping of the wife, for a few minutes I thought it was actually a comedy. While even after that and a few disturbing scenes, you still laugh. It's a very dark comedy with very dark drama.I would recommend this movie, but not for the faint of heart. It's a little too much to handle if you can't stand gore. Boy did I get it when I asked for it.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure that many have commented on this, but I haven't heard any discussion of this point. When the Buscemi character and his cohort were pulled over outside of Brainard (with Mrs.Lundegaard tied up in the back seat), was it the suspicion of bribe (Money was protruding out of his wallet when he presented his license and registration) that caused the trooper to ask Buscemi to "step out of the car"? Or was there something else? Also, the younger Lundegaard had a poster of a master accordion player on the inside of his doorway. Is accordion music a popular genre for the youth in Minnesota? or was a humorous take on the quaintness of the region?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extra points for making me feel like an asshole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo, for me, was quite a powerful experience, some of it, admittedly, on account of the latitude factor. You see, I happen to live a bit to the north, and quite a lot to the east of the movie setting (and Fargo is proof that an ocean cannot separate two nations united by hockey!). As such, I have seen for myself how the obsessive mentality of the west fuses with the "conditioned-by-the-elements" type characters of the north, to create some very confused individuals (this is stereotyping, but you get the idea).They call it a dark comedy, but it would perhaps be more appropriate to say that it is a kind of line dance between the tragic and the comical, leaning one way and the other (usually both ways at once, actually) but never once stumbling. This extremely potent -if difficult- combination, coupled with an assortment of grand themes and some of the most interesting twists on archetypal characters I've seen, form what can only be called a masterpiece. There is no "fat", in fact, there's hardly a scene that isn't absolutely riveting, and the acting is generally good, with a few excellent performances. Oh, and I cried a little at the end. I did have one small problem the movie though.Fargo isn't exactly culturally sensitive. I thought that "Mike Yanagita" the Asian-loser-pervert was a bit of a cheap shot, not to mention the violent, drugged out, native American mechanic named "Proudfoot", and many others. I had an especially "good laugh" (well, I did and I didn't) at the car chase scene. Many of you probably missed this, but "Gaer Grimsrud" (that's Peter Stormare's character -what kind of name is "Gaer Grimsrud" anyway?) exclaims "vittu" (that's the f-word for you non-Finns) in a Swedish accent while hunting down those unfortunate passers-by. Grimsrud is one mythical Finn you'll never see in a Finnish movie; although he really is just a ridiculously exaggerated Finnish stereotype, this breed of northerner certainly isn't treated with the same sympathy as the inhabitants of Brainerd! Now this stung a bit (especially when Grimsrud executed that poor adorable girl in the car wreck, that was heartbreaking), but I for one have no trouble swallowing my national pride -GENIOUS goes a long way to make up for the insults, and I get a feeling that it was all intentional anyway: a big fat **** you to political correctness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Powerful drama played as black comedy."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In snow-covered Minnesota, a car dealer hatches a seemingly water tight plan to have his own wife kidnapped by two crooks and collect a ransom from her wealthy father. However, things go disastrously wrong...A powerful crime drama which is played for a blackly comic effect. In common with most modern day pictures there is a rather unnecessary emphasis on sex, but apart from that this is good old fashioned entertainment. William H Macy is excellent as the naive car dealer while Frances McDormand as the pregnant cop who has to go from bloody to even bloodier crime scene as the movie progresses is standout. The film is shot perfectly on the standard Widescreen format by cameraman Roger Deakins. All in all, "Fargo" is an unmissable treat from the Coen Brothers who have given us other gems such as "The Man Who Wasn't There".ACADEMY AWARDS: Best Actress: Frances McDormand, Best Original Screenplay: Joel &amp; Ethan Coen.ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor: William H Macy, Best Director: Joel Coen, Best Cinematography: Roger Deakins, Best Film Editing: Roderick Jaynes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, to say the least, but a mockery of North Dakota</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, this movie was interesting. I did enjoy it, but I wasn't overly impressed. Partly because it was such an odd story and partly because the people of North Dakota were portrayed so inaccurately. As I was watching, I was looking forward to seeing how they would present these totally unique people to me and I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps it's because much of my family originates from North Dakota, but i was hoping to see a part of someone I could recognize, but all the people were just simple, everyday stereotypes of Midwestern folk. Still, the story was intriguing, and though the people didn't seem entirely real to me, they made an amusing spoof. I'd say that it's about a 7/10. Not perfect, but still worth the watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without giving the plot away, I can still remember watching this at the movies and squirming at the conclusion of the movie when I realised what was happening.This was the first film where William H Macy came to my attention and I found his performance wonderful. He play Jerry who is a car salesman who hatches a plan to extort money from his father in law by hiring two kidnappers to kidnap his wife. The problem comes when the two kidnappers are loose canons and Jerry rapidly loses control of the situation. Marge (McDormand) plays the police chief investigating the various crimes and is also heavily pregnant. The Coen's sneakily promoted that this film was a true story or based on a true story. Fortunately this wasn't true and the film is gripping throughout with several excellent performances. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fargo" seems to be drawing flak lately; I think it's part of an anti-Coen backlash. The brothers have been serving up heavy doses of irony and dark humor for years, and some viewers are getting tired of them. Still, that's no reason to retroactively criticize their masterpiece, is it? Yes, the film has a very queer sense of humor, but if things like the Minnesota accent drive you nuts, you're not getting the joke (BTW, this doesn't mean that you're stupid, just that you don't share the Coen sense of humor!). I usually hate "funny" gore, but I do think that the violence here, though occasionally "amusing," is also quite horrible and repulsive. So, it's not quite like a Tarantino film then, where violence becomes a supercool thing to emulate. What ultimately distinguishes this film from a Tarantino effort - and indeed, from the Coens' other films - is that it is, in the oddest way, sentimental. McDormand's character lends warmth and humanity to a story that is otherwise quite cold and detached. Her presence makes "Fargo" accessible, even if you're not a big fan of black comedy, and her "normalcy" elevates this above even "The Big Lebowski," which is a great movie as well, but also too much of a freak-fest.Enough apologies - this is one of the best films of the 1990s (surprise surprise, it didn't win Best Picture!). The photography is gorgeous, and the icy landscapes lend so much atmosphere to the proceedings. The script is fast and snappy without seeming artificial, and the acting is across-the-board great; Buscemi's comic role is often overlooked, but in fact he may give my favorite performance. Burwell's score is evocative (what a great, bombastic opening!), and it is of course a wonderful novelty to see locales in a movie that aren't in New York or California. Classic stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, but overhyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" came out in 1996. I saw it for the first time in November of 2003. Those seven-odd years during which the film was hyped to death as one of the best movies ever caused a noticeable ascension in my expectations. And unfortunately, as we all know, the more a film is touted before you see it, the more likely it is to disappoint. Such was probably the case here.Here are a couple of main items that prevented me from liking it as much as the general American public:1. The plot of the film was solid, but I thought that it was a bit underdeveloped. The film's runtime was just over an hour and a half, which may not seem too short, but in this case forced the main conflict to resolve itself a tad quickly. In doing so, the writers (the Coen Brothers) failed to progress it to a truly noticeable climax or capture the type of characterization that is necessary in order for this sort of "comic crime-caper" to work.2. To be fair, though, the characters were very cleverly created, and very well cast (as is the case in most Coen Brothers movies). However, only Jerry Lundegaard's character (played by William H. Macy) is given enough screentime to truly develop. His massive amount of screentime allows the audience to eventually notice his visible inner conflict and come to grips with him as the sort of desperate, fidgety person that he is. Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson, on the other hand, seems to just appear on the screen at one point and then disappear a little later. She just really doesn't bring a whole lot to the table in terms of the linear plot, as she seems to go off more on tangents and rely on a thick Canadian-esque accent (one that loses its novelty very quickly) for laughs more than anything else. Her time on screen was apparently sufficient enough to warrant her nomination in the category of "Best Actress" and not "Best Supporting Actress," but, in my opinion, it wasn't enough to present her for much more than surface value. Although McDormand played the part as well as anyone could have, her character was weakly written and should not have won her a nomination, let alone an Academy Award.All in all, "Fargo" is simply a good, watchable movie that was probably, in my case, just a victim of self-imposed over-scrutiny caused by more than half a decade of hype. But I have the feeling that even if I had seen it when it first came out, I wouldn't be placing it in any upper-echelon categories anyway. On a scale of 1-to-5, I'd give this one about 3.5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Business man Jerry Lundegaard is in a dire financial situation.So much so that he is a desperate man willing to do anything to save him self.So what else can he do but concoct a scheme to replenish his withering bank balance.Hiring two hapless small time hoods,the slimy Carl(Steve Buscemi) and the silent,brooding Gaear(Peter Stormare) from Fargo,North Dakota.Jerry arranges that the two of them will kidnap his wife Jean(Kristin Rudrud) and hold her to ransom.The money will no doubt be paid by Jerry's wealthy and unsuspecting father in law.With the cash Jerry will be able to pull him self away from bankruptcy and use it to pay off the two inept crooks he has hired.But as is usually the case,things don't go to plan.Now with corpses littering the beautiful,cold landscape of Dakota and feisty sheriff Marge Gunderson on their tail.What chance do Jerry and his partners in crime have. What else can I say about Fargo that hasn't been said already.Quite the opposite actually.uninspired,lethargic and emotionally distant, Fargo has to rate as one of the most over rated movies of all time.Okay maybe I'm being a little unfair.The Cohen's most greatly rewarded movie is not exactly awful.But it's hardly good either.Why this is held in such high esteem by critics and movie fans is beyond me.But as the old saying goes.'There's no accounting for taste'.If so how could Keanu Reeves(although he seems like a really nice guy) and Tom Cruise to this day be such big stars in Hollywood.Who knows?Who cares? Anyway.I'm beginning to stray from the subject of 'Fargo'.A movie which wastes a good,strong cast who are normally seen in supporting rolls. Although the four main stars are by no means fantastic and become the personification of each of the four protagonists.Ethan and Joel Cohen's script doesn't truly do them the justice they deserve.Wether it's down to the the quirky humor(which can work at the best of time),the fact that I couldn't begin to care about the characters who for some reason you feel detached from or that not enough happened to truly keep me rivited to my seat.I'm not entirely sure.Chances are.It's all the above. Even the scene where a couple of innocent motorists are gunned down by Buscemi and Stormare,having witnessed them commiting a vile crime didn't chill me to the bone as it should have. Although well directed and the very slight moment of amusement from Buscemi and Stormare as well as McDormand.This was and is something of a disappointment for me.Even with it's bloody(and may I say predictable, anti-climatic)denounment.It's a thriller that just didn't manage to set my pulse racing.A pity I suppose as there might have been potential for a decent movie here.Sadly the Cohen brothers just wasted what was a promising premise with an uninspiring waste of an hour and a half of movie celluloid.Robs Rating: * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Coens' best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My all-time favorite Coen Brothers movie remains Miller's Crossing, but this one is probably my second-favorite. It's a given that any film they make will have great photography, intelligent, snappy writing and at least a few laughs, but I'm not the first one to point out that sometimes they seem like a little too much style and a little too little substance. Such films can still be drop-down hilarious, as with The Big Lebowski or O Brother Where Art Thou, but Fargo is one that gives you a little bit more.The heart of this movie is provided by Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Their characters are very well fleshed-out and very human; to give just one example, the scene where Macy starts smashing his blotter down onto his desk in his office is almost painful to watch, because it captures so perfectly his feeling of utter frustration and helplessness. Part of the movie's genius is the seemingly effortless way that it captures the little details of its characters' lives and really makes them come alive.When I just watched this movie again recently, I realized that the whole set-up -- plot, characters, setting -- is also a work of genius. It's no secret that the Coens are fans of the film noir genre and, especially, the novels that inspired it. Blood Simple and The Man Who Wasn't There are both in the style of James M. Cain (The Postman Always Rings Twice), Miller's Crossing is a clear homage to Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key (especially the Alan Ladd film version) and The Big Lebowski is a parody of Raymond Chandler's writing style, with a burnt-out stoner sitting in for Philip Marlowe.But what they've pulled off in Fargo is, conceptually, their most brilliant idea, perfectly executed. They've taken a storyline that could have come straight out of a classic thriller -- the husband who needs money, the betrayal, the murders, the plans gone awry -- and completely inverted almost every stereotypical element of such a novel.Instead of being set in a big city like Los Angeles, this is set out in the boondocks in Minnesota; instead of snappy gangster patter, the characters speak in a broad midwestern accent peppered with "yah" and "oh, geez".Instead of having an unmarried, cynical private eye as the hero detective, we have a pregnant police chief with a loving husband and a preternaturally cheerful disposition.Instead of being shot at night with lots of shadows, much of the film takes place during the day and the dominant color in many scenes is white (snow).The truly amazing achievement in this film is that the Coens could take something that's basically an elaborate stylistic joke -- a "reverse noir" ("film blanc"?) -- and turn it into such a funny, human and all-around great film. Don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A black comedy with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen brothers are obviously skillful filmmakers, but it wasn't until FARGO until they revealed themselves as true artists, with something very valuable to say about the human condition.From the opening shot to the end credits the Coens unfold their story with uncharacteristic confidence. A car drives through the snow to a haunting violin anthem. An awkward man meets with two criminals and asks them to kidnap his wife.And the rest of the movie lives up to these first scenes, combining a cold filmmaker's eye with a real human heart. FARGO has what a lot of other Coen films are missing: sincerity. BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY--they're all skillfully made and very unique, but really cold. Here, they've found the perfect balance--a satire of small town Midwestern life, a cool noirish plot, but some really devastating characters.Jerry Lundegaard, for example. The guy's funny, but desperate, and you actually feel for him. But most of all in Margie Gunderson and her husband--wow, what a great addition to an already great film. Marge's a good person without being boring, and through Marge's eyes, the Coen's cold, ironic take on most stories is redeemed. In the end, FARGO is a film that does more than just impress. It moves the audience, ends up being an experience that they will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening credits with "it is a true story" greeting till the end and its final statement that "this movie is fictitious" this film won?ft let you leave the room for a minute, hell won?ft let you look at the clock. One of the best Coen brothers' movie probably second best after "The Big Lebowski" for this one is my weakness. The thing with "it is a true story" worked for me perfectly. That's how I saw it which pretty much enhanced the overall perception. And I don?ft understand why some people complain about Coen brothers' way of manipulating. Everything was so realistic in this movie. The characters weren't very bright fellows doing not so well thought out things as how in real life is. Great performances from Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy and especially Macy. If Marge was the soul of the movie then Jerry was its brain?!? I guess. You could actually see him at the end crumbling down from the weight of his lies wanting to go to some place safe just to have a break for a while. Beautiful. So realistic as it's so simple. Great Coen brothers, great William Macy. He should've gotten the Oscar.I can't tell what's exactly the genre of this movie but if I had to categorize it I would say it is a black comedy. But this is really not important for you will definitely be entertained. Isn't that what good movies are all about? Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many incidental pleasures in "Fargo", but where's the structure? I recall reading a definition in one of those concepts-for-which-we-have-no-words dictionaries: "a book in which everything is clear except the author's purpose in writing it". Here is the cinematic equivalent.For those who want to excuse the film's messiness as the result of being based on a true story ... well, guys, I don't know how to say this: it isn't. That "the events you are about to see" opening statement is a simple lie. They made it all up. I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to just shrug my shoulders and say, "oh, well"; this is AT BEST the Coen brothers' shameful way of manipulating us into doing their work for them. They should use craft to make us accept their stories, not deceit. No doubt they can pass it all off easily enough as a postmodern joke, but to tell the truth, I'd thought the Coen brothers were above postmodern jokes - and they are. "Barton Fink" was one of the best films of the 1990s. "Fargo", thanks to its shapelessness, fails to live up to the other three Coen works I've seen. (In case you're interested, the remaining two are "Miller's Crossing" and "The Hudsucker Proxy".)And yet, and yet ... Particular plot elements, individual scenes, certain characters and aspects of people's characters, are so fascinating, so artfully drawn ... it's frustrating. Lundegaard is a wonderful character. He's the kind of man who stumbles from one weak act to the next and would probably hate himself if he stopped to think about his actions at all. It was very clever of the Coens to begin his story in the middle. We're never told exactly what fraud he's trying to cover up by kidnapping his wife; but we know, we just KNOW, that he committed THAT to cover up some lesser fraud, and the lesser fraud was in turn a way of saving face after he'd done some other thing, and that when we trace the chain of events back to its source we'll find ... in all likelihood, nothing. Marge Gunderson is also a wonderful character. She's proof that someone can be deeply, deeply good without being dull, or getting on our nerves. Take the superb scene where she meets her old school friend in a restaurant ... but I'm reminded of what's wrong with "Fargo", for what's THAT scene doing in THIS movie? I can't make it out. "Fargo" really baffles me. So many good parts, a curiously unsatisfying whole; great throughout, good overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected more from Fargo. Shortly said, the brothers wanted to be original, and ended up being too original. I gave it a 6 anyway, because it was yet interesting, in particular for dialogues and characters. There was an eerie atmosphere, too. But the balance between noir and comedy resulted in a tie, with no spectaculars... Of course a movie may have a complex order, but it always needs an order. Here we see scenes that don't have a direction, every one going its own way. It looks like a collection of random shots. As for humor, there are some hilarious lines, but I really mean 'some'.I understand somebody may appreciate it more than me and give it a 7, but anything above is pure overrating.In conclusion, if you've heard about Fargo and hope to find that particular humor in it, you'd better see 'The Big Lebowsky'.</fullReview>

And how Frances McDormand (with all the respect) could have won the oscar for such a stupid role. The end is one of the most strange things I ever saw. It was like: "Oh! here is the murderer, let´s catch him" And who cares about all the investigation and the clues. In my opinion, it's just a movie for those days when you can´t sleep, and you want a reason to fall asleep. Fargo is so boring!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe artistic?? But sincerely quite dull and overrated. Good acting though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this film because of its high IMDb rating as I felt if others liked it I would. This assumption has worked well for me so far in finding a few hidden gems until now...This film is about a guy (Macy) who is a scam artist as he is paying two villains (Buscemi and Storemare) to abduct his wife, so that her father (Presnell) will give the money for her release and he will keep the majority. Although seemingly a simple way of making a large sum of money, events unfold to turn this plan sour and pregnant and lethargic, cop (McDormand) is on their case.Now I can appreciate the efforts of good quality actors and an artistic feel to a movie as Buscemi and Storemare played a pair of real cold hearted thugs who comically struggled to get along, Macy was tremendous as a desperate, lying, money driven salesman who seemed to have little emotion towards his family. Amongst others McDormand was fantastic as a pregnant cop who seemed extremely dimwitted (but not so perhaps) and was madly in love with a slobbish, bald and slow husband who was devoted to his wife. This film has many layers which I'm sure many other reviews will cover but my overall issue with the film and why I couldn't score it over a 6/10 is that it is simply too slow, too simple and too dull to be a great film and the masterpiece some consider it to be. Now I appreciate not all films have to be complicated, fast and full of action but this film was simply a yawn from start to finish (especially the finish). I appreciate a strong drama which aims to capture the layers of the characters which I'm sure it did but the finish of this film summed up the whole movie, dull and predictable. Maybe this is the sort of film for you and if so you may love it but for someone who enjoys not being able to take their eyes off the screen in case you miss something, please think twice before you watch this as you may waste a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is the sayings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a movie that has an interesting story, it is a good movie, but also well directed with a snowy cinematography. There are outstanding actors such as Wlliam H. Macy, Peter Stormare, Steve Buscemi. There is also Frances Mc Dormand, another outstanding actress, even if she is so unsympathetic in this movie, she is usually cold anyway, but. If Fargo had been made after A Simple Plan, I would have said cliché or an imitation, but I can say that it was a pioneer. This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem. It is seen as one of the best movies of 1990s, some say it is the best Coen Brothers movie by far! Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later. Because it was stunning, but Fargo is not. At least it should not have been in IMDb Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Blood has been shed, Jerry."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the "true story" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as "You betcha," "Aw Jeez," "Okie-Dokie" and "Yah."The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical ? almost slapstick ? comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a "funny-looking" weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}.I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list.</fullReview>

Frances McDormand rightly earned herself the Oscar for Best Actress portraying Marge Gunderson, chief of Brainerd police.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is facing financial troubles. He concocts a scheme to get more money to support a new project he is undertaking. Jerry hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get his rich father in law (Harve Presnell) to pay the ransom of $1,000,000. Unfortunately things get way out of hand.Fargo is a movie everyone needs to see. It is a mixture of many things. Crime, comedy, thriller, drama and romance. The screenplay is witty and packs many delights along the way. All the performances are perfect in this movie. The movies also is extremely true to life. The characters are not overdone or inhuman. Nothing seems unrealistic. If I were to name anything wrong with this movie it would be that it was too short. I really wanted it to continue on.4?/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a mild disappointment on big screen to me, which is quite often the case with these "based on a true story"-flicks for some reason. (Although this is not a true story, that claim in the beginning of the film is just typically odd Coenesque humor.) It really took repeated viewings to catch the appeal of characters who virtually all seemed at first sight unbearably stupid. Along with the slow pace and white, cold Minnesota/North Dakota landscape. But when it hit, it hit: especially William H. Macy's deservedly Award-winning realization of an unspeakable loser is probably THE best acting performance of the 1990's. Frances McDormand is also great as a wonderfully committed and clever cop despite her vulnerable state! And Steve Buscemi never manage to fail. Only minor complaint is latter's partner in crime, Peter Stormare, who's character and motives remain a mystery to the very end. But all in all, a true modern American gem. (Correction by the author: Macy didn't win an Oscar for the Best Supporting role after all, but was only nominated. He most definitely should had though.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting look at mannerisms and speech in Fargo, North Dakota but will it be memorable 20 years from now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Fargo in 1996 I enjoyed it mainly because I was hoping that it would edge out the highly over-rated snorefest The English Patient at the Academy Awards. Now I'm aware of the fact that Fargo is also highly over-rated. Three generations of my family grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota. The mannerisms and speech used by William H Macy and Frances McDormand is realistic but why should I remember this screenplay twenty years from now? Apparently it is a true story which must have all the fans of Survivor running for their local Blockbuster stores along with the fans of America's Most Wanted and Cops. When I want to see reality that will impact me for years to come I'll rent something historically significant like Malcolm X or a documentary film like No Man's Land or One Day in September. These movies are by the books as reality movies should be and don't look for black comedy that offends the memories of the people who were most closely affected by the tragedy. I did appreciate the effort on the part of the Coen brothers to add their usual wit to the mix. William H Macy was hilarious as the father and husband who was more worried about money than about the lives of his family. It was a somewhat enchanting experience to watch him try to keep everything under control while slightly breaking down with every passing moment. Frances McDormand has proven herself to be talented in Almost Famous and The Man who Wasn't There but she is highly over-rated here. Perhaps it's my bias that was putting all bets on Emily Watson's extraordinary performance in Breaking the Waves for the Academy Award. For me McDormand was adequate and appeared to be having fun but not memorable 20 years down the road. The always reliable Steve Buscemi (he should have won for Ghost World) stole the show here. Fargo is a film that I'd recommend to the reality-television audience and to serious fans of the Coen brothers films. It enchants on some level but may disgust some viewers who will be perplexed that this really did happen. It suffices as a rental on a Saturday night when you want to see what all the fuss is about. Be prepared however, if your from Fargo or Minnesota to be somewhat offended. After all, when you see Frances McDormand, you'll be looking in the mirror.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar-Winning Writing Based on a Lie to their Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this screenplay begins with a lie to the audience; at the beginning of the film, a somber title comes on saying that "due to respect for the survivors, names have been changed in this film". This implies that the events of the film are true, and that the writers are showing respect. Neither of these two things are true. The Cohen Brothers, after winning the Oscar for Best Writers (not before), eventually came out and admitted the story was entirely fictional. So much praise had been heaped on them, that no-one seemed to care at that point. It would be great of newspapers worked the same way. Bush would never have been criticized when no WMD's were found. Why does this matter, and who cares at this point? When I first saw this movie, I was disturbed by the way the kidnap victim, the mother, was portrayed: as comic relief. Her running from her kidnappers was comical, the way she was shown running around in the snow with a bag over her head was comical, and even her death (her skewed legs upside down) was shown as comical. The son, however, who was terrified for his mother, was not shown comically. So here we have a screenplay where the writers showed a terrified victim as comedy, and the son's terror for his mother dismissed. If this screenplay had been based on true events, to say this was disrespectful both to the mother and the son is an understatement. Imagine being the son who survived your mother's kidnapping and murder, and seeing her portrayed in this way.But that's OK, because we find out later the whole thing was fictional. Except for the fact that I wasn't the only one upset by the way the victims were presented; other people, in particular victims rights groups, were too. Then we find out that we had been jerked around, that it was all a fiction.Does that make it any more acceptable? Imagine your favorite movie that moved you because it was based on true events; then you find out years later it was all done so you would buy a ticket, and you had been deceived. This is what the Cohen Brothers did to their audience. Good writers? Sure. Ethical people? You decide.But respectful of their audience and to murdered people?Apparently, not very.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me see if I understand this. Fargo won the Academy Award for best screenplay written directly for the screen? Astounding. Another nominee that year, Jerry Maguire, was more deserving (not to mention a better film overall). Yes, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy acted well. But the story was empty and transparent, the motivation questionable, and the outcome not entirely resolved. Why did William Macy's character need cash in the first place and what was so important that he would consider extorting his father-in-law's money at his wife's expense? What about Macy's character's son? What happened to him? And what about the money buried in the snow? Didn't anyone check his father-in-law's bank accounts to see that a million dollars was missing not merely 80 grand? What about his lawyer? Did I miss something here?? And what was up with that old high school chum of Frances McDormand's character, Mike Yanagita, and his contrived story? What was the point of this? And why would her artist husband (who only seems to eat rather than work or paint) not be a bit concerned that his seven-month-pregnant wife went to investigate cold-blooded murders? I definitely must have missed a lot of things here... At least her point that money isn't worth the violence perpetrated was on the mark... and this was better than "A Simple Plan" (1998), but otherwise there's not much left to say about this film. Well, if you're easily amused by overly-exaggerated Scandinavian / Minnesotan / North Dakotan accents, then see this film. If you enjoy dark humor with sudden bursts of homicidal violence then see this film... Otherwise, don't be misled by the Academy's misguided choice in 1996.

I didnt hear a single positive comment. I concur. It is dull dull dull. Goes nowhere and is as entertaining as Andy Warhol's 'Empire'. I forced myself to watch it a third time to make sure - there must be something I'm missing. But no. Do you have to be from America to understand this movie? Its not funny, the characters are frustratingly annoying in their blandness or idiocy, and there is no action/suspense/tension that isn't done better in another film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not A True Story...Just Very Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My lack of enjoyment for this much-beloved murder-comedy story may have something to do with the complete disconnect I get reading positive reviews posted here. They talk about its great humor, its strong sense of place, and the tough way it deals with bad things people really do.I watch this movie and just feel miserable. Not so much with the story on screen, but with "Fargo's" enormous popularity.Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) needs a lot of money. He decides on a plan to have his wife kidnapped so that her wealthy father will pay a million-dollar ransom. He offers the kidnappers, a pair of lowlife goons, $40,000 by pretending its half of a much lower ransom demand. All this comes apart when one of the goons gets trigger-happy on their way back from the wife-snatching, and Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets the call.People liken the humor in "Fargo" to that of "Goodfellas", except in "Goodfellas" the people getting hurt and killed are guys who chose their "kill-or-be-killed" line of work. Here, the kidnapping and later deaths are treated as a kind of goof, to be larked over by Marge and the other cops. Tragedy becomes a kind of cynical shorthand for audience merriment. For example, the kidnapped mother's poor son is only glimpsed teary-eyed in one scene after the crime so the directors can make the point of his lame musical interests - Whitesnake and accordions.The comedies of Joel and Ethan Coen often deal in broad caricature with a regional slant. "Raising Arizona" used the Southwest United States, "O Brother Where Art Thou" the Deep South; both to great effect. Yet here the depictions of the Northwestern people (Minnesota, not North Dakota, is the central setting; Dakotans may be grateful the Coens are not from there) border on the bovine. Big cow-faced people chew disgusting amounts of starches and red meat while talking in monosyllables about the weather and little else. "Yah", "Yah betcha", "Doncha know" and so on permeate their dialogue until the point of their basic moronity is hammered home.One wonders if this is what makes the film comedic to so many: How could you care about people like this being murdered? They're barely alive now! I actually have less of a problem watching the murders - which to be fair to the Coens are not shot in an exploitative manner - than some of the casual dialogue scenes. The Coens as writers seem to enjoy creating one miserably painful conversation after another, using Larry David-style morbid embarrassment as its ultimate purpose, such as Marge's pointless meeting with an old high-school flame or Lundegaard getting the shaft from his too-nasty-to-be-true father-in-law."This could work out real well for me and Jean and Scottie", Lundegaard tells the old man at one point, trying to sell him on a loan."Jean and Scottie never have to worry," the father-in-law growls.To say this film is morally repulsive and insulting to Minnesotans is not to deny its funny or interesting in places, once you make an effort to accept where its coming from. Watching the lowlife crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) argue about pancakes is kind of fun, and certain scenes work in a low-key way. The camera-work by Roger Deakins captures the grimness early American settlers talked so despondently about, where horizon lines are lost between whited-out land and sky.But this 98-minute film with seven murders feels more to me like the Donner Party running on real time. I know people enjoy this film, but man I don't know if I'd feel worse knowing why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typically comment on films only when my view varies from the vast majority of commenters. I don't see how this film makes the top 250 list. Yes, there are quality performances delivered by Buscemi, Macy, and McDormand, but nowhere near Oscar material - and I think they would agree. McDormand does the Northern laid back officer role very well, and of course, Macy is at home as the stressed out protagonist.I agree with critics that wonder about the purpose of the film. What was the purpose of the multiple idiotic sex scenes with the villains and the local whores? The free-wheeling cussing was enough to guarantee the R rating. Life in the North during the dead of winter IS very bleak for the uninitiated, but the plot is worthy of only TV movie of the week attention. Grinding frozen human remains in a wood chipper?? PLEASE. In my opinion Buscemi steals the show, and carries the audience through all of the insanity of the situation confronting all the characters. Don't tell me that the freakish situation that McDormand encountered - multiple homicides on the highway in the middle of winter - wouldn't have stressed her out just a little bit more, yet she treated the whole situation as some routine investigation. I couldn't see that, and I'm good in the snow.I couldn't buy the raves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Macy, I salute you...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William H.Macy is my fave actor at the moment. He has been in a long list alongside such names like John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Matt Damon. To me, Macy makes this film a whole lot better than it should be. To me, it's a very basic plot with an overall average acting performance bar the unbeatable Mr. Macy. Frances McDormand got an oscar for her performance. I couldn't believe this after watching the film because to me she comes across as a very dim-witted talentless actress. Of course, a lot of people would say that was what her character's personality was like, but to me, I see her as not a dimwitted character, but as a poor actress who is failing to make a connection with me. I despised her in this film.Macy on the other hand, played his character with such excellence, that this film was the reason why I love the guy as much as I do now. His character is perfect, he says the silly lines perfectly, and when he's in a pickle, I love the way he makes it seem like nothing's happening... the scene in the motel bathroom as an example.The storyline as I previously mentioned is very basic. A car salesman needs money, so he hires two guys to hold his wife hostage, and then claim a huge ransom off her wealthy father. Things go wrong though due to the mistakes of the two criminals, and then it's a case of the hot-shot police officer to find the criminals who've left a bloody trail in their wake. It doesn't sound gripping stuff, tho neither The Usual Suspects on its back cover and we all know about that don't we?So Fargo... it is good, don't get me wrong. Some of the acting performances are top notch but don't expect a twisting crime thriller... it's more comedy than serious!PROS: + Macy + The conversations within are pretty funny. + Steve Buscemi plays a good crook.CONS:- Frances McDormand does my head in! She's so annoying! - The storyline's a bit basic. - That other crook lacks belief. - Nothing stands out as a major point in the film.</fullReview>

The plot is basic, the outcome when things start getting out of hand where the criminals make one mistake which leads to another is inevitable, the sheriff's work isn't amazing!, there were no shocking twists - all in all, a very simple film - I'm at pains to identify why people have rated it so highly.In summation, I didn't hate the film, or dislike it that badly, it's an OK film - but it's nothing special. I'd give it a 3-4/10. Don't come in expecting something amazing - as I did - else you'll set yourself up for a disappointment. It's very mediocre - but watchable - if a bit mundane.

		<shortDescription>Declines in quality on repeat viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Completely honest viewpoint... I first saw this film in a theater during its initial theatrical run in 1996. A friend picked it out, as I had never heard of it until then. We sat through it, then on the way out, I said to him, "Well, that was weird." He looked at me and laughed, saying, "I was just going to say that." We then promptly forgot about it and started talking about someone else. It seemed like it would have done well as an extended episode of some bizarre TV series along the lines of "Twin Peaks," etc. Something that you would watch once, and then next week, something different would happen with the same characters. But as a self-contained film, well, it's not enough of a story, not enough of a film. The months later, it was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture. On hearing that, I thought, "Wow, Hollywood really liked it." I have to admit I was rooting for Brenda Blethyn to win the Oscar for "Secrets and Lies" as I thought hers was the best performance of the year. So I was let down when Frances McDormand won, not that her performance wasn't award-worthy, just that the wrong person won that year. Thinking I had missed something profound about "Fargo," I rented the DVD when it came out, I think in 2003. This time I could hardly stomach the violence in it. I wisely turned it off before one particularly gruesome scene happened. I don't see any point in sitting through it again. I was ready to write off the Coen brothers as filmmakers, until I rented "The Man Who Wasn't There," which was brilliant. Sorry, but that's just my honest opinion about "Fargo."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is absolutely no reason for this film to be noteworthy in any way.Some movies aren't good, but at least they are bad. This one doesn't even have the courtesy to be even bad.The story is mundane and replaceable. The scenery is as boring as a literal blank piece of paper. There is nothing that can even be said about the acting. No character one could connect to. Barely anything happens.And I'm no action junkie. I prefer calmer but smarter films. This one is just calm. But with nothing going on behind it. Which misses the whole point. Like a piece of music that as so obsessed with the silent parts, that too little notes are left for the silence to stand out and mean anything anymore.I can only attribute its high score to a severe case of film snobbery.So if you are the type who lives in a very very rural area, yet believe there is such a thing as a wine/cigar/? "expert" and that you are one? If you "like" caviar. Or engage in other kinds of silly snobbery? then this one's for you.You can act like you like it to elevate your ego all day, and for no reason everyone will believe you.

		<shortDescription>With the Coens you are always entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is an American movie from 20 years ago and despite some well-received earlier work, it was the big breakthrough for the Coen Brothers as writers and directors that won them an Academy Award as well. And it also won lead actress Frances McDormand (married to one of the Coens) an Academy Award. I see some people debate her being a lead in this film, but I guess I agree that she is. Yes she is not in it the first third of the film, but afterward she is probably the main character. The other thing debatable here is William H. Macy's supporting nomination. Not only is he first cast, but nothing in terms of the action would have happened without his decision to stage his wife's abduction. Wrong category for sure, he is undeniably lead.Now let us talk a bit about this film. I believe the biggest strength here is the writing. it is tense, dramatic, a great crime story and also extremely funny on some occasions. My favorite moment was probably when McDormand's character (perfect wife, perfect cop) was examining the very first crime scene on the highway. Hilarious stuff and her cop colleague was just great with what he said and how he said it. It is always the Coen's strength to make minor characters really entertaining and memorable and this one is another brilliant example for their great talent. I would probably not agree with McDormand's Oscar, but I still think she was pretty good and maybe the heart and soul of the film. It has mostly to do with her being a good casting choice and especially with the way she was written. This film here is one of the rare exceptions that has either completely good or completely bad characters and it's a great achievement by the Coens to make this work.The cast includes more known names, such as Steve Buscemi, who faces the most ill-fated face here with all he has to go through the longer the film goes on. And with "longer", I am talking about no more than 95 minutes which is really short, not only for the Coens, but in general, but that's perfectly fine. This runtime keeps the film nicely on spot and focused. Plus, the setting in the snowy town of Fargo helps the atmospheric touch as well. And there are many great scenes in terms of camera work that function extremely well with the strong writing. The Coens prove that they were already masters of their craft back then. I recommend watching Fargo and I got curious about the relatively new television show now too. Maybe I will watch it at some point. Talking about this movie finally again, I want to emphasize once again how much fun it is to watch the characters here with all their quirks and actions. Extremely memorable. Go check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, as a "film buff", I've set out to watch anything and everything. And, after hearing a ton of hype for Fargo, I decided to give it a try. Now, the first half of the movie was actually pretty interesting. William H. Macy's character is one that is convincing, and is the kind of character that you just love to hate. His character is interesting, and I was getting invested. But, then the movie makes a big misstep in my opinion. That is, making Marge Gunderson the main character of this movie.I don't like this character at all. I think the performance is stiff, lifeless and her character is just so annoying. I expected this movie to be kind of similar to A Clockwork Orange, that being that even though this man is a criminal and kind of vicious, you still want to see him succeed. But, Marge is not interesting. There is zero development for her, and I don't care about her. Now, there is a lot said about the dark humor in this movie. I hear people saying that you don't know whether to humored or shocked by this movie. Well, outside of the scene where Marge is talking to the prostitutes, nothing was really humorous, and nothing in this movie was shocking. I dunno. I was born after this movie came out, so maybe it was shocking at the time, but nowadays, this is actually pretty tame. Actually, no! There was no way this was shocking to anyone even then because movies like A clockwork Orange and Reservoir Dogs had already come out by then! Look, this film does have some good performances, and the cinematography is decent, but I really can't see myself watching it more than the 2 times I already have! By no means a bad movie, and if you like it, that's fine, but i just didn't get the appeal of it.</fullReview>

I was deeply interesting in this movie because of the presence of Steve Buscemi, it is such a good actor, he always do the funny and clumsy guy (he also did in reservoir Dogs) The rest of the cast was also great. William H. Macy and Peter Stormare were very good too. I have not much to say about the soundtrack, it was not a big deal. The story passes in North Dakota/Minnesota and the scenario is extremely good. There are some scenes you have to see, because they are to good to remain unwatched, but of course, I will not spoil it. In overall, it is a very good film, the first I watched from the Cohen Brothers, and If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it right now! YES! THIS MOVIE IS THAT Awesome!

		<fullReview>Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).The Coen Brothers have consistently created good content for thirty years, with almost everything they touch being golden (or at worst silver). Somehow along the way, "Fargo" got to be the film most associated with them (even overshadowing the cult hit "Big Lebowski"). Nothing wrong with that.This is clearly the film that got people to notice Frances McDormand if they had not already done so, and probably lead to much bigger things for Peter Stormare (one of the greatest character actors in the business today).</fullReview>

In the long run, it turned out to be the Coen brothers' best effort.If you want to relax, simply switch your brain off and enjoy the movie. Fargo is considered to be a masterpiece, but i'd name it an above-average movie. It's might not surpass the notoriety of Barton Fink (1991) or the fame of The Big Lebowski (1998) and the Academy Award winning boredom called No Country for Old Men (2007) yet it is fun to watch.If you want to analyze Fargo, you won't get far. The characters are one-dimensional and the humor is actually "humor" yet the Coen brothers restrained themselves more than in, say, Barton Fink.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a satire of the blankness and bleakness of the American Midwest. The movie is set as a crime story, but actually the Cohen brothers are poking fun at the monotonous, unimaginative, and humdrum life there under veneer of well-to-do. The thing is that the brothers are Jewish, and they were concerned that the white populace there would take the movie as what it really is?a social commentary on the goy way of life. Hence the solution, which is a racist solution?As a sop, create a nerdy and contemptible character and cast a colored person for the role, and balance it out. The Cohens picked an Asian because Asian Americans do not have an NAACP and would not picket the movie or create a ruckus unlike the blacks would have. That is why an Asian appears out of the blue in a movie set in Minnesota where less than 1% of the population is Asian. In other words, in a perverse way the Cohen brothers chose a racial solution to the political-correctness problem of their own movie. The dastardly solution speaks volumes for the Jewish brothers' essential cowardice, despite their apparent claim for making a social statement clothed in a crime story.</fullReview>

Macy who played Jerry Lundegaard a car's salesman manager own by his father in law in Minnesota and wanted to start a new businese and has a lack amount of sums to start on a businese and planned to pay 40,000 and a car to Carl Snowalter played by Steve Buscemi and Gaear Grimsrud played by Peter Stormare to kidnap his wife and ask his father in law 1 million dollars. Steve Buscemi played a delightful and a strong role and it was his ever the best role in this film and the energy of his speech delivery was unbelievably done and had matched the character correctly and lastly for Peter Stormare's role was much mature and he really got so in to the role that it was like its his real life attitude and I was so great full to watch this film it's a mind-blowing crime classic that I ever watch.And if you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it and It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off, i watched this movie not knowing that it was an adaptation of actual events since i skipped the introduction part and started watching about 3-5 minutes into the film. As the film progressed, i found the plot to be sort of intriguing more than actually being interesting. Nearing its ending, i was waiting if not wishing for the main character to come up with an inconceivable plan or scheme; i was waiting for a great climax to what i thought was a great build up of unforeseen events. In the end, i was disappointed. There was no storybook ending, no unbelievable twist, no spectacular finale. Instead, what i got was a punch in the stomach; a taste of reality; of how things actually end up and happen in real life; the feelings of envy,pain, bitterness, brutality, regret were painstakingly yet brilliantly portrayed by the actors. With this sudden realization, i went back playing the first few minutes and little to my surprise it was a true story. Now, knowing that it was based on real life and real characters, i got to appreciate much more the effort put into making the movie. The intent to inject genuineness and real life characters and mannerisms(the accent and excessive use of the word "yeah") was now so clear in my head although i have to admit got annoyed at more than one point while watching the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the best Coen brothers film (and that's saying something)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is the modern classic that elevated the Coen brothers to the upper echelon of filmmakers working today. They'd done some fine work prior to this but it wasn't until "Fargo" that they got the attention that they deserved.The film is set in Minnesota in 1987 and centres around a kidnapping plot that goes horribly awry. Blood is shed and yet the laughs come steadily. In retrospect, it's amazing how effectively the film balances unflinching violence and understated comedy.The cast is dynamite. Frances McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as the local police chief while William H. Macy got his big break by nailing the character of inept car salesman Jerry Lundegaard. And how can you not like Steve Buscemi &amp; Peter Stormare as the pair of kidnappers? In fact, there's not a single performance in the film that's less than ideal.Then, of course, you've got the work of the Coens to consider. Joel got the directing credit but both brothers actually collaborated, as they did with the script. The script garnered a richly deserved Oscar while the direction was recognized with a nomination. The Roger Deakins cinematography was also nominated for an Oscar but Carter Burwell's moody score was unaccountably snubbed.In the end, "Fargo" is one of those films where almost everything works so well that it's difficult to spot even the slightest flaw. As a dark comedy, it's practically without peer. As a Coen brothers film, I'd say it edges out "No Country For Old Men" as the best of their career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A. Depends on the SIZE of your Feet! Fargo is a 1996 American dark comedy-crime film produced, directed and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant(?) police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival."Fargo opens with a title card proclaiming: "This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987." Earnest journalists who went in search of the "real" woodchipper murders were outraged when, after months of wild goose chases and increasingly deadpan obfuscation by the film-makers, they finally admitted that the title card was actually an elaborate hoax - their way of "poking a hole in the true story balloon", according to William H Macy.So Fargo was not, in fact, based on a true story. None of it really happened. There is no real "Jerry Lundegaard" out there." Back to the film: William H. Macy is the best actor in this film, closely followed by my favorite Steve Buscemi. Peter Stormare complements him well in his role as the murderous Gaear Grimsrud. Not to forget the awesome cameos by Steve Reevis as Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot.The person I hate in this film is Frances McDormand(Darkman). This b*tch has no acting talent whatsoever and spoils the mood of the film. In this film you will hear her (and some of her buddies) repeating a common phrase OH YAH! OH YAH! YAH! YAH! This gets on your nerves after a while.One thing makes me wonder: how the hell can a PREGNANT local police chief be allowed to work during her pregnancy? This part I DO NOT AGREE ON.The core of the film is based on a botched up kidnapping which affects the lives of many persons. The motive for the kidnapping is money (a.k.a. GREED). Greedy persons in the film are Jerry Lundegaard, an indebted car dealer who hires two men to kidnap his wife. Carl Showalter, a small-time crook hired to kidnap Jerry's wife and his psychotic partner Gaear Grimsrud.Best scenes in the film: Shep beating Carl &amp; Carl getting mince-meated during the films end.This is for me the 2nd best film by the Coen Brothers, the best or 1st ranking Coen Brothers film for me is No Country For Old Men. Miller's Crossing I rank 3rd. Barton Fink I rank 4rth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched last night with the hubby. It was a first view for the both of us and I was eager to watch what, I've been told by various folks over the years, is an iconic American film.This snapshot of midwestern life from times gone by (from accent to clothing to location) bordered on cartoonish at times- some of it felt too exuberant to be plausible. I also did not appreciate that the film opens with text stating that the story is true yet facts show exactly the opposite- the Coen's have given interviews which state that they took parts of true events from a bunch of different cases, wove them together to create this novel narrative, and included that text about the film's veracity because, in their opinion, if the audience believed the film was not fictional it would give them permission to show a perspective that would otherwise not be accepted. Even though I understand the Coen's explanation for lying to the audience, I still don't accept it.Still, this film was dark and funny and strangely moral in its point-of-view (money isn't everything, family is what really matters, and good triumphs over evil in the end) and I absolutely loved it! This is a must see and, quite possibly, an all-time favorite!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Happened to be browsing through my old VHS collection the other day and came across Fargo, which I recorded back in 1999. It hasn't aged a jot and is as memorable as I well, remembered it! Watched on a crappy old TV but listened to through a decent HiFi (I've kept an excellent example of VHS HiFiness for such purposes) the standard stereo soundtrack to this film (as with all the CB's films) is superb, bringing hidden depths to the surface as the music envelopes the ratcheting tension. If only more recent movies could be as precise with their soundtracks instead of ruining them with overblown sound! Then of course, there's the excellent cast with a story that's so compelling in its telling that you become quickly absorbed and just don't want it to end! If you haven't seen this film before or it's been a while since, do yourself a big favour! Blows most of today's cinematic crap out of the water....YAAH!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should you watch Fargo? You betcha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is a very rare occurrence in films. It is a perfect storm of actors, writers/directors, cinematographers, and an amazing plot. Each character has their own unique traits that fit together so well that you wonder if the story is actually based on a true story.&nbsp; As the plot twists around in a very entertaining way, you are brought on a ride you won't forget. The genius writing of the Coen brothers has never been this good. 'The Big Lebowski' was one of the best films I have ever seen but it doesn't have the same effect that Fargo has.&nbsp; Movies like this are the reason I watch movies in the first place. It connects with you on a personal level no matter who you are, but especially if you are from the Midwest. If you have ever seen a film in your life you should have seen this one. No chance of disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen brothers best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is quirky beyond belief, even for the Coen brothers. Without giving too much away, William H. Macy is Jerry, a dishonest car salesman(redundant, I know) who through a series of money games, needs to raise a good deal of cash quickly. He arranges the kidnapping of his wife by a couple of low life's headed by the super creepy Steve Bescemi in his most evil role. Jerry has the idea of having his father in law pay the ransom for his daughter. The best laid plans of mice and men soon go awry and what follows is part keystone cops and part Greek tragedy. Equal measure sardonic black comedy, violent crime drama and domestic romance, this is a brilliant work of art with a perfect script and characters so fully realized that I have to rate it a 10/10. This is a flawless film from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo's A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmmaking siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen both embraced and poked satirical fun at their Minnesotan roots with this comedy-drama-thriller entitled,Fargo. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.The movie was produced, directed and written by brothers Coen brothers.McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson,a pregnant police chief whose affable, folksy demeanor masks a whip-smart mind. When a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper, Marge begins piecing together a case involving a pair of dopey would-be kidnappers, Carl and Gaear. They've been hired by Jerry Lundegaard, a car salesman under the thumb of his wealthy, overbearing boss and father-in-law, Wade. Jerry's raised some money illegally through a petty scam he's run on General Motors and he's about to get caught. When Wade sours a business deal that could save his son-in-law's hide, the desperate Jerry hires Carl and Gaear to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. Things go predictably wrong and a series of murders occur,with Marge, waddling along behind her enormous belly and ever-hungering for an all-you-can-eat buffet, hot on the trail of the killers. The movie is a masterpiece for it works at all levels.McDormand excels as the most endearing, funny and wholly feminine heroine. The laughs and shocks in the movie are surprising and also very entertaining.While the storytelling is good for it is hilarious, disturbing, tragic, and hopeful.Overall,Fargo is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the words of Ebert: 'Films like Fargo are why I love the movies.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pity, really. Movies having a cast of relative unknowns of the industry, which make up for their lack of publicity with a superb storyline more often than not remain buried it the DVD archives titled 'no one cares' while films starring the big-wigs, with their six-packs or saving the world antics sell like reindeer training manuals in Antartica. Unfortunately, Fargo falls dead-centre in the former neglected category, which made the satisfaction of successfully excavating for it equivalent to finding a brick of pure gold. Fargo keeps all pretensions aside. It is a simplistic, home-spun, small- town dark comedy-crime film and it doesn't try to be anything else. The story is almost insultingly simple. A slightly eccentric, paranoid car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William Macy) is facing an acute financial crisis. He meets two criminals, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare), and makes a deal with them - they will kidnap his wife for him in return for which Jerry offers them a car and half of the $80,000 ransom he plans to mooch off his rich, antagonistic father in law, who also happens to be his boss. They kidnap her successfully but the coup soon goes awry resulting in messy deaths, a pregnant policewoman (Frances McDormand) coming on the prowl and big mouthed hookers giving away vital information. While the film could have gone the stereotypical comedy-chaos way with all the involved characters involved, it doesn't disappoint you. Writers-Directors Ethan Coen and Joel Coen stick to their guns. They slide the humour aside, though not neglecting it, while focusing entirely on development of the characters and the story. Fargo can be termed as a sitcom because most of the comedy is derived from the situations the characters, and especially Jerry, find themselves in. Jerry is absolutely inept at crime and is in no way prepared to deal with things as they begin snowballing out of hand. His absolute incompetence at controlling things is satirically proved by the fact that he can't ask the kidnappers to call off the job when things get awry since he doesn't have their phone numbers. The film doesn't have a single protagonist, but the four important characters who share much of the screen time are all memorable, if not endearing. All the people involved are well-rounded, making them seem extremely close to real-life. Macy the Underrated is just splendid as the depressed and economically challenged Jerry. He isn't a bad guy, but is more simply a case of good guys resorting to unethical tactics due to desperation. A single scene where Jerry tries removing frozen ice from his car's windshield after a disappointing meeting illustrates the above mentioned fact; he isn't evil, just frustrated. Being a common man compelled to do wicked stuff, you pity him despite secretly laughing at his misery.The two criminals are a study in contrast. Carl pretends to be the gregarious cool-guy who thinks he has everything in control, even if he knows things are going way out of hand. He does things that Gaear doesn't appreciate, like talk a lot, which makes him a classic case of the proverbial barking dogs seldom bite. Gaear is usually silent, but he proves to be the deadly when it comes to it. Despite being the brooding one, he makes many of the dangerous decisions that have to be made, like cold-bloodedly killing a cop followed by chasing down two kids who saw him kill the cop and shooting them too. A moment where their television doesn't work and their differing reactions perfectly highlights the stark difference between Carl and Gaear. The latter seems to be inspired from Sal in Dog Day Afternoon and it's only towards the end that you realize just how disturbed he is. While the policewoman, Marge Gunderson, and her yet unborn baby barely look like a match for these demented men, she does have the benefit of intelligence on her side. Unlike the others, she doesn't believe in complicating things and with a clever combination of reason and deduction is able to take them on quite easily. Yet, the bulging belly doesn't give her the supercop feel, which makes her more life-like. Despite being the only woman in the midst of this chaos, McDormand carries her role of a faithful police-officer with ease, making you believe that you can trust her. She quite rightfully deserved the Academy Award for her neat performance. It is the nonchalance and the simplicity of the movie that makes it such a real-life experience; a thing the movie even boasts of being. Even the details, like the conversational dialogues and the speaking accents are paid close attention to. The actors don't exceed the precincts of their roles, the drama is not overdone, the darkness isn't depressing and the comedy comes with the flow; giving a heart-warmingly authentic feel to Fargo. The film maintains a taut pace throughout, ending in a brilliant and bloody crescendo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Idiocy Leads to Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just re-watched Fargo after not having seen it for several years, and was extremely impressed. What I had recalled as a black comedy about a crime gone badly awry is in fact a tragic and gripping story about violence, with a humane law enforcement officer as the proxy for the audience. The parallels with No Country for Old Men are clear, reinforcing my view that while the Coens have a definite facility for comedy, they are at their best with drama.Much of the confusion about the genre of this film stems from its setting in the rural upper Midwest. Many assume that the accents must surely be an over-broad conceit, an example of the Coens condescending to characters they consider their intellectual and aesthetic inferiors. This is quite incorrect--the Coens are setting their tale in a very specific setting, and the comedy stems from the distinctive mannerisms and speech of that setting. The descendants of Scandinavians who came to this region to farm and who continue to live in rural isolation really DO speak very much like the characters of Fargo. The "ya sure, you betcha" twang of Sarah Palin reflects the same influence: Wasilla, Alaska was mainly settled by the same descendants of rural Scandinavians that inhabit this film.Fargo moves briskly--the opening scene sets into action the hare-brained scheme that will lead to all the tragic events to follow. William H. Macy's character, Lundegaard, is meeting two strangers to arrange for them to kidnap his own wife. Desperate for money--he's been embezzling from the GM dealership owned by his disdainful father-in-law where he is manager of sales--he's entrusting this dangerous scheme to two men he's never met. What follows is disastrous for all involved--the kidnappers, the woman abducted, an unlucky trooper making a traffic stop, two random motorists, Lundegaard, his father-in-law, a parking lot attendant.The emotional center of the film is the pregnant chief of police of tiny Brainerd, Marge Gusfatson, and her husband. Beautifully played by Frances McDormand in an Oscar winning performance, Marge gamely investigates the trio of murders that occur shortly after the kidnapping and eventually, with a little luck and a great deal of pluck, solves the case. A consistent rock of good sense and kindness, Marge embodies the best aspects of her culture, in stark contrast to Lundegaard, who is nervous self-interest and foolishness personified, and even more stark contrast to the kidnappers, who embody violence and greed, all in pursuit of 'just a little bit of money.' The script, acting, directing, cinematography, music, and sets of Fargo are all top-notch. This is film-making of the highest quality, the sparse landscape and wintry terrain perfectly reflecting the bleak reality of the consequences of violence. No Country for Old Men is in many ways a companion piece--the searing sun and bleak Texas landscape is just as forbidding as the snowy landscapes of Fargo, and both films accurately depict how greed can lead to dangerously bad decisions, which in turn can have deadly consequences for both participants and innocents. Fargo is a tragedy, a modern American Shakespeare, where base motivations--greed for "just a little bit of money"--can have vast unforeseen and evil ripple effects across entire communities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You should see the other guy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A+ One film that everyone must surely see at some point in their life is "Fargo". Far from a loud action movie while retaining the aspects of a crime thriller, it is above anything a black comedy film. The storyline is based as many know on an actual murder case, and yet the writing has this irresistible off-beat comedic dialogue throughout. Most of the humor is unexpected, coming at times when you least think it. The Coen Brothers have an un-dismissible knack for story and character writing that shakes things up.The incredible ensemble cast takes that screenplay and turns it into gold. William H. Macy is perfect as the quirky, shrewd schemer Jerry. The way he does it makes you feel sympathetic for his character at times, seeing as everyone just tosses him aside without a second thought. Peter Stormare spent most of the movie silent yet one could easily tell the character was a mad just because of that. Frances McDormand was pretty damn awesome as our main protagonist Marge, who maintains her composure no matter what she sees. With this film, it puts her on the list of great female roles, along the likes of bitch and Weaver. But even second to that, in my opinion, is Steve Buscemi, the "funny looking" guy. He's in such sharp contrast to his partner that it easily makes it one of the most memorable crime partnerships ever; even if for infamous reasons.Going back to the story, it just twists and turns but you hardly notice it till near the climax. By then you realize the plan has fallen apart and that in effect all hell has broken loose. The photography by Roger Deakins also what help keeps the camera work subtle and you really are inclined to pay attention. Adding to all that is an awesome score by Carter Burwell that keeps the mood of the film constant. "Fargo" is an undeniable classic</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before last night, I had only seen certain parts of "Fargo", specifically the rather disturbing scene where Marge stumbles upon Gaear disposing of his late partner, Carl. I always thought that was pretty freakin' cool. But I never really had much motivation to watch the entire film... until last night. Once I put the movie in, my eyes were glued to the TV. The movie is so well made, I might even go as far as to call it perfect! The setting was amazing. I really enjoyed the scenes with the white outs, especially, strangely enough, the opening credits. And not to mention the acting was impeccable. Frances did a near-perfect performance as the caring and just Marge. And Peter Storemare was really, really disturbing as Gaear. In general, though, this movie is perfect. I could go on and on how the plot was very clever, the writing was simply fantastic, and how it is probably my favorite American thriller yet. I recommend this film wholeheartedly to everyone who wants to see a creepy, stylish dark comedy about disaster in the mid-west, a man hiring kidnappers to kidnap his own wife, and a pregnant cop who is much more than your average police officer. TEN OUT OF TEN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coen Brothers' Crowning Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not enamored of all of the Coen brothers' oeuvre: RAISING ARIZONA was fun; THE HUDSUCKER PROXY left me cold; so did BARTON FINK. So I wasn't a huge fan. I was, however, fascinated with Frances McDormand (I forget where I first saw her) at the time when FARGO was released, so I went to see it mostly because of her.When I left the theatre I was sure that McDormand was going to win the Oscar and that the picture would too (I turned out to be right about McDormand; the movie unaccountably lost to the major bore THE English PATIENT). For what I saw that evening was a true original: the best combination of tragic drama and uproarious comedy I have ever seen put on film.We begin with Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy in another of his truly great performances), a nervous, twitchy little man who works at his father-in-law's car dealership. His father-in-law (hissingly played by Harve Presnell) views him with a contempt he does not bother to conceal.Jerry is in some sort of unspecified financial trouble, and an attempt to borrow money from "Dad" predictably fails, so he comes up with a bizarre plot to have his wife kidnapped to extort the ransom money from the old man.Jerry enlists the help of a couple of ex-cons referred to him by yet another ex-con. Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), two of the most inept crooks in all of Minnesota, are the "help" enlisted by Jerry through his mechanic acquaintance Shep Proudfoot (Steven Reevis), who is himself an ex-con.To be brief, things start to fall apart right from the get-go. Father-in-law unexpectedly agrees to the loan he had previously refused, so Jerry makes several abortive attempts to head off the kidnappers, but it is too late. The crime is afoot and Jerry's wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) has already been kidnapped. And in the process, the blundering kidnappers murder a pair of witnesses and a State Trooper.Enter Police Chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand). When we first see her, she is asleep in bed beside her loving husband Norm (John Carroll Lynch), and is awakened by the telephone with news of the discovery of the bodies. As she sits up in bed, we see that she is hugely pregnant. Norm, a devoted spouse, won't let her leave without breakfast, which he cooks for her. Then she puts on her gear and waddles out to her patrol car, to find that the battery is dead ("Norm, prowler needs a jump!") Indefatigable and determinedly cheery and polite, yet every inch a Chief of Police, Marge is at once the nice lady next door about to have her first baby and a formidable cop with great powers of observation and a sixth sense that kicks in just when she needs it.I am not going to reveal any more of the plot. This movie is a true original. It is bloody, there is a lot of violence, the two kidnappers are as depraved as they are incompetent, and there is a lot of death. But there are also a LOT of laughs, especially if you happen to be of Scandinavian descent. I grew up with people who talked just like some of the people in this movie, and to hear that cadence again made me giggle like a schoolgirl even when the dialogue was deadly serious.The entire cast is perfection, but at the end of the day this is McDormand's film, and she deservedly won the Oscar for it. Which is quite an accomplishment considering that, though Marge is the female lead, she does not appear until thirty-three minutes into the film.This is one of those movies that is in a class by itself. Its greatness lies in the fact that you can't categorize it.</fullReview>

Ultimately the blend of Minnesota Personalities and murder commentary, added with a moral value at the end to make it more morally correct add up to make a modern classic.

He expects everything to go according to the plan. But of course there will be many mishaps.The acting is very good. I was annoyed with William H. Macy's character. I wanted to punch him in the face. I guess thats how we are supposed to feel though. Frances McDormand is fantastic as the cop trying to settle the case. I love Steve Buscemi.

		<fullReview>Rating: 8/10Fargo follows the story of Jerry Lundegaard who Jerry works in his father in law's car dealership company and has gotten himself in financial problems. He hires two henchmen to kidnap his own wife with hopes of his father in law paying off the ransom. While a pregnant police officer, Marge Gunderson, tries to find out the person behind this bloodshed.I enjoyed Fargo. It was well written, well acted and well directed. From the moment the film starts and the score kicks in, you just know you are in for a chilling and relaxed drama/thriller. The film moves slowly and carefully introduces us the characters and the storyline. As the film progresses, it becomes more intense and intense.Everyone did great in the acting department especially Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson, and William H. Macy. Steve Buscemi also did a great job as the funny looking tempered henchman along with his quiet but brutal partner, Gaear, played by Peter Stormare. Everyone nailed their roles in this film. They nailed the mannerisms, facial expressions, and especially the accent. I don't know if the accent is right in this film, but it certainly is interesting to hear and even funny at times.As I said earlier, I enjoyed Fargo. I think it was a well made film. But there was really nothing special about it. Yes, everything was great; the script and direction by the Coen brothers and the acting. But nothing stood out. When the climax of the film kicked in, I was at the edge of my seat. I didn't want the pregnant police officer to die. I was really curious how the film is going to play out. But between that climax and the last scene, the film lost my interest somewhere somehow. It just gave me a MEH feeling as the credits start rolling. I was not disappointed at the film. I thought it was a well put together film. But it didn't really have an impact on me. I don't understand the point of this movie. Everything just seems DULL. Don't get me wrong, I think the screenplay by the Coen brothers is incredibly well written. They created one of the likable and memorable characters of all time including Marge Gunderseon and jerry Lundegaard. The film has a good story, climax, and a somewhat disappointed ending. The last 5-10 minutes or so just didn't do it for me. However, if the ending was improved, I doubt I would have liked it any better.Maybe this is the type of film that grows on you. It might improve upon a second viewing. But as of now, the film is just MEH. I don't understand why people like this film so much and regard it as a masterpiece. Yes it's well acted, directed, and written. And that's about it. Nothing special. I didn't particularly love this movie and I still liked it. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I think it's a well crafted film that I hope will grow on me upon a second viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo (1996) - Personal Matters! You Betcha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers have brought us another story filled with blood and guts. "Fargo" is the story of a deal gone wrong involving cops, money, and an unexpected triple homicide. Now this movie is like a two-part plot involving two different stories, and both reaches together to make one full story. Joel Coen and Ethan Coen has created a script, that only they can write. They really know how to make the 'dark and bloody', and help hide it with some drama, and some comedy. Also, the well-provided cast of Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Harve Pressnell, and Peter Stormare is one of the best casting ensembles I have ever seen on film. But it was McDormand that took the screen away with her excellent performance as a pregnant cop, undercover of the triple homicide. Every single moment with McDormand made me laugh, and she really is a great actress. Everything about the Coen Brothers and how they make movies is just so unique. They know how to create memorable characters, quirky dialouge, dark qualities, and fresh laugh-out-loud one-liners. The dark comedy is top-notch, the well-written script is exhilarating, and a mix of Coen Brothers dark magic is all that's needed to create one of the most incredible dark movies ever. "Fargo", in my review, "a wicked and thrilling motion picture, the Coens at their finest".</fullReview>

Although the credits for Fargo state that the film is loosely based on real events, the story is entirely fictional, the claim being just an ironic jibe on the part of the Coens.i was waiting for the day i will watch this movie. everyone loves this movie and talks so great things about it. and that was not the only reason, Coen Brothers, yes they are genius. well this movie was praised all over by Critics. and it is a audience favorite too.

		<shortDescription>The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a quick-glance subtitle at the start of Fargo that says the film is based on a true story. What a smart prank by the sneaky Coens. Never trust 'em brothers, for Fargo is a tale that borders on the near incredulous. Made in 1996 on a shoestring budget with a small cast of effective performers, Fargo is often considered by critics to be the quintessential Coen film ? quirky, odd, violent and darkly amusing. Despite having their films financed by major distributors, the Coens have all these years remained a truly independent unit, always finding themselves a corner in the sandbox where they have full liberty to build their dream sandcastle. I feel that Fargo is slightly overrated; heck it is not even as good as No Country For Old Men, their recent Oscar-winning triumph. However, Fargo has some of the best acting performances in a Coen film, especially from William H. Macy (Jerry) and Frances McDormand (Marge). Jerry and Marge are two characters that have personalities that are polar opposites of each other. Jerry is a fumbling, nervous, dim-witted salesman who has a huge money problem; on the other hand, Marge is a persevering, quick-thinking, and calm pregnant police chief who stumbles upon one of the strangest kidnapping-murder cases ever seen this side of Minnesota. Despite the outstanding displays, the characters seem distant and we do not care whether they live or die. For once, the Coens focused too much on creating the perfect setting, the perfect story, thus neglecting the importance of giving emotional value to the characters they have written. These flaws of Fargo are somewhat covered by the same thing that covers the landscape of Minnesota - heavy snow. The cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins is the most striking aspect of Fargo. Building frame after frame of long, composed takes of spreads of white, he manages to bring a sense of gloom to the mood of the film. The genius of the Coens is their ability to fuse strong, uncompromising violence with moments of dark humor. We see that in No Country For Old Men, but it is in Fargo where they actually perfected this macabre formula. Fargo is good, but not great. It is the kind of film that will get better with repeated viewings. Well, ain't all Coen pictures? But for the originality of their screenplay, and their obsession to make the perfect police thriller, darn tootin', I will salute the Coens.

		<shortDescription>It's all about the Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw Fargo a few years ago i wasn't as convinced , as most , of how good this film was. Since then , The Coen Brothers films have grown on me. After watching this again it has certainly gone up in my estimation although i still think it's far from perfect. Without a doubt , the best thing about Fargo is the characters . William H Macey , Steve Buscemi and especially Frances McDormand make Fargo the interesting film that it is. I love the way Marge Gunderson acts as if she's so slow , yet it's just the way people are in that part of the country and in fact she's far from stupid. William H Macey plays a man so caught up in debt that he tries to have he's wife kidnapped so he can share the ransom and needless to say things go wrong very quickly. He's perfect for the role of a man in trouble as he is in one of favourite films , Boogie Nights. This is not the best Coen Brothers movie but it certainly a memorable one and it's a film i appreciate a whole lot more than i did when i first saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ya Darn Tootin'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'd like to weigh in with my thoughts on the Mike Yanagita scene. This is possibly my favourite scene in the whole movie (amongst several classic unforgettable scenes). It's funny enough when you first watch it, even though you find yourself feeling guilty about laughing. What IS funny about someone's wife dying from leukaemia exactly? The more you try and suppress your laughter, the harder you start to guffaw. I believe the Coen brothers wanted people to laugh guiltily at this poor chap breaking down.It's even funnier when you realise later that Mike never in fact married the woman, she never died from leukaemia and the whole thing was some sort of creepy fantasy of his.I don't really believe there is a deeper meaning behind this scene in terms of plot development or changing Marge's motivation, though I do accept it gets her scratching her head at how nice people can barefaced lie (or deceive themselves). I just think its a wacky piece of black humour, a set-piece slightly on a tangent but very very funny and therefore worthy of inclusion in the film. Does EVERYTHING in a movie have to be directly part of a linear plot line? Is there no room for random vignettes simply included to add to the atmosphere and entertainment value? The quirkiness of the Yanagita scene leads me onto my next observation about "Fargo": Marge is the natural successor to my hero Lt Columbo (who I have reviewed several times on IMDb). When she first checks out the car wreck, in between barfing and drinking her coffee, Marge's style of deductive police work is pure Columbo. When she interrogates people, it's with the same "dumb friendly" schtick Columbo uses. Not that she's a one-dimensional copy of the Columbo character, far from it, just cut from the same cloth. Works for me!Everyone in this film, every piece of dialogue, every snowy scene, every "ya" just works somehow. It would be much easier to analyse what's wrong with a movie than what's right, but in this case I find very little to criticise. The acting all round is stupendous. I actually rewatched "Reservoir Dogs" after this, so impressed with Steve Buscemi's acting that I wanted to see more of him. For the first time ever, I felt disappointed with "Reservoir Dogs", a film I normally love. Watching it back to back with "Fargo" revealed the superiority of the Coen brothers' movie to Tarantino's (still a great film don't get me wrong).There are so many little touches that make this movie entertaining: the appalling muzak at the cafeteria; Carl's hilariously ill-at-ease facial expressions under the glare of the traffic cop's torchlight; Jerry "co-operating" with Marge, before getting carted out of his own house in his underwear, screaming like a baby; and all the peripheral but memorable, eccentric characters like the waitress at the diner, the escort girl at the Feliciano show with Carl and the "pathetic piece of (whatever)" parking attendant etc. Shep also plays his part excellently.Just absolutely chock-full of great scenes, I actually watched Fargo three times yesterday and didn't get sick of it once. I feel like watching it again! And this is not because of hype or a feeling that I'm "supposed" to like this movie. I just do! I really feel it is something unique, not the most upfront, dramatic movie of all time, not a movie with a great profound message, just a lovable slice-of-Minnesotan life and some very entertaining winners and losers going about their business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most bizarre and absurd films you'll ever see. For me that's a guarantee you'll love it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally breaking through into 'mainstream' audiences, the Coen Brothers skillfully woven comedy, Fargo, tells the tale of a man's desperate attempt to bring himself out of the severe financial problems he has encountered. Jerry Lundergard, played by William H. Macy, decides that the best way to fix this problem his to have his wife abducted and his father in law to pay the ransom. However, as with all Coen Films, not all goes to plan. Directly from the beginning we are made aware that Jerry's decision to hire two criminals, characterised by their lack of agreement on anything, will result in dire consequences. As the film draws to it's end, we're left with the dead bodies of Jerry's wife, her Father, a Police Officer, two witnesses and one of the two would-be criminals. For me though, it's not the story, although written beautifully by both Coens, but the performances of Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi; all three of which have yet to have been bested. Fargo tells not only of the tale and ultimate downfall of greed, but also the fantastic quirky story of Marge Olmstead-Gunderson (Frances McDormand)in her quest to both catch the two criminals and her husbands stamp interest. Surely one of the best films of the nineties if not of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowed out Crime of Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>William H Macy and Frances McDormand's strong performances carry this film based upon a true incident. This is one of the movies which established Joel &amp; Ethan Coen's reputation as film makers. While the whole crime idea by Jerry Lundgaard (Macy) is insane, the people he hires too kidnap his wife mess up everything. This goes to prove that no amount of money is worth everything.There are a couple of flaws in the understanding of the plot. I really do not understand why Jerry (Macy) needs to score all that money. A scene that doesn't make sense is when Jerry arrives home to find his wife missing, he carries the groceries all the way to the second floor when the kitchen is one the first floor.One more thing is I wonder if it is true that a character buries most of the $1 million in a open snow drift, if the money is still out there as there is no indication in the film that anyone has found it. Still the movie plays well &amp; tell the whole story well. It is sort of a prelude to the later No Country For Old Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one the most original movies of the 90s. The Coen Brothers do a excellent job in making this film.The acting is very clever. The plot is so original. I love how the story is so simple. It starts off as a simple non violent kidnapping that goes completely wrong. Jerry Lundegard works for a car dealership with his father in law and is an need of money for financial problems. So he hires two small time criminals to kidnapped his wife so his father in law can pay the ransom. Fargo is an excellent film and I highly recommend this movie to those that haven't seen it. It is filled with action.It is filled with suspense.It is also filled with some humor. Fargo is one of those types of movies that they don't make anymore. I give it a big thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama filled with a of comedy..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie Fargo, the character Jerry ends up in debt and set up a kidnapping of his wife, so that her father can pay a ransom. What he didn't expect was that the two kidnappers Carl and Gaear were going to kill a several people. The theme of the movie I would say is that a crime gone badly. The kidnap was supposed to be the clean cut and no one was supposed to be hurt. By the end of the film people were killed and no one ended up with the ransom money as planned. The kidnap was a disaster from the beginning, when Carl and Gaear met up with Jerry he showed up late at the bar and they were upset. Then when they went to kidnap Jean, she ended up knocking herself out by getting wrapped in a shower curtain and falling down the stairs. After that it goes from bad to worse, they have to kill a highway patrol and an innocent person who just happen to be riding by. The movie was filled with drama but also comical, because of some of the events that took place. Like Jean getting wrapped in the shower curtain, the investigating sheriff Marge being pregnant and also Marge's voice seem so high pitch and nonchalant. Another comical scene was when she met her friend Mike in the restaurant for lunch, that scene was funny to me but I didn't understand how it related to the film at all. The lighting in the film was very mild; although it was winter and there was white snow outside it was still a cloud look throughout the film. There weren't any bright moments in the film they were always a dim look in the scenes. The light wasn't bright most like to make the plot of the crime look more interesting and unexcited. I think if there would have been bright lighting in the film it would have gave the audience the same effect as with the dim lighting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start out and say that I don't like that at the beginning you get this impression that the story is true (I didn't get the privilege of knowing otherwise before watching it) only to find out that, well it's fiction stringed together from a few events, but fiction made from inspiration, nevertheless. I admit that boiled me a bit. I think they could have gone about it a different way other than being so misleading, but I'm sure if they re-did this film they might agree they could have done that better.Now, about the film. I feel knowing that it's not more non-fiction that it ruins it a bit. I was left gullible before knowing that thinking "Wow, this is so unbelievable that this happened...wow...really?" So, when I look back at it knowing that's not true, well I feel like the gore is now unnecessary. If it happened it adds astonishment that such a crime was committed, but... if it's somewhat improved from events the astonishment of that is gone. You're left with some excessive gore.The acting was marvelous, but it meandered a bit in the beginning. A bit overrated, but not a bad film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heck Ya Mean?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo opens with the message that it is "based on a true story," and closes with a retraction that its "persons and events" are fictional. "True story" is a joshing dramatic contraption, obliquely causing us to accept certain elements we might not normally accept so easily. Regardless, Fargo is concordant with the intonations and distinctions of modern small-town life. When Chief Marge Gunderson stands at the first crime scene and counts three dead bodies, she accurately recognizes that the culprits are not from Brainerd. Endeavoring into the city on her inquest, she asks a friend for a tip on a good place to eat, and is guided to the Radisson buffet. Jerry Lundegaard is as boxed in by his sales manager's job and his cruel father-in-law as any inmate in a jail cell. He's shuffling a stolen car and a double fraud. His son hurtles off from the dinner table to meet his friends at McDonald's. His wife toils manically at every domestic chore, chopping, stirring and knitting with as much rapidity as she's capable of. Against these homegrown nuances, the crimes protrude as brutal and barbaric. There are unpleasant parts. Everyone recalls the scene with the wood-chipper. More cold-blooded is the scene where the poor hostage, blindfolded and barefoot, attempts to escape on foot in the snow, and Carl Showalter makes fun of her. There are also the shootings, callous and abrupt. Against this Chief Marge, seven months pregnant, applies cozy small-town buoyancy as a way of ferreting privileged info out of crooks.Our introduction to Marge comes far into this atmospheric and genre-less film. The crime aspects are at this point engaged. We've met Jerry, the auto sales executive with a ridiculous scheme. We've met Carl and his laconic, merciless accomplice, both memorably played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who have settled for it. These are eccentric, off-kilter, incomparable characters, yet when things lose control and Marge and her husband Norm are presented is when the movie unearths its heart. Marge Gunderson is one of a sprinkling of characters whose names always abide in our recollections, like Travis Bickle, HAL 9000, Walter White. They are totally, daringly themselves in stories that rely upon exactly who they are. Lacking all the fetishistic glamour of other Hollywood policewomen, Marge is the chief in Brainerd, Minn., continues to have periods of morning sickness, inhales all the processed, frozen, prepackaged, canned food she can get her hands on, speaks in a Minnesota dialect where "yeah," pronounced "ya," is showered like a motto. She's a born cop, really sharp. Although one might find the lack of response by the State Police to the murder of one of their own highly questionable, at the crime scene local police chief Marge nevertheless promptly and efficiently deduces what occurred, and discerns there were two killers, one big, one small. Her partner, not so nimble, doesn't catch on that "DLR" signifies a dealer plate: "I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work there, Lou." There is a scene some people seem to think baffling between Marge's first and second interviews with Jerry, when she has dinner with a high school classmate Mike Yanagita. It's a disquieting hiatus that, when it comes to motif---a forlorn guy lying hysterically, failing to mask his anxiety---weighs in as pivotal. Mike functions as an echo of Jerry, and the dinner scene works like the connector between Marge's first and second interviews with him. The next morning, she is about to revisit Brainerd when a high school girlfriend tells her that everything Mike said was a lie. That's the alarm bell that compels her back to Jerry, and is somehow superior to the recourse, a single interview with Jerry that just swelters him out.William H. Macy's performance is a cave-in of dread and agitation. Here is a man who just wants one thing: a $750,000 loan from his affluent father-in-law, so he can purchase parking lots and make some of his own money. His office's vertical blinds are used visually like prison bars. If he can steal the money, he can buy the lots. Yes, his wife will have to be abducted, but he'll have to be big about that. He knows nothing about the kidnappers, and lawyers are hounding him all day for data that would reveal the missing car. And there's Marge, sitting across his desk, bright and sprightly, asking him questions he cannot answer. Macy wilts, his smirking grin a cringe, his restraint like a nerve clasp, and things cram him further in.The snow and cold endow the Coens with cinematic reference marks and an inescapable feeling of location. The opening shot fades in to Jerry's desolate venture to transfer the car with a haunting folksy Carter Burwell score. High-angle shots reveal two frosted parking lots, which the Buscemi character curiously decides to boost license plates and make a ransom exchange. When Jerry struggles to satisfy a discontented client, the goofy man and his wife have their goose-down coats amusingly heaped in their laps. The frost and gloom oppress everything, and in the middle, in their snug envelope, are Chief Marge and Norm. The Coens have been said to gibe their characters, but their affinity for Marge generates the healing power of Fargo. Marge is the spark plug, alleviating grief and mending law and order. As a result, this might be the warmest film the brothers have so far made, and no less exceedingly ripe and uniquely engrossing than their other works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting in this movie was almost mocking the Minnesota accent at first but at the end of the movie, you realize the simplicity of their lifestyle is critical to the impact of the story. It adds drama and creates a more violent story line. There was symbolism in the life of the police woman versus her job. she seemed able to to separate her personal emotions from the crime and bloodshed, however in the end we see that it does finally effect her. This movie also shows how things in life cannot be planned and life has a way of not following the original path one sets out. I think this movie was trying to emphasize that life is short and unpredictable and we have to make the most of the simple pleasures and people in our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coens blend their dark comedy routine into this murder story and create an instant classic. The shock and awe of one particular scene is lost on me because I saw this film years after it's release and knew about it before hand. Yet it still had an impact on me.Steve Buscemi is perfect as the 'funny looking fella' who never shuts up (which is why he is constantly told to shut up by Walter in The Big Lebowski) and the counterpart of Peter Stomare is chilling. When the kidnap the wife, it works in both comedy and terror.William H. Macy plays the loser who comes up with this so called brilliant plan, but it never goes his way. People say when you write a script, you throw your character in a tree and while up there throw rocks at him. At the end you let him down, but with Fargo, Macy stays up there. He takes a beating in this film and nothing works out for him.The script is written with a sense of irony. It is a serious crime drama and the Coen's sprinkle of comedy throughout. The film is brilliant in a way. Specifically when we see Buscemi walk up the backyard steps of the house he's about to break into while the wife just sits there watching him speechless. It's not until he literally breaks the glass that she screams and runs away. Funny and entertaining stuff, it works so well in this film.I'm upset I didn't see this one sooner then I did and that I wasn't a fan the first time around. The film shows the talent of the Coens and their ability to create something that will b e remembered years from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Coens' Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I imagine popular opinion now holds that "No Country for Old Men" is the best Coen brothers movie ever made, but for me this 1996 crime thriller will live on as their masterpiece.The Coens have always had trouble integrating their warped sense of humor into their films, and too often they tip the balance over into the grotesque. But in "Fargo," they for once strike the perfect balance between the macabre and the absurd, and though laughs abound, the film never lets us forget the seriousness at the film's center.The plot revolves around a money scheme gone badly awry, but the scheme itself doesn't matter. The Coens are more interested in watching what can happen to a bunch of ordinary Joes when money lust is involved. Anchoring the film with a beautiful performance is Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge, whose country bumpkin accent and demeanor belies the sharp acuity of her investigative skills. The Coens are frequently mean and snide to their own characters, as if they're making movies about people who they feel superior to, but Marge is one of their most fully-realized and warmly human creations. She's the lioness protecting not only her cub but everyone else's cub as well, and the fact that she goes about her job with a smile and a friendly "hello" doesn't make her any less ferocious.I love the film's final scene, in which Marge and her husband watch the evening news, both without actually speaking the words asking the other just what kind of world they're bringing their unborn child into.Grade: A+</fullReview>

There's no bluff, no bravado in McDormand's High Planes snow-drifter police chief, just the James Webb facts, ma'am.In perhaps the greatest anti-climatic scene in late 20th century cinema, McDormand' chief discovers the bad guy disposing of his buddy (Steve Buscemi) in a stump grinder. When he tries to flee across the frozen lake, she drops him with one shot (to the right thigh) from her .357 mag service revolver.This is not a classic shoot-em-up but it is the ultimate put-em-down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still think Fargo is the Coen brothers' crown and glory, even after seeing some of their more popular films such as The Big Lebowski and Millers Crossing; not to mention recent best picture winner No Country for Old Men. Such a film can be revisited and enjoyed every now and then, delivering a powerful experience revolving around some pretty desperate characters in a location ice cold and seemingly cut off from the rest of the world.One of the many reasons I frequently revisit Fargo is its attention to detail and the manner in which it comes across as an art film. There is so much going on both on and below the surface in the film and yet it doesn't need to bash you over the head with vast visuals in order to tell you this. On the surface, Fargo is a very quaint and slow burning crime drama revolving around an organised kidnapping and a ransom deal that goes awry. The film is one of few that I suppose comes to near perfection, in most every aspect of film-making. The cinematography, the screenplay, the intensity of some characters and the quirkiness of others, the attention to each character as an individual different to everyone else and the tiny things like the attention to sound that compliments the visuals.I said the location was cold and felt cut off from the rest of the world. In essence, most of the characters are like this. They are self obsessed and do not stop to think about others until it is too late, the incidence that demonstrates this is when events instigator Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) sits in his house's hallway and contemplates how everything got to the level of awfulness it's now at in the film. Other characters are victims; others are phoney aggressors that mutate into real aggressors and others are innocents tragically caught up in the middle.The film is about pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand) as she attempts to piece together what happened following the shooting of a state trooper after he pulled over a car. This event is connected to the arranged kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Rudrüd) by her husband Jerry so that he can quench his thirst for greed and automatically inherit a lot of money from his super-rich father in law. The shooting of the trooper is a significant event; it sparks a change in both genre and focus, shifting the perspective from Jerry and his criminal buddies to Marge and her quest to just figure things out for herself. The film carries its crime related establishment over into a detective strand, but maintains enough of a focus on both to deliver a riveting and harrowing tale.The film begins with Jerry meeting both Carl Showalter (Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare) at a bar, again in the middle of nowhere. He lends them a car and gives them the heads up on the plan; he is also very late for his appointment which could be seen as a pre-cursor to the string of badly timed and miss-matched events that follow. It is one man's desperation and greed that signals the chaos and Jerry is that man. "It was a mix up, I guess" says Jerry; one of many more to come.It's easy to just sit and watch in awe when viewing Fargo, even on a repeated viewing. The Coens pay specific attention to the crime genre but also to comedy, black comedy, best seen when Jean is in the process of being kidnapped and panics amidst the shower curtain before falling down the stairs and knocking herself out. Additionally, upon arriving at the log cabin, she panics some more and rushes around whilst bound and blind thus falling over a log and hurting herself again. It is the bizarre image of someone trapped in a shower curtain and running around in the snow with a sack on their head juxtaposed with the situation that is the kidnapping and the two kidnapper's reactions to these events.But additionally to this, the Coen brothers pay specific attention to realism. When at the night club bar, Carl tries to get the attention of a waiter who cannot hear him and walks off and it's these tiny, tiny focuses on the unnecessary that just push the film into a boundary of the brilliant, you're convinced these people may be real in real places doing real things. But to see the film is also to hear it. Witness the snow falling gently or the wind blowing minutely; the use of the television show playing as one kidnapper makes their way up the side of the house much to Jean's surprise and horror. It is the attention to sound as well as the visual that truly packs the punch which hits home with Fargo, a juxtaposition of sound and imagery as we feel the same emotions of surprise and fear etched on a character's face.I am pleased the Coen brothers have had the success they've recently been through as when they keep within in the realm of the crime or gangster genre, things usually go very well. Their branching off into comedy rarely works for me, but seems to give many others a kick so that's all well and good. But if they ever do match Fargo, and they have come close, then the spectacle will truly be one to witness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! Brings back memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in Wisconsin, and boy, do I remember those winters. Nothing but endless white as far as the eye can see. And they consider zero as pleasant weather, and as they say in the movie, "looks like it might "turn cold" tomorrow!" Like it's not already below zero!! I truly believe that they filmed this movie in the upper Mid-West. My favorite line is when Chief Gunderson has the murderer in the back of her patrol car, and she tries to talk to him. She says, "there's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that?" Then goes on to say, "and look at this... it's a beautiful day!" Only a Midwesterner could look out a window, see nothing but white snow and fog for miles around with virtually no visibility and say, "it's a beautiful day!" This is one of the reasons I moved to Nevada.I'll take the desert over those winters I suffered for 30 years anytime!!! But it still makes me a bit nostalgic for home, though. This was a great movie, a "can't miss movie" and everyone should see it. Though, the accents were a little dramatic. Nobody talks with THAT bad an accent in the Midwest, but it sure was funny! And I recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Go see it, you'll thoroughly enjoy it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is inevitably a ruined film. The directing, story and screenplay. The reason i dare not say acting is because it is, on one hand fun and indulging to watch, but on the other it is a near missed opportunity for greatness. I know the Coen brothers didn't make O brother where art Now before Fargo, but just goes to show that a good choice of actor/actresses can carry a film regardless of other elements e.g. story, directing e.t.cTo me, this is is not a classic as others are saying but a missed chance of greatness that sadly thrives for excellence but just cant reach. The acting is the only joy i had watching this, but just saying this doesn't make the film any more than average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film many people think a lot about and try to read messages from in one way or another, when it seems it was just a nice film Coen wanted to make, end of story.I liked the most of it: the woods, the winter, and with a pregnant cop(!) as the main character. Since I'm from Sweden, it was kind of cool picking up the Americanized Swedish names - Gustafson, Lundegaard and a couple of more - it gave the film a more specific, unique and not very often used location and background which was really nice.There were not so good points however. I found the dialects too thick (they might talk like that in that are, I have no idea), the character development too shallow and the worst, too many loose strings and oddities thrown in. An Asian guy makes an appearance from nowhere, doesn't contribute and then disappears. The fate of a kid is never resolved, and so on.However, the thing that really lifts the film are the actors, mainly Buscemi in his best role ever. William Macy is great too and Frances McDormand do well, if not great. Stormare has the weakest part, mainly because his character is almost mute. Not easy to work under such conditions.So in short, I'd say this is well worth seeing after all. See it not as a Hollywood but as a well done school project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very nearly a darn toot'n' classic...but not quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarantino without the fractured narrative. Fargo is the kind of film that people call "quirky", which is ironic in the light of its opening claim to being a true story ? I had my suspicions the instant it said that the events were portrayed exactly as they happened, a tall order for any film. While I think it's flawed in places, it's still an extraordinary peep into an enclosed environment; while some films like to point out small-town suburbia as a front for some seriously freaky goings on, the great strength of Fargo is that it undermines that sense of juxtaposition; it deals with life in a sleepy town and an investigation into a series of brutal murders without really presenting any major difference between them.In many thrillers setting is used to box the story in, to provide clear boundaries that provide the characters with their definitions and beyond which they cannot pass. A lot of film noir is an example of this. With the white snowdrifts of a Midwestern winter though, Fargo appears to take place in a void: it has no need of boundaries since there is nothing for it to mark, no sense of a place where here stops being here and becomes there. In some indoor shots the outside world is literally featureless, as if the entire film takes place inside a giant ping pong ball. This sense of blankness is far more isolating than any found in the kind of crime film that romanticises the idea of Mexico as a criminal's escape route, turning it into an Eden-like haven.The atmosphere of the film comes from the sense that every character in the film feels like they belong precisely there: they are so much an intrinsic part of their setting, unlike the usual stereotype of bringing in the hero from outside so that they can in effect become the audience, pointing out the place's oddities from an external perspective. Fargo gives the viewer credit for noticing this for themselves, without really having to actively reinforce the sense of place and culture. Characters are allowed to be people first and narrative devices second: they sit around repeating themselves and stating the obvious, while the camera impassively lingers on shots to record them shuffle around doing whatever it is that they do. The best illustration of the film's dynamic is its leading lady, the very ordinary Marge Gunderson (a fantastic performance by Frances McDormand), who slips between her homely personal life and her gruesome professional responsibilities so smoothly that there ceases to be any delineation between the two. Her character's slow, pregnant waddle becomes her greatest asset: she is someone so unbelievably good at her job that she has no need to actually look the part and hit all the usual marks. Hers is not a role that calls for an Ellen Ripley, and this justifies the film's endless ? and endlessly charming ? digressions here there and everywhere, which never feel like they're disrupting the plot.Perhaps it's no surprise then that the lease convincing characters are the out-of-towners, the two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) hired to kidnap a housewife (Kristin Rudrüd) so that her husband (William H. Macy) can collect a fortune in ransom money from her rich father (Harve Presnell). Carl (Buscemi) shows up the film's Tarantino influence most strongly, with his rambling monologues deliberately about nothing. However, this has a tendency to compromise the film's sense of authenticity since his dialogue is nowhere near as natural as Tarantino's; this is screen writing taken to the opposite extreme, with a character casting about for topics of conversation for little reason other than for the sake of not talking about the plot. Far more interesting is Stormare's near mute, Gaear. Carl is the brains of the pair; Gaear is not the brawn, but the will. He is the one who takes matters into his own hands to resolve a problem, but his motivations lie far deeper. While Buscemi's snippy crook is motivated fairly unambiguously by money, Gaear seems indifferent to it. He kills out of necessity, convenience, sometimes just pure whim, while other times it is genuinely impossible to imagine his reasons, making Marge's final words to him ? not understanding how he can kill people just for money ? all the more resonant.For all its charm and comedy, Fargo is a sometimes distressing film. Innocent people get killed or bereaved, and they evoke sympathy because of their relentless likability. Even Jerry (Macy) still feels like a nice guy in the face of his vile and cowardly crime, because he's so helpless and pathetic. The brutal violence is shocking in Fargo not because of its nature but because these are real characters getting killed rather than nameless meat-puppets who exist merely to provide action scenes to titillate the audience. If only the film had tighter characterisation of its lead villain, we could be looking at a classic: with that slightly weak link in place though, Fargo is merely very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can see the humor in Fargo.The characters have a quirkiness and a dialect that most would find at least a little humorous,particularly that of Marge Gunderson.They do and say things that would give you at least a slight chuckle.The American Film Institute ranks it not only in their top 100 greatest films in cinema history,but it is also in their top 100 funniest films.It has a uniqueness that I suppose qualifies it for both lists,but speaking on a personal taste level,I had trouble laughing at this film's humor due to the fact that there were so many dead bodies lying in the way.I don't argue with what the AFI calls a great film,but I just didn't connect with this film at all,and this will most likely be my first and last trip to Fargo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Hawaii 5-0 meets a blizzard and women's lib! I absolutely love Marge and Norm--their relationship is the excellent counterpoint to the Lundegaard family and a lot of American movies of the last 2 decades. America needs more films depicting couples such as the former.It's one of the few dark comedy movies I really like in that it doesn't make a mockery of the the fact of what happens to its victims but goes to other angles for the laughs--mostly the reactions of the ones discovering the bodies, the occasionally high-strung "funny looking guy" criminal helping Jerry, the accents and the food. It's MHO that one who doesn't have an appetite before turning on this movie regain it within the first 45 minutes and especially after the scene of Marge in the restaurant.What wasn't funny was Grimsrud--indeed I found him to be one of the scariest characters in recent movie history.Who was absolutely adorable was police-person Marge, smart sweet and "connecting" all things together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant film with some of the best characters of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm not sure if its my favorite work by them (that'd be "The Big Lebowski"), "Fargo" is the defining film by the Coen Brothers. Despite not featuring their trademark bizarreness as much as their other films, this is what they'll most likely be remembered for. And why not? "Fargo" is one of the most brilliantly conceived and written thrillers of all-time and completely deserved the attention it received. And while praising this can make us overlook the Coens' other achievements, it really is a masterpiece."Fargo" is a suspenseful picture, full of tension that leads up to shocking violence. However, the action isn't the reason why its so successful. Its the characters. Every one of the main characters is three dimensional and memorable. Francis McDormand plays the nicest cop ever in cinema history and received an Oscar for her work. Everyone else is equally impressive in my mind, especially William H. Macy. He plays a character whose both an idiot and a sleaze, but you end up feeling sympathy for him just because Macy is so brilliant in his portrayal. Steve Buscemi's kidnapped shares the great lines with McDormand and ends up being oddly sympathetic also. Harve Presnell is one of the most annoyingly stubborn characters ever in film and Peter Stormare is quite chilling as the psychopathic cohort of Buscemi. Like all the best films, the characters here aren't good guys or bad guys, each one is shown to have both positive and negative traits. This is a character study, and one of the finest of the decade.

		<shortDescription>Excellent independent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stars: Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare.This is what would be known as a very small movie. It takes place in very few places, has only a few main characters, and the whole movie just seemed really small, which turns out to be a good thing. You really get to know and love every character, no matter how much they have to say. The order by which the character's are introduced are quite odd, where the first 1/3rd of the film is about Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) and his wife's set-up kidnap by Carl (Buscemi) and Gaear (Stormare). The last 2/3rds are about Marge Gunderson (McDormand), a police officer, trying to solve three murders in the process of kidnapping Jerry's wife. The whole film I was glued to the screen, and when it ended, I kind of went "Oh." It's not a tricky film to follow, it doesn't have any interesting plot twists or any amazing ending, it's just a wonderfully written, directed and acted simple film, that instead of ending with a big bang shoot 'em up, ends with more of a simple and effective whimper.My rating: **** out of ****. 93 mins. Rated R for language, gory violence and some sex/nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black comedy is a one of a kind sort of film...lots of shivers along with the laughs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FARGO is a rare kind of film that has you hooked into the story of a kidnapping that goes wrong and ends in a series of gruesome murders--and at the same time, it works beautifully as a black comedy.Principal reason for the humor comes from FRANCES McDORMAND and WILLIAM H. MACY who have the pivotal roles and play them with such skill that they'll have you laughing in spite of some of the twisted plot turns and sick humor sometimes involved. You won't know whether to laugh or cry. The wood-chipper scene was gruesome enough, but there are so many dark elements running through FARGO that it borders on film noir except for the excessive amount of dark humor and color photography.The chilly Minnesota climate, the grim settings for crime, the many plot twists and turns, the uniformly excellent performances from a cast of pros, all of it is guaranteed to make you enjoy every bit of the story as it unravels and reveals some interesting tidbits about the main characters.FRANCES McDORMAND really deserved her Oscar for Marge, the methodical lady police officer with the homespun values who finds herself facing some really grim situations. And WILLIAM H. MACY delivers another one of his "everyman" roles as the ultimate bungler who can do nothing right.A one of a kind film, well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched this movie last night for free on-demand on Comcast because I had heard it was excellent. I had also seen a few clips of it on the AFI's 100 years 100 movies. I usually don't listen to the critics or other people but they were right. This is a brilliant film. It deals with a car salesman (William H. Macy) who meets with two con-men (Steve Buscemi, I don't know the other guy's name). Anyway Macy hires Buscemi and his friend to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father-in law can pay a ransom. It then leads to the con-men going to Brainerd Minnesota after they kidnap her and a local cop (Frances McDormand) tries to investigate (after she is murdered) the murders of Macy's wife and other people. There are no complaints I have about this film. It has a little too much violence and profanity but oh well. I love McDormand's brilliant Minnesotan accent! She definitely deserved an Oscar. I demand you to check on-demand if you have it and watch this. It is under the free movies section. Enjoy the show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The titles at the beginning of "Fargo" indicate that the film is based on a real murder case. The clue to whether this is true or not, I think, comes during Marge Gunderson's lunch with Mike Yanagita, a guy who attended the same high school as Margie. Mike's tale is woeful indeed ... but as we learn later, it's all an elaborate ruse. The same can be said for "Fargo," but who cares? This is one movie I can watch over and over and NEVER get tired of. I found the "Special Edition" DVD at my local grocery store for just $10 and wondered, "Is this DVD so cheap because so few people want to take a chance on this movie?"

		<fullReview>I haven't seen too many of the Coen brothers' films, in fact, the only ones I've seen apart from this one are Intolerable Cruelty and The Man Who Wasn't There. This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty. It was quite funny at some points, no doubt about that, and often it was far more funny than most other comedies... but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over. The pregnant lady eating, the locals saying 'yah', William H. Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit... I don't know, it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes, so they just repeated those they had over and over. Some of the jokes are insanely funny, though. Most of these come from Steve Buscemi. Just about every scene he's in, he steals the show. When he's not on screen, you're usually somewhat bored. One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved, and the scenes that seemed pointless. There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product, apart from making it move faster. The plot is good, original and full of clever twists. The pacing is somewhat good, but too much of the film is boring. Like I said, Buscemi saves every scene he's in, but it's often boring in scenes not involving him. The acting is good, for the most part. Frances McDormand gives a great performance. The rest of the leads are all credible. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is good, and at times great. A pretty good Coen brothers' film that could have been better. Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes, but definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of Steve Buscemi. I recommend it to fans of the Coen's, Steve Buscemi and the other principal actors. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FARGO is one of those movies you see on screen not often. The reason behind this comment is because Fargo is not those typical written true stories we see everyday. story is good in my own view but the problem is not with the acting noir their performances the problem is the reflection of characters involved in the movie. Coen brothers I must say disappointed me with they're work. I could list so many things they've done wrong. First they couldn't get in to detail with characters. We hardly new what really was going on. Story telling was bad,I think with dialogue they've tried hard to impress but did not work. 'Ja' phrase actually to me the phrase that stuck most in my mind in the whole film. This really gives you the idea that this movie is a little over rated in my opinion. Some of the articles rated this movie as the third best movie of the decade. Disappointing comment in my view. If you expect to much from a film then some of the things could hardly impress you but this film defenintly did not move me at all. Lack of character history and nothing special about characters and there relation between teach other made this film look very average. overall I can only rate this fil out of ten a 3.9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers are without doubt well known for their peculiar films but this is the first which has had more hype about it than any other. Fargo has a story as straight as they come. One kidnapped lady, Two Kidnappers, one desperate man and a policewomen with time on her hands. That's what you get with Fargo. Taking it's set in a town where it never seems to stop snowing it hasn't got a claustrophobic feel to it like I would have hoped. I honestly didn't think much of the film. The acting was spot on as was the dialogue but it didn't take me back. I can watch Fargo without flittering an eyelid and enjoy it all the same but I don't enjoy for the reasons I should. The story was good but I have a feeling it's the kind of narrative I have spotted before in a film and had nothing new to offer. This isn't The Coen Brothers best work, that title goes to Miller's Crossing, The Big Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There which are much better films with much better stories but Fargo got all the more praise when it really shouldn't have. Still this is not the worst film ever, it's just not the best which is what I was lead to believe from the hype but it still makes interesting viewing and has it's moments but I would encourage people to watch other Coen Brothers films instead of this as I don't think you'll be getting what you are looking for.</fullReview>

Having said this, I must say there were isolated performances I liked from Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormarnd.McDormand's performance as a pregnant sheriff was the only positive of the film. I have to give credit to the Coen Brothers for casting McDormand in this role. As great as McDormand was in her role, she was unable to save "Fargo" from disaster. The plot of "Fargo" seemed to go in circles without any clear explanation of what is going on in the film. When something worthwhile happened it seemed to end up at a dead end point in the film. The ending of the film was a little off-kilter as it seemed to be forced.With the talented cast and academy awards "Fargo" received, it really should have been better. I can't believe the number of people who thought "Fargo" was one of the best movies ever made was so high. If it were up to me; I would tell everyone to restrain themselves from renting this awful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>honestly what is so great about this movie... the plot is boring, the actors performances aren't anything memorable. Its slow moving... there's two moments of the movie that have any mark in my memory, the cop getting shot, and the woodchipper scene. other then that to me nothing happened. This movie sucked and I can't comprehend how so many people love it. I agree with almost every movie on this top 250 list except this one... I can't imagine what I might have missed but if you guys enjoy it more power to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's another Coen effort: better than 'Arizona', less than 'Brother'.It's a simpler send-up, reliant more on characters than circumstance, and more pedestrian than their other work.Notice their reliance on lesser actors this time and only McDormand gets decent expansion. This doesn't have them pushing any kinds of limits, certainly not compared to Gilliam.This film is unique in the Coens nature, but it doesn't have the same level of magnetism that even 'Arizona' had. Where's the charm?After their latest 'Intolerable', I hope the Coens come up with something unique.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie of the 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning:May contain spoilers.Very closely followed by Pulp Fiction, Fargo is definitely the best film of the 90s. It is the perfect mixture of comedy, drama, violence, suspence, great acting, and even greater dialogue.The story revolves around a middle-aged car salesman(William H. Macy) who makes a deal with two thugs(Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare), to kidnap his wife, in order to collect a hefty ransom from his wealthy father-in-law(Harve Presnell) to pay off all his debts. After they kidnap his wife, and have a very bloody encounter with a state trooper, on comes the pregnant police officer Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormand)to track down the criminals. As Marge gets closer, the job goes haywire, and what could've been a simple job, turns out to be a blood bath.Macy is great as afraid Jerry Lundegaard. He is the one who starts all the trouble, and causes everything. Macy was nominated for his performance, but lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. in Jerry Maguire. It's great fun to watch Macy pretend to know what he is doing even though he has no idea. Also, playing a man who is pushed off the edge of his simple life, after his boss and father-in-law, refuses to pay attention to his new business dealsSteve Buscemi gives the greatest performance of his career, playing the over the top criminal, Carl Showalter. His great performance brings life and excitement, to this otherwise stale movie. It shows that it takes a lot to bring him down(woodchipper).Frances McDormand won her only oscar for best actress, for playing police cheif Marge Gunderson. The midwest chick who'll stop at nothing to catch the criminals she's after.After the first time you see Fargo, you may not like it, but you'll find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again, until you do. It strikes you like no other movies made in the 90s did. The Coen brothers won the oscar for their amazing screenplay. This movie is a masterpiece. Out of ten stars, it gets ten, with a bullit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The winter is well portrayed, the characters insufficiently so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being Swedish, I know of winter. I have come across it in Wisconsin, too. Fargo portrays it well. The snow, the cold, the sort of pause mode it puts on life - and the human struggle to break out of it.The tempo of the film is kind of Scandinavian, and so is the acting - not only from very experienced Peter Stormare, who worked extensively with Ingmar Bergman on the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater, years ago. There's a constrained mood on all the acting, reminding me of the Bergman ideal, also making the characters quite realistic.What happens in the movie seems pretty much unavoidable, in great accordance with the drama ideal cherished by Aristotle. That is very interesting, since it's a story from real life. So life follows the laws of drama? At least when interpreted by the temperament of artists.There's a significant element of parody, too. A burlesque. What makes me hesitant, is that the balance between parody and realism is not set, not consistent. How the characters speak and react, that's close to farce, while their actions and the plot itself - that's very much realism, or naturalism, to use a concept from the art of literature.That is probably the reason for the actors not being able to sum up their characters and lead them to a proper end point. For just about all of them, when they have their last scene in the film, they are in limbo, not rooted at a point where events and their character would lead them. It's like they wait for the real ending.Well, maybe this is an epic, not a drama, but if so, it gives so much a pretense of drama, there is no room left for the epic to flourish. Nor is there sufficient room for significant characters in the story to be exposed.Another half-hour or so might have solved it. Maybe the film was too drastically treated at the cutting board.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay but too Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo was an okay film, but I will not recommend to see it twice. The acting was so believable enough that I thought that they were actually from Minnesota. On the other hand, the film is kind of predictable and you might know what kind of ending it will have just by watching half of the movie. Also, the only character that I cared about through the entire film was Marge (the policewoman) the other characters I didn't care whether they died or not, I guess that says a lot about the film. Also, I think they should have cut a few parts of the movie since they don't have anything to do with the main story; but I suppose they put it there just to be funny. I'm totally surprised that this film went up all the way to 76 in the rankings. I have to say that the plot was different and if you want to see a really good rental and its winter time do rent this, it will feel like it happened right next door, but you won't be missing much if you don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eccentric, original dark comedy that is sure to be remembered for years to come. Macy is terrific as a struggling, scheming businessman who recruits two reckless kidnappers to abduct his wealthy wife, hold her for ransom, then split the loot with him! McDormand is magnificent as a pregnant and perceptive Minnesota police chief who thinks that there may be more to the story. Brilliant, totally off-the-wall comedy/murder mystery is a perfect blend of violent action, oddball humor, and clever, insightful observations of Minnesotans. Buscemi and Stormare are a riot as bumbling, mismatched kidnappers, and the film's zany dialogue is impeccable. One of a kind, and definitely a must-see. ***?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One brilliant, original, eye-catching, hilarious, compelling piece of cinema!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got finished watching this movie in my film class. This is the first time I watched it straight-through, and I was very impressed and look forward to watching it again sometime soon. Of course, I had to view it in a somewhat intelligent, focused manner--indulging the way the cinematography and setting helps tell the story, what the props symbolize, etc.--since we're studying the movie. So I wasn't exactly kicking back on my living room couch with a glass of soda at my side, enjoying the show. Well, I did enjoy the show--a lot!--but in a somewhat analytical way. I'll start off by complimenting the acting. Frances McDormand earned a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as a pregnant police chief in this small, quiet Minnesota town. You can say this is the role that put her on the map, and I'm glad she's on the map, because she's a very talented actress. William H. Macy never ceases to please, delivering a subtle performance as a money-hungry car salesman. Just his facial expressions alone speak a million words. Steve Buscemi is absolutely hilarious as the talkative Carl. He's superb at anything he does, and I think this marks one of most memorable appearances on film. Peter Stormare is subtlely terrifying as his silent buddy. I don't think they could've picked someone with a more piercing stare than him. At moments you actually feel as if you're staring at the Angel of Death himself, he's so effective. His name escapes me at the moment, but I loved the Asian guy who played McDormand's old friend. He has one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. I remembered him as a worker for "Rolling Stone" in "Almost Famous"--also with McDormand in the cast. He really is good! The cinematography is great! It really brings out the coldness (both literally and figuratively) of the setting. The music is brilliant and haunting. The dialogue is full of zingers that film buffs will have a field day with. I heard that people from Minnesota wrote angry letters about the Coens (who were actually born and raised in the state) for making fun of the way their people talk. I know they must've exaggerated (I don't see how anybody can talk like that without laughing at themselves), but they must've used some element of truth. You know what they say: There has to be truth to every joke. I didn't think there are people in the world who can be so stoic and cheerful, even when there's a murder taking place. But one of the girls in my class said she spent some time in the Midwest, and the people there actually do behave a lot like the characters in "Fargo." Nevertheless, I couldn't help but crack up every time the word "Ya" was used. Especially in that scene where McDormand was interviewing the two hookers. I think that scene sets the record as the one with the most "Yas" used. If anybody was counting, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm sure the reputation of the people of Minnesota has changed due to this movie, and I'm sure tourists jokingly approach them with "Yas." Hey, I'm from Jersey and talk nothing like the characters in "The Sopranos," and I'm not complaining. I can take a joke. I think the extremely mild manner of the main characters (minus Buscemi and Stormare) helps create an ironic tone that contradicts the atmosphere. "Fargo" has almost anything you can ask for in a movie. It's a dark comedy, and in that department it's hilarious. In fact--keeping in mind that this was marketed as a drama/thriller--I think I got more laughs out of this film than most straight comedies I've seen. Of course, some may think you're a sadist for laughing at certain gags, but we don't always have to laugh at pleasant things, do we? It's a crime drama, and in that respect it's compelling and intriguing, with some unique twists. Not giving anything away, that wood-chipper thing--nice touch! Should you see this movie? Ya! Ya! Darn tootin'! But if you're squeamish, take a blindfold. It gets bloody at times. My score: 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like all the Coen brothers films, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like all the other Coen brothers films, this is crafted with expertise (well, at least that kind of expertise distinctive to their style) and makes for good entertainment, but -- purely aside from the artistic merits of the film -- it isn't what I consider their MOST entertaining movie. The first time I saw this, I considered it pretty good thriller-entertainment, but not as spectacular or amazing or all that extraordinary as the critics seemed to think. After the second time through, I figured the same thing. Finally, after some more cinematic maturation, I watched it a third time, and basically think the same thing.The story is based on real events (warning: I may not be particularly drawn toward movies based on real events, as they strike me as too journalistic for the medium, but that may be one of my idiosyncracies); it is particularly appropriate for a Coen brothers film because of the way the events transpire. It revolves around a real slimeball's attempt to "solve" his monetary crises by having his wife kidnapped and held for ransom, and the money then funneled back to him. Of course, what makes it all interesting is how things get increasingly screwed up and gruesome as the story goes on. The Coen brothers obviously embellish events and characters with their own quirky twists and mannerisms -- e.g., from the slimy but incompetent maneuverings of the husband, to the cheery-and-cute-but-very-smart cop (played by Frances McDormand), to the criminal duo of the whiny tactician (Steve Buscemi) and his sullen but very dangerous sidekick (Peter Stormare).It's most definitely better than the usual action/thriller/mystery flick, though that by itself doesn't say a lot. My impression is that the Coen brothers put together a film that for them was pretty "standard" but happened to hit it on with a lot of viewers and critics; they were probably as surprised at all the attention as I was. It's pretty middle-of-the-road for fans of the little genre that is the films of the Coen brothers. For Coen brothers films that I both liked a lot and regard as "distinctively Coen brothers" (come to think of it, is there any movie they've made that isn't?), I recommend _Miller's Crossing_, _Barton Fink_, _The Hudsucker Proxy_, and _The Big Lebowski_. (I am more mixed or undecided when it comes to the others, which includes _Fargo_.)All in all this means at minimum that it's well worth watching at least once, but not a "must buy." On my scale, that's a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

The story is simple and elegant, while the script is equally plain and appealing. The casting director really scored big with this one; all roles are perfect and acted out with amazing precision, especially McDormand, but then again, who didn't know that?Oh, but that's not all. The direction is compact and clean-cut, and the dark tale of a kid-napping gone wrong is oddly mixed with humor and satire, and it even makes fun of northerners accents! It works! The Burwell score is one of the most enlightening and spine-tingling of the 90s. The Roger Deakins cinematography is again, very simple but masterful. Even the run-time of the movie fits in to the other factors; the length is enjoyably short and easy to handle.You might as well buy this movie without seeing it first; you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Score ever!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Coen Brother's Fargo is somewhat of a classic, depending on the viewer. For the last five years people have been loving or hating this movie for their own reasons.Some people like it because it's gory and bloody. Some people like it because it's funny. Some people like it because it's a complex human tragedy-comedy of terrifying proportions, filled with greed, evil and decay of morals.Yes, all this makes a good movie. But what makes this such an outstanding movie is Carter Burwell's haunting music. Other reviewers on this site have omitted this, so I'm going to discuss it's effectiveness.Movie scores are a complex business. You get movies that has beautiful music, but it doesn't compliment it in any way. Some music try to be too complex, like John William's score for the Phantom Menace. Despite the main theme and "Duel of the Fates" parts most of the soundtrack is like ill conceived ballet music.Burwell's theme is slow and simple, like the Fargo itself. When the "This is a True Story" line appears you hear a solitary instrument bringing forth the tune. Then by the time they actually show the title of the movie, a full orchestra joined in. This theme explores the tragedy of "Fargo" and all who lives in the Coen's vision of the Northern USA.The orchestral part of Fargo's Soundtrack is the best ever created for a movie. Ranks right up there with Forest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic and the Original Star Wars!Fargo would have just been another independent film with a good story if it hadn't been for this great soundtrack which made this film a classic. I think there are a lot of Hollywood A-list directors crying in darkly-lit recording rooms wishing they had Fargo's main theme for their movie.Who knows? Maybe "Freddy got Fingered" might have won Best Picture if it had this score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story; done as only the Coen's could</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Fargo for the second time, having watched this film about two years ago. It seemed to me that I liked this film much more the first time. Fargo has the interesting storyline, great direction and superb acting, yet I felt that something was missing. A hA! Could it be a little bit more realism and perhaps a bit longer film.Regardless of the fact that Frances McDormand played the part very well and even won Best Actress for it, she seemed to play her character too dumb-wittedly. Margie (McDormand's character) seems to be a couple nickels short of a dime and yet manages to solve this murder mystery (albeit a really bungled up one) in what seems like record time. No sooner has she arrived on the scene, than she already knows what happened, when it happened, who was responsible and where to go from there. I've been to Minnesota and North Dakota and the people that live there are not at all like the morons that they are portrayed as in this film.The length of the movie seemed too short. If Marge had at least pursued the killers for some time, rather than stumbling upon their hideout (also too unbelievable) almost instantly, this film could have been much better. I don't like the way the Coen's wrapped up this film like they were in a hurry and needed to go somewhere.Other than these problems I really liked the film and never lost attention from it. The story is quite original and leaves you wondering just what is going to happen next. The performances are top notch, especially Steve Buscemi who is humourously always referred to as a "funny-looking-guy in some sort of general way." This film doesn't top Raising Arizona as far as I'm concerned but is still more than worthy of a rental.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Coen Brothers peak in Fargo and will probably never be able to top it again (although how I wish them to prove me wrong). Taking a guessable plot and planting it into the imposing vastness of a North Dakota-Minnesota winter and coming up with a perfect cast, impeccable timing, unforgettable score (by Carter Burwell) and a world of everyday eccentricities, Joel and Ethan Coen create a gripping dark comedy that we often fail to see beyond the local news. And this is what great movie makers are all about, showing us things our perceptions remain short of imagining as we read, hear or watch them happening around. Fargo is a movie one discovers so many delightful details in its mosaic as one watches it over and over again and one gets awed how they all fall into their places in the great jigsaw. And that, my fellow filmgoers, is what a masterpiece is all about.</fullReview>

Brilliant idea - well worth several viewings just to catch the mundane conversations (which surely struck a cord with most of us !)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is an absolutely incredible film that achieves its goal of being both side-splittingly funny and viciously violent, while at the same time getting across a meaningful message to the audience. The senslessness and selfishness of the criminal path is put across in a brilliant way through great performances by the entire cast.Frances McDormand's was a restrained performance, but one in which she WAS the charming and very pregnant sheriff of a small Minnesota city and the viewer couldn't help but love her character and find her believable and endearing. She definitely deserved her Oscar as Best Actress and I consider this one of my top-5 favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only see one other Coen movie (Raising Arizona), which I thought was really dumb and boring, so I was surprised at how much I LOVED "Fargo". The script was hilarious, the characters very entertaining, and its capture of Minnesota culture right on. The combination of grimness and humor, the juxtaposition of how different people's lives are, was just brilliant. Frances McDormand was just wonderful to watch. I have to wonder how people who have never lived in this part of the country react to this. Knowing all the local references made it very amusing and recognizable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Fargo because it was an interesting story and it shows what the Coen Bros. can do more than just comedy. It was creative in how they integrated comedy with the way that the criminal characters were really pretty sick and twisted. The characters in this are great too, how they picked actors that looked true to real life. I am a fan of all of the Coen bros. films including Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo had the potential to be one of the Coen Brothers best films. However, the ending comes so quickly and suddenly and applies little to the preceding portion of the film that it almost renders the entire experience pointless. Marge simply stumbles across the crime scene using clues which she learned early on in the film. Essentially everything between could have been cut out and the film would still have been completely logical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW this film is subtle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo took me a few viewings to really appreciate, and judging by some of the other ecstatic reactions to this film, I still don't fully "get" it. Hidden in amongst what at first seems to be merely a quirky twist on the heist gone wrong staple is what I think is a strong message about the moral fibre of today's society. Compare the money-hungry, deceitful, anti-social behaviour of the perennially miserable Macy and Buscemi to the constantly honest, happy, content and perennially cheerful nature of McDormand.Now I usually hate films that try to sell a message, but this one does it so subtly that it has an almost subliminal impact. Two scenes at the end, one with McDormand and Stormare in the Police car and the final scene in bed sum it up.Still though, it's not my favourite Coen film, that is still Millers Crossing. And I disagree with everyone here, neither McDormand OR Brenda Blethyn should have won the best actress Oscar. It should have been Emily Watson for "Breaking the Waves". So there.I give Fargo 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is one of those movies that are simply unforgettable. Coen brothers have made many good movies but Fargo is one of their biggest achievements. This movie has everything needed to make a movie interesting and compelling for the audience. The outdoor shots in this movie are simply breath taking and the landscape has been captured in a very captivating manner. Strong performances by most of the characters is also one of the big strengths of this movie and the music certainly enhances the overall impact and appeal. The best thing about Fargo is that one can see this movie more than once without feeling impatient even for a moment. This is something that can hardly be said about most of the movies.</fullReview>

Generally i like movies which scenes are laid in a cold, drear land, but although the film had some stunning scenes, it's rather dull and uninteresting, that contains incomprehensible characters without any sympathy. It's actually quite boring and overrated. Could have told a better story. There's so many other films, that has much more potential difference. I don't see the hype(?) either.

It is one of those rare films which can have you talking about it the next week. So much of the credit goes to Daniel Day-Lewis who was do devoted to his role and made his character what he was. As you watch the movie, you will start to identify the traits of his character, which may be disguised at first. In my opinion, the whole film is about this man's character. It's about what will satisfy him in the end and how cold he is. Many people will choose to ignore the meaning in movies, and if you are this kind of viewer then don't bother.

		<shortDescription>A kidnapping caper that goes criminally bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any film made by the Coen brothers is worth a look. They have that rare talent among American filmmakers where their movies speak in a singular voice, something that makes their work fresh and original, even when they utilise familiar plot lines. And in the case of Fargo, they take the standard story of a kidnapping plot, inhabit it with some extraordinarily memorable characters, and direct it to such an engaging degree it becomes a modern classic.I didn't always like Fargo. The unique and offbeat style of the Coens doesn't always lend itself easily to a storytelling narrative. And on my first viewing of Fargo, I was left very puzzled by the film. I couldn't quite grasp it, because of the way it contrasts light humour with some very black overtones. I found it to be a very overrated film.But there was something about Fargo that remained ticking in the back of my mind. And I decided to give it another whirl one night. And a funny thing happened. I really started getting into it. I found myself cracking up at the strangest things. The way it was directed impressed me, and by the end, I'd fallen in love with the film.Fargo makes use of a staple of film-making that has cropped up over the last 50 years. The kidnapping plot. But this being a Coen brothers film, you know beforehand things won't unfold in the traditional scheme of things. Kidnapping plots seldom turn out the way they're supposed to on film. Otherwise there would be no interest. But in the hands of the Coens, Fargo proceeds at such a bizarre pace, this plot goes horribly wrong in the most spectacular way imaginable. And then some.Jerry Lundegaard (a suitably loserish William H Macy) walks into a bar an hour late to meet with two lowlifes, Carl and Gaear, to discuss a proposition. He needs his wife kidnapped, who is the daughter of Jerry's boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). Jerry is on the verge of bankruptcy after an insurance swindle went bad, so he figures another swindle will get him out of this jam. Jerry will claim Carl &amp; Gaear demanded $80,000 in ransom, and when Wade pays up, Jerry takes the amount he needs to pay off his debts.But Jerry is not the sharpest pencil in the box. Since he's not a particularly good salesman, it means he's not a particularly good judge of character. Otherwise his instincts would have told him that Carl &amp; Gaear are not expert kidnappers. And when they end up killing a state trooper and two innocent passersby, its just the beginning of an escalating body count and a fiasco of monumental proportions.The first half hour carefully sets up the events. The plot. The kidnapping. The accidental murders. All set against the frigid backdrop of Fargo. Its at this point it introduces the film's best character, Marge Gunderson (a wonderful performance by Frances McDormand), the local police chief. A 7 months pregnant waddling ball of cheery chirpiness, its up to her to unravel the mystery and close the book on it.McDormand captures the attention from the second she arrives. You couldn't imagine the film without her, which is why the first 30 minutes seem like they're just waiting for her to turn up, and when she does, all of the plot strands seen beforehand finally click into place.McDormand plays Marge very deceptively. At first glance, she appears as a smalltown hick, forced to move up into the big leagues when these triple murders come her way. She gives the impression that with her Midwestern drawl she's a little slow on the uptake. And because her acting is so good, I actually bought into that. But she gradually reveals to us that her mind is as sharp as a tack. She correctly intuits the chain of events that eventually lead her back to Jerry.I love the scenes when she questions Jerry. Watch the way she fixes him with her penetrating stare, a big smile on her face that betrays none of her true emotions. Her deceptively pleasant demeanour wears down Jerry's resolve, until he's practically ready to confess everything. Sort of like Columbo. Only of the pregnant variety. Marge should get her own TV show.All of the cast give excellent performances. In a part Macy was born to play, he gives an impeccably controlled response to what is (in his mind) the perfect plan gradually unravelling around him. And Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are superb as the chalk and cheese scumbags who make a complete hash of the plan. The Coen's typical black comic approach is prevalent in their scenes. You won't forget the wood chipper scene in a hurry.The ending is a surprisingly moving one. Not to mention philosophical. And its McDormand's character who provides that emotional key at the end. She sums up the entirety of the plot in just a few sentences, that really left me breathless. Fargo is by far the Coen brothers most intelligent and well rounded work. Its not often that you can call a film that clocks in at 90 minutes a modern classic. Fargo is such a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tremendously entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical.McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays "Margie" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her. The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, "I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv." She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. "Oooh" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. "That's a good one," says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head. The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is possibly the most sincere film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not the most realistic criminal romp ever carved out, but there is an underlying and even fundamental sincerity in its gallery of supporting characters and in the fumbling folksiness with which they interact in the chilly north of Minnesota. 'Fargo' is the reason Roger Ebert loves movies so much. Although I do not share his same gushing love for the film ? or indeed, for the Coens ? 'Fargo' is so well-written, well-acted, well-executed and well-condensed that I find no tangible reason for why I should not feel this way about it.The title 'Fargo', much like its story, is misplaced. It briefly opens in Fargo, North Dakota but soon plunges into the barren, frigid smalltown of Brainerd in Minnesota, capturing the chill atmosphere of the setting with effortless conviction, probably because the Coens grew up in these North woods. Here Joel Coen directs and Ethan produces, but with deft, personal pen strokes by the both of them. They apply the same meticulous familiarity to their characters with Frances McDormand and William H. Macy in the front row, two smalltown people so heartwrenchingly sincere they completely carry the film.William H. Macy is a push-over car-salesman with financial difficulties who resorts to hiring two sleazeball, violent but fumbling criminals to kidnap his wife to blackmail his domineering father-in-law. A talkative, neurotic and "funny-looking" Steve Buscemi and a hard-edged, strong-silent-type Peter Stormare (my country's finest export, for sure) botch their way through this kidnapping heist, killing three people in the process, which raises the stakes and sets Frances McDormand's tough (and 7-months pregnant) cop character Marge after them. She is an apt and no-nonsense chief, and one hell of a genuine, likable and cheerful character ? quite possibly the best role written for a woman ? rightfully earning her an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.Macy was also nominated as Best Supporting Actor and it is a crime he did not win it. Here is a pathetic and realistic middle-aged small-town car sales executive, under the thumb of his father-in-law and desperate for a little bit of money to gain some dignity. Macy's performance as Jerry Lundegaard is unspeakably emotive and had the Coens chose to, he could have carried Fargo all the way to the end by himself. As it is, there is no need for it. The Scandinavian names all ring true to me (as a Swede) and the local jargon is pleasantly peppered with "oh jeez", "dern tootin'", "ya", "you betcha" and "d'heck do you mean?". This is the Coens in their own element.'Fargo' is a black comedy but it is never laugh-out-loud worthy, except in one of the early scenes in which a shocked Steven Buscemi exclaims "Oh daddy!" after Stormare has killed a cop in the heat of the moment. Most of the humour in fact stems from the underlying absurdity of the situations and the depth of its characters. It is probably an apt conclusion to draw that its success stems from the very same things.8 out of 10</fullReview>

This complicated screenplay about a hostage-taking-for-hire is pure brilliance from the start, and it's the acting that takes it one step beyond that. William Macy and Francis McDormand's characters are in my mind two of the greatest characters ever developed for film. Macy's Jerry Lundegaard has all the best lines though, and Macy is tres funny, even when he's giving dead serious lines. This is a movie I can watch over and over again (and in fact, I have)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad story but at the end American type of flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suggest you should just check out the comments-board of the over-rated movies in IMDb's top 250 movies. Almost all the people who give a top ten vote for such over-rated movies are viewers from America and Canada(mostly). Here's another over-rated movie. When I read the disclaimer in the beginning of the movie "a true story" that "took place in Minnesota in 1987," I thought it would be a real good movie about life itself. And the gad served its purpose yes the disclaimer really set my mood up for the movie. But the more I saw what was inside this real story the better I got the picture "this is just a gag this is not a real story". It could have been a real story but still it would be an American type of thing actually.A car salesman with financial troubles who hires two men to kidnap his wife and try to obtain money, a psychologically unbalanced man who lies that he lost of his wife(leukiema9 then tries to reconnect himself with his high-school crush, a robotic killer who slashes his victims in a dead-pan face" I am not saying it can't be real I am not saying the story is too bad either but it is just an American type of thing and it would be superficial to give a top ten vote for the movie. Plus I couldn2t see a bit of great performance by Frances McDormand, who got the Academy Award for Best Actress. Even if it is a good performance not an Oscar-rated one.Oscars really suck then!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even though it's serious, it's just so darn funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange film. Most of the time, when it comes to films that are reality based, I get tired of them real fast. Take a film like Affliction. That film was about an alcoholic father and the abuse of his sons. It got real old real fast because there was just too much reality in there. And it didn't manage to mesh the reality with even a modicum of entertainment. Fargo is different. This is a very serious film with a whole slew of funny moments. I don't think I have laughed this hard in a film when people weren't doing anything particularly funny. But when a guy with a shovel in his hand tells you than there are clouds coming in over the horizon, and you find that gut-splittingly funny, then you are in for a special film. Fargo is that film.But besides the hilarity, what makes this film work is the breakthrough performance of William H. Macy. Macy plays Jerry Lundergard the only way he should be played. Lundergard is a troubled man. He is in some financial difficulty and he has rich relatives that wouldn't give him any money for any reason. They don't particularly like him. Lundergard is a normal man. He comes from a small town and he ends up hatching a big scheme to get the money. He will have his wife kidnapped and then set up a ransom for her that will go to him. His wife won't be harmed and then he can pay off his financial debt. So he hires a couple of idiots, violent idiots, but idiots nonetheless. Of course this being a crime movie, and a Coen crime movie at that, everything is going to go wrong. And it does.Macy captures the true feel of what it would be like to be in Lundergard's position. He is nervous. He is nervous because he is so inept at crime that he hasn't even bothered to get the kidnappers phone numbers and he tried to supply them with a car by smudging some numbers when sending in a fax to GM. In one of the best scenes in the film, what starts out as a friendly meeting between Marge, the police detective, and Jerry turns into disaster for Jerry. He can't even lie well enough to a police officer who really isn't questioning him about the crime, just the possibility that the crooks stole a car from his lot. Now I'm no expert in kidnapping, but wouldn't it have been better for him to just say that he had a car stolen from the lot? But he can't even figure that out properly.Marge is played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand. She is from the small town of Fargo, she is pregnant and she has trouble starting her car in the morning. But she is also a gifted police officer. Upon investigating the scene of the first crime, she figures it out with common sense and logic. " I don't think I agree with some of your police work there..." she tells the other officer that seems to have it all backwards. When she gets to the big city, the first thing she does is look for a buffet, then she goes onto trying to solve a crime. She still has her priorities straight.The two kidnappers are played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Buscemi is Showalter and Stormare is Grimsrud and they couldn't be more opposite. Buscemi is "funny looking" and a nervous, talkative fellow while Stormare is a quiet, almost dumb looking dork. But they are ruthlessly violent and quick to pull the trigger. Buscemi provides the film with some of the bigger laughs as his character is always described as being funny looking by the locals.The Coens have made some movies that were considered good, although not my taste ( Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink ) but Fargo is a step above most other films. It is smarter than any film should be and it is honest and deceptively funny. If something is supposed to go wrong then it does. In most films, when a crime is committed, the only reason it is solved and the good guys win is because that is the way scripts are written. The good guys have to win because that is the formula for a film. But in Fargo, everything that happens does so because there are reasons for it and reasons given for it. If Marge is going to figure out the crime, she does so because she has done her homework and found out where the bad guys are. The script doesn't let her down.Fargo was one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it sure as hell was much better than English Patient. I don't think we are meant to figure out the academy though. One year it gives out best picture to a worthy film like Titanic and overlooks unworthy opponents like L.A. Confidential and then other years it gives best picture to crap like Shakespeare In Love and English Patient overlooking films like Saving Private Ryan and Fargo. Fargo is one of the most original films ever made and it is a perfect one to watch when you are tired of the formula that Hollywood releases time and time again.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a tad over-rated. Maybe it's the continuous pounding of forced Minnesota accents or the bloodiness of the story, but it is unsettling. First, Minnesotans (or minnesooootans) don't talk this way all the time (I rarely hear it--; at least this pronounced). Secondly, A Simple Plan (in my opinion) is a better film. I like the winter scenes in both movies and the story lines are both at least good. However, Fargo goes a little too far. Aspects like the chipper are good/funny, but a continuous pounding of the "yeah, ya bechas" is too much. Understandably it is a little funny to make fun of the midwesterners that have a pro-wrestler governor, live in the "cold", (had the gall to make Might Ducks 2+3), and have made fun at New Yorkers and others in the past, but there is such a thing as too much of a bad/good thing.</fullReview>

I found the characters hollow, both the good and the evil ones.If I had interpreted it differently though, it could be perceived as a projection of the characters onto a purely material plane, in which they are observed strictly in terms of their actions with no added effort to reveal their psychological state on the part of the filmmaker. The onus is on the viewer.In the end, in any case, I was not drawn in, and I found it to be a cold meditation on the effects of human stupidity and materialism. A description of a world that we don't quite actually live in, but could, if we don't watch our step and observe ourselves in the same cold ridiculing manner of Fargo's camera?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay -- It had the Potential to be Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Fargo, I was left with the same feeling I felt before I watched it; a need to be entertained. Don't take that the wrong way, the movie entertained me, but those entertaining parts were few and far between. Between what? Well, nothing (Nothing as in bland snow-cast lands) And I'll say the movie was awfully long feeling for only being one and a half hours or so.The humor of this comedy if mostly created by those over-exaggerated (I hope) accents. And when everybody else is laughing at that and I felt left out. Lucky for you, you're probably in that 'everybody' category.Other parts were entertaining though, a number seemingly useless actions, shots of funny things we all do once in a while and of course, the all superior chit-chat type of humor. Basically the type of humor Steve Buscemi is known for; the kind I like.But between these glory blessed scenes of humor are a few nice-to-watch action sequences and frankly, quite unentertaining conversations. But where the movie fails the most -- where it could've been made better, is the overall atmosphere. It isn't edgy like 8 Mile or laid-back like Pulp Fiction, it's more along the lines of . . . nothing. Not only that the scenery consists of homey feeling houses and as I said before, snow. Officially, I'm not retiring to Fargo, North Dakota after watching this movie. It seems much too cold and depressing.And while some of the scenes could have been polished up, sped up, or even cut out, the acting is fairly funny and a few characters are good, while others are bland and bad. Steve Buscemi's Carl is of course my favorite character, and the conflicting pair between him and Grimshrud creates a few good jokes. Shep Proudfoot adds a little spice and Marge the expecting cop is nicely done as well. But the rest of the characters just seem to annoy me, especially Jerry Lundegaard. He appeared very self-centered (as he was meant to), and there was nothing to like about him. But somehow he did'nt seems villainous enough to be the bad guy, leaving him looking like neutral/bland character.So in the end, it just seems that Fargo has something bad to bring done each good things it has going for it, thus earning it a nice average 5 out of 10. While my friends seemed enjoy it, I nearly killed myself watching it the second time through. So for me, it is more or less not worth a rent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointingly ordinary film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is frequently called the best film ever made by the Coen Brothers, but I must resolutely veto this notion. How people can consider this superior to "Miller's Crossing" or "The Hudsucker Proxy" I'll never understand. The film tells the story of Jerry (William H. Macy, playing his standard pathetic loser), who arranges to have his own wife kidnapped by two goons (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, as their standard characters, a foul-mouthed weasel and a taciturn thug), in order to get the money needed to pay off his debts. Things go wrong, and police officer Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is on the case. The film won two Oscars in 1997, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (McDormand); I must say that it didn't deserve either of them. In particular, I found McDormand's performance incredibly overrated. Margie is a cartoon character, and nothing more. I give this film a disappointing 5/10.</fullReview>

Macy's (whats the H for anyway) character as well as the Northern accents, (mostly because my mom's side of the family is from Minnesota) but that is all i can say of entertainment from this movie. I gave it a 5, i think. I don't recommend this movie, unless you're from the north, but then again, you may be offended: all the more fun i guess.</fullReview>

Now, I have NOTHING against the directing abililty of the Coen brothers, even in Fargo... and I certainly thought the acting was very well done. However, the story did not satisfy me, and overall I did not enjoy watching this film. Thus, despite any positives, I can hardly give it a good review. Enjoyment goes a long way in a movie. (Ex: Citizen Kane is an innovative masterpiece, but I would never watch it for fun. That's my opinion. The Third Man is ALSO a directing masterpiece, but I WOULD watch it for fun. It entertains me much more than Citizen Kane.) I try not to label those who liked Fargo as inane or holier- than- thou just because I didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had a great concept and it was actually written very well, but... I don't know if it was good acting or bad acting, but every character in this movie sickened me. Their behaviorisms, their speech, their rationale just drove me insane. Mr. Lundegard (William H. Macy) was a train wreck, the criminals he was dealing with were inept, his father-in-law was a boorish old bastard, his wife was just annoying, and the sheriff was a pregnant Columbo.It's ideal to do a movie about a crime that goes horribly wrong due to lousy criminals, but make it a comedy or something. This was supposed to be the real deal crime drama type, but these people were so pathetic that I couldn't bear to watch them. And besides that, what possesses a sheepish, meek man like Lundegard to try to pull off such an extravagant crime like have his wife kidnapped? Though I couldn't stand it, somehow I stomached the movie. I forced myself to watch it like a child forcing down lima beans just so I could be fair in my critique. But what was worse than anything... what topped it all off... what was just the splinter under the fingernail, the nails on the chalk board, the reason for shoving screwdrivers in both ears...THEIR ACCENTS!!! AAAAAH. I ABSOLUTELY HATED, ABHORED, DREADED, &amp; LOATHED THEIR ACCENTS. Especially the wife. How can anyone who talks like that be taken seriously???

In the excellent "A Simple Plan" the characters think about consequences and what they think about how to handle things. There is none of this in "Fargo". The characters just do things without thought. The kidnappers seemed to be having more sex than doing their "job".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In retrospect, a very mean and insensitive film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie, it had been advertised as a "black comedy." As a result, numerous people in the audience giggled and laughed at various scenes, some of which, were not intended to be funny at all. I enjoyed the film alright, largely due to the wonderful performances of Steve Buscemi and Kenneth Macy. I have to admit, that I did snicker at some scenes. HOWEVER, after recently viewing this film, I have done a complete 180. This is an ugly film and very mean spirited. Oh yeah, I know that the Coens issue a disclaimer about how they were not changing the story, out of respect to the dead, BULL! Excuse me if I am wrong, but the real events having to do with this case involved numerous people being killed? So, why so much emphasis on making fun of the way people in Minnesota talk? In the story, a boy is told his mother has been kidnapped by unknown assailants. So why does the scene close with a close up shot of the "Accordion King" poster, which is completely ridiculous? Did the Coens actually see that poster in the boy's house? Or did they just want to keep cracking little jokes? While the police chief is supposed to be investigating the killings, she goes off to have this lunch with a comedic Asian character. Funny scene? You bet. But you know what, that whole scene was completely made up, did not happen. So why, are we getting more comedy thrown into this story? Did the Coens not say that the events in this movie were all true? And this is what bothers me. None of the humor in this film actually involves the specifics of this case. The humor is all added to mock a very real and tragic series of events. Hey, if you want to produce fiction, fine. But don't claim your story is non-fiction and then tack on fictitious comedic scenes. Great performances or not, this is an ugly and insensitive film.</fullReview>

Almost 20 years later, we still don't have enough female-lead driven stories.FEMALE-LEAD DRIVEN stories. Not women-oriented stories. Fargo remains highly relevant today. Not only because it is a superbly told story, but because strong non-cliché female lead like this remains one in a hundred good films even today. But all hope is not lost...Swedish theaters now goes beyond PG or age limit ratings, and will include women-friendly rating system.

		<shortDescription>FARGO : Funny, Authentic, Rare, Great, Original ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fargo" is one of these cinematic rarities for which the word 'original' has been invented. Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of "Fargo", while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not "Fargo"'s only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that "Fargo" is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why "Fargo" was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.The characterization is what gives "Fargo" its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, "Minnesota Nice" as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a "F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these "Yeah" that sound like "Yah". The accents are the music that accompanies the rhythm of the film in an odd but so appealing way. The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the "talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks" classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously: it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses ? just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside."Fargo" is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like "Fargo" in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!</fullReview>

This sort of sham/scam was common in the eighties and nineties but it is unforgivable! A breach of the vital trust between moviemaker and movie watcher. It's an odd sort of movie combining gruesome brutality with quirky comedy. It's an original dramatic device. The bad guys are so bad that you need a little relief. And that's provided by the pert, perky (and pregnant) cop. There also are some very loose ends. What, for example, was the point of bringing in the Japanese ex-boyfriend? It didn't seem to have any link whatsoever to the plot. It also overflows with plugs and product placements. However despite these shortcomings, it is still a pretty good nailbiter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh, after watching this movie i was forced to write a comment because i want those people to know, who want to watch this movie, that his is not so great of a movie.Yes it has got very high rating point in IMDb website and i fell for that and watched this movie. I was expecting a lot from this movie and after watching it i can say that i am not convinced at all. after watching coen brothers " not country for old men" i decided to watch this movie but i was wrong.this movie certainly does not deserve that much of a high rating. the lady, who was playing a cop in this movie, never looked or behaved like a cop. The dialogs were even worse. "Oh yah" and "jeez" words have been used almost 100 times throughout the movie which really freaked me out. No one did justice with his/her role including Macy who was playing the central character "jerry lundeggard".Please don't watch this movie if u are expecting a lot from Coen Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ya, I watched this movie the other night and i have read a lot of the comments that have been posted so far, and I neither think this is a great movie, nor did I hate it.A lot of unanswered questions in this movie tho which i did not like, for instance, why did Jerry need all that money for?? Did he have a gambling problem??? A drug addiction?? Or was it because he was such a bad salesman that he lost a whole lot of money selling his father in laws cars?? Also what happened to all that ransom money??? Did anyone ever recover it??? Or should i travel up to Minnesota to look for it since this is based on a true story??? Some things i did like tho, was how everyone said Ya, at first i thought what a bunch of hicks, but soon it began to amuse me. I enjoyed how the characters talked to each other as neighbors do to one another, that made this movie seem more like the real world than some of the fake dialog i witness in other movies.All in all, i give this movie a 5 or 6, not a piece of art like some claim, but not a piece of trash like others have suggested.Its an OK movie!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fargo" has another character - that North Midwestern accent, with its Scandinavian lilt, its folksy charm and its disarming presence in practically every scene in the movie. This film is a hoot! I agree completely with Ebert's beautiful review. It is fascinating, heartfelt, true to character, place and situation, extremely funny, and sometimes painfully violent. I would only add that as an entertainment, it is one of the most disorienting experiences a viewer can find in the cinema. It is fascinating to watch this film back-to-back with the Coen Brothers' "Blood Simple", a great film in its own right, but which seems like the preparation for their masterpiece, "Fargo". The tension is almost unrelieved in "Blood Simple". But the ending violence is so over-the-top, that the viewer suddenly realizes that they are really being sneakily had by the filmmakers and that the joke is on them. In "Fargo", the tension is also unrelieved. But here the film starts with the audience being "in" on the outrageousness of the events and the almost cartoon-like characters with their outrageous accents. But still we don't know sometimes whether to laugh or feel chilled (with the events AND that bleak Minnesota winter!) The audience experiences two strands of tension - the crime, and Jerry Lundegaard's exponentially growing nightmare. Who doesn't identify with the moment when in total exasperation at the unfolding of events, Jerry has that tantrum, trashing his desk. Granted we haven't all had our spouses kidnapped for money! But we are right there with Jerry, feeling his helplessness. What a tour-de-force of acting from William H. Macy, with France McDormand's human-wise Marge, and Steven Buscemi's SadSack crook creating and leading one of the greatest acting ensembles to grace an American film in years. The audience thinks from the very beginning, that that bizarre Steven Buscemi sure seems "funny-lookin" in this movie. And when that phrase is uttered in two of the funniest moments of the film, we in the audience laugh, knowing the film-makers are actually making fun of us at these priceless moments. We may be "in" on the jokes, but the film-maker"s are absolutely onto us - and they have fun in letting us know that. Frances McDormand's Marge, with her genuine, caring persona, a smile that lights up the screen, and the most-musical of accents - absolutely nailing the rhythms and cadences of that beautifully distinctive speech (little-known outside that part of the United States until this film came along) is a revelation in this movie. It makes the audience want to see any film she has ever been in before!This is a movie that became an instant classic, plunging the viewer into an alternate universe of feelings, situations and characters that they identify with, are repulsed by, laugh at, and ultimately embrace. You betcha!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this film is about a horrifying true story, one cannot help thinking its pretty funny really. I know that is a terrible thing to say and the humour in it is a very subtle humour. Here you got those parts of the States which Personally I would most like to visit, which is not the common choice, I know. You got Bushemi at his best here, as wacky as he can get. Check it out! However our hero in this movie is a pregnant cop lady, so wonderful, so simple, lacking all tensions in the midst of this horrifying nightmarish hunt. This to me is the Coen brothers at their tops. I like their work a lot, although they are not always as consistent, they can be can make some great work and Fargo is definitely one of their greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll have to go a long way to find another film like "Fargo". Well, at least as far as another Coen Brothers movie, anyway. Not quite a dark comedy, not quite a police procedural and sort of almost a thriller, in terms of genre "Fargo" is best described as a "One-off".Filled with sympathetic characters, boo-able villains and smart dialogue, "Fargo" takes you to a slightly skewed version of middle America and leaves you there for the rest of its run-time. Think "Twin Peaks" without the pretentiousness and you're already halfway there. The acting performances are all top-notch and these are what will keep you watching. As events unfold and people's lives begin to unravel, I defy even the most stony-hearted viewer not to get sucked into the world of "Fargo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cohen Brothers masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set against the white canvas, Fargo is one of those rare films that comes along once in a decade. Arguabley the best film of the nineties, this gem gets better with repeated viewing like most Cohen brothers films pre Ladykillers. The acting is superb, the cast perfectly picked. Some defining roles in the careers of Steve Buschemi, Peter Stormaire and William H. Macy.The serpentine plot is just one of the outstanding facets of this film, the cinematography set against the white canvas of the Minnesotta winter, creates a lonely, sad, isolated feeling. Isolation in general is a major theme in this film, as well as the distances between people, the lack of communication, lies and deception that can be humanity at its worst. In fact very few people in this film are not total degenerates. The Cohen brothers are clearly expressing our existential despair through black humor and they do it like no one else when they have all cylinders firing as they do in Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, Barton Fink, and Millers Crossing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of all the Coen Brothers movies, but this is their masterpiece. After seeing that both the USA men's and women's Olympic curling teams were from Bemidji, Minnesota, only one hundred miles north of Brainerd, the home town of Frances McDormand's character, and then listening to the similarity of the curler's accents to the characters in the movie, I had to watch it again. Not surprisingly, the movie gets better each time I see it. But if you really want to see a great review, read the one by Roger Ebert. He won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, and those that have will laugh right along as he describes the movie. His review can be found at rogerebert.suntimes.com.

And that kidnapping scene where the two guys botched it was funny in a sick kinda way, considerin' they killed her and all. Yaw! Those Coen brothers. A couple of Minnesotans, ya know, can tell a pretty gory tale and make it work out. And where else would you find a wood chipper bein' a major part of a story?

		<fullReview>Fargo? Let's face it, the Cohen's didn't think "Bemidji" made a good sounding title. Being from Fargo, I remember when they were shooting the outdoor scenes (it was a warm winter and they were having trouble finding snow). The only scene in Fargo (and it wasn't even shot here) is at the very beginning. Everything else takes place in Minnesota. Some people criticized the accents (but I've been in a lot of little towns where the people sound exactly like that).That being said, I did like the movie. The pace was rather slow, but it was funny, maybe a little to violent for violence sake. It's good movie to rent if you've got nothing to do on a Sunday night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder, money, and kidnapping. Doesn't sound like a Coen brothers'flick does it? Well, in this 1996 dramatic real life based film, the brothers give us all that and more.Waking up to a call early one winter morning, Margie (Frances Mcdermont), the chief of police in Brainard, MN, investigates a murder that's taken place not far out from her hometown. Back in the twin cities, the planner, kidnappers, and basis for the entire doings of the calamity, are underway and about to take shape before the audience's very eyes.A dramatic, well-written, and very realistic portrayal of six murders, in the span of just a matter of days, is spellbinding and a very intense piece.The actors that are most noteworthy are, Frances McDormant, William H. Macy and Steve Bushemi. Each one, has a specific character, that will make you feel for each of them in your own way, including other unmentioned such characters.A very character driven film, it's the best Coen brothers film I have ever seen, and recommend it to every person who enjoys good, intense murder mysteries.</fullReview>

The story line is fantastic and is true human emotions. I can tell some of the story line does not make sense, even when I thought it was a true story. I can assure you, if a state trooper was killed on a traffic stop, the local yokel police department would not be the lead investigators on the case. Even Brainerd being a small town, it is doubtful the Chief herself would go out of town (to Minneapolis) on a follow up investigation. That is why you have detectives.

		<fullReview>I am going to say this right now...this is the last movie that had a truly great and original plot.No film made after this has a really brilliant idea behind it's story like Fargo. The plot is pretty simple and goes something like this: A man wants money, so he hires two people to kidnap his wife so her rich husband can pay the ransom. That's pretty much it. Of course, nothing goes right and people end up getting killed, beat up, axed, whipped, and chopped into tiny bits.Apart from the original concept, this film actually has mostly everything else working in it's favor. The writing it funny, directing is pretty laid-back, but gets the job done without looking dull or too stylistic, and the acting is mostly good. Only thing that bothers me is Frances MacDormand actually winning an Acadmey Award for her role. How that ever happened is truly a mystery, not to mention the first thing people should consider when contemplating the credibility of the Oscars.I have absolutely no trouble saying that this is, without a doubt, the Coen's best film...by far. It's hard to imagine that the same people who made that film also made Miller's Crossing. Seriously, I'd rather watch grass grow in the winter than have to suffer though that poor dialogue-fest once more. They are on opposite ends of the entertainment and artistic quality spectrum's.</fullReview>

Gunfire is inevitable however the deceased were given dignity and bloodshed was very minimal. Used only to make a point!The humor used was very well blended into a serious movie which I personally think is why this movie was so successful.

I think both deserved Oscars. You really do believe McDormand-to a point, and feel for Macy as his world crashes down on top of him.Personally what I liked best was seeing Rockhound and Leb from Armageddon in an earlier film, Buscemi is a scream and a very talented one too no matter what he tries. Enjoyed seeing Leb too, although he had maybe 7 words in the whole film. He is a Brutal spud in this isn't he.Couple questions: what happened to Macy's wife-was she killed or what? We don't get to see her after a couple scenes in the 'hide out', maybe she was wood chipped....And two-why was this such a big deal? Good film yes, but-an Oscar contender? Somehow I don't think so. If you want to see a well acted, lower budget film from 1996, set in an out of the way part of the land, with some realistic characters...Might I suggest you try LoneStar, by John Sayles.

They want to be kewl and/or popular. I like Fargo, now, too, but it took practice. I originally saw Fargo at my local videostore for halfprice. I liked the acting in the movie, but didn't really see that much substance in it. But it came with that snowglobe. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's cool. Suddenly I had to have it.

Then some other friends wanted to see it, and I watched it again. And so on and so on until I realized....I kinda actually maybe sorta liked it....It hurt me, but I had to admit, Fargo was geek chic. Everyone is so corny and old fashioned and dull, and I realized that's what makes them so cool. I too, am addicted to Fargo. SIDENOTE: This drives me crazy.

When I finally did, I struggled to keep myself awake just to be sure I wasn't being unfair. The narrative is slow and boring, the story is just dull.

Forget bad language, this movie deserves an X rating for criminal cold blooded violence. When the man in the car coldly blasted a state trooper in the face with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, I almost quit watching right there. Then, the man pursued, and killed two witnesses by shooting one in the head at close range, the other in the back.Kidnapping a woman, letting her fall down a flight of stairs, then laughing at her while she hopped around in the snow blinded with a hood over her head, scared for her life,crying in panic as she tried to get away, is in no way comedy. IMO, this movie served no purpose except to give criminals ideas how to be more violent.This movie should have been rated X, with no redeeming social value.</fullReview>

It happens in comedies, romance movies, well, even cartoons. But not this movie. Suddenly something happens, but it is absolutely NO use for the rest of the movie. There is no change whatsoever. The movie just keeps on running for the last 45 minutes before you think "Pheww.. Now I don't have to more of this.." Of course, all opinions can't be the same as mine, but if you consider watching this movie, you better do a bit more considering than just for a minute.If you REALLY want to see it, grab a pillow and get ready to sleep (just what I thought would be a good idea :D)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is great. It's got drama, suspense and a little bit of comedy.Jerry (Willian H. Macy) is in deep crap. He owes all this money to his boss. So he hires 2 thugs (one played by the excellent Steve Buschemi) to kidnap his wife for randsome. Everything goes fine until the cops catch on and do everything in there power to find out who is responsible. The film has very strong profanity, most of the words coming out of the bad guys. This film is great and should have won more Oscars.The film is 98 minutes in length and is rated R for violence and strong language and nudity and some other bad things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo is the definition of when rural community meets inner-city crime...but doesn't know it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jery Lundegaard (William H Macey) is in debt. He hatches a plot to hold his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd) hostage...and then realises he has a way out. But by then it's too late and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) are already on their way.This appears at first glance as a slightly slow paced thriller, but in truth it's a non-stop acceleration into the depths of "salaried" criminals.Frances McDormund hardly registers in the films credits, but I challenge any man alive not to warm to her motherly love and want her as his wife. She is truly stunning as Marge Gunderson and perhaps more than anyone provides the comical link between "commercial" America and the true Scandinavian dominated north-mid-west.This is a film that makes you laugh under your breath all the way through...only to make you question why at the end. It's not 100% serious, but it's more than 101% intended.Buscemi and Stormare are exceptional as crimanals, and if it wasn't for McDormand they should have gained Oscars for this, but FMcD steals the show in all senses.This is a film you will watch time and time again and still see new nuances.</fullReview>

I really disappointed Frances McDormand's acting performance very weak... Although Peter Stormare did his job very fine, i don't know why the rating of this movie is so high, i've seen tons of movies better than this one, it's something from the category "For TV" Poor scenario, poor acting, cheap budget, some stupid accent which made me mad... Some kidnapping story with poor performance and cheap budget... This movie doesn't deserve to be in IMDb top movies 250, i'm very sorry for you people, that you are voting really bad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I surfed this database and found 'Fargo' rated better than 'The Big Lebowski'. Since The Big Lebowski is my all time favorite I thought "Hell! This movie has to kick ass!!".Well, I watched the movie and waited for about 98 minutes for some genius tricks that make the plot interesting. Without luck. My girlfriend even fell asleep several times.I don't think this is a bad movie though. It is always nice to see Steve Buscemi performing and nearly all dialogues have some deep strange sarkasm in them but such a superb rating as in this database isn't based on facts I can agree to.--&gt; 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirkiness for quirkiness' sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to have a high opinion of critically acclaimed Oscar- nominated movies...key words USED TO!...A long time ago in a movie-watching galaxy far, far away. Of course this back when I was too young to know any better. Much as I despise most acclaimed films that come out now and think that better ones came out when I was growing up, I can still pick out overrated tripe from the "good old days" and FARGO (1996) is definitely overrated tripe! FARGO is actually a film that I like to reference when a movie like THE DARK KNIGHT (another overrated piece of trash) comes out because FARGO is one of the first examples of a film where I realized that EVERYONE that praised it so highly back in the day could NOT for the life of them truly justify WHY it was so great! With THE DARK KNIGHT, at the very least fans of that flick can point to the one good thing about it and that is Heath Ledger's performance (but nothing else).Pretty much every review I recall hearing about FARGO used sweeping generalizations to describe it and simply seem to use the excuse that just because of the fact that it was novel for the lead character in a big (directed by Coen Bros.) crime drama film was (A) female and (B) pregnant, and (C) a cop, that automatically makes it groundbreaking and a modern masterpiece.But the simple fact is...there is nothing to Frances McDormand's character, nor William H. Macy's, for that matter. How in the heck McDormand won the Oscar for making barf jokes, sounding stupid, and literally doing nothing for her short screen time (Macy had more than her, seemed like the real central character, and somehow he got tagged for a SUPPORTING nom to her LEADING nom and win) is beyond me. Macy is a tad better, but in the end came across just as emotionless and empty. And the Midwestern accents? EVERY character sounded the same! Every character is treated and acted like a caricature of real people (based on a true story), but none of them (well, save perhaps one in the end) left any kind of impression with me. The Coen's 3 previous big films BLOOD SIMPLE, RAISING ARIZONA, and MILLER'S CROSSING (their true best film) all had their character quirks and strangeness, but the characters in those films all had real personality, depth, and at the end of all 3 of those films, I actually drew something important from them.The ONE authentic scene in FARGO is actually the opening one when Macy meets with prospective kidnappers Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare to map out the plan to kidnap his wife so he could use the ransom money to solve his financial problems, but from there on, it's all downhill! Then after that, it's just a bunch of quirky, go-nowhere, slow- moving vignettes, some of which have nothing to do with the story, and even the ones that supposedly do are dominated by the annoyances of the characters (overdone) Midwestern accents and just making boring idle conversation, with the actual plot points coming across as distractions...Yeah, we get it, Coens...solving crimes in real life is boring...you proved it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coen Brothers .. overrated as per usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like the Coen brothers have some uncle up in the Oscar "distributing" jury who always comes up to them and says "Listen, we have a couple of Oscars lying around to give up in next week's ceremony so why don't the two of you make a movie &amp; we'll give them to you"Come to think of it Al Pacino didn't get an Oscar for his role in The Godfather, Morgan Freeman didn't get it for Shawshank Redemption, Robert De Niro for Taxi Driver, Jack Nicholson for A Few Good Men &amp; Frances McDormand got on Oscar for this movie for saying "Yah" a zillion times(in a very irritating &amp; intolerable way). I honestly don't get what all the hype is about.Coming back to the topic, this movie very much like Coen Brother's other "masterpieces"** Burn After Reading &amp; No Country For Old Men, is pointless, boring and extremely overrated. It is an average movie with a week story line, irritating acting with an annoying &amp; excessive use of the word "Yah".** I would like to make an appeal to other reviewers to stop calling every other movie a "masterpiece".If you are about to watch this movie i would seriously suggest that you do yourself a big favor &amp; for a change not go with what the majority views say &amp; watch something else. And if you have already watched the movie well then "Yah" welcome to the club...Peace !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Hollywood, Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off seeing this one because my dad went to Fargo High and I knew it would be weird to see this movie. Then i decided it was time--gee, what a good rep the movie has had to this day. However, my early doubts were sound. Hokey accents and "character bits"---beginning with the waggy headed blonde cashier. So, that dates this movie. Cuz now we know that the Upper Midwest is populated with regular people, who are not painfully cute in their snowsuits. In fact, audiences moved to penguins, who don't even have to wear snowsuits. As time has gone by we have also grasped the range of William (Pleasantville) Macy. He's gone on to better things. But the caricatures and gruesome psychosis juxtaposed with inept human greed and self-centered myopia---ah! it is a diversion. And it is very agreeable to watch Frances McDormand work. The Coens seem to have gone in, done their job and pulled out. A directorial road movie in which the repetitive snowy road goes through mood changes--same road, but the story has altered its meaning. At the end, it's comfortingly familiar. I feel the skeleton of a better movie here. Like Peter Jackson's animated bugs in "King Kong", the smiling heads of quickly daubed "local color" wouldn't be missed. There's good stuff, and it's just off the road a bit, that beautiful straight, snowy road.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cold north holds grim boredom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was smitten by several of the brothers' other work (Big Limbouski, Miller's Crossing,O Brother, Where Art Thou? Raising Arizona), and was primed to enjoy this much hyped film. The idea of the film is a simple joke: what if you set a grim tail of desperation in the banal setting of Minnesota. Characters would be wonderful because of their grit and pedestrian nature in extraordinary circumstances.Done well, such characterizations would do away with a need for a compelling plot. Sadly, despite fine acting, the characters aren't compelling, leaving the plot to plod on to its inevitable conclusion -boredom. Joel Coen has left me wondering why he bothered to make this film, with all the charm of a drunk-driving accident.Fargo's only saving grace is that it is ever so slightly more tolerable than Intolerable Cruelty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most over-rated films in motion picture history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first you think it's a drama, but it's not. Then you think it's a comedy, but it really isn't. Come to think of it, it's not even a dramedy! It's just... different. Now don't assume that I'm opposed to originality; I enjoyed and appreciated films such as Fight Club and American Beauty, but Fargo is just too... pointless! I mean, a guy hires two bizarre goons to kidnap his wife and then asks for ransom money from her father, planning on splitting the cash between himself and his new "business" associates. In the end (~*~ SPOILERS ~*~) their plan goes down the drain: the husband and one of the kidnappers both get arrested, and the other guy gets reduced to a pile of sawdust in the now-infamous woodchipper scene. Am I the only one that fails to see the "deeper meaning" in all of this? I've come to the conclusion that the only real message of the film is not to mess with the law... but I already knew that before I sat down to watch this one-and-a-half-hour weird-o-rama! In my opinion, a movie should either make the viewer laugh, cry, or deliver some sort of moral. Fargo never really makes you laugh (maybe chuckle a bit), there certainly are no sad parts, and after extreme examination I've decided there is no ultimate moral. So why is this hailed as one of the best movies of all time in the first place?!? I'm not saying Fargo is an AWFUL movie, though, because it does have some good aspects. The music, for one; the song played during the main and ending titles is catchy and haunting. Another pro is the cinematography: the scenes that take place in the vast snow deserts of North Dakota are really astounding, and the part where Steve Buscemi (at least I think it was him) buries the money was brilliantly filmed. Frances McDormand and her accent are both great, and William H. Macy is surprisingly good. Sadly, the talented performances, excellent music, and beautiful filmography are not enough to compensate for the dullness of the plot and the over-all stupidity of the movie. If you have never seen Fargo, don't waste your time on it. Instead, check out the Coen Brothers' future and far better film, The Man Who Wasn't There. Oh, and by the way: contrary to what the opening scene says, Fargo is NOT a true story.Overall rating: 4/10</fullReview>

At first, I did think the whole accent thing was overdone, but that's not what irritated me the most. I thought that this film was going to be MUCH better than what it was. Normally, I like their movies (Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, Miller's Crossing, The Man Who Wasn't There). This one left me flat &amp;, well, irritated.

		<fullReview>The DVD box and the IMDb refer to this movie as a thriller. During the meeting with Macy's character and the two thugs, it was apparent that all three characters were so sleazy and dumb that the plot was bound to fail. Watching it unfold was not exactly a riveting experience.I also heard this often referred to as a comedy. Well, some of the characters had those funny Swedish-derived Minnesota accents. Nothing in the writing, however, provided for genuine laughs (at least not to me). Compare this to other black comedies such as One Flew Over the Cuckoos's Nest or Dr. Strangelove, in which there are many funny lines and episodes amid the backdrop of dire and/or disturbing circumstances. This movie will not stand the test of time as those have. For that matter, it won't even stand up favorably compared to other (far superior) Coen Brothers efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely hated this movie. It couldn't seem to figure out whether it was trying to take itself seriously or not. It kept throwing itself curveballs and never seemed to know where to go next. Here's my problem with this movie.1. It seems to try very hard to be a dark comedy, but it simply isn't funny. I cracked a smile two or three times throughout the movie, and one of them was that part where Steve Buscemi got cut up in the wood chipper.2. The "This is Based on a True Story" thing at the beginning seemed to be trying to prepare the viewer for a hard-hitting drama, but instead we got a bunch of weirdos with goofy accents.The problem with this movie is it doesn't make me laugh, and I can't take it seriously as a drama when every single character is a white bread goof with a stupid accent (by the way, NOBODY in Minnesota talks like that). I'll give it a four, but only Frances McDormand's acting job keeps it from being a one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those who haven't had the pleasure (???) of seeing the performance of Frances McDormand, read no further. Ms. McDormand probably did the worst artificial Scandinavian sing-song dialect ever heard by man, woman or dead cat, except when a bad amateur mimic was mocking Norwegians, etc. This story was really lame! I walked out at the end (why did I stay till the end? - I don't know to this day) wondering who the movie critics were that recommended it - I would certainly not trust their opinions in the future. This movie was highly thought of in the worst movie year ever - all the candidates for the Oscar were weak, small films . . . that would never be CONSIDERED for awards in a normal year. Compare 1996 to THIS PAST year (2001), especially at Xmas time, with several legitiimate 4-star movies out at the same time. 'Fargo' would not rate 1.5 stars if released in 2001. 1996 was a really hard-up year for Hollywood. I left the theater think I had probably seen the worst flick of my life. Then I rented 'Barton Fink' a few months later (also by the Coens) --- I actually do not have words to express how unbelievably awful THAT was! No more Coen films for me, thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo is a movie with little merit as drama and little other reason to watch it save one - raw random violence. If that turns you on, and it must have turned on a lot of people to get the rating it did from so many people, then its for you. Otherwise don't waste your time. While Fargo is the true story of what happens when some sick minds get together and do the wrong thing, there is nothing particularly new about this theme in true life or fiction. And while Alfred Hichcock might have made a masterpiece of this story, Mr. Cohen, in his flat pan "cinema vérité " style makes it one hell of a bore. Jerry Lungard (William Macy) plays an emotionless jerk that is in trouble and dreams up a dumb plot to try to get himself out of it. He convinces me that the real life Jerry Lungard was as boring an idiot as the movie character. He plays the part so well he is absolutely dull. (But then - it is vérité !). Pregnant police chief investigator Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) plays a like character but with more style. Flat pan and in a plain Minnesota folk type Luddite brogue (`ja - dats the way is' - except sometimes I think I hear a Brooklyn / Illinois accent sneak tru), she stumbles around and finally comes upon the murderer(s). I use the tenuous plural since one of them (I can tell you this 'cause its right on the video jacket) - is mainly (very red) mulch because he's mostly been fed through a wood chopper! This is a stupid movie about a stupid caper in which there are no redeeming qualities (in the movie, that is).Siskel - Ebert - what in the world did were those guys thinking giving it two thumbs up? So go for it if you love watching cold people commit a lot of cold blooded murder. (Was this movie made for TV?) Ugh. As Garrison Keillor might say, "and that's the news from the lake this week." Now if Garrison had written this movie it might be interesting (Cinema vérité noir á la Keillor).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly mediocre film for Academy Award Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must say that I cannot for the life of me figure out why people think that the movies made by the Coen brothers are so great. I have seen numerous comments that another of their films is "the best movie ever," and that movie, which I will not name, is even worse than this incredibly mediocre movie! I think that the Coen brothers put out in-your-face, insipid garbage. I have no problems with silly movies, in fact I like to suspend my disbelief for any movie that is done in any kind of clever way, but their movies really demonstrate how movies can fail to challenge the viewer even to suspend disbelief! Well, my disbelief is the praise their movies get."Fargo" is about a kidnapping scheme that is badly bungled from beginning to end, but the real bungling is again the total artlessness of the way the story is put together and acted out. And as I wrote above, the biggest "entertainment" are scenes of murder and violence that are totally in-your-face. The day is saved by a pregnant police officer, who is so sweet and kind, we just know that she will get her man. Yet neither her portrayal nor any of the other portrayals of people from the Great Lake states are very effective. It's not that they aren't accurate, because they are, and this adds to the boredom of the movie - they almost never express emotion, they never get out of their ordinariness, neither when people are brutally murdered nor when one of the officer's former male friends has personal problems. No, life goes on for these people regardless, and what is entertaining about that banal sameness? Finally, the portrayals in the movie are just too cute, at least for me.What makes a lot of movies work is that their characters have transformations, they learn something from their experiences, they go from bad to good or vice-versa, or undergo some kind of change. And that is yet another reason why this movie fails in my opinion, after all the murders and other actions, no one learns anything at all! The man who arranged the kidnapping learns nothing, the murderers learn nothing, and life just goes on as it was!</fullReview>

Fargo is an 8.1 with over 12000 votes on the IMDb for crying out loud! This is without a doubt the most over-rated movie I have ever seen, with zombie-like acting(on purpose? why?? is this a satire??), and terrible writing. It's one of those movies that I laughed at, not with, and I have no idea if it was a comedy on purpose or by accident. If I lived in Fargo I'd be plenty p***ed off because this film makes the people there look like cardboard figures pretending to be goofy moroninc humans. The Brothers Coen geniuses? I think not. And if anyone is thinking "he just didn't get it", well, if true, at least that's one good thing about Fargo, because whether it was supposed to be serious, or supposed to have some deep comical meaning, I don't WANT to get it!Jeremy Barger</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of thos movies (like "Pulp Fiction") where the audience is expected to laugh about scenes of most cruel violence. That's disgusting and even dangerous, because this plays down violence. "It's only a movie, you know?" But we all know how influential movies can be, don't we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always heard good things about Fargo, and once it made the AFI's top 100 list of funny movies, I decided to rent it. I very rarely rent R-rated films, but this seemed to be worth it.In short, my brother and I did not laugh once, nor did we enjoy the film.First of all, the film is violent and grotesque. I've seen many violent films before, but this went beyond anything I've seen. There are several murders committed. All of them are extremely disturbing in their depiction of blood and guts as well as the complete inhumanity of each killing.Second of all, the film has numerous moments of gratuitous sex which serve the plot no purpose, other than perhaps additional character degradation.In my opinion, this film is the second worst thing to happen to mainstream entertainment in the 90s.The worst thing is that people out there laughed at it. What a blasted hame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst Coen brothers movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am ordinarily a big fan of Coen brothers movies. "Raising Arizona" is one of my all-time favorites, and most of their other films are also quite good. Fargo, however, is highly over-rated. I believe it to be their worst film to date. As several others have commented, the film is simply too mean-spirited in its comedy, especially when it purports at the beginning to be a "true" story.The best example I can think of, is the scene in the movie when the wife is tied up inside a sack and the kidnappers are trying to get her into the cabin. She momentarily gets away from them, and runs around in a panicked frenzy, blindly bumping into things, while the kidnappers laugh at her. Believe it or not, in the movie this scene is played for laughs. The movie wants the audience to laugh at this scene, and inevitably some do laugh. Laughing puts the viewer into the same frame of reference as the kidnappers, instead of identifying (as they should) with the victim. As a result, you laugh without thinking, and then feel bad about having just laughed. A very uncomfortable feeling.Most Coen brothers movies are filled with quirky characters that have a lot of "heart." Even the bad guys end up being somewhat likable. In "Fargo" however, there are very few likable characters. Marge Gunderson is just about the only one, and even she is really too much of a cartoon caricature to feel like a real person. Yet, at the same time, the movie feels a little too much like real life to be a good dark comedy.Dark comedies are tricky things, and I do love a good dark comedy. However, I think a dark comedy needs to feel unreal enough, in order to allow us to laugh at the naughty goings-on. Bad things can be funny, if we know they are not real. The more real bad things feel, the less funny they get. "Fargo" made the mistake of trying to portray bad things in a very realistic way, and then making fun of them. This contrasts with "Raising Arizona," which portrayed some bad things in an over-the-top cartoonish way, and remained funny. Cartoon violence is funny, real violence is not.I say, skip this one and watch "Raising Arizona."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sorry, it may be a 'work of art' as some have suggested here, but Fargo is the most BORING movie I have ever seen. You just can't care about the characters, the plot, anything! The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused. There was a whole lot of snow..a bunch of really 'meaningful' scenes including snow. Some more snow. Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it. Then there was some more snow. I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines. Fargo is boring. Fargo is bad. Never watch Fargo, not even to put you to sleep. It just isn't worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo's in a class of its own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fargo is truly awesome. It's like a light-hearted, whimsical, deeply dark and disturbing comedy-drama, or something like that. It's in a class all of its own is what I mean. There is no movie that's like it. It's really amusing and disturbing at the same time. And it's completely fascinating. And it's absolute quality film making. The Coen Brothers really put their touch on the film. I feel William H. Macy is the best part of this movie. His character is genius. And Macy really gave an awesome performance. McDormand and the 2 thugs are a close second. The cast really shines. Fargo is a true gem. It has depth, details, all the good movie making qualities you need. I feel this is one of the most powerful movies ever made. You almost have to be in the right mood to watch Fargo, because it is so dark, but if you are, it will be one of the best movies you'll ever see. I think this is a bonified, consensus classic that will stand any test of time. Fargo is so precious, just because it's so completely different from any other film. Words are unable to describe, just go watch it for yourself! Worthy of a perfect score, 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways I find this the most satisfying of all Coen Brothers movies I have seen (nine out of sixteen) and mostly the later ones. I enjoyed 'spotting' characters based on Clifford Odets, William Faulkner and Faulkner's long-time Hollywood mistress in Barton Fink but that was only one aspect of a movie that failed to grip me in total. In the case of Fargo it's difficult to identify any negative aspects in a movie that works on so many levels, black comedy, thriller, love story celebrating married love (think William Powell/Myrna Loy without the martinis and wise-cracks)tragedy. Although William H. Macey and Frances MacDormand have rightly been singled out for high praise - which their subsequent work has fully justified - the entire cast work brilliantly as an ensemble. One of the best films of the 90s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen "Fargo" and I must say that I was a bit disappointed. The first twenty minutes of this movie were very thrilling and promising. But then the film became weaker and weaker. Especially some dialogues are just horrible! Sometimes I asked myself, whether it was a thriller or a film for children learning English. The plot became boring, uninteresting and daft and all suspense went gone! The actors were quite good, the music could have been more diversified. All in all the film is not bad but the dialogues and the many deviations weaken the movie's quality a lot! It's a pity, the movie could have been much better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected to see Oscar caliber performances when I saw this film but I was wrong. I did see a film that didn't really go anywhere.There was no suspense or nobody to feel sorry for. Having said this, I must say there were isolated performances I liked from Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormarnd.McDormand's performance as a pregnant sheriff was the only positive of the film. I have to give credit to the Coen Brothers for casting McDormand in this role. As great as McDormand was in her role, she was unable to save "Fargo" from disaster. The plot of "Fargo" seemed to go in circles without any clear explanation of what is going on in the film. When something worthwhile happened it seemed to end up at a dead end point in the film. The ending of the film was a little off-kilter as it seemed to be forced.With the talented cast and academy awards "Fargo" received, it really should have been better. I can't believe the number of people who thought "Fargo" was one of the best movies ever made was so high. If it were up to me; I would tell everyone to restrain themselves from renting this awful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lightweight tragicomedy, but good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a great time watching this movie. I haven't laughed like that in front of the TV for ages. But...once it was over, it was over. In my opinion, it's really over-hyped - it's the story of Jeff (William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble...so he pays some small-time crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife for part of a ransom he will extract from his wife's rich father. When the deed is done and the crooks are hauling Mrs. Jeff to their hideout, a cop stops them for not having the right tab on their car, and is shot. Uh-oh, two innocent bystanders noticed! Boom-boom, dead too. About four or five other people have gone to Jesus by the end, and the movie centers around Marge (Frances McDormand), the Fargo police chief trying to track down the killers. Her performance was actually pretty good as a sensitive woman who is intentionally oblivious, refusing to let the horrible things she must witness seep in and bring her down. Since Steve Buscemi is here too, you can predict the tone of the comedy, which is very dryly hilarious - the point of the movie is to contrast tragedy with comedy for a haunting and bittersweet ending. An interesting idea, but the tragedy wasn't tragic enough, it was disaffected in an odd way. Normally gruesome scenes are trivialized in a way that I don't like. It would have been very powerful had you just felt a bit more for the characters. As was, it was slightly off-kilter and I felt it left you with nothing. Great fun, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is my favorite film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening shot of the film is the best. It immediately establishes how dry and strange the film is. The opening shot is just white. Eventually out of the white emerges a truck in the middle. It is soon established that what we were looking at was a road. We wouldn't have known this since we couldn't see anything that was indicating that a second ago. The plot(which the film shamelessly exclaims at the beginning is based on a true story) is pretty original. a man, Jerry Lundigard, who is behind in dept needs money. He comes up with an ingenious scheme. He is to hire two criminals to kidnap his innocent wife and ask for a ransom from her rich father. Then, when her father hands over the dough, they split it with him. The plan doesn't go as well as it should. A body count starts across the valley of Minnesota and dead bodies are found everywhere. The two criminals hideout in a cabin in the woods where they try to communicate with Jerry so they can rearrange the deal as blood has been shed by them. Meanwhile, Marge, a very pregnant police officer, gets involved as the body count rises and things get more twisted and more out-of-hand. What makes this film particularly interesting to me are the bystanders. They all sound exactly the way they are supposed to. The film takes place in Minnesota, which I am very familiar with, so the people all have accents and talk a certain way that may sound funny and quite friendly with many people who are not familiar with these kind of people. This puts the film at a really interesting angle and fits perfectly. This may sound weird to have this kind of a dark theme in a film that has such light little quirks, but somehow the Coen brothers pull it off. The theme of the film itself may not fit with many viewers. My mother rented it one time thinking that it was a comedy. She hated it. So this basically puts viewers who have not seen this film in a weird spot. The people going in to it thinking that it'll be a comedy will most likely be disturbed by the strong violence and intense feeling that this film uncomfortably radiates. The people going into it thinking that it's a thriller or a serious drama will be a little bewildered to find the film having a light sense of humor detracting from the horror and the violence. But the people going into it wishing nothing more than for it to be an entertaining film will most likely be satisfied. That being said, I really loved this movie and have watched it millions of times. There are very few people i know who, surprisingly, don't really like it. It is so weird when i see a film that, in my eyes is brilliant, but i then recommend it to somebody and they return saying nothing but how much they hated it. This film doesn't appeal to everyone. Anyway, the film's music score is so beautiful in expressing the grim looking locations and the intensity of the storyline. With it's droning violin hang downs and its low sounding rhythm, the score sounds beautiful and makes it more than worthwhile to get the soundtrack. The haters of this film have one good thing that they absolutely can't deny. The acting is completely top-notch. William H. Macy as Jerry is perfectly weaselly as the imperfect husband. Steve Buscemi(one of my favorite actors) is also perfect as the the leader of the two criminals and manages to make somewhat of a sympathetic feeling out of a wacky and sadistic guy. But it is Francis Mcdormand as Marge who truly gives the role of a lifetime as the pregnant cop who has everything to win and is appropriately cheerful when she needs to be. This film's sense of humor can be somewhat dry, but thats partly what makes the film so different. And aside from having the greatest death scene in a film since PSYCHO(1960), boasts incredible believability. This is comparable in terms of very realistic thrillers such as THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE(1974) and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT(1999), and yet can also just about stand next to comedy classics such as PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES(1987), and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL(1972). This film succeeds in spades as being an excessively violent thriller and a chuckle inducing comedy, but what it succeeds most at doing in my eyes is be good entertainment. The ending is so haunting and yet so fitting that it truly seals the deal that this film is an American classic.PROS:-Incredible originality in everything-stunning performances by the whole cast-incredible genuine horror and humor-unpredictable-the most shocking and brilliant ending to a film I've seen-gripping plot and charactersCONS:-the dry humor and the graphic violence isn't for everybody</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writing and directing brothers, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Joel, and Ethan Coen (Raising Arizona, No Country for Old Men, True Grit), I remember seeing this film once before, but I needed to see it again to really appreciate it. Basically Jerry Lundegaard (Oscar nominated William H. Macy) has financial problems, and out of desperation, in Fargo, North Dakota, he decides to hire criminals Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd). This is in order for his father in law Wade Gustafson (Patch Adams' Harve Presnell) to pay a ransom of $1,000,000, for which the two criminals will get ?40,000 of while he keeps the rest. So they kidnap the wife, but on the journey to the secluded cabin they will be keeping her in they are stopped by a policeman who Gaear kills, he also kills two witnesses who crash their car. Investigating this homicide, from Brainerd, Minnesota, is local pregnant chief/sheriff Marge Gunderson (Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Frances McDormand) who is tenacious to catch whoever committed the murders. Jerry, who did originally ask for money from Wade, which he thought he was going to get (not needing the kidnappers anymore) but didn't, gets the ball rolling for the kidnappers ransom money. Being an antagonist man, Wade is insistent that if a $1,000,000 ransom is going to be paid, he will do it himself, and of course Jerry is trying everything he can think of to make sure that does not happen. Marge's investigation leads her to the discovery that the car passing by and killing the victims was hired at the car lot that Jerry works in for Wade, he is obviously very nervous in convincing her he knows nothing about it. It comes to the money drop-off for the ransom, and Wade goes against the wishes of the kidnappers to take it himself, while Gaear keeps an eye on Jean Carl is the one to pickup. Angered by the appearance of the father-in-law and not Jerry he shoots Wade, and he ends up getting shot in the face, and after Carl leaves the parking lot, Jerry is the one to take the body of Wade away. On his way back Carl sees that the case has $1,000,000 instead of an agreed amount, so he buries some at the side of the road in the snow, and when he gets back to the cabin he finds Gaear has killed Jean. Gaear kills Carl with an axe after an argument for the car, and after questioning Jerry again and seeing him flee, Marge finds her way to the cabin where the remaining criminal is putting the body parts of his dead partner in a wood chipper. In the end Gaear is arrested for the five murders, Jerry is caught and arrested for his involvement, and Marge returns home to husband Norm (Volcano's John Carroll Lynch) and they both look forward to the two months left to wait for their baby. Also starring Tony Denman as Scotty Lundegaard, Larissa Kokernot as Hooker #1, Melissa Peterman as Hooker #2 and Steven Reevis as Shep Proudfoot. McDormand gives a nice simple performance that I can see being worthy of the accolade she received, Macy is great as the man setting up the kidnap, and Buscemi and Stormare are equally great as the hopeless but creepy criminals. The stylistic direction by the Coen brothers are brilliant, their scripting is witty, funny and full of some really good thrills, the snowy settings are worth watching, and you can enjoy both the tension and the moments that make you laugh, a fantastic black comedy thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film, , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Marge Gunderson was number 33 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was 93 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!</fullReview>

The whole auditorium with 300 people was crying from laughter!!!!! But it got even better. You know, when Steve Buscemi is killed with an axe and he, and a few other corpses are pushed through a wood- chipper??? Everybody loved that sequence!!!!! Hilarious!!!!!

But having now watched it all, I'm now really confused as to why so many people like this film to begin with and thought it was a big let down. Apart from a few scenes of felony, the majority of the movie was incredibly boring and the acting was dreadful, most of the characters were really annoying and forgettable, the character of Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is perhaps the most annoying character in the film, will you just quit saying "Yah" already... Apparently the movie also has some elements of comedy but it's all so poorly executed and it just wasn't funny at all.I honestly think that this is a very overrated movie that's so poorly written, just don't bother with it. However, I will say that I highly recommend that you should watch the Fargo TV series which is far much better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an okay film. On the plus side, the music is quite nice.I can't however really understand why it has such a high score. The story of a kidnapping gone awry is quite simple. What is quite special is how unintelligently the people in this film talk and act. Unlike most films, this one does not have really smart or powerful characters. Much of the conversations, just as in real life, is basically nonsense. So in this sense the film is realistic.The problem with this realism is however that the film can get quite boring. Time is spent on events that have nothing to do with the main story. For example, the policewoman met one of her schoolmates who turned out to have some serious psychological issues. But that guy or their meeting has nothing to do with anyone else in the film. So why that scene instead of let's say, a rabbit is sleeping very tight in his burrow?This film reminds me of No Country for Old Men. If you like that genre, you'll probably enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true moment of hilarious trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To kidnap someone and get a ransom is not an easy thing and it takes professionals to do it clean and neat. An amateur crime entrepreneur needs money for some economic venture. He wants it from his father in law who will naturally refuse to give it. So that dear amateur contacts two hooligans who accept to kidnap the amateur's wife, the very daughter of the rich father in law, to get the money as a ransom. Since the man is a car dealer, they want a brand new car and thereafter everything will go wrong. On the way back from the kidnapping with the abducted woman in the back the two hooligans are stopped because they had not registered the car that had a Dealer plate. They kill the state trooper. Two witnesses come by. They are chased and killed. Then the car that was given away has a problem with its registration at the bank or some accounting firm because its serial number is not legible on some listing of sold cars. The father in law decides to deliver the money and he ends up dead, plus a parking lot warden dies too. In the mean time one of the two kidnappers who was taking care of the woman kills her because she is whimpering, and he kills his accomplice when he arrives without the money he has buried in the snow along some cattle fencing, which causes his being killed and then put through a wood-chipper by the first kidnapper. At this moment the pregnant female sheriff from Brainerd who has been investigating the death of the state trooper in the Twin Cities arrives and arrest one kidnapper. During that time the entrepreneurial car dealer is trying to cool it off when the police comes for him. He will end up arrested too. The best Jewish thriller ever produced. When everything turns wrong. The Coen Brothers are perfect witnesses for these flunkies drop-out failing losers who are loose in their brains and disjointed in everything else. It is the Biblical Job but without any divine dimension, without the excuse of being victimized or tested by God. Just one mishap on top of another and the impossibility to stop the sinking process. And the Coen Brothers by just over-highlighting the negative events transform a pathetic character and a pathetic situation into a real funny one, not funny to the point of laughing your heads off, but funny to the point of thinking "God bless me and thanks I am not like these idiots." A classic of sorts of the Jewish humor we like.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dare not go below 4 after reading all the other reviews, I can only say, I found it rather shallow, slapstick-y and self-consciously arty rather than rooted in real-life, maybe it was lost in cultural translation, as I am not American. I thought it had a kind of clever-clever whackiness about it that I find hard to warm to. But then it is a very long time ago, I was young and maybe ignorant.I will have to watch it again to see if I have missed something, as based on my first viewing when it first came out, I just don't recognise it in these reviews!I am not sure what else to say to make this up to ten lines, but will comment again when I have watched the film a second time....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard some good stuff about this film recently so I decided to watch it and see what is was about. Unfortunately I just don't get why this movie is so praised.my main problem with this film is how long it takes to figure out the plot. The movie starts off well but falls apart because the majority of the film is spent saying "what the hell is going on" and not in a good suspense movie way but in a way that drags questions out for the hell of it. Not only that but in between all the dragging out it introduces scenes that have absolutely no relevance to the movie what so ever.Another complaint is everybody's accent. I know its mean but i really hate everybody's accent to the point that I really just wanted to turn the movie off. And why the hell is everybody so happy in this movie? It deals with murder and conspiracies but everyone has a damn smile on there face, even the people getting crapped on the entire film. Even the ending isn't satisfying.After all this though I cannot give the movie a perfectly bad score because Peter Stormare's performance, while subtle, is amazing as well as the concept of the film being original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I admit it. I like action movies. I like it when things blow up, but of course nobody is getting hurt -- they're all highly paid actors.But this story is true, and it's gruesome and violent. I can't enjoy that, and the attempt to throw in a little dark comedy doesn't make it fun. As a documentary, well, why should I want to learn the details of a sordid little multiple murder in the midwest? Unlike the topic of Schindler's List (the Holocaust), the true story itself has no overall importance or meaning. It's just sad and painful to watch.Who should see this film: -- people who like true TV such as COPS or Survivor -- people who love to hate serial killers so much that they watch everything they can about them. -- people who live near the Twin Cities or near Fargo, North DakotaCan't fault the directing, acting, nice execution overall... wrong topic though, I'll give it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

How the hell did they advertise this junk? Frances McDormand takes on Peter Falk's role of Lt. Columbo as she tracks down yet another one of the Coen brothers' intellectually-handicapped kidnappers. Experience the oohs and ahhs as you hear Northern Minnesotan accents that were done better on Howie Mandel's kiddie show "Bobby's World". Can even the combined forces of William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi can save this film from certain mediocrity? I don't think so.Calling this movie a classic is the equivalent of calling a chunk of cow flesh (with skin and hairs intact) plopped between two mounds of uncooked bread dough a classic hamburger.</fullReview>

Terrible acting, slow-moving plot, and absolutely unbelievable fools for characters (no, this does not make for a better movie. Better movies allow the audience to IDENTIFY with the characters). The only thing that could have given this movie a shred of credibility and humor was if it were based on a true story. But surprise, surprise...it wasn't! The writers/producers took a few creative liberties in this story, one of which was the intro which states that it was based on a true story.Whenever I speak to someone who feels that this was a great movie, their argument for it is typically, "Well, just think about the context. This actually happened! It's based on a true story!" Hmmm...do you believe everything you see in the movies?

		<fullReview>Without question, the worst movie I've ever seen. It isn't an issue of style - I like Tarantino movies, for example - but one of quality. The plot was unimaginative, the characters insipid (which I hate to say, because I like William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi otherwise) and the writing weak at best. There was no flow to the story, if it could be called that. The film was so bad, in fact, that we almost shut it off in the middle and took it back to the video store early - and I sat through all of 'Jacob's Ladder'.An associate of mine suggested the appeal was the constant juxtaposition of the absurd and the banal, but that's how it felt - like the writers sat there and said, 'if we juxtapose the absurd and banal, it'll be a great movie.' Completely forced and artificial.Their idea of what midwesterners sound like was pulled from thin air. Having lived in the midwest all my life, I can honestly say I've never heard anyone speak like that before. It's not an issue of being offended, it just wasn't accurate.As it is, I would not recommend this movie for anyone for any reason. There were absolutely no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever.</fullReview>

I usually like a lot of different movies, and it takes a lot to get me bored.To me it looked like all the actors just spoke their lines out of their head, and not with their heart, just as the acting itself.The events seemed like running out of control and cutting up the movie, instead of following up and glueing the movie together. There was too much emphasis on the story telling to make it look real, so the characters come over too slow.The fact that the movie is based on a true story doesn't mean I have to appreciate the movie higher than I do now. There could have been done a lot more with the story, and the attempt to 'fresh it up' a little with to some dark comedy failed imo.</fullReview>

I will not love this kind of humor behind the lines (some scenes I appreciated and I understood the meaning behind it) but overall it was boring and too foolish to say the least. many unnecessary scenes and despite this a film that barely exceeds the hour and a half of life, incredible. I do not know how to evaluate the Oscars to McDormand surely be a good test of acting, (but also other Buscemi in the first place) but not having seen all the films nominated can not do a real comparison. For the rest I do not know, when a film so short you can not wait for it to finish or that you look at him as if to say "so what's the point," there's something wrong.</fullReview>

While is not exactly a comedy, it grossly overdo the supposed to be but not so funny script and action. "OH YEAH" is funny when the sheriff interviewing the pay girls but not funny beyond that point.2. Movie is full of scenes which are not contributing to the resolve of the movie in any way. Reminds me of Antonioni's Blow-up! Not that gross but still too much irrelevant scenes.3.

		<fullReview>There isn't much to say really, and nobody in their right mind should lose a lot of time reviewing things like this "movie". I saw it when it came out and thought it was a piece of garbage - I had to force myself to see it through (I almost made it but not completely), which I wish I hadn't, but I guess I kept expecting it to give me something (anything) so as not to feel these people had made me waste my time. Actually I should be impartial and acknowledge that even being exposed to such sad cultural products as this you can learn a lot about the culture that produced it, although sitting through it can be, understandably, very frustrating. It receiving awards is just to top it off, actually, but doesn't change much of anything: Hollywood is obviously an industry and not an art school, so it makes sense that they celebrate garbage when it's what they are producing most of the time anyway, and it would be real odd if it weren't that way. Of course I'm generalizing here, but I think that anyone in their right mind will understand what I'm saying. Saying Hollywood, by the way, means referring to the directors, actors and so on (a lot of them celebrated as models, go figure) that are responsible for contributing to it one way or another - I'm really sorry for them and I'm not kidding you, as they are in a lot of risk of passing it to their children. Like I say in the title, things like this movie are more telling of the state of popular U.S./worldwide culture than a book-length sociological study - it's either what popular (mass) culture has become (if you want to put it that way) or what it has been led to become (if you prefer it like that). I leave the details of why this movie is worthless to other people that have posted it already and said it better than I could (Check them out).Another thing, though unrelated. When posting this I find a warning from the site, the "don't write a spoiler" thing, which states that, if you do, your *future* reviews will be automatically discarded. Dare I ask who would want to write a review when knowing that it will be automatically discarded? Looks like the people from this site, just like the ones that made the movie, are that type of *smart*. What do YOU think?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulative to the audience?but not how you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to deny that the vast majority of cinema?American or otherwise?is going to be ridiculously overrated by a certain group of people. When that group is the actual American population itself, a lot of negative reviews like to label the said film as "The most overrated movie of all time!" The fact is, no matter if you or I like a film or not, almost everything gets more recognition than it deserves in America. Average movies are stretched out into "modern masterpieces" simply because of the utter lack of creativity or originality in cinema overall. It's much easier to force yourself to feel contentment in something you just wasted your time and money on than admit it was terrible. It's a common misconception to "look for the good in every film", rather than actually admit that you've seen/heard everything the film showed so many times you almost feel asleep or lost interest and made out with your girlfriend for 3/4ths of the movie, then call it a great film just because the critics did. Everything I just mentioned above could be the reason Fargo is so overrated. But if you want me to be honest, Fargo is so downright pathetic, no matter how hard I try, I can't figure out why it's overrated. At all. I just don't understand it.I've seen reviews calling Fargo everything from the best movie of all time to a Shakespearian masterpiece. I read their reasoning, and I found it flat. I've watched big-name critics rave about Fargo, but even they failed to give a real reason it was so amazing. Basically, they all come down to: "Fargo was average, sure, but the humor gave it some life." And if that's the best they can think of, by their own logic, SpongeBob should be rated alongside The Godfather.Based on a true story or not, there is nothing even remotely worth watching in Fargo. It has the same exact plot as you've seen on bad TV crime drams before, and it unfolds in exactly the same way. What's the point of making a movie about a true story if it's exactly like the countless fictional stories just like it? Fargo has no originality, and next to no creativity. Sure a few lines of dialogue are decent, but who really cares? Reviewing an entire movie based on a few lines is ludicrous. The dialogue and humor both aren't even that great. If anything, it reminds me of a severely watered-down Pulp Fiction wannabe.Likewise, the heavy use of nostalgia is the sole reason this isn't playing on the women's channel instead of being called one of the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers rely heavily on nostalgia and soft-spoken characters to give off the faux sense of seeing something you haven't seen before. I always hear people calling a movie "manipulative" or "and insult to my intelligence" due to a plot twist or something that they didn't see coming. Though I usually find those types of people unintentionally hilarious, I'm going to go as far here as to say that Fargo is manipulative to the audience: it uses nostalgia to mask that it's really a dull, hollow shell. The plot is completely throw-away. A guy pays to have his wife kidnapped?and weren't we all oh-so-shocked when that went wrong? For once, I'd like to see a movie where something like this goes RIGHT and everything thereafter plays out exactly as planned. That might be interesting. Fargo, however, takes the boring, safe route and does exactly as expected of it. By the closing credits, I literally asked myself out loud: "What was the point?" I think I figured out the point. The point the Coen brothers were trying to make was that you could make the most typical movie ever, add a couple funny lines, and they'll be basking in wealth because of it. They probably even had a good laugh at the level of positivity regarding their pathetic film. Because, really, no one tries to find the faults in films anymore, just the good in everything. May I suggest that this is why we're watching Fargo and not a truly original, captivating film from these two skilled directors? If you love their crap, they're not going to waste the effort making gold.1/10</fullReview>

OK they say I have to put 10 lines for this movie but I don't event think it is worth 10 lines to say how bad. Everyone was so polite and come on that just isn't how life is. Is this how we are supposed to believe the people of fargo are, "Oh yes Mrs Police officer let be be so kind to you" And the cop, no I don't know the names I could watch this piece of drivel, was so kind and plot to everyone. This is one of the worst films ever. I would rather sit thru a Jeav Claude Van Damme film and I hate him too. Soon this film will be forgotten, like titanic, and we can move on with our lives. It will not be taught in film classes but will be shown late night on USA network cause the rights will be so cheap they can show it over and over, like Porkeys 2. Hey I shouldn't insult Porky's like that, I'm sorry. Oh by the way if this makes anyone mad and they comeback with a comment about a misspelled work or a typo, then I have proved my point on who likes the film, Jackasses!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FARGO is its own worst critic. Supposedly based upon true events, the plot is glacial and pointlessly violent and the characters are either half-realized or irrelevantly annoying (what do the fantastically exaggerated accents of several characters have to do with anything?) or both, which one presumes is intended to reflect the film-makers' vision of reality. Fine. But it's one thing to point out such a vision of reality in a film (successfully accomplished in, say, BADLANDS); it's another for a film to actually BE this vision of reality. FARGO is a dog-and-pony show, a trick film, intended to make a meta-fictional point by exploiting the film-viewer's pre-supposed moral vacuousness and lurid fascination with sex and violence. In short, it is not a film of substance and the point is that, truly in the sense which the Coen brothers mean it, only insubstantial, "half-realized characters" could be fans of it (naturally, to realize this point is to be "realized" and no longer be a fan). Looked at this way, FARGO is brilliant, but still only in the most menial, kick-'em-when-they're-down sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fargo Directed by Joel Coen"The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is still going round the sun."?George Orwell According to the opening title of Fargo, the events that follow are all true, but out of respect for the dead, the names have been changed. However, according to the last title, none of this should be perceived as true. Is this a Coen brother's commentary on what has the final say, if there is one? No, it's more of a cynical mocking of crime capers who make the initial claim based on a loophole like the last. Much of Fargo goes similarly. It executes hideous acts of violence and crime and then tries to distance itself from them by using a heavy handed police detective Marge (Frances McDormand).It's also a comment on crime genre clichés. It picks apart the idea of how in novels, crimes go perfectly. The crime here is a kidnapping of Jerry's wife which is delegated by Jerry (William H. Macy) so he can collect the ransom from his wealthy father in law. The crime is executed by Gaear (Peter Stormare) and Carl (Steve Buscemi) who will receive half the ransom and are merely looking for "some money." Part of the problem with Marge and the three other lead characters is their simplicity. Jerry is an upper class evil while Gaear and Carl are a lower class evil, while Marge is pure good. The characters in Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing on the other hand were all various forms of each, and one can sympathize with most if not all of the major characters. This film also exhibits none of the excellent precision of Blood Simple, a film some view as a prequel to this one. But Blood Simple's violence was used as a means for a point and not an end.One of the other major functions of Fargo?Like Alexander Payne's Nebraska trilogy?is to get back at the land from where the Coen's hail from, Minnesota. They make fun of the accents and rural attitudes through thinly veiled contempt. It generalizes about Minnesotans weaknesses for prostitutes and fast food, while essentially putting the joke on us for watching this violence unfold.The chaos that ensues after the kidnapping has no control system set up by the filmmakers, but is messy and ugly and only gets messier and uglier as the film goes on. But even with all this going on, the film never surprises. Its style is the only thing that keeps us interested, but the style fades in time and all we are left with is one very cynical and simplistic world view.Actually more like a 4/10, but wanted to get the comment noticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is not entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nearly impossible to sit through. It is a dull, plodding story with contrived situations that aren't even comical. There is no saving grace. But I finally sat through a showing to critique, and it could be used as a diagram of how not to make a movie for male audiences who aren't die hard Nazi party members. It's supposed to be about a blotched kidnapping of William Macy's wife, and one of the two men who did it is a psychopathic lunatic. To appease the females, and grab the large Nazi audience of the U.S., the director chose to contrive the plot so to kill any woman with hair darker than complete blonde. Women love movies that do this, since they like to imagine a world with less competition. And women usually make the choice of what movie to see in a household. The acting is horrid, too. They try to do the accent of Hoosiers and people further West, but real people enunciate much better. The accents are horrible, and show incompetence. But that is minor compared to the complete contrivance of the movie. Total flop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fargo is your average piece of trash movie! Don't waste your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those of you who find Fargo funny needs to get your heads checked. IT'S NOT FUNNY!!!- IT's so amazingly boring, the characters suck and don't make any sense. Is Macy's wife retarded for example? Are we supposed to take the movie seriously when it mixes tragedy with absurd and pointless dialog?? Soo bad it hurts - Can't believe it's on the top 250-list. Please stop holding this crap in such high regards. It's a bad old movie OK, let's move on already. Watch anything but this.REALLY, save your time and watch something funny like hot rod, or just have another go at gladiator or something.</fullReview>
