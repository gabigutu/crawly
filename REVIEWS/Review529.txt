		<shortDescription>Vastly underrated, charming movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid, I used to watch reruns of the original "Maverick" -- and so I looked forward to seeing this one when it came out in the theaters. I was NOT disappointed! Mel Gibson's Maverick is a bit more goofy than James Garner's, but is every bit as charming, sly, and entertaining. A number of excellent cameos provide some comic relief, especially Danny Glover near the beginning of the movie. But by far the best casting is reserved for the original Maverick, James Garner, who is cast in a featured role, and who has surprises in store for darn near everyone. Most movies remade from old TV series ignore the stars that made them popular enough to BE remade -- kudos to the producers of this film, who apparently know better.Other roles are filled capably; the biggest surprise for me was Jodie Foster, whom I normally dislike on screen. She is very impressive in a rare comedic role, and thankfully discards her repetoire of facial tics for a much more natural performance here. The plot is kept pretty simple until near the end -- and the end has a great twist, which I won't divulge. Suffice it to say that your time will be well spent, and you'll want to revisit Maverick country more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Richard Donner sure knows how to make an entertaining movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making entertaining movies such as the "Lethal Weapon" movies, "The Goonies" and "Scrooged", Richard Donner the man behind all those movies, brings us "Maverick", an excellent and fun 'modern' western with a fun story and entertaining characters played by veteran-actors who seemed to have lots of fun working on this movie.The best thing about "Maverick" is the 'fun' feeling that this movie has. You can tell that the actors worked on this movie with lots of pleasure and fun. Mel Gibson is a wonderful and fun leading man as Bert uhmm I mean Bret Maverick. The cast is filled with many other big names such as: Jodie Foster, James Garner, Graham Greene, Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Dan Hedaya, Margot Kidder and Danny Glover in a fun cameo.The story is really strong and full with fun twists and plenty of comical situations. Yes, "Maverick" is a real fun 'no worries' movie. Truly one of the most underrated movies.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. Forget what some people have said about Jodie Foster, she is absolutely perfect as the apparently-dumb-but-smarter-than-she-looks blonde, and the chemistry between her and Mel Gibson is superb. Also perfect are James Garner as the marshal, Graham Greene as the harassed native chief, and Alfred Molina (the Englishman who is so good as an Iranian in Not Without My Daughter and a Cuban in The Perez family) as the "Spaniard". The writing is simply brilliant, one of William Goldman's best - how anyone could describe it as "virtually plotless" just staggers the imagination. The direction and cinematography are superb. A special treat is the Lethal Weapon reprise with Danny Glover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laughed throughout this movie. Mel Gibson still managed to stay suave and handsome as usual even though his character is supposed to be "bumbling." He and Jodie Foster had amazing chemistry. I enjoyed Danny Glover's cameo and reference to the "Lethal Weapon" movies. And James Garner, the original Maverick, was a delight. The movie had a bunch of twists and turns that kept me guessing until the very end. (Mel's bathtub scene helped, too.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western That's Really A Pleasing Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good mix of comedy, drama, suspense and nice scenery all make this a pleasing viewing experience. (Most people watching this leave with a smile on their face.) This "western" is really a lot more of a comedy, but so was the TV show on which it was based. In the movie, we get some really neat twists at the end, too. Kudos also for including TV's original "Maverick" - James Garner - in this film.Mel Gibson (the "new" Maverick) and Jodie Foster play off each other well in the leads and Graham Greene has some very funny lines as a supporting player. Alfred Molina, James Coburn, Geoffrey Lewis also shine in supporting performances and it is really fun to see all the cameo appearances in here. Included in there were a couple of old-time western movie stars along with country-western singers, all at a big card game at the end.Another plus are the two songs during the ending credits. There is rousing C&amp;W rendition of "Amazing Grace" followed by a good Randy Newman song called "Ride Gambler Ride." They are worth sticking around and hearing.One negative about this film: the message seems to be that cheating, lying and just being a dishonorable person if okay if you can get away with it!! (Only in Hollywood!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most memorable absurd and rebel Western/Comedy anti-hero film of its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maverick is one most favourite Mel Gibson idol, and is truly an American icon. In the western/comedy genre movies of all time cinema history, Maverick comes anyhow in the top-5 list. After the several failures of Red Kit(Lucky Luke)'s cinema adaptation between 1991-1993; Roy Huggins's "Maverick TV-series" of 1950s' had been enriched with the Hanna&amp;Barbera vision of Lucky Luke(1984 TV-cartoon series) to integrate the whole concept of writing a new modern day Maverick by the writer William Goldman. There are a bunch of similarities between these two Western legends, but still Maverick's story was unique and impressive. Here in my review I would much rather talk about this movie itself, instead of its production values. Anyway, if you would like to share your opinions with me and everybody else, visit my message board topic with the title "40 factors that Lucky Luke and Maverick have in common".Director Donner has preferred a left-in-the-middle Adventure type opening right away in the first scene, as if it's a continuation to Maverick's adventures. His antagonist, performed by British actor Alfred Molina, has left him in a trapped dilemma; that appears to our eyes as Maverick is just about to die. As the widely known old saying says: "A person recalls his life just before he dies" , Maverick starts to tell his story to sum up the reason how he ended up being in that deadly dilemma. Under his narration, we're welcomed to a heart-warmingly told weirdo story. He's been collecting money to enroll in a Poker tournament and travelling the country through several adventures.What makes Maverick memorable and unique in style is first of all, the mood. There is a political film-noir view that we get every time we meet a new character. Every single character, even the cameos in this movie is so selfish, rebel and against the law. Robbery, racketeering, murder, gambling, bribery, deception is a must-have character profile for all. The sheriff of a town is in debt with fugitives. A credible police chief steals a $500,000 poker tournament prize from his son. A son of a police chief is a bandit. Well, his father known as the most credible police chief in Western America; and he even steals money from his own single child son. Even the most likable Jodie Foster's Annabelle character tries to steal money from everywhere, she fools every man to steal their wallet; even from a dead old poor wagon rider It's very absurd and reasonable at the same time that this is the greatest dreamy Western adventureland ever that the audience is witnessed.After this great accomplishment, who cares if there are gaps in the plot? Indians might be so friendly(especially after Dances With Wolves, all the American Indians in Western movies somehow has become very friendly). All the bandits might be sappy. Set Designs might be cheap and distracting. Audio and sound effects might be the lowest quality. But still with craggy zigzagged narrated style of editing works perfect, and thus the film always rises unexpected incidents and surprises. The zigzags of the storytelling keeps the viewers' attention on trying to find the reasons why each character chooses to do what they do. Cinematography and directing of photography are also admirable. The sceneries are taken in rivers of Arizona, uplands of Oregon, canyons of Utah, prairies of Washington, Yosemite National Park of California. It feels like a falsely guided visit to Western states; Maverick says that he's going to the poker tournament in New York, while in the actual Earth geography he's in Yosemite. This film was nominated only in Costume Design category at the Academy Awards, but instead Hugo Weaving &amp; Guy Pearce's Australian desert comedy won it.Maverick can be seen entirely by everyone. Mostly with humour and film-noir comedy of Old West, it's also worth your time for Poker/Road Trip Sceneries/Adventure/Cowboy Gunfights/Living with the Indians segments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always thought this was great. Makes me laugh no end. When he lets himself go, Mel Gibson is funny, and this pastiche of an almost forgotten TV cowboy show - complete with its original star cast in the main supporting role - is comedy gold. Better yet, this is Jodie Foster's only real brush with the comedy genre and she proves so adept at it that you can't help feeling this route would have been better than Nell and Anna And The King. The ending piles twist upon twist, and it's one of those movies where everyone involved is clearly having such a great time that you do too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of old west treachery, from the mind of the man who wrote The Princess Bride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Garner Ah, the old west. Personally, I'm not big into western movies, which would probably explain why I like this movie. It isn't a western. It just happens to take place in the old west. Maverick is the story of a poker player (Gibson) who is going against all odds to get into a championship poker tournament to find out once and for all just how good he really is.The movie starts with Bret Maverick at the end of a noose, sitting on a horse, out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the men who put the noose around his neck in the first place. Then the movie goes into a flashback that tells about the week leading up to this point. A very large chunk of the movie takes place in the flashback.Bret hasn't had the best of luck over the last week. His horse was stolen and he had to replace it with a donkey, his friends double cross him when it comes to issues of money that they owe him, he nearly gets his butt kicked after a game of poker goes sour, his lucky shirt gets shrunk, and all sorts of other misfortunes. While playing poker he meets Mrs. Annabelle Bransford (Foster), a thief who is also trying to get into the poker tournament. They get stuck riding on the same stagecoach together, along with Marshal Zane Cooper (Garner). True to Bret's luck, the driver has a heart attack and the coach goes out of control. He plays the hero and stops it of course, since he is the hero of the movie, and they continue along on their way to the tournament.They encounter a group of settlers that have been robbed by Indians, or at least who believe they have been robbed by Indians, and Bret agrees to help them get back their stuff for a cut of the money he'd be recovering for them. He finds the group of whites who were masquerading as Indians and gets the goods from them, and then when they return the goods, real Indians show up, ones that are actually friends with Bret. The encounter between the Indians and the settlers is one of the more hilarious parts of the movie.After Bret goes along with the Indians and has some interesting encounters with them, we finally catch up to the present, where Bret is dangling from that noose again. He gets out of it and makes his way to the poker tournament.I'm not going to say whether he wins or loses the tournament, but I'm sure you can guess. But if you haven't seen this movie before, there are probably quite a few things you won't be able to guess, as this movie has many different plot twists and turns along the way. It's absolutely hilarious and in my opinion, a classic.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun movie that doesn't try to be anything more than what it is -- an amiable comedy.Mel Gibson can actually manage to be tolerable when he's playing charming, which he does here. James Garner is perfectly cast for quite obvious reasons. And it's nice to see Jodie Foster lighten up and play a feminine character for once -- up to that point, her resume had been quite serious.For some strange reason, I distinctly remember Siskel and Ebert being infuriated that this film won an Academy Award nomination for Best Costume Design.

		<shortDescription>The Charm of Mel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Gibson can some times irritate me. He's just in your face too much. In this movie however, he's laid back and charming. I'm a fan of westerns, usually those heavy handed types like "The Searchers"and "Little Big Man". I was surprised how much I liked this light-hearted romp through the American West. The movie brings to mind "Blazing Saddles" and "Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid". In fact the screen writer wrote the latter film, though this one fells a bit more like "The Sting" with all its cons and scams. I also enjoyed the cinematography and locations. The movie goes from Lake Powell to Owens Valley to Yosemite and a beautiful river boat in Oregon. I may be a bit biased towards this film because I walked the set in Yosemite Valley, but I'm still giving it an 8 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As TV show adaptations go, "Maverick" is a movie that excels because of a rollicking sense of fun and good humor. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and I think everyone involved is perfectly chosen for the job. The film opens with Mel Gibson's eponymous gambler, out to prove he's the best poker player. He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). And it's a journey that will see our hero tangle with rattlesnakes, renegade Indians and even a runaway stagecoach."Maverick" is an Action/Adventure/Western/Comedy that runs high on likability and even a few great setpieces. Everyone involved is clearly having fun, and it goes a long way in inviting the audience in on the laugh. It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show. There's enough here in the engaging protagonist to keep the audience interested in the free- standing story. And what an affable hero Maverick is, a role that greatly benefits from Mel Gibson's trademark boyish charm and joking sense of humor. It's not just Gibson; Foster and Garner also show an unexpected flair for comedy. Maybe the real star of "Maverick" is William Goldman's terrific screenplay; one that infuses the movie with a delightfully wry sense of humor and lightheartedness. In almost every scene, things aren't always as they seem; and it's usually played to great comedic effect. This is the movie that made me a Goldman fan (in my defense, I haven't yet seen his greatest hits, so to speak). I found myself constantly grinning from ear to ear. You don't even have to be a Western fan to appreciate "Maverick". It's just an overall likable movie.8/10</fullReview>

He and Jodie Foster team up together and survive many amusing mini-adventures on their way to the big game, to end up with nothing! well maybe? The cast is great, the dialogue is quick and funny, and the film is littered with some great scenes.A really good romp, that is humorous throughout. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing that is deep or serious, but plenty that is entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Maverick" is a comedy Western which relates the adventures of Bret Maverick, a gambler and adventurer in the Old West. (It is based, apparently, on a television series from the 1950s, but I am too young to remember it; indeed, I am not sure if it was ever shown in Britain). Maverick wants to enter a major poker tournament, but lacks the entry fee of $25,000. The film tells the story of how he manages to scrape together the required money and what happens to him during the tournament itself, as well as his dealings with three people he meets along the way- Marshal Zane Cooper, a lawman based upon Wyatt Earp, a rival poker player named Angel (ironically, as he is far from angelic) and a young thief and con-woman named Annabelle Bransford.The film stars two actors, Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster, whom I would not normally have associated with comedy. Gibson had previously made the light action-adventure films "Bird on a Wire", and the "Lethal Weapon" films contain some elements of humour, but "Maverick" is the closest he had yet come to pure comedy. As for Jodie, while she had made some comedies such as "Bugsy Malone" in her teenage days, by 1994 she had become regarded as a rather serious, intense young actress. Her previous film before this one was "Sommersby", another costume drama set in the late nineteenth century, but much more serious.Both, however, reveal their previously hidden comic talents here, which is just as well. Neither Maverick nor Annabelle is, morally speaking, a particularly admirable individual. He is a wisecracking adventurer who lives by his wits; his code of ethics as a professional gambler might prevent him from cheating at the poker table, but he is not always so scrupulous in other areas, of his life, although he is occasionally capable of a generous gesture. She makes a living out of stealing and swindling, normally from men who are attracted to her good looks. As neither is admirable, therefore, it was important to make them sympathetic, and both Gibson and Foster succeed in this. Gibson's Maverick comes across as a likable rogue and Foster makes Annabelle sexy and winning enough for us to overlook the fact that she is a scheming minx. Another good performance comes from James Garner as Cooper; in the sort of in-joke that modern casting directors love, Garner played Bret Maverick in the television series.The film was directed by Richard Donner, who had earlier directed Gibson in three instalments of the "Lethal Weapon" franchise and was later to direct him in a fourth, as well as in "Conspiracy Theory". Donner is an experienced director of action films, and manages to make the film an entertaining mixture of humour and thrills, often combining the two in the same scene, such as the one where Maverick is desperately trying to stop a runaway stagecoach in which he, Annabelle and Cooper are travelling. Unlike some other films from this period starring Gibson (e.g. "The Man without a Face") or Foster (e.g. "Nell"), there is nothing very deep or serious about "Maverick". For all that, however, it makes entertaining viewing. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved this film, and it actually made me a Mel Gibson fan back in the 90's (I never liked the Lethal Weapon films). All of the jokes in here are spot on, the timing is crucial and perfect, and Gibson takes a rascally character you don't want to like and not only makes him likable, but funny, friendly, and charming as well. Jodie Foster is also as hot as ever as a sly thief, and I have always felt her strong character was underrated- really, how often have we seen an intelligent woman in a Western who is just as crafty as our hero, just as charming, and who plays "weak and swooning female" with a wink and a nudge while she attends to her own agenda? All around, every player in this one is enjoyable, amusing, and will go down as one of my fave five Westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a maverick main protagonist in a maverick western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the nineties, western was somewhat ditched in the landscape of the American cinema in spite of commendable endeavors to renew it like Clint Eastwood's revisionist, dusky "Unforgiven" (1992). "Maverick" hasn't got the pretensions to give the genre a new lease of life but is much fun to watch. It is one of Richard Donner's most palatable efforts in a filmography dominated by action-packed stories like the "Lethal Weapon" saga. It even predates a fashion which was to thrive in the following decade in the Hollywood industry: to adapt a TV series for the silver screen. I must admit that I have never seen an installment of the "Maverick" series.Action-packed stories are Donner's specialty and he knows his job. There are action and stunts in "Maverick" coupled with twists as one could wish, particularly in the end. They are part of a droll, fantastic story lived by a threesome of delightful actors who are linked through bickering, deceits to collect the necessary amount of money to take part in a poker tournament.But Donner goes beyond this and rehashes some distinctive elements of the western (Indians, sinister-looking killers, representative scenery like the saloon, the bank or habits like gambling) but gives them a zany inflexion. So, Donner's shooting of Maverick's incredible story never takes itself too seriously and takes often a leap into uproarious laughter. The filmmaker takes pleasure in deceiving the audience about several apparent self-explanatory actions Maverick is about to do. Towards the beginning of the film, he takes his shirt off in front of Annabelle. No, he doesn't want to make love with her but wants her to wash it (the shirt)! Or later when he presses his ear against the ground. No, it's not to hear whether the Indians are very close but "I'm going to have a rest while waiting for the white men dressed as Indians!". Needless to add that Donner has fun with the clichés linked to the western and most notably the Indians and the sinister-looking killers and it helps to produce hilarious sequences (my favorite one is when Maverick is "prisoner" in the tribe of the Indian chief Joseph).Mel Gibson is one of Donner's favorite actors and here he simply fits in and doesn't go far. He gives a lot of presence to his incorrigible egocentric poker player sometimes unpredictable in his actions. Jodie Foster and James Garner are prime secondary roles who perfectly complete themselves with Gibson.Certain of the strong points (a cinematographic genre, here the western, for fun, an assumed zany tone, a controlled direction of actors) which make of "Maverick" a prime product will leave the duo Donner/Gibson for their collective effort three years later, "Conspiracy Theory" (1997) which will deal a severe blow to the success of this collaboration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** "Maverick" is one of those delightful, whimsical, and entertaining western/comedies that demands to be viewed over and over again, as its elegant, humorous, and stylish premise is indelibly enjoyable, regardless of how many times one watches it. Talk about reviving the borderline-dead western genre from out of the dust, with a zesty mix of contemporary comedy and some of the most admired credits in Hollywood: Mel Gibson as the clever, mischievous ace, Jodie Foster as his delusory, saucy love interest, James Garner as his paternal, knacky "sidekick", and Alfred Molina as his vindictive, contemptuous nemesis. The dialogue more than fits the bill for good old-fashioned western charm accompanied with some hilarious contemporary humor that works well to identify Mel Gibson's astute, charismatic persona. The story reads as: Maverick, on a trip of desperation and hope, seeks to enter the arena of poker aboard a riverboat in striving towards the $25,000 entrance fee, believing he has nothing to lose except his distinguished luck. Along the way, he finds himself coincidentally accompanied by the likes of Cooper (James Garner) and Annabelle (Jodie Foster, boasting a very convincing Alabama accent), and the three experience one catastrophic misadventure after another, ranging from a near-death plight involving a horse carriage, to a hilarious "abduct-ion" by savage Indians. Despite the many, many disasters Maverick and company encounter, he finally ends up arriving at the riverboat to partake in a poker championship worth half a million dollars, where events continue to amusingly unfold. "Maverick" boasts fine, convincing performances by all three leads: Gibson, Foster, and Garner, a hilarious, knacky, and wild screenplay, some delightful, rich music, and some really splendid scenery of the "Old West" accompanied by brilliant makeup and costume design to situate the audience back in Western times. What an delightful, entertaining, and copious revival to the western genre, and what a fine, delicious ensemble: the spectacular likes of Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Garner, Alfred Molina, and even the late James Coburn, in such a whimsical, economic premise. "Maverick" is everything a contemporary western (and comedy) should be: entertaining, hilarious, polished, and laden with delight and surprise. **** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most underrated movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is among Mel's best. It has absolutely everything you could want for a hit. Bert...I mean Bret...is a multi-dimensional character that changes from humorous to serious seamlessly. Jodie Foster is an excellent faux-Southern belle. And James Garner plays the veteran lawman to the T.This movie has humor, but not gross-out humor. The tongue-in-cheek, James Bond/Lethal Weapon kind of humor. Like Miss Bransford looking in both of their tubs to "compare" the two, without ever saying anything. It has decent action and suspense, and the last 15 minutes has more plot turns that most mysteries.This is one of my personal favorites, one I can watch over and over again. I believe this gets none of the credit it deserves. It seems to have a stigma because most movies based on TV shows (i.e. Beverly Hillbillies) well, suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maverick (Mel Gibson) is a charming gambler who needs $25k to enter a poker tournament with at least half million at stake. It's happening in a few days on a steamboat run by Commodore Duvall (James Coburn). Maverick is a quick draw and one of the best card player. He encounters other characters like the macho Angel (Alfred Molina), the sexy con Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner). The tournament is not just about the money but a challenge to his abilities. It's one misadventure after another as he tries to gather the money together.It's a good fun western that has a nice comfortable charm. To emphasize that, director Richard Donner got 'Lethal Weapon' cohort Danny Glover to play a cameo as a bank robber. By no means is this a gut busting comedy. The best thing is the great chemistry between the film's trio.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAVERICK **** A great western-comedy. Mel Gibson plays nice guy Bret Maverick, a witty gambler whose eager to collect enough money to enter the Winner Takes All poker game championship beginning in a few days. Through a variety of comic mishaps and funny scenarios we find our hero in, the motion picture takes on a new, fresh form of entertainment. Eventually, it seems that James Garner, Graham Greene, Alfred Molina, and James Coburn all try to settle scores with Gibson through funny conspiracies and deceptions - involving snakes, ropes, and gunfire. Sexy grifter Jodie Foster keeps Gibson preoccupied in other ways. Several plot twists sustains the story's momentum and comic edge, while a wild and delightful trio - Gibson, Foster, and Garner - leads the film. Two thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Maverick' is another Mel Gibson show where the audience is constantly able to see how much fun the man has with his character. As in the 'Lethal Weapon' films, or 'What Women Want', he has the perfect actors around him to make himself even funnier. The leading lady here is the wonderful Jodie Foster. If it was not for Gibson, it would have been her film. Also starring are James Garner, Graham Greene, Alfred Molina and James Coburn. All these actors look simply filled with joy, all having fun with their part. The only negative thing about that is the awareness of the audience that they are watching performers the entire time. But then again, who really cares about that in a film like this anyway.The story is about Maverick (Gibson) on his way to a big poker tournament. He is accompanied by Annebelle Bransford (Foster), she also plays poker and is a pretty good thief as well, and Marshal Zane Cooper (Garner). On the way he gets into trouble, out of trouble, and back into trouble again. Maverick is quick with his gun but he rather talks and laughs his way out of trouble and a lot of fun comes at moments like that. Other great moments are between Gibson and Foster, a perfect chemistry for comedy, and later between Gibson and Garner, who once played the Maverick character on television back in the fifties. Of course this film is based on that series.The best moment though, comes with a cameo from Danny Glover. Director Richard Donner, Gibson and Glover collaborated on three 'Lethal Weapon'-films before this film (and one after) and when Glover walks in to rob a bank there is a perfect moment that requires you to know their collaboration on the three other films. 'Maverick' is like that scene, like the 'Lethal Weapon'-films. It has fun with every single scene not really caring about plausibility, but being pretty effective and accurate as a western as well. Art direction, set decoration, costumes and effects are all very well done. Although it does not really matter, it does help the film. This is entertainment as it should be!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the most enjoyable movies that you will watch. It's great. Mel Gibson was great for the part as Maverick. He was so funny and since this movie has so many different genres than it's hard for an actor to protray this certain role but Mel Gibson acted great. The movie had action, drama, adventure, comedy, romance and western scenes through out the movie. I think this is like Lethal Weapon in a way. It has a lot of action/comedy which is Lethal Weapon. This was a great movie and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like Mel Gibson and enjoyed the Lethal Weapon series because this movie is almost the same thing besides the plot of the two movies. Mel Gibson was great in both of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It stumbles on expectations but is nice to use up time some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns have a certain appeal that fans of the genre look for. When people think of westerns, the most common of concepts that come to mind are gun fights, saloons, fillies, booz, beards, dirt, horses, the list goes on. For movies during the last half of the 20th century, Westerns didn't seem to be as popular as one thought. In order for these types of movies to work, the right cast, director and crew had to be involved to really get the viewers attention. With previous disasters like Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate (1980), the genre took somewhat of nosedive in interest among viewers. It was later close to being killed off again after the next biggest (and strangest) disaster being Will Smith's Wild Wild West (1999). With those two bookending those two decades, there were others in between but not a whole lot. However, when learning that the director of Superman (1978) and the lead from Lethal Weapon (1987) would be working together to make a popular television western a major film, could there be a problem? It depends on how you see it.In their respective careers, both Mel Gibson and Richard Donner have made quite a filmography for themselves. Being that they are also from a time where they would remember older shows from the past seems right that they make an older property more mainstream. The script was adapted William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and Chaplin (1992)), of where viewers are introduced to Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson), a career poker player who looks to enter a major game but lacks the funds. To attain his entrance fee to the game, Maverick goes around looking for ways to make that money, leading to all sorts of comic relief events. Of those moments, Maverick comes across filly thief Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner) and hotheaded gamer Angel (Alfred Molina). Aside from the main cast, there are several other names to boot like: Graham Greene as pseudo Native American, Geoffrey Lewis playing a friendly banker, Paul L. Smith as a French Diplomat and even Art LaFleur, Dan Hedaya and Danny Glover all as gunslingers.The problem is even with this, the overall execution of the story does not feel like a western. Very few events that take place in this western setting feel like it belongs to one. Instead, much of it feels like a parody of sorts due to its tone. That's not to say these scenes aren't funny but the film's trailer presented itself as more a lighthearted western with some comedy. Not the other way around where it's all comedy and less western. This also doesn't mean the actors perform badly either. Mel Gibson as Bret Maverick has a number of good lines that make him a smart and likable character. An ongoing joke is that people call him Bert Maverick, which gets him annoyed. Jodie Foster as the slippery crime filly is fun to watch too. Her ability to trick people just by her looks makes her quite dangerous if one isn't paying attention. James Garner as Cooper has his moments as well, showing both a caring and selfish side. The most creative of the supporting characters is Graham Greene's role. It's interesting that he would play a fake Native.This could've be one of the funnier parts to the film. What if the Native Americans were just putting on a different face when talking to the Europeans? It's completely oddball and clever. Yet as unique as this is, the film suffers from an over packed running time. There are some particular parts to the story that could've been cut to help slim down viewing experience. The biggest time user of them all is the actual gameplay this movie focuses on. That being Poker. This is also one of the more surprising things about this western. One would expect that since it's a western, the climactic finale would be dealing with a showdown or some kind of deadly match. In place of that, viewers watch Mel Gibson and characters play a poker game with each other until the last individual is standing. Unless one is a true poker fanatic, no one will know how to play the game the right way. This in turn could make the game less tense. How engaging will the game actually be for a nonplayer? The cinematography handled by Vilmos Zsigmond is nothing short of great. Being that Zsigmond has worked numerous projects dating back to the early 1960s, his ability to capture the right look has only gotten better. Just like his work in Heaven's Gate (1980), Zsigmond sets the stage for amazing looking western backgrounds. That means including every bit of the land from top to bottom. There's even a great scene that involves a canyon and it looks so spectacular. Very few cinematographers can master the art of capturing all of the land but Zsigmond seems to have figured that out. The musical score composed by Randy Newman was an interesting addition as well. Considering this score was created only a year before Toy Story (1995), it's funny to hear cues that sound like they belong to Pixar's animated classic. The sound of the music is utilized with organic orchestra that has all the signature themes that only Randy Newman could resurrect. The score itself is fun to listen to and does fit the western setting.This is a fun western poker game movie but don't expect it to be more western than that. There are some shootouts but majority of the tone is comedic and has more parody like scenes than western ones. Nonetheless, the actors, cinematography and music all make it a tolerable goofy watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Maverick' is gentle fun provided you are in the mood. The film is very episodic and feels like it has been edited from a long running TV series. The pacing is unhurried, there are no huge explosions and the energy level is a bit low. This film probably won't appeal to everyone. Mel Gibson is charming in the title role. His character is more comic than heroic however. Jodie Foster is good but comedy is not her forte. ALfred Molina is adequate as the villain and James Garner, the star of the original TV series, has a major supporting role. If you enjoy comedy westerns, than it's worth watching.Overall 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedic romp in the old west.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back last century there was a TV series called "Maverick." A much younger James Garner was the star. Now Garner came back as a different character in a fine supporting role in this movie "Maverick." Mel Gibson is Bret Maverick, expert gambler and expert gunfighter, but always quick with a joke and a laugh. The basic story line is his journey to a big poker tournament on a river boat, but he needs to scrape together the $25,000 entry fee. Along the way he encounters old enemies, and makes a few new ones.One of the people he meets is Jodie Foster as Annabelle Bransford, also a fine poker player, but even better pickpocket. Then there is James Garner as Marshal Zane Cooper.It was fun seeing Graham Greene as an Indian Joseph, and he and Gibson were in some good scenes shot in Yosemite National Park. Half-dome is prominent in some of the shots. (As the scene began my wife said "That's Yosemite.") Greene was the native medicine man in the TV series "Northern Exposure." Alfred Molina is superb as Angel, who is after Bret Maverick. Always trying in vain to get rid of him, or at least prevent him from getting to the poker tournament in time.For me it was a totally fun movie. Gibson, Garner, Foster, and Molina played off each other so well.MAJOR SPOILERS: As it turns out, Maverick is Marshal Cooper's son. As the poker tournament ends it appears that Cooper turns bad and steals the $500,000 pot. But he and Maverick meet up at a spa, along with Annabelle. She disappears with part of the money, as expected, but Maverick held back his share in a different place so she wouldn't take it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Western Even Non-Western Fans Can Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of westerns. I like Clint Eastwood, and I love "Brisco County Jr." (which this is very similar to), but I never cared for "Bonanza" or "Gunsmoke" and I don't know what Gary Cooper looks like. This movie was not a typical western, though, as it sought to make itself fun and added in so many subtle references (especially the "Lethal Weapon" nod) to old westerns, country music and Richard Donner films.Hidden in the movie are Corey Feldman, Margot Kidder, Waylon Jennings, Clint Black and more. I did not recognize them. (Believe me, if I had recognized Corey Feldman I think this film would have received an 8.) Also, the film co-stars James Garner, who was the original Maverick in the TV series.The plot: Maverick (Mel Gibson) must collect money owed to him to raise $25,000 in order to enter a high-stakes poker tournament on a steamboat. Along the way, he befriends a sheriff (James Garner) and a swindling yet beautiful woman (Jodie Foster). Also, Graham Greene appears.Seriosuly, the film comes down to an endless series of fun events as Danny Glover parodies his "Lethal Weapon" role, Graham Greene plays an unusual Indian, a Russian archduke shows up for no apparent reason and many wacky card games and gun fights ensue. No excessive violence and very mild sex (this is PG, you know) make for a great time without getting too "adult".If you liked the lightheartedness Richard Donner gave to "Superman" or "The Goonies" and you'd like to see more of that in the Old West, this is the film you are looking to find. Or, as I said, rent the first season of "Brisco County Jr" - you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

There were 124 episodes between 1957 and 1962. It was James Garner as Bret one week and Jack Kelly as brother Bart the next. They sometimes appeared together. Garner left the show in 1960 because of a contract dispute. The appeal of Maverick was its humor. It was the exception among westerns. It had a great theme song.

		<fullReview>This movie had loads of famous/notorious people doing bit parts, which anyone familiar with this site's feature allowing examination of the entire cast &amp; crew might know, but one cameo that remains unlisted is Alice Cooper (he of the girl's name, boa constrictor, and guillotine) as the Town Drunk in the early part of the film when Bret Maverick is walking down the long staircase--I heard an interview with Cooper on Memorial Day weekend in 1994 when he describes his cameo as such, and upon further observation I have to admit that looks like him. However, other than Cooper (and the host of other cameos), this movie is a mixture of romance, occult, greed, and racism. Seriously--the romantic interest is between Bret &amp; Annabelle, obviously, so why bother blathering about it. The occult is Bret's obsession with being able to summon a needed card (the Ace of Spades) while gambling, and when he cuts the deck to reveal the Queen of Hearts as he contemplates his feelings for Annabelle. The greed is another obvious element--it's about gamblers, their tricks, adventures, and desire for money. The racism is certainly present--consider the scene that Bret impersonates an Indian Affairs government agent. I like this movie quite a bit, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.</fullReview>

Garner is quite good too in his role and the best comedy is born everytime he, Foster and Gibson have a feud. And of course.. there's the cameo by Danny Glover. Brilliant. The Lethal Weapon theme quietly on the background with Glover and Gibson looking at each other like they'd met in another life or something. The final laughbreaker is the line "I'm too old for this s**t". I almost forgot to mention Molina.. he, as always, turns in a terrific supporting performance. This film makes me laugh, because the chemistry between the characters.. it's just there.**** / *****</fullReview>

The animatronic rattle snakes used in the movie look completely realistic and life like. However, there are a few draw backs few of them can be noted. One is the make up for Alfred Molina. He does not look anything like himself. I agree that he is the bad guy but please not that bad. And Jodie Foster's making her escape with the money is completely inappropriate.

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia to see fine actors re-create charaters from the TV Series, "Maverick"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgia caused me to invite my wife out of the kitchen to watch a re-creation of the 1950s TV Series with really fine actors Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and the original Bret, James Garner. We were disappointed. The path to the big poker scenes on James Coburn's boat became mostly dull and tortuous although a few of the lines drew some laughter. We found that we were dwelling on the opening scene with Mel sitting on a horse with a noose around his neck and a rattlesnake spooking the horse. The next scene shows Mel riding on a mule into town. He sold the mule for a dollar and so on. How did he get out of that hanging scene? We watched a replay and still could not figure out how Mel went from noose to mule. Another distraction was the numerous trialogues, in which Mel, Jodie and James were all talking at the same time. There were some good lines in there but we missed many of them. I rate this movie a 4.</fullReview>

It's about hidden motives, outsmarting one's opponent, and getting what one wants, all the while showing no "tells". I can't think of an actress who fits the requirements better. To mistake Foster's talent as merely attractive would be just what Mrs. Bransford is counting on. If you don't give credit where it's due, you lose the pot.Graham Greene provides the most memorable scenes. He's the best pseudo-buddy of the bunch. And the cameo performances add just the right spice to this surprise stew. In Maverick, each person's wants come before everybody else's wants, they just find out too late. But there's always the next hand...</fullReview>

Based on the TV Series from the 1960s starring James Garner, the thin story deals with charming cardsharp Maverick's adventurous journey to a tournament of the very best card-players, on which he's accompanied by Marshall Garner and pick pocket Jodie Foster, he meets with old friends like Graham Greene and makes new enemies such as Alfred Molina. Sporadically funny, slow-moving and pointless as it is, the charm of enjoyable Gibson, pretty, ravishingly funny Foster in a change-of-pace-role, a solid supporting cast full of hilarious cameos (Danny Glover) and old Western regulars and expensive-looking, pretty art direction and Oscar-nominated costumes make this good, clean fun.</fullReview>

She can't play comedy well at all, plus Donner doesn't really know where he wants to go with her.

However, he finds himself coming up short of the entry fee, and between friends who owe him money but can't seem to come up with it, beautiful con-artist Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), a straight as an arrow marshall (James Garner) and a mysterious Spaniard who has been ordered to make sure Maverick doesn't make it to the big game, Maverick has his share of problems getting there. The viewer gets his/her share of laughs in the process.But of course, Maverick gets to the game, where he has to match wits with some of the best card players in America, including some of his former foes such as Mrs. Bransford, the hardly angelic Spaniard Angel. The last portion of the movie includes some great poker scences, leading up to what one THINKS is the the climax, only to find that there's another twist after THAT. And then some.All in all, "Maverick" is an enjoyable film with some interesting cameos as well, as Gibson meets with an old friend who robs a bank and complains, "I'm getting too old for this s---." Fans of "The Sting" may also see a vaguely familiar face, this time at the table himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that works both as a light-hearted western and as an plot-oriented comedy. As a whole I can say that it's a winning combination. The film never forgets what it is and never tries to pretend that it's something else. It opens on an upbeat note and continues on that note till the very end. Personally, I find that refreshing.The film leans rather heavily on its cast's ability to pull off good comedy, but luckily it got some of the bigger names that are able to do just that. Mel Gibson does a surprisingly good job as the eponymous Bret Maverick. He can be tough and convincing when he needs to be, but he can also do light-hearted comedy. He also has good chemistry with Jodie Foster's Annabelle, who's the other main character in this little romp. Her character doesn't quite hit the right notes all the time, mainly because she's one of those characters you're never quite what she's going to do next, which often makes them annoyingly unpredictable, but she's better than most her kind. James Garner does a great role as Marshal Zane Cooper, as does James Coburn as Commodore Duvall. Both are old western legends, and it's nice to see this movie giving them a respectful nod like that.I unfortunately cannot say that the antagonists of this film were quite as good. Alfred Molina's Angel especially was a bit too... obvious, I think might be the right word. Obviousness might work in a comedy such as this, but I just found him annoying and not all that believable. Still, he and his kind do their jobs and their not offensively bad, so they don't ruin the film.Aside from that the film has a good sense of humour. Most of the jokes stem from the characters and the story, and not from pop culture or lowbrow jokebooks, which is always a good thing. Furthermore, the film looks and sounds great, the action is suitably over the top and the story isn't half bad. I'd definitely give this one a watch if you're looking for a fun action-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wild West romp of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love this film. It's silly, funny, irreverent and clever, and does not take itself seriously at all. Mel Gibson is at his most charming and irrepressible, and Jodie Foster dazzles as con-merchant and petite-criminal Annabelle Bransford, Bret Maverick's "nemesis" in the story. The plot is simply that Bret has to secure $25,000 to enter a poker tournament and he has some trouble raising the money given Annabelle trying to rip him off and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner - the original TV Maverick) doing his best to stop him getting to his destination. Bret is a fast-thinking, fast-talking trickster who's friendship with local Native American Indian Joseph (the brilliant Graham Greene) gets the trio out of a tight spot and also makes for the funniest scenes of the film. Some great stunts, amazing one-liners and a shocking disregard to the amounts of money they have pass through their hands (given it's set in the 1800s) make this an enjoyable, charming and pleasing film.Amusing cameo from Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Engaging Diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a family favorite that I watched again with my girls. Mel Gibson was at his best during the 90s and is thoroughly enjoyable in this tongue-in-cheek, nothing-is-what-it-seems adventure. Jodie Foster as the pseudo Southern belle and James Garner reprising his TV role complement Gibson perfectly. The movie is presented in three acts. Act 1 sets up Gibson as the playful conman trying to earn just a bit more money to enter the "poker match of the century." Act 2 introduces Garner as Gibson's apparent foil trying both to earn the respect of Mrs. Bransford and, we gather, to keep an eye on Maverick. Act 3 is the poker match where everyone shows their true colors.Tons of fun and a great diversion. Eight of ten stars for the pure entertainment value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it wasn't really like this in the Old West but this film does fill me with the hope that at least sometimes it had these moments. This film is pure entertainment, not a historical documentary and certainly not, at any point, to be taken seriously. Maverick's (Mel Gibson's) character as a likable rogue had a surreal and very believable chemistry with Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and a pleasant nod to the "original" maverick that old standby, James Garner.The humour is firmly tongue-in-cheek and Foster does indeed "do southern" very acceptably and looks as radiant as any woman in the role could. Her unique brand of energy, injured innocence, scheming minxicity (I made that up) and twangy edginess give the part a solid and definitive profile. No man of Maverick's marque (or any other for that matter) could resist chasing a temptress of such charm, beauty and duplicity through a hundred countries to get his money back and would indeed have a wonderful time doing it.I'm not a Mel Gibson fan but this exceptional part was cast against type and Mel performed very well. As I said, the chemistry between Mel and Jodie is tangible, perhaps because they're close friends off-screen as well.Garner is solid, if a little pedestrian (don't mistake it for gravitas Mr. G), but since he's already got his (metaphorical) halo it's hard to find fault with him and particularly for his acceptably human (if feigned) reluctance to join a firefight with a bunch of drunken outlaws. Joseph (Graham Greene) is outstanding as is Angel (fellow countryman Alfred Molina who has proved himself many times since) as the kind of necessary semi-villain/rogue types that help show Maverick, no angel himself, in a slightly less predatory light.This film pretends to be nothing but what it is and that stands to its eternal credit. There's no doubt, given the cast performances, that this film was a hoot to make. Such films are vital to lighten our moods from the sombre turns they can take sometimes by reminding us that probably it was much worse in the past, and for exactly that reason, it might also have been quite a bit better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cute trick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say at the outset that Maverick is a hugely enjoyable humorous western. Coming right in the thick of Hollywood mining TV nostalgia in order to put big screen adaptations of popular TV series from yesteryear on screen, it is both a decent homage to its progenitor as well as being a very entertaining movie in its own right. It has a good, unpredictable story, an excellent cast who all perform well (especially the supporting characters), Mel Gibson makes an attractive Bret Maverick, and it is pleasing to see James Garner, TV's Bret Maverick, as Marshal Zane Cooper - such films like to place members of the original cast as a nod of approval, a way of linking the old to the new.And then the makers of this film play a trick on the audience (by which I mean those members who recall the original and are watching this film for the first time). I can't say anything about it other than that it involves confounding expectations, but it is a sheer delight when it dawns on the audience how thoroughly they have been had.I'm not a major Mel Gibson fan, but I do like this movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen any other incarnation of this franchise, nor do I intend to, so I cannot compare this to any of them. Due to personal tastes, there really isn't a lot in this that I would normally be attracted to(I won't bore you with the specifics). Nevertheless, I cannot claim that this isn't a well-done piece. The plot is good, and develops nicely throughout. There are quite a few twists and unexpected occurrences, though it isn't entirely without predictability. The cinematography is great. Editing of this is sharp and spot-on. The acting is quite marvelous. Humor in this is consistent in tone, and the timing and performances are near-perfect. The leads have chemistry. Characters are credible, interesting and well-written. The music is fitting and well-composed. Honestly, this is mainly a typical Gibson movie, set in the old West, but it's tough to argue with high quality film-making. I can imagine pretty much any fan of the male lead liking this, and it's perfect for anyone who enjoys things seldom being as they seem. I recommend it to anyone who finds themselves in either or both of the aforementioned groups. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Good as the TV Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films. It faithfully captures the spirit and format of the great television series by the same name, which (of course) starred James Garner. In this movie, Garner plays Maverick's father - very appropriate, given his age. Garner is as good in this movie as he was in the television shows. Mel Gibson is perfect as Maverick; I can't imagine anyone playing the role better. This is my favorite film with Jodie Foster, who is beautiful in it, and she ably displays her considerable comedic talent. Graham Greene is excellent, and James Coburn does a great job. A number of neat old western actors from TV and movies are visible in the big poker game, including Robert Fuller, Doug McClure, Denver Pyle, and Clint Walker. Country singers Clint Black and Waylon Jennings make an appearance in the game, and Margot Kidder is very good in her small supporting role. They even worked in a humorous encounter between Gibson and Danny Glover, with reference to their excellent Lethal Weapon film series. Old-time western actor Dub Taylor even has a small role. The familiar faces enhance the fond memories I have of watching Maverick on TV every Sunday night when I was in high school. The multiple twists at the end of this film are very similar to the finale of each TV episode. I look forward to watching this movie often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Donner brings back Maverick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I've never watched the show Maverick with James Garner in main role. Maybe I'm too young, but I also don't remember anyone saying that that show was played here in Croatia. So, my first introduction to Maverick was through this movie and I have to say that I enjoyed it.Well known director-veteran Richard Donner made great and funny movie. He definitely knows how to make this kind of movie (remember "Lethal Weapon" series). Donner included Mel Gibson in this project and in my opinion he wasn't wrong. Gibson is great in main role. So fresh and funny portrait of Bret Maverick. Jodie Foster is Annabelle Bransford, talented and funny thief and original Maverick James Garner plays Marshal Zane Cooper. There are also great roles for James Coburn, Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and all others. I think that every single actor in this crew made an excellent job.My favorite scene is when Gibson is talking to Lewis in a bank. And when robber comes in and look at Gibson and says to himself it couldn't be. Just like Gibson does with his face. Robber is Danny Glover and that is Donner's dedication to his serial "Lethal Weapon". Actually as long as you don't take "Maverick" too serious, you'll have fun. Cause this movie is only made to entertain you and this is great connection of western and comedy brought back to life by Donner and Gibson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the West Was Fun! (How cliché is that?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old West was about three things: thieves, women, and cards. All three are the basis to the 1994 western comedy, Maverick. Based on the 1960s TV show, Maverick details the events of Bret Maverick, a card playing, woman charming, gun fighting smart-ass played by Mel Gibson, as he heads to St. Louis for the big, half million dollar winner-take-all 5 card draw poker tournament. We see Maverick try to collect on debts owed to him by a variety of characters on his way to St. Louis. There is the banker, who is robbed while he is there and features one of the many cute cameos, this time by Gibson's Lethal Weapon partner Danny Glover, who utters the famous "I'm too old for this s---!" as he tries to get on his horse. Maverick also need to collect from his Indian friend, played by Graham Greene of Northern Exposure fame, in a truly funny scene. The Indians in the film have embraced the stereotypes that often appear in movies to make money for themselves. Along the way, Maverick is paired with a fellow conman, or rather con-woman played by Jodie Foster. With a thick, phony southern accent, sometimes we forget it's Foster on the other end of the playful banter that she and Gibson share. Also on the trip is Marshall Zane Cooper, played by James Garner, who played Bret Maverick in the TV show. Cute, isn't it? Alfred Molina plays a shady Spanish poker player, and James Colburn plays the tournament organizer. The poker scenes are fun, though it's doubtful so many great hands would actually come up when they do in a 5 card draw game, but I digress. Several country music stars have cameos as poker players, such as Clint Black, Vince Gill, Waylon Jennings, and Kathy Mattea. Directed by Mr. Lethal Weapon, Richard Donner, the action sequences look great, there is true intensity to a run-away wagon, and the vast vistas that is the Western United States look wonderful as well. It's a fun movie, one that is well acted and funny as well.</fullReview>

She had a playful personality in her role as a con-woman that was fun and attractive, plus it didn't hurt that she's gorgeous in the old-fashioned dresses and hairstyles of the period.Very enjoyable and very funny.

		<shortDescription>One of the most under-rated movies of the nineties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I know what you're thinking: "Maverick" is one of the best movies of the nineties?? But, if you haven't seen this movie, why not give it a try? Based on the popular television series, Gibson plays Bret Maverick, a comedic, sarcastic, and especially not-so-brave poker player about to enter the southern All-Rivers Poker Tournament, in which the lone winner will receive $500,000. However, Bret is still short of the $25,000 entry fee and the tournament is only two days away. What unravels is a series of comedic, outrageous, and dangerous obstacles, ranging from friends unwilling to pay Bret the money they owe him, to a villainous Spaniard (Alfred Molina) out to stop Maverick from entering the game. No matter what, the movie keeps you guessing as to what Bret will encounter next and who exactly is on his side.Jodie Foster stars as Annabelle Bransford, a distrusting female hustler, James Garner as Marshall Zane Cooper, a law enforcer with no tolerance for tomfoolery, and James Coburn as the Commodore, in one of his last great performances. If you're looking for a Western that's a little more light-hearted, "Maverick" is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maverick is a hilarious western comedy. Mel Gibson stars as a cool guy who is just plain funny. Practically everything he does makes you laugh.Review: The movie storyline is basically this: To get to a poker party on a fancy steam boat, Jeff (Mel Gibson) must gather $25 grand. The movie is about him on his way to the party and as he tries to get enough money in time. Along the way he "meets" a guy named Cooper, and a girl who are both on their way to the party. The girl also needs more money, so along the way they both try to get some. Jeff's hilarious personality and his constant antics are just plain hilarious.Objectionable content: PG is a bit of a mild rating for this movie. While there isn't enough bad stuff to make it a definite PG-13, there is quite a bit of language (d*mns, SOBs, a**es, etc.), and one scene with Jeff and the girl in a bedroom kissing passionately (Jeff is seen later without his shirt, but nothing else is seen) and other times there are some suggestive things said. A few people are shot at, but do not seem to be injured very much.Conclusion: All in all this movie is an absolutely hilarious comedy set in the wild west, but could be a bit more innocent. Because of content, it might get an 8, but it's such a great movie I couldn't give it less than a 9. It might have gotten a 10 if it didn't have so much bad language and a few of the suggestive instances. Kids under the age of 10 probably won't get much out of it, and it's probably not appropriate for them. Ages 11 and up would probably like it, but because of the content I would recommend it for teens and up (who are almost guaranteed to love it).Extras: The DVD has several language options for captioning, some behind the scenes clips, and both the pan-and-scan and widescreen modes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson plays an ace-card player in the Old West who runs into all sorts of trouble on his way to a riverboat poker championship; James Garner (who played the lead in the popular 1960s television series) saunters through non-plussed as a marshal; and Jodie Foster is lovely but miscast as a con-woman (Foster is too intelligent a presence to passed off as this klutzy cutie-pie). Gibson's appeal isn't harmed by the recycled slapstick, and the film's tone is certainly genial, but the narrative and director Richard Donner's flashback structure are obtrusive and uncontrolled. Lots of country-western singers make irrelevant cameos, Margot Kidder appears unbilled, but Linda Hunt (Gibson's "Year of Living Dangerously" co-star) had a supporting role completely dropped in post-production. The results are a bit disheveled, and Donner doesn't seem to know when or how to quit. The squirrelly energy does lend the movie some big commercial appeal, and Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is breathtaking. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

Garner portrayed Bret Maverick in the original series, so obviously, he was quite happy with his "protoge" Mel Gibson's performance.From this movie, I came up with the term "a Maverick ending". I don't know if this was the first movie to do what they did with their twist, but it's certainly one of the most delightful ones. I just remember seeing it for the first time and laughing so hard I fell out of my chair.

		<fullReview>This movie accomplishes something truly amazing: It starts out almost pretty good, with some semblance of the format of the original Maverick television series (1957). I started off thinking it might be a 7 rating movie, but every 10 minutes of so it gets a notch worse. A good movie should make you want to watch it within the first 10 minutes -- 5 if it is done by a master. This movie makes you want to turn it off after the first 10 minutes -- 5 if you have a sensitive stomach. If that's the way you feel, my advice is trust your gut. This movie is a gold-plated piece of coprolite. The greatness of the original Maverick series was in the classy, clever writing. Try watching another TV western from that era and you will see a lot of gunfighting, chases, cattle drives and covered wagon trains, ad nauseum. Maverick had a formula, and a lesson for life: appearances can be deceiving. But in this remake, the deceptions are glaringly obvious and not at all clever. What James Garner is doing in this is not entirely clear, beyond the obvious window dressing. He never gets a chance to act. Back in the Fifties, Warner Brothers cheated him, and Garner left after two seasons with the help of a lawyer. Watching Warner so cluelessly bollixing this movie version, with Garner standing right there available for advice which surely was not sought, probably left Garner with some small satisfaction: There was only one James Garner as Bret Maverick, and Mel Gibson ain't even close. Let me give you a clue, Mel: the secret to Garner's Maverick was in his voice more than his face. Garner had an incredible voice (try watching Maverick TOS with the picture off). Mel, you aren't even in the same league with Jack Kelly's Bart Maverick, which I thought was excellent. Kelly and Garner were a sort of Yin and Yang that balanced things out week to week.This Warner movie makes Garner look like he is senile. To clear that up, just watch Space Cowboys, made six years later. Hmmm, I wonder what would have happened if Clint Eastwood had directed Maverick, the movie?As I have tried to watch this over several days, it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse. It's not just Mel's fault. I can't really blame Alfred Molina, who is a great actor, though I can't for the life of me figure out what his role is in this picture -- who is he and why does he hate Maverick? I don't like Jodie Foster's cloying over-acting. I have no sympathy for her character, which is not how the original series played the women. Usually, Maverick helps out some lady in distress, though you aren't always sure who that is going to be. Here there is just one obnoxious woman, aside from the bizarre wagon train of ugly missionaries -- what's with that? So the bulk of the blame must fall to the director, Richard Donner, and the writer, William Goldman. Sorry, Maverick is not Superman, nor Princess Bride, re-set in the wild West. The Indians speaking in 21st century lingo was close to the last straw. Is this a remake of F Troop in disguise? As I say, it just keeps getting worse and worse. There is no integrity to the script; things just happen for no particular reason, aside from a cheap gag. Gibson's Maverick doesn't think his way out of trouble, he just sort of stumbles along. Except for his super-human ninja-level fist fighting and Superman-level skill with a pistol. This is Maverick as a cartoon character super hero. Well, I have watched 1 hour and 20 minutes of the movie, and my movie rating has gradually dropped from 7 to 3. I am afraid if I watch the last 40 minutes, my rating will be minus 1, which is not possible on IMDb. If I were being paid to write this review for IMDb, I would grit my teeth, take an Alka Seltzer, and do my best to watch the whole thing. As I am not, I will cease this masochistic movie torture. Let me give other viewers a bit of advice: If you like this movie version of Maverick, you will love the original TV series F Troop. If you liked the original TV series Maverick, don't bother with this movie. The only thing the two have in common is the title and the studio. But do watch Support Your Local Sheriff. That is the closest thing to a Maverick movie, with some great supporting acting by Jack Elam and Bruce Dern, et. al. It is wonderful fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maverick is a film that is based off the old 50's TV Show also starring James Garner, but in the titular role. I thought this film, while not very substantive, was quite fun to watch. This is an ideal escapist movie and it is clear that everyone had a good time making the film. The film is funny, has plenty of action, creates poker games that are fun to watch, and have brilliant movie/television references (ahem Lethal Weapon ahem). Richard Donner's film is about a man named Bret Maverick who is a gambler bent on conning people. He is on a mission to raise nearly three thousand dollars to enter a famous poker game. But many things get in his way such as a beautiful thief woman, some rattlesnakes, and some misfit Indians along with other scenarios. I thought the film was well-acted. Mel Gibson clearly had fun in his role and is less serious than many of his roles, even the Lethal Weapon series. Jodie Foster did a great job as Gibson's sidekick, and they had great interplay with each other. James Garner does a great job as the main lawmen and Alfred Molina as Gibson's main rival. Overall, Maverick is a stylish, entertaining movie that celebrates how over-the-top and giddy the film is. It is one of those films that has a goal to entertain and it succeeds by far. It is also a Western movie, and a fine one at that. This movie almost plays as a spoof of Lethal Weapon and James Bond, which is always good in my book.My Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this fun entertaining film, u laugh a lot, and I didn't expect to before watching it, boy was I pleasantly surprised!! This film just does everything right, whenever I watch it I always feel great while watching. The Wild West is a very fun place in this flick based off an old TV show. Jodie foster was probably my favorite character. But let's not discount Mel and James, they were fantastic together! Laughed and had a heck of a lot of fun with this movie. If your looking for a serious john Wayne style western, then this isn't for you, try True Grit if that's what your a fan of. So round up the family and get ready for a really fun night with this comedic western flick!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under Rated Fun Romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being reminded how good Mel Gibson was in "Expendables 3" I have been looking back at some of his earlier movies since. And Gibson is on top form as Maverick in this fun western romp recreated from the character James Garner created in the 1950s TV program "Maverick"Plot In A Paragraph: Maverick is a gambler who needs three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward. He joins forces with a woman gambler Annabelle (Jodie Foster) as the two head to enter the game.I often felt Gibson was under rated as a comedic actor and he is clearly enjoying himself here. Jodie Foster looks as attractive as she ever had on screen, whilst always talented, "attractive" was never a term used to describe her.The original Maverick James Garner has a supporting role and James Coburn is on fine form. Alfred Molina does OK as Angel, Whilst Corey Feldman (what happened to him from the days of Goonies, Lost Boys and Stand By Me) pops up as a bank robber, as does Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon co star Danny Glover. In my favourite scene in the movie Glover's and Mel Gibson's characters appear to almost recognise each other. The Lethal Weapon movies were all directed by Richard Donner who directed this movie. During their appearance on screen, the Lethal Weapon theme song can be heard, and as Glover departs he says "I'm too old for this s**t", a line his character used frequently in the Lethal Weapon series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Maverick', directed by the legendary Richard Donner, is a genuinely entertaining film, that also manages some good laughs in the goings-on. The film is stylishly directed, wonderfully photographed &amp; features a Fabulous performance by cult actor, Mel Gibson. Set in the American Old West, Gibson stars as Bret Maverick, a wisecracking gambler, on the way to a major five-card draw poker tournament. But on his way to reach his destination, he is faced by a women thief, a villain who wants to track him down &amp; a legendary lawman. Based on the 1950s television series of the same name, created by Roy Huggins, 'Maverick' turns out to be Good Fun. The Screenplay is well-written and packs in several interesting moments. The Witty One-Liners, are hilarious and keep your interest alive. Donner's direction, like always, is effective. He has directed the Grand Climax, with style. Cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, is wonderful. Editing is sharp. Costume Design is pitch-perfect. Performance-Wise: Gibson, as mentioned, delivers a Fabulous performance as Maverick. He gets his comic timing spot-on and plays his part with rare ease. Jodie Foster is efficient, as expected. James Garner is top-notch. Alfred Molina &amp; Graham Greene are decent. James Coburn is terrific in a brief, yet substantial role. On the whole, 'Maverick' is an entertaining film, that is definitely worth a watch. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maverick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapons 1-4), this did look like quite a fun western, and I noticed some good names in the cast, so I was certainly going to try it. Basically Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) is hoping to save up $25,000 to enter the big Winner Takes All poker tournament, and he is $3000 off the amount he needs. While trying to get the rest of the money, and practising his poker skills, Bret meets Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster), a cunning con artist, and they seem to be quite a match. Bret is making one or two enemies, including with Angel (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina), but after a long while of missing opportunities of money, and some fights, Bret does raise the money for the game. The full prize for the winner is a full $1,000,000, and in the end, Bret does win with a royal flush, but Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner, played Bret Maverick in the original TV series) decides to take the money himself, only for us to find out he is Bret's father in the end. Also starring Graham Greene as Joseph, James Coburn as Commodore Duvall, Dub Taylor as Room Clerk, Geoffrey Lewis as Matthew Wicker, Paul L. Smith as The Archduke, Dan Hedaya as Twitchy - Riverboat Poker Player, The Goonies' Corey Feldman as Bank Robber and Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover as Bank Robber. Gibson is likable as the lead character, Foster has her small moments, and it is mainly the poker games that are most fun to watch. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. Worth watching!</fullReview>

The chemistry between them is wonderful. SPOILER ALERT:One of the BEST gags in the movie is during the bank robbery scene. Danny Glover plays one of the robbers. As he is holding Maverick (Gibson)at gunpoint, Maverick reaches out and pulls down his mask. They look at each other quizzically, then both go "nah" and shake their heads and look away. Later, as Glover is riding off you hear him say his famous "Lethal Weapon" line..."I'm too old for this s***!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to survive the west by wits alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviewers thought that this movie was jilted and had no really direct plot, and that may be so, but I still liked it. Parts of the movie were confusing and didn't really make sense, like what exactly was happening at the end, but it still didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.Maverick is based on a old TV series of the same name, and actually has the actors from the original staring in it (especially the guy playing Zane Cooper). The movie is based around Brett Maverick (Mel Gibson) who is trying to get $3000 so that he might enter into a poker championship on a riverboat and the adventures that he goes through trying to get there. Maverick goes through so much, that it would take too long to explain all of them, so I will just settle with talking about Maverick's character The reason I like Maverick is because of Maverick's character. He is a gambler, a smoker, and a champion bluffer. He does not survive in the west by his skill at brawling or shooting people, but rather his wits. He uses his ability to bluff to the extreme, and also his skills such as speaking an Indian language, and the money he has in his pocket, to not only survive, but to survive well off. He may not be a good shot, but he is a very fast draw, and he uses his fast draw to intimidate people into thinking that he is a good shot as well, but what he won't do is get into a direct fight, unless he knows that he is going to win.This is a cool little movie, and quite enjoyable from my end of things. As I said, the ending seems to fall apart as it does not have any reason for why the things happened, and just seems to be quite confusing. If they had reworked the ending, then it would have become a much better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maverick is directed by Richard Donner and written by William Goldman. It stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner, with support coming from Alfred Molina, Graham Greene and James Coburn. The music is scored by Randy Newman and Vilmos Zsigmond is on photography. It's based on the 1950s television series of the same name and the plot finds Gibson as Maverick and follows his attempt to take his place in a major five-card draw poker tournament. With Foster and Garner in tow, there's plenty of adventures and misadventures along the way. After Costner's Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven had reignited interest in the Western genre in the 90s, Richard Donner and his team felt the time was right to unleash a light hearted Western on the mainstream audience. Timing was important, as was the casting, but Maverick is the sort of family friendly fun that could in truth be released at any time in any decade and still be a hit at the box office. It's not particularly clever in narrative or themes, but with its blending of action, romance and comedy seamlessly coming together as a whole, Maverick is practically hard to dislike. Even the cast seem to be having a real good time, with Gibson smooth and roguish, Foster dainty yet spunky and Garner (the original Maverick from the TV show) offering up a sort of stoic maturity over proceedings; with all three playing the comedy with ease (how great it is to see Foster in such a role). Donner and Goldman have also shown respect to both the TV show and the Western in general (check out those lovely landscapes), while it's always fun to play spot the numerous stars in the cameos. Harmless fluff, then, but always watchable and never once over reaching itself by trying to be something it's not. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably underrated but charmingly quaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A worthy little film on the far west the way we can see it today, a big farce. Everything is false. A woman is playing poker and picking pockets. A Marshall is robbing the bank of a poker competition, with the agreement of the organizer. All kinds of players who are cheating and trying to win with weapons or violence, or even unfair padlocks. Indians who are organizing wagon train attacks for some dollars and the killing of some fake Indians still for a lot of money from a Russian ambassador. In one word everything is false, a big lie and a big laugh between or among the gun fire and the bullets. And yet all those crooks are trying to steal one another and the only woman in the tale will get the last word, except that she will only get a small part of the stake. Never put all your eggs in one basket. The only real interest of this film is not to show you what the far west used to be but to make you enjoy a comedy about it and that comedy is of course absurd. And that's why it is funny with some good actors who can play surprise and fear and joy and pleasure (you see the one I mean) and horror just as if the rattle snake under their feet were a real rattle snake. It sounds like one all right but it is nothing but a fake plastic rattling device and it won't bite. Even though they had a rattle snake tamer on the team, or rather because. I guess he is the one who dubbed them for the rattling to sound really real. Speaking of Canada Dry. Well we are in the country of the saints, Saint Louis and so many others down to New Orleans.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maverick has a whole lot of trouble getting to that poker tournament.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a rather good western movie, a genre that I am not the biggest fan of. Granted, in the case of this movie it is more of a comedy so that helps this one rise above the typical western movie in my eyes. So does the cast as you get Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, and Alfred Molina as well as veteran actors James Garner (who played Maverick on the television show) and James Coburn. The story has Maverick in the middle of a rather unpleasant situation, you get to see what led to that as the movie unfolds to show you how he got there and then proceeds to show what happens afterward. Maverick is trying to raise the cash he needs to enter a huge poker tournament on a riverboat, but alas he is having a lot of difficulty. Not only does he have to deal with an over the line rival named Angel (Alfred Molina) he also has to worry about a nice gal that seems to have taken a liken to him, or the fact that she can dupe him at almost any turn. There are also thieves to contend with as Maverick gets tricked into lending a helping hand and mad crazed Indians as well. All this before he gets into the tournament where there are so many double crosses it gets rather funny. So yes, this one was really funny and it had its moments of action as well. It never, however, takes itself to seriously as the actors seem to really be having fun with their roles in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Gibson's Bret Maverick, Jr. could belong in the television Maverick family, which included Bart, Brent, and Beau, but not to James Garner's Bret Maverick. The old television Maverick was, in my view, Garner's best role. I love Jodie Foster whose roles are usually playing someone who is or seems to be in over her head, and she's not too bad in this as Annabelle, but we might want a more casual show of confidence from this sly coquette, though some of the original show's female hustlers played as easily on their own appearance of being un-confident, as they did and then didn't, upon Maverick's intent to be a gentleman towards them.It's clever to have James Garner show up as "my old Pappy," but the line that inspires it doesn't really get played. The television program was filled with its in-jokes, the most notable were about Dad. The fill-in-the-blank line "my old Pappy used to say..." is a defining wackiness, a common source of all kinds of folksy wisdom, some obvious, some insightful, and some totally cockeyed, the nature and display of which leads us to wonder if any of these quotes actually comes from Dad. And Dad's exploits, as rendered by the Maverick brothers, add up to a bizarre collective unconscious more than a human being. There are two times I can remember when our curiosity about Pappy is addressed, once when we meet a stranger identified as Pappy, as it turns out, only to set up a hustle, and the other time, Pappy has apparently reincarnated as a slightly tamed crow, hopping around town and engaging humans a bit. Garner's secret connection as Dad in the movie is hardly the oddity we would expect from "my old Pappy" of yore.The oddest mismatch, however, was the disappearance of the theme song. It isn't unusual that the music from an original doesn't make to the remake, but the film was written with the television theme song in mind, which has the chorus lines: "Riverboat ring your bell. Fair-thee-well Annabelle..," although the TV show may never have had an Annabel character. With the song clearly in my head, I laughed when it turned out that the movie would be with a lady named Annabelle and it would climax on a riverboat, but, as it turned out, the theme was a no-show; the film lacked any acknowledgment or reference to the song. Another victim of an unnecessary re-write, some frivolous cost-cutting?Graham Greene's character, a larcenous Indian, though minor, was probably the best in the film, and the humor of his role was probably most typical of the spirit of the TV show. The visual comedy of Bret's hanging is not so bad, either.If you liked the movie, you'll love the 1957 television series. If you liked the TV series, the movie is not utterly without merit. As my old Pappy used to say...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course, this western spoof is based on a successful TV series of the same name that delighted audiences back in the '50s. James Garner created the easygoing character of card-playing ladies' man Bret Maverick when the show first aired September 22, 1957. It effortlessly mixed cowboy action with laughs and ran until 1962. Due to a contract dispute, Garner walked out on Warner Brothers in 1960. Evidently, he has let bygones be bygones, as he turns up in the same studio's big-screen Maverick some 34 years later. As droll as ever, Garner plays lawman Zane Cooper. The part of Bret has gone to Mel Gibson, and he fills the Garner boots quite slickly. Add to the mix an adorable Jodie Foster as a con woman who can't keep her hands off a wallet or her bustle out of a card game. A big hand for the little lady.Too bad Maverick runs out of steam on its way to the big poker showdown that is about as exciting as a pair of deuces. A broadly played mid-movie digression featuring Indians and a German archduke is especially dumb and slows things down to a trot. There is a delightfully deadpan performance from Graham Greene, however, as a chief named Joseph, which carries us through. Danny Glover makes an unbilled appearance just for a few easy laughs with Lethal Weapon co-star Mel. The script is by William Goldman, and the many cons and lighthearted twists are reminiscent of his work on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Yahoo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bret Maverick is not the most honest of men but he is at least charming and talented. Seeking enough money to enter a big poker game, Maverick heads into a small town where he joins a game involving, among others, Mrs Annabelle Bransford and a tough guy called Angel. He wins the game but makes very few friends in the process ? quick talking his way out of trouble. He falls in with Annabelle, even after he realises that she is just a thief and con artist like him. With an uneasy dislike and distrust of one another they head out of town on the same stagecoach as lawman Marshal Zane Cooper. Maverick ends up stuck with them as he tries to raise the money to enter the game ? how hard could it be?Anyone coming to the film should know what to expect because this is not a film that Mel Gibson, full of seriousness, would make now. No, Maverick comes from a period when he was very much the action hero with a naughty glint in his eye and his tongue in his cheek. Thus this film is very much in that vein and as such is rather superficial silly fun that can be enjoyed if you come down to its level for two hours. The plot is nothing more than a series of comic adventures involving Maverick on his way to try and get into a poker game, which makes up the conclusion to the film. In this way it won't make for a great character study or narrative but it slides forward with a slick sense of fun that is suitable for a hollow American summer movie ? which is just what this was. I quite enjoyed it because, after a long day at work I just wanted to sit and veg out in front of something not too demanding.The cast are part of it working. Gibson naturally dominates the film with his "three stooges-lite" routine and, although he is very simplistic, he matches the tone of the material at least. Foster is a nice presence but comedy isn't really her thing and although she tries hard she never really convinced me. Garner just rolls though the film letting his presence and charisma carry him ? it is a lazy performance but it works. The support cast are mostly good with nice turns from Molina, Greene, Coburn and Hedaya among a few others.Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination ? the plot is hardly good enough to give it that name but it is quite comic and enjoyable regardless. Try the first ten minutes ? if you haven't gotten into it by then then you should probably bail out because it doesn't get any better or different for the rest of the film. A fairly bland film but quite enjoyable for what it is.</fullReview>

Along with James garner i found denver pyle and James coburn very friendly to me as i had pictures of me taken with all 3 individually.

Jody Foster, a fine dramatic actress, has no gift for comedy, and the chemistry between Foster and Gibson couldn't ignite a match, let alone the screen.

		<shortDescription>Silly and predictable, OK if you're in the mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of those cheesy comedies Burt Reynolds used to do for his own amusement more than the audience's (perhaps trying to reinvent his image), except now it's Mel Gibson taking a shot at slapstick comedy. It's named after (and ostensibly based on) an above-average comedy western TV show of the '50's, but other than the poker games, the presence of the original Maverick, James Garner (in a different role), as well as some stock dimwitted bad guys, the movie has little to do with its progenitor. Most of the time, Garner and Mel just mug for the camera. You'll see some other stars who apparently had nothing else to do that week, and dropped by to act silly for the camera as well. It was nice to see Jodie Foster willing to poke fun at herself and have some brainless fun for once, but her character is hopelessly mired in routine clichés that even she can't generate any life from. The same with James Coburn, and Alfred Molina. Everyone seems to be just clowning around aimlessly, with little attention or effort for characterization. The closest thing to plot you'll get is everybody trying to outsmart each other in acts of skull-duggery, which starts to wear thin after a while. Poker game outcomes can be recited by the audience an hour before they occur; you even get the routine final winner-take-all hand in which everybody has a high hand at the same time. The movie's best comic bit is a clever satire of "Dances with Wolves," but this scene has almost nothing to do with the rest of the story. A by-the-numbers walk-through, with little originality. It can be enjoyed, if you switch off your brain to watch. Certainly not the best work for any of the principals, though.</fullReview>

One of the best scenes in the movie is when Danny Glover comes running into a bank and is robbing it. Gibson looks strange at him - " hasn't I seen this guy before? " - in the background you can hear LETHAL WEAPON -melody, fantastic scene!Director Richard Donner ( LETHAL WEAPON ) does a nice job and the whole movie is great. Funny, dramatic, entertaining and good-looking. Mel Gibson is wonderful as Maverick and the story is pretty easy.The Wild West. Bret Maverick is a gambler with style, he does never cheat and is a good player. He meets a young and pretty woman that also gamble. This two people doesn't really like each other but soon they get together with Sheriff Cooper by their side. They now start a hunt for 250. 000 dollars! That's what you gotta pay to even get to play in the poker championship! Entertaining and laughing western - comedy. Really nice and as always, Mel Gibson is very, very good in his character See it!

		<shortDescription>fun quirky Western, featuring a 'not so mad' Mel Gibson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a reason why Mel Gibson has appropriately earned the name 'Mad Mel'. It's not only because of his antisemitism, but rather the majority of characters he portrays are angry bastards; hence you have films like Lethal Weapon, Random, Payback, The Patriot, an decently Edge of Darkness. As it happens there is also a lighter side to the guy. In Maverick, Mel is not playing Mel, he is playing Maverick. Getting absorbed into the role, and having fun with his fellow cast of memorable names including Jodie Foster, James Garner, and James Coburn, he allows us the viewers to have fun. When it's funny, it's funny and when it's exciting it's exciting. Unfortunately when it's lame it's lame. Good thing then that it is almost never so, only in the final fifteen minutes which are an exercise in utter contrivance and coincidence, which is sort of aggravating. In the end it doesn't ruin a fun western experience. Comedic westerns are few and far between, from the classic Blazing Saddles, to this year's Gunless. Maverick is another worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maverick is an excellent example of why silly humour works but stupid humour doesn't. It is at its best during the verbal and physical sparring between Mel Gibson and a likeably feisty Jodie Foster, but also occasionally plumbs the depths of incredibly unfunny ridiculousness. Viewers familiar with the previous films of Gibson and director Richard Donner will appreciate the 'in' jokes liberally scattered throughout, and there are also some cameo appearances from a plethora of well-known country and western personalities. Western movies aren't produced in such great numbers as they once were, so the setting is a refreshing change from the generic cityscape so often used in comedies. Donner pokes fun at the dusty landscape and makes use of its well-worn stereotypes, but also hits some uncomfortable home truths, such as the displacement of native Americans. But the spatial setting is only peripheral to that all-consuming game, poker. Bret Maverick wants to enter the All Rivers poker contest; the stumbling block being the entry fee of $25,000. As it is, Southern belle Annabelle Bransford is all too willing to relieve him of what cash he has. Chaperoned by respected lawman Zane Cooper they set off on a madcap money-hunt through the Wild West, helping stranded missionaries and avoiding old foes out for vengeance (including an unbelievably stupid sequence involving a Russian archduke with a penchant for killing). The plot meanders along for three-quarters of the movie's length until suddenly we are bombarded with multi-layered double-crossings, which may require a second viewing to satisfactorily disentangle. However, the final twist in the tail is likely to leave the viewer with a grin, just as it does Bret Maverick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, "Maverick" is the big screen version of the classic TV show, which, like the movie, starred James Garner. As a film, it's a mixture of adventure and screwball comedy. These two genres are not immune to mixing, in fact the Golden Age of Hollywood was filled with movies like this. Unfortunately, the attempt to recreate this kind of a movie is not entirely successful.Bret Maverick (Mel Gibson) is a professional gambler in the Old West who is looking to enter in huge poker game with a $500,000 pot. Unfortunately, he's $3,000 short. So, with his would-be companions, a pickpocket named Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshal Zane Cooper (James Garner), he sets out to collect the money that is owed to him by his cronies. Of course, nothing goes quite according to plan.The biggest problem is that the film just isn't that fun. The comedy isn't as clever or as funny as it thinks it is, and the action sequences aren't particularly exciting. Part of the reason is that "Maverick" feels like a series of skits loosely connected by a simple story. The film needed some serious tightening up at the script and filming stages.The art of making an effective screwball comedy has been lost in time, and try as he might, Richard Donner wasn't able to resurrect it. A screwball comedy relies mainly on timing and energy. Donner isn't able to gather the two requirements of the genre to make it work.All three actors are skilled thespians, and neither of them a strangers to comedy. It's not surprising that Gibson, Garner and particularly Foster are effective, but they could have used a better script. Foster is especially delightful as the mischievous Southern belle (or at least that's what she makes herself out to be). James Coburn is good in a small role as the head of the final poker tournament. Character actor Graham Greene fares the best as the Indian fed up with having to act like the cliché of the Indian for a rich foreigner. That scene has some of the biggest laughs (when it doesn't feel like a sitcom).It's not a complete bust, there are some clever moments here and there, and while gut busting laughs are few, there are plenty of moments that are worth a grin. It is however, a little too convoluted for its own good; the twists eventually become too numerous and tiresome, and they drag the movie on for far too long.If anything, "Maverick" proves that there is a difference between attempting at something, and succeeding at it. It accomplishes the former, but not the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun at times, but this movie is so scatter shot it grows quite tiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes it's nice to get your mind out of current events and problems and find a movie that is just fun straight through. This movie could be the ultimate fun film, being a western with absolutely no drama and a whole lot of comedy, and this movie does draw quite a bit of attention with it's great looking sets and a pretty hilarious performance from Mel Gibson, but in the end, this movie is just too stupid to be consistently fun. The plot is ever changing and there is no center to the film, and really in the end it's just a bunch of goofy ideas thrown together in a western comedy. Maverick (Mel Gibson) is a trickster westerner con-man who knows how to sweet talk the ladies and throw enough sarcasm in each sentence to confuse everyone else. While trying to get to a high stakes poker competition he gets in some trouble with the locals at a gambling establishment, and along the way also meets Annabelle (Jodie Foster), who he distrusts as he should. Along the way even farther he meets Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner). The three of them get into old western wacky shenanigans, and many sub-plots ensue as the film fails to find a center.If you can't tell, my main problem with this movie is it's lack of center, and ever changing situations. You never have any idea who's a good guy, or who's a bad guy, and everybody in this movie is a trickster with a gun up their sleeve. The character's are all pretty entertaining because they are so goofy, and Mel Gibson gives an amusing performance, as does everyone else, but the constant silliness grows very tiring. This movie's style of humor is very reliant on physical comedy, and it seems more often than not that these character's are imitating Kramer from Seinfeld. And the ever changing plot with every character acting the same way is not a good thing. It really makes this movie grow to be tedious.This whole movie has this unrelenting fast pace, which is good considering this movie clocks in at over two hours, but when every scene is fast paced, it makes the movie feel even longer, as the action just keeps coming and coming. It is fun at first, but just becomes somewhat of a bore by the end, and in the end, this movie just isn't very good. The twist after twist at the end seemed like they were really running out of ideas, until we get to the actual end, where it's obvious they're just out of ideas completely but want to stretch the movie another ten minutes. Overall, this movie has it's moments. It's silly and funny at times, but all too often it's just dumb silly and grows boring. Mel Gibson is charming however, and fans of western comedies might enjoy the silly comedy and rip snortin' gun fights. Otherwise, watch the first thirty minutes, and you've seen enough.My rating: ** out of ****. 125 mins. PG for language and violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: A card player in the Old West tries to win a cards tournament worth $250,000 but finds that someone is out to stop him.MAVERICK is a big screen adaptation of the old TV show about a gifted card player (and crook) in the Wild West. After learning about the tournament Maverick has to raise the $25,000 entrance fee, which is what he spends most of the movie doing. He finds himself chased by villains, hunted as human prey by a mad Russian noble and alternately assisted and hindered by a female grifter and a leathery old lawman. He also meets a bunch of post-modern Indians but the jokes are pretty thin and it only serves to pad the movie out far beyond what it ought to have been. The leads are good, the script fun and the direction competent yet the film never quite suckers you in. There are enough fights (OK), plot twists (a goodie at the end) and jokes to keep you going but it doesn't lift off and a good half-hour ought to have been left on the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable pantomime, less than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of us who remember the original series - and it wasn't all that memorable - and for those of us trying to forget 'Bird on a Wire', Lethal Weapon', etc., 'Maverick' is the usual romp through a series of predictable setpieces, that seem to have been brought in just about on budget. It's not undemanding though; there are several points where I found myself wondering what on earth the point of a scene or character was, particularly the 'Russian prince' (was Alfred Molina not frightening enough? What did he do to upset the costume department?). Others on this board have pointed out the swathes of plot redundancy draped all over the movie like carnival bunting. In that, Maverick plays like an episode of the TV show padded up to 2 hours. There is certainly not enough of a plot to sustain the interest of anybody over about nine years old: we know how it's going to turn out - Gibson might as well be Norman Wisdom for all the jeopardy he's in - so the only question is how Goldman will write his way out of the obstacles he puts up; the hanging dénouement is particularly weak. There is no character development because Bret is the same annoying, smug, self-regarding brat, yes Brat, at the end that he was at the beginning. Jodie Foster does her best with a part that must have been cut and pasted from the original series - maybe James Garner had it in his boot all this time. The sequence of throwaway twists at the end is not reward enough for sitting through this glorified TV movie. Your kids might enjoy it and if you like Mel Gibson you'll like it too. If you're after being otherwise entertained for two hours forget it.</fullReview>

Utterly lame from start to finish, Donner is surely the worst of the worst in action comedy, and owe his fame to the kind of folks who kept the Bob Hope Specails going.  Vilmos Zingmond, one of the true heroes of American film, makeseverything look great. Randy Newman participates in something as venal andcrass as anything he ever made fun of with a satirical song. It's interesting to watch the utterly miscast Jodie Foster, though. As for Mel, he better hope the almighty is very forgiving when it comes to self-indulgent, stink bomb would be comedys.

		<fullReview>If you were to watch this film on mute, you may get more out of it. The plot is erratic. Perhaps in 30 minute chapters it would be a better production, but in film format the plot jumps around and loses cohesion.This should be called "crazy ways that Mel Gibson tries to make $3,000." It plays out more like a serial than a film. The characters don't behave in such a manner that the viewer buys their actions. Maverick and the Indian Chief especially. The final poker scene's great tension is spoiled by what follows. I won't write a spoiler here, but the twists that follow the game negate the entire set-up.Not a great film, but it has it's moments where the viewer does get a hearty chuckle. MANY cameos. Incredible, breathtaking backdrops during the sequences shot at Yosemite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jodie Foster Is Great Comedienne. Who Knew?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's one main reason for tuning in to this loud and bawdy version of the TV show 'Maverick' which originally ran from 1957 to 1962, and that's Jodie Foster. Heaven knows what she's doing in this typically confused confection helmed by veteran hack director Richard Donner but she's a godsend to the movie as a female shyster of dubious reputation, complete with batty eyes and dodgy southern accent ('most gentlemen enjoy my Southern'). There's absolutely no doubt Foster is a terrific actress. Oscars for 'The Accused' and 'The Silence Of The Lambs' as well as grounded performances in genre pieces such as 'Panic Room' are sufficient testimony to that fact. But we rarely see her doing comedy and, on the basis of this performance, she should lighten up more often. As with her dramatic performances, she has great instinct and fantastic timing. With more than a hint of Irene Dunne (another superb comedienne), it's a great pity she's not paired with someone who has better comic abilities than Mel Gibson. This movie has the dubious honour of containing one of Gibson's worst performances. He's much better in dramatic roles ('Year Of Living Dangerously', 'Gallipoli') where he can't show off rather than the action-comedies that he seems to prefer. Unfortunately, he just can't resist these buddy pictures and the cronyism is complete with Richard Donner on board who panders to Gibson's worst instincts. Gibson mugs and apes his way through this and there's no one behind the camera trying to tone him down.Donner is clueless. He seems to think that simply populating the cast with recognisable faces from other similar western TV series is inherently funny. Proof of his lack of subtlety is Danny Glover's embarrassing and completely unnecessary cameo. Double-take, followed by triple-take - apart from being totally humourless, I'm surprised we weren't treated to flashing subtitles saying: 'hey look, it's Danny Glover!'. Luckily Gibson's scenes with Foster have a certain amount of frisson to them (as if Gibson momentarily seems to understand that he's dealing with a professional). Also, on the positive side, James Garner (the original Brett Maverick, fact fans) manages to get through it all without embarrassing himself (although he has one or two dodgy moments).This is an undemanding enough waste-of-time if you can stomach Mel Gibson at his worst and a Director about whom David Thomson memorably said: 'Mr. Donner has made several of the most successful and least interesting films of his age. And one doubts it's over yet'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maverick is a Western about a gambler named "Maverick." He has super powers. He can't lose at cards, has super fighting skills, can beat anyone to the draw in gunfights, and has ESP. He's not likable, and has a superiority complex bigger than the muscle bound heroes of other movies. In fact, he begins the movie by spotting some card players money, then beats them in cards, and then beats up an entire town. This makes the viewer wonder why he didn't just beat u the entire town to take their money in the first place. Of course, there's no logic in this movie, and Gibson's portrayal of Maverick gives him an aura of the afore mentioned superiority complex. Since the main character isn't even remotely identifiable, and there's never any challenge, the movie is of no joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another example of a film apparently made for the sake of simply presenting some popular actors on the screen without any regard towards plot, creativity or story, and then waiting for the box office profits to roll in (which, unsurprisingly, did not happen in this case). The simple attraction of box office stars (in this case Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster) is never an adequate substitute for a reasonable script, and when the actors are aware that they are just along for the ride (and paycheck) the smugness can be unbearable. That describes "Maverick" in a nutshell; (another more recent example would be the remake of "Ocean's Eleven").In yet another tired remake of a once popular old television show, "Maverick" sports James Garner as its best gimmick: Garner played the title role of the old TV Western "Bret Maverick", in which the smugness and cleverness of the lead character were to take the place of the usual fistfights and gunplay of the standard westerns of the era. In this version Garner is a lawman policing a poker competition (hosted by James Coburn)in which Gibson and Foster intend to participate. The point of the movie seems to be more for the viewers to locate and recognize country singers and other actors who appear briefly in cameo roles and catch other inside jokes (such as the appearance of Danny Glover reciting his catch line from the "Lethal Weapon" movies)than to actually follow the thinly strung together storyline.The film reaches its lowest point (among many such possibilities) with a plot foray involving some handy Sioux Indians, (led by Graham Green, no less, who is his generation's Chief Dan George, appearing whenever an American Indian is called for in a script). Here the smugness requires Indian Chief Green to speak English and generally carry on as any regular 20th Century (white)American might, with the requisite historically anachronistic politically correct "wry observations" on the plight and exploitation of the noble red man with his old pal and confederate Gibson. It's not funny, and in fact is even more pathetic and insulting to the Sioux, and to Green himself when one considers Green's famous portrayal of a noble Lakota in "Dances With Wolves". (Is he parodying himself in advance?)The movie and script are dopey, but without charm. It's a poker game with a stacked deck (metaphorically speaking) with everyone playing to the audience with a wink and a nod. It's as much a western as the old "F-Troop" TV series, but with Gibson's wild-eyed mugging for the camera instead of Larry Storch. The climactic poker game itself lasts just one hand, as the double and triple crosses stumble over eachother long after after should care, and yet the film drags on until its final "surprise". Deal me out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really stinks. The humor is sad, the plot is predictable, the script unoriginal and most of the acting (if it can be called that) is centered around Mel Gibson making the same facial expressions in every scene. At best it deserves a 1. Lets see, where to begin? 1. Jody Foster's entire role is pointless and could have been edited out to make most scenes less lame. Even the ones she wasn't in. It appeared as if she only stopped by the set on her way to acting lessons. 2. This movie should have been called: Mel Gibson Makes Funny Faces For An Hour And Thirty minutes. 3. What is the actual point? Why have Mel win, the Dad then steal the money to only meet up with Mel anyway? Why didn't Mel just win and he meet his Dad afterward? Why even go through the whole thing in the first place? 4.Why was Alfred Molina the bad guy? He was just doing the job he was hired to do! He was the only guy who wasn't a scum bag! Having said that, Molina's outfits were ridiculous to the point of pointlessness 5.Was this movie about awesome scams or was it about Mel Gibson making faces? 6. The entire scene with the 'friendly natives' acting as a side show for a dim-witted Russian prince was even more pointless then Jody Fosters role and Molina's costumes combined.I'd rather eat broken glass covered in lemon juice then ever watch this complete waste of physical matter again.
