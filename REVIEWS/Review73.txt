		<shortDescription>Was This Supposed to Be a Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly don't know what to say about this horrendous, terribly unfunny movie except I wish I could get my money and time back for the waste that was this movie. Here is a suggestion - watch the movie before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing. I guess the other two people in the room didn't think it was very funny either because I never heard one person laugh for more than a moment. I think I laughed more while watching "Hannibal." Do not go to see this pile of crap. It was awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have given this movie a 3/10, but the lower rating is from sheer disappointment. This movie had such a great idea, but was executed so poorly.We see a hard-working mom of two with the stereotypical doof-ball husband, dealing with PTA moms who seemingly have nothing better to do than make her life harder.Aside from the TERRIBLE acting, horrible cringe inducing dialogue, it just wasn't funny. The countless crappy attempts at "humor" fell flat on their face over and over and, had I not been with a friend, I would have left after 15 minutes.But I had to endure a SAGA of ridiculous story lines, and so many loose end tie ups. By the end I was actually willing the movie to stop so I could leave.Just, so awful. Terrible performances, a terrible script, a disgrace to the film industry and moms everywhere. Save your money and your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good premise but everybody's so rich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!!! I laughed at Cethryn Hahn the most, she's great! lotsa great stars made appearances, chick flick it is and i was prepared to enjoy the premise of the movie. but everyone was so rich and lived in Huge houses and they had no money worries. I couldn't imagine going to a bar, getting bombed, then going to a grocery store to run around and destroy food without being hauled to jail. that was over the top. i was hoping to see more women of color, but Hollywod is so color-blind, more diversity please! at least there was Jada Pinkett-Smith. Loved Mila Kunis but she played a mom with a part-time job, 2 kids, in a Big-foot house, yeah...not believable! and then riding off into the sunset with friends on one of the friend's husband's private jet...please!! i shoulda saved my little hard earned $30.00 and waited for HBO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bad Movie for Moms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.The worst thing about this movie, which is obvious from the opening monologue, is that it is corny. The story is corny. The characters are corny. The jokes are corny. The only audience that might let them get away with this cheese-fest, is mothers, because they will be able to relate.This movie has its moments, but the majority of its laughs fall flat. Particularly bad were a couple of different montages, specifically, one of the girls drunk grocery shopping. Most disappointing is how unfunny Kathryn Hahn is, it seems that every word that comes out her mouth has to do with sex.This movie also fails to follow some of the basic rules of a screenplay. The characters speak for the writer, not for themselves. The main conflict doesn't even come up until half way through the movie.The brightest spot of this movie is Kristen Bell's character Kiki, who is a weird stay at home mom. She provides almost all of the enjoyment you will get out of this film. JJ Watt and Martha Stewart also have funny cameos.I would not recommend this movie unless you are a mother. If you are anything but, avoid this train wreck at all costs.Game of Thrones SPOILERS BELOWThey also spoiled Jon Snow's death for the sake of a mediocre joke. Not Cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Moms is a "Bad" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tried much too hard with the overuse of raunchy, vulgar unnecessary humor, which cheapened the movie, which caused this film to be nothing more than an overrated B Movie embarrassment. I am not a prude by a long-shot, it just didn't work. Just a badly written movie. I couldn't even utter a chuckle or a smile from these God awful flat jokes. All I could do, was roll my eyes with disbelief. Painful to watch. This movie "could" have been SO brilliantly funny, witty, and adorable. What were the writers thinking?? It's definitely..... NO 'Hang-Over' movie. How could anyone remotely compare the two. Ouch! What can I say..... It was just WRONG on every level. Lastly- The first movie I ever walked out on, and demanded a refund. Thank you AMC Theaters for the credit. I wouldn't have paid $5.00 at a cheap show for this mess. psst. Mila Kunis- I really like her. But this movie destroyed her comedy appeal. Please rethink your visit, before you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A failure with some nasty hateful parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another example of how a good comedy is far more difficult to make than a good drama or action flick.I was dragged along to this movie by a friend hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggested. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on the beloved Hangover franchise. It has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has.The ugly gag about uncircumcised men is particularly nasty and reveals a mean spirit considering that circumcision rates are declining in the USA and currently at only about 60%. So that's almost half the domestic population that has been insulted by the dirtbags responsible for this disaster. What pathology is behind this scene one can only guess at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ABC Family + Frat Boy Humor = Worst Possible Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wanted a silly comedy for a night out with my best friend. We knew the movie would be bad, but this was so so so much worse. I find movies funny when they contain some authenticity. When I can say, "Wow, this is over-the-top, but there's a shred of truth here." Ummm, no. This had the same sentiment as an ABC Family movie, but mixed with the worst frat boy humor available. I doubt whether the writers have actually met mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this? Please make this movie again but with actual characters and an actual premise. Make it somewhat believable or at least make it funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an avid film goer, I like mindless comedies...... Rarely have I watched a "comedy" movie and not laughed through it's entirety.... Congratulations Bad Mom's you have made one of my rarer lists! It is a horrible example to set for anyone young actual mothers. It is unfunny to the point of being over the top trying too hard! The entire party scene has been done and beaten to death! The whole penis thing was unfunny and borderline sexist in it's own right. Some of the actresses have done very well in other parts, but here they all just sort of fall flat. It's a shameful movie and one I hope they are ashamed to have their names attached to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inconsistent laughs in a comedy of parental duty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Penned by the writers of "The Hangover" (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore), this was a film I went into with really, really low expectations. But it was better than I expected it to be.Mila Kunis (which we already know means "Fine" in Navajo) plays Amy, a normal working Mum (albeit clearly living in a hugely affluent neighbourhood) with a no-good husband and two kids. Amy is at the end of her tether, and as parents haven't we all been there? After one particularly dreadful day she uncharacteristically heads for a bar and forms a firm friendship with hen-pecked wife and Mum Kiki (an excellent Kristen Bell) and the potty-mouthed and kick-ass Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Making a pact to not follow convention they decide to be "Bad Moms" which brings them into direct conflict with Gwendoline ("Anchorman"'s Christina Applegate), the tyrannical head of the school Parent Teacher Association and her fawning sidekicks Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith, "Matrix" sequels) and Vicky (Annie Mumulo, "Bridesmaids"). As attacks get personal, Amy is forced into standing against Gwendoline for the PTA chair and a battle royale ensues.From the film's publicity, I expected this to be a "3 go mad in Vegas" style of romp, but it didn't head in that direction. True that there is one very funny and well-cut scene of craziness in a supermarket ("Kids, we're going to have to find a new supermarket"), but the film has a more thoughtful tone reflecting as it does the stresses on working parents exacerbated by the need to conform to social mores.It would be dangerous at this point for me, as a man, to appear sexist and misogynist, so I will quote (and credit) my wife here in commenting that the film is like a "Next Generation" movie to 1987's Diane Keaton vehicle "Baby Boom". In that film Keaton's character has to juggle a corporate working life with unexpected child rearing: something still relatively unusual in those days (yes folks, things have changed a LOT for the better in 30 years). "Bad Moms" skims forward to today when being a working parent is almost a given, but the characters in the film view that maybe that swing has gone too far - that there is not enough time for them to treasure and nurture their kids. Here the film does slip into sexist territory in featuring all the struggling "Moms" as predominantly female: the one single Dad (hunk and love interest Jay Hernandez) never seems stressed or out of his depth.So, there is a good concept in here, but to be honest it is not particularly well executed. Given that it is supposed to be a comedy, the limited laughs supplied are well distributed throughout the film. It's more of a smile-along than a laugh-along.The film is also pretty inconsistent in tone, flipping as it does from the leads being "Bad Moms" to being lovey-dovey "aren't my kids adorable"parents. For a UK audience I would suggest that there is way, WAY too much sickly hugging of kids going on. And - without spoilers - the denouement at the ending is far from satisfying.On the plus side, it is technically well delivered, and looks like bloody Shakespeare compared to the truly execrable "Dirty Grandpa". The editing is slick and the music choice and music editing is particularly good. Some of the performances - especially those of Bell and Hahn - are great. And a particular nod to young Oona Laurence as Amy's daughter who carries her part really nicely.In terms of the lead, Mila Kunis wouldn't seem to be a natural choice for a comedy part, although her performance is kookily watchable (that might just be the "fine" influence on me). A low point however is a post-sex scene where Kunis appears to have been watching ABC News rather than doing any sort of strenuous horizontal jogging (not that my wife noticed this as she was MUCH too distracted by who was acting on the other side of the bed). If anyone puts together a top 10 of unconvincing movie sex scenes, this is a strong contender.Comedies are very personal things. Might this one be right for you? I would suggest that if you are not a parent, you should probably skip it and wait for the TV showing - - many of the situations are those that only parents who've been through the more hellish moments of child rearing will relate to! It's also not for the very prudish. There is a lot of bad language, a bit of nudity and drug references, although it doesn't quite descend to the same gross-out level comedy of "The Hangover" or a Farrelly brothers film.A final shout-out to the goofy final credits, done in "When Harry Met Sally" style, where the actresses real mothers talk about whether they were good mum's or not. (Cue more hugging).(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review, and to make comment. Thanks.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lighthearted slapstick comedy on the shaming of stressed-out moms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The shaming of women is a global phenomenon that unfortunately is part of everyday life. Filmmakers, media and marketing industries prey on women's anxieties about their bodies, and motherhood is another favourite target. While the documentary Embrace (2016) calls out body shaming, the comedy Bad Moms (2016) calls out the impossible standards to which modern mothers are expected to conform. Laughter carries this message more effectively than polemic but make no mistake: while this film is funny it also has serious things to say. The plot line is all too familiar. Over-worked mom Amy (Mila Kunis) is always running between the needs of her spoilt two children, a lazy husband, a part-time job, homework, school rules, and endless extra-curricular activities. The kids are overscheduled, over-controlled and over-indulged, and like too many parents everywhere, the homework is for Amy. When she ditches the husband for having a cyber-sex affair her already chaotic world nears breaking point. That's when the pushy cabal of PTA perfect moms and yummy mummies insist on ever-more elaborate cake-bakes. When she publicly quits the PTA, the snobby dominatrix president Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) launches a vendetta against Amy and her kids. She retaliates by campaigning for president and the internecine warfare between mom camps escalate in hilarious ways. Deserted by the school, her nearest friends become her emotional anchors and all give themselves permission to party and carry on. While the story is predictable and at times corny, the underlying issues are totally real. The slapstick comedy softens the pointed message about just how powerless mothers are against the onslaught of unrealistic expectations. The bigger irony is that so many movies perpetuate the myth of the perfect mom without even questioning the existence of the perfect dad.This film is obviously targeted directly at stressed-out moms but dads should watch too. If nothing else, it exposes the gender inequality that persists in parenting and the bigger injustice of 'perfect moms' shaming other moms for not meeting politically correct standards. When Amy gives her election speech and confesses all the ways she is a bad mom she starts a sisterhood chorus of bad moms all needing to offload their guilt about the things they have not done for their children. While it's always possible to find aspects of a film that could have been made better, this film deserves praise for going in to bat for the most honourable profession on the planet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and motherhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this new comedy from the writers of "The Hangover", you can expect drugs, sex, bad language and lot of drinks. If you have watched "The Hangover" then you know what I mean, only that this time we deal with motherhood and women in crisis. There are some laughs and some sentimental (nothing too serious though), but they are not enough for making a forgettable movie. But it's an entertaining comedy and the performances are funny and not so bad as... the moms are. It's summer time and a movie like this seems ideal- I wouldn't recommended to watch it with your kids because of all that mentioned above. Motherhood is difficult but still you can have fun. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In your own head you are not only supermom you are also a martyr that would sacrifice everything for your family.You are ridiculously hot, you do everything at home and at work (literally) and without you the world would come crumbling down, yet you are under appreciated and treated like dirt.All in 6 inch heels, flawless make-up and not a hair out of place...The movie is what Hollywood thinks soccormoms fantasy themselves as. They would break away from their roles and be "bad girls" for a day and that would bring balance back to the force.I didn't mind the cliché however the humor here is really either hit or miss. You'll either stare in silence at the screen going "what? was that supposed to be a joke? It looked painful/offensive/silly" then there are the jokes that land and those are really funny in comparison... they don't happen often enough to cover for the bad jokes though.Harmless enough of a movie if there is nothing else on but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Feminism Film of Summer 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ghostbusters was slaughtered and fed to the wolves in terms of box office because the feminist twang to the franchise was not well-received in the least bit. Some complained it was pointless, some complained it was just milking a franchise that is heavy in nostalgia, and others complained that it was pandering to the female-driven audience as opposed to the fanbase that had supported the franchise in the first place. Despite the good critic reviews, it became a major loss for Sony, and killed any hopes for a sequel.Bad Moms on the other hand is the little summer film that could, taking a $20 million budget and already matching that amount after the first weekend. And with strong word-of-mouth and good reviews it continues to make decent money in a crowded summer schedule. This film also has a heavy feminism touch, yet hasn't received the male-bashing you've been seeing from Ghostbusters. And that's because the film from the ground up was made for moms, made for female millennials, and doesn't hold anything back and keeps the focus on the ladies.Led by the screen writing duo that penned the clever original Hangover flick, Bad Moms is a cinematic stress ball for mothers around the world. It follows a trio of ladies fed up with their stressful lives and start rebelling against the norm. It starts a revolution amongst the community which counters the strict clockwork ways of the PTA---leading to a culture clash against its leader. The plot isn't anything drastically revolutionary, but it has a lot to say about modern society's difficult expectations for mothers.With the plot being slightly thin, it gives plenty of room for the main cast to go vulgar, go nuts, go raw, before ultimately getting the point across. And Kunis, Kristin Bell, and especially Kathryn Hahn knocks it out of the park with timing, delivery, and a good range of emotions to boot. Mila Kunis' character rises from humble soccer mom into a wild force of nature that results in crazy parties, rebellion against her children and deadbeat husband, and even nachos for breakfast (my hero). Step aside men as most of the focus was on the relationships between mother and child, with men popping in only once in a while. Then toss several funny scenarios, a wild cheap wine scene, and a couple fun cameos, and you'll be seldom bored at the chaos that emerges once the second act rolls in.This movie definitely isn't perfect. The tone gets slightly uneven, the soundtrack is overindulgent, and the final moments doesn't quite match the comedic wrecking ball of the second half, but if you are a mother this is your guilty pleasure. The cast is too fun, the movie doesn't slow down, and it gets unapologetically vulgar and uncut and doesn't let go.Mothers: Bad Moms tailors to you, speaks to you, represents you, and challenges societal beliefs held against you. And prepare for the final scene once the credits roll in---it wraps up the motherhood themes perfectly. You can't just switch genders on a film and try to staple a feminism theme and expect it to work---you need to fully commit to your audience and also explain what your 21st century movement is all about. Otherwise it feels like a gimmick. Ghostbusters was simply trying to ride the wave of feminism. Bad Moms actually has something to say, which is why ultimately amongst the flaws and hard-R rating it actually works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very very unsatisfying film. While it had plenty of moments of comedy that I did laugh at and a number of one liners that worked well. The whole thing fell flat for me. The story was absolutely laughable, and not in the positive way. The climax/feels moment made me feel absolutely nothing because it was stupid to begin with. The love interest of the movie is forced and could be done without entirely. Just almost every plot point was unrealistic and forgetful. To the critical mind, this film falls way short of being anything special. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. So unless you fall within the first bracket and are a film lover, this is an easy pass, ladies and gentleman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moms FTW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So we've had Bad Neighbours, Bad Teachers, Bad Grandpas, either Bad Santas, and now, Bad Moms headed up by Milas Kunis who has come a long way since her breakthrough, Forgetting Sarah Marshall back in 2008.Hangover/Change-Up writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore both write and direct this comedy and is gladly an improvement from their first main feature 21 &amp; Over. Interestingly, the director of the Hangover trilogy also has a release at this month; War Dogs.&nbsp;We see Kunis come under pressure of being a mother of two (probably three if you include the immature husband played by David Walton) and constantly fighting against time and perfection to be a good mum. Especially under the watchful eye of the impeccable mothers Jada Pinkett&nbsp;Smith, Annie Mumolo (well maybe not so much Mumolo) and uber bitch Christina Applegate who happens to be head of the PTA.&nbsp;Things go from bad to worse for Kunis and she snaps, going from trying her damn best to breaking all the rules and forms an unlikely alliance with not-so-ideal moms Kathryn Hahn who is outrageously crazy and has the best lines of the movie and fellow Sarah Marshall star, Kristen Bell who's the innocent, under-the-thumb mum that needs to break free and grow some balls. The only common traits they share is the mothering instinct for their children and the hatred of trying to be perfect moms.&nbsp;We see a more human Jay Hernandez than his recent Diablo from Suicide Squad and I was quite happy to see Kick-Ass' Clark Duke playing an immature and demanding boss, someone else Kunis had to mother. But it's massive shout out to Oona Lawrence, who plays the highly-strung daughter, obsessed with being on the soccer team and in real life, who happens to be in two major releases at the cinema at the same time; the other being Pete's Dragon. You go girl!&nbsp;It boasts an superb soundtrack with current dance tracks from Demi Lovato, Icona Pop and DNCE, especially the supermarket sweep scene and the sorority party, the craziness from Hangover really shines through.&nbsp;It's quite long and while it gets a little cheesy towards the end, it still projects a good underlining message, same kind of feel good feeling I experienced from Crazy, Stupid, Love and there's a nice touch during the end credits with the stars own real life mothers joining them on the couch sharing their own experiences at motherhood. It's funny, entertaining and certainly one of the better comedies I've seen this year.&nbsp;Running Time:&nbsp;7 The Cast:&nbsp;8 Performance:&nbsp;7 Direction:&nbsp;8 Story:&nbsp;7 Script:&nbsp;8 Creativity:&nbsp;8 Soundtrack:&nbsp;8 Job Description:&nbsp;8 The Extra Bonus Point:&nbsp;10&nbsp;for the end credit sofa moms, supermarket sweep and therapist Wanda Sykes.&nbsp;79% 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a cliché film, I'm so disappointed!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second time in my life that I have walked out of a film. The first time was an art-house movie where a lady was writhing around on a floor of broken mirrors reciting Japanese haikus whilst crying for 40 minutes. I'm not sure which of the two was worse.Let me preface this - I am a working mother around the same age as some of the characters in this film. None of this rings true to me, mostly because of the way the script was written (by a couple of men who have clearly no idea what being a working mum is). The cast is great, the idea is great. It should have almost been the Clueless of the next generation on (humour wise). The women end up looking humiliated for being meek or embarrassingly gross. We have no idea where their children are when they decide to go AWOL. 'Hey - want to go to the movies?' 'Sure! I'll just dump these 4 under 5s somewhere and we'll go to a bar'. Hmmm.My two friends and I lasted 20 minutes. There was a big crowd of younger girls, possibly not yet having had kids, that were laughing their heads off. So I think there is a market for this. But I think you will either love or hate it. They could have done so much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever there were a film to make a child appreciate the unique pressures their beloved mother goes through (or has gone through) on a daily basis in order to run a ship-shape household, Bad Moms is probably not it.That's not to discredit the film as it's still an entertaining and frequently laugh out hilarious 100 minutes. But when push comes to shove, the Mommy dearest's in this film don't go half as far as Joan Crawford would on a 'normal' day.Thankfully, every joke thrown at us in a torrent of dirty talk and foul language hits the (low) mark, largely thanks to the whip-smart dialogue and the brilliant, core performance of Kathryn Hahn as the raunchiest, baddest of Moms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review of Bad Moms (spoiler free)*** (3/5)Cast: Mila Kunis, Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith, Anna Mumolo.Plot: Amy (Kunis), is a mother of two and her workaholic lifestyle has made her kids fall out of love with her, so she tries to find a way to make her life better by meeting Carla (Hahn), and Kiki (Bell), the three of them become friends and Amy does things that she wouldn't normally. But as life gets more bliss for her, her children's lives go in a downward spiral. Can she pick up the pieces make their family life better?Bad Moms certainly isn't the best comedy this year but it is still a fun one, writer/director duo Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the writing team behind the hangover trilogy whether it be the quick-witted and hilarious first movie or the clunky, unfunny and rushed sequels this is just another strong addition to their ever-expanding comedy career. However the pair keep their quick-witted antics from the first Hangover and transfer them to this mainly because of what happens throughout the film. Mila Kunis who has had several strong performances we all know her as Meg from T.V's Family Guy but what is she like on the silver screen? And also is she as good as her laugh out loud in bear-comedy Ted? On the silver screen Kunis is a strong performer with funny moments and a lot of people say that her best performance was in Ted. In this Kunis stars as Amy a workaholic mom who is deprived out of love from her two children and her deadbeat boyfriend who has one hell of a secret that he is hiding from her, she finds out that he has a secret girlfriend. You could say that Amy is lost in the world of work; however that isn't what makes her life bad she is in a dead-end job that has been voluntary for so many years and she is forever antagonized by Christina Applegate's Gwendolyn, the president of the P.T.A and she is forever going on about how she is so much better than Amy. So as life goes in a downward spiral she meets Carla (Hahn, in top form), a rowdy single mother of one who only wants to do one thing and that is drink heavily and party hard and alongside her Kiki (Bell, in top form after her disappointing appearance in The Boss) a mother who is in the same ball pit as Amy, with a husband that won't do anything that involves getting his hands dirty. And from there Amy's life gets better.Although inspired by the Hangover series what the men do in that, the three moms do in this they go out to drink heavily and party hard, this still keeps the same traits as the Hangover trilogy however a lot more fun the rushed sequels. There is one scene in this which could be described as the funniest scene in the entire film, and that when the trio get ready to go out, which involves Amy's 'sexy' bra a jerk off scene involving Kiki's hooded top "I am never wearing this again" she says in shock after said scene, and it leads to them going to one place where they can party hard, a supermarket then we get into the set piece of the film it's rare for a comedy to have set-pieces but it's there, a scene that pops out from any other part of the film. It includes trips, slides, and falls and also milk tipping, along with slow-motion style laughs and after all this Amy becomes something she never dreamed of to be a fun mom however that does not make her kids love her even more. Not only does Amy have a pose so does Gwendolyn, and her two friends Stacy (Pinkett-Smith, not a lovable character not like Gloria in the Madagascar trilogy), even more bad-ass and bitchy than ever, and also Vicky (Mumolo) whose a little bit and quite frankly she likes what Amy is doing.Things take a turn for the worse for Amy as Gwendolyn tries to take over her life and Amy cannot be bothered to do anything again however it does get slightly better after that, when the P.T.A elections come round and everybody goes to Gwendolyn's at first but then they discover that she is boring and everybody just wants to have fun, so the three form an election party and again the Hangover style takes its toll. However Amy soon learns that she has to fight fire with fire she tries to beat Gwendolyn at her own game, and it is almost successful until Amy loses her drift and again things take a turn for the worse. However the scene when Carla and Kiki try to convince Amy that she is a good person and mother is surprisingly enjoyable filled with laughs and moments that may make you cry, along with scene when Gwendolyn realizes what kind of person she really is and all that she tries to beat Amy when she should have been looking in the mirror that moment is very enjoyable, after that things get better for Amy as her life goes uphill from there even Gwendolyn starts to like her. In conclusion this is a really fun and hilarious adult comedy that will ambush you with laughs, rudeness and wild parties a very funny adult comedy that even be a contender for one of the best comedies this year but it's still slightly patchy in areas.Verdict: Drinking, laughs and wild parties Bad Moms is a fun yet patchy comedy filled with laughs and joy and even your mom will be laughing at this. One of the best and most interesting this year.6/10 fun and hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad Moms is good? It's good to be a bad mom? Yep, that's the message of the movie. And that's probably the best thing about the writing - Lucas and Moore's script is an absolute shambles. They clearly went on "movie-title-generator.com", churned out "Bad Moms" and wrote their usual drivel in the same vein as their Hangover trilogy. Every other word begins with F, and as usual, it's entirely unfunny - they don't seem to realise swearing is only funny when used sporadically for emphasis.Moving on to the characters - pretty much every one is a moron, which again the writers think is hilarious, but again is only effective sporadically. The only person that shows any aspect of likability is, as always, Mila Kunis, whose honesty and integrity is the only substantial thing in the entire movie. Hahn, Bell, Applegate, Pinkett Smith and Mumolo pretty much destroy every line they speak and every scene they're in with their inconceivably one-dimensional and shallow characters.The main issue with Bad Moms (except for Kunis), is that it's totally unrealistic, unbelievable and unengaging. It's just a dumb fantasy which they think is hilarious, but at times is actually painful to watch. The character interactions, the inconsistency in motivations, the way everything resolves neatly, it's all so amateur and excruciating. The brief moment of emotion when Kunis finds herself alone towards the end has more quality than the rest of the movie put together. For a comedy, smirking once isn't enough.2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear oh dear where to start with this monstrosity? These days it is oh so easy to get away with not bothering to write jokes, and hoping the swearing and sex references are enough to make the audience laugh. At some point this became acceptable with comedy films, and judging by this film's page even the critics have bought into it! These are worrying times...Bar one amusing reference to a certain recent sci-fi film, this film fails to land any laughs.On to storyline. Half way through the film they decided to try and shoehorn in a moral to the story. Unfortunately every time a point was made, it was duly undermined/contradicted around 10 minutes later. Awful stuff. The 2nd star is given on the strength of the fact that stuff happens constantly, so at least the film manages to be entertaining on some level. But for laughs? Please look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my, oh my, where to start. It was supposed to be a comedy still I did not smile ones during the film - and I love smiling so that shouldn't be an impossible mission. At one point I considered I may cry a little because it was so pathetic - the uncircumcised penis scene - but it wasn't even pathetic enough for that. The whole film was nothing - well, at least the first hour, I just couldn't watch the rest of it. It didn't make itself believable enough to be enjoyable as a comedy, because even with a comedy you have to care about the characters or at least believe they could exist in some universe. And if it tried to go the more satiric road than it was too believable for that. I don't know what it was, other than a really bad movie and a complete waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>contender of the most horrible movie of 2016</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had been treated on a real horror-esque fest this summer. From botched up remakes of movies to well bad moms. There are no redeeming qualities. At least the new Ghostbusters had me laughing a bit now and again but this movie is nearly as bad as Himalaya, a three + hour movie i was forced to watch in highschool of how indigenous people herd their yaks over the mountain paths. I never walked out on a movie, except on this one.But back to the movie. Really Really bad script, not funny, man hating, failure to communicate and no sense of humor sums this erghm "movie" up quite nicely. basically story goes like this; Women make active choices they later regret ( like finding wealthy men and marrying them, plus having kids while sitting at home or just fail to produce anything noteworthy because of the lack of education... because they got children quite early). Then the say enough is enough.. go girlpower.. and act like deranged immature college frat boys/girls. Then they roll stupid and immature with each other and smash it into one big pretzel of fail.So conclusion: actresses, though still easy on the eyes seem to be the ones with their careers winding down ( some aren't as good of an actress to begin with). the so called humor is so immature that it is facepalm retch worthy. The script is even worse and yes, one could argue that actresses can't shine if the script is terrible.To end there is a disturbing trend in Hollywood where in certain movies the "hate" for one or more groups, oftentimes men in general, can see oozing like a slimer that just flew through the theater screen. Directors some advice: keep your SJW/feminasty social construct politics and Utopian dreams out of a movie that could have been OK-ish if you had bothered writing a half decent script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highschool flick for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not have any expectations when I decided to go to Bad moms, and I came out indifferent. The movie has a plot that has been used numerous times in many high school flicks that you'd think Hollywood should start feel that it was overused, but not this time.Basically, the movie is about the PTA president (Christina Applegate) who is a bully controlling perfectionist freak, when the not so perfect Mila Kunis decides to stand against her tyranny and overthrow her to become president, with some subplots that could have been more meaningful if the movie hasn't tackled them with such shallowness, like the so much pressure on parents to become perfect by even making up stuff that do not benefit the kids at all, and the unbalanced relationships among others, and the 80s born generation who is now in the struggle for balance between adulthood and youth.The movie had some laughs in it, but all in all it was not worth the time, had you replaced the moms with high school kids it would've been the worst movie in years, but the story would've worked just as good.And finally, if you are looking for the movie to win the Oscar for most characters flip 180 degrees for absolutely no decent reason and no build up whatsoever, this movie is your champ, I think the crew members probably changed from evil to good too because this must be an outbreak in the set or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why anyone would ever use Mila Kunis i don't know, she has no talent, no t*ts and is generally just a pain in the ass. Had they picked someone with talent to play her part, the movie could have worked, but her lack of talent just killed it, don't watch this unless you like wasting time in your life.. Such a bad movie due to one person.. such a shame... With the right cast, we could have seen an epic movie but.. That did not nor will it happen... So sad... One good part about the movie is Kristen Bell, she does an Awesome job, but not enough to dumb down the horrible horrible part of Mila... Mila has no talent, everyone knows this, but, shes with Ashton so gets parts to not hurt his feelings.. thats it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best and not the worst and funny in parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a successful movie. It has earned $125 million at the end of this month, Aug, and it cost $20 million to make. It starts out uneven, and Kunis is not in a groove. About 3/5 into the movie, things start to click a bit and it starts getting funny. Consider audience. Most likely this is for young moms and recent young moms. True there is gratuitous dirty humor and jokes and it seems like just another teenage movie but add ten years or so to the cast. But just like a cheap novel, you can lose yourself in it and have a laugh or two. In this day and age, if an hour and forty-one minute movie can do that, why not? The cast is a bit surprising in parts and even wooden Martha Stewart does not mind making fun of herself in the movie. Kunis in her role smooths out and the movie skips developing obvious plot points, ignores them, and I think this helps the movie out. It is just about fun and laughing and by the middle of the movie, that is all the movie is about. It is not steady fare, not artful, somewhat dirty, and yet it pulls off a few laughs. Go for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me laugh so much - very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like I need to pitch in here with all these bad reviews. My sense is that most of the haters probably aren't mothers/ parents, or maybe not in a highly competitive area, or their kids are still too young, or they're not working, or they're just perfect and prudish. But, I'm a working Silicon Valley mom, and so many themes in this movie hit a raw nerve, showed an ugly ? of course grossly exaggerated ? truth and provided huge comedic relief i.e. I'm not the only overwhelmed, stressed out high performing mom with -of course- high performing kids in a supposedly "perfect" relationship. We laughed so hard at so many things, the whole theater did; there where even scenes the whole audience clapped because it was so true and so funny.So, yes, Mila Kunis wasn't that great, the love and relationship scenes were flat and unrealistic, some of the jokes just not good (the uncircumcised penis one for example). Yes, a little better editing wouldn't have harmed. Of course, everything was over the top but OVERALL it hit the nail on the head and it was really fun. Christina Applegate was superb as the grotesque epitome of the Uber-PTA mom, there was the boss we all know who just doesn't get it, the husbands who take on less and get away with it somehow? Kathryn Hahn was amazing and Kristen Bell was great also. Yes, this happens to all of us, some of the times, and it's so exhausting?.so it was really fun to get a good laugh and know that we can do this, and maybe just need a little more humor so that we take it all less seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Watch! 10/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so good. Especially if you're looking for a funny family comedy/romantic comedy movie to go and watch. Although there is a lot of swearing (which I personally don't mind), but I know some people might find off-putting. Here are just a few things that I loved about this movie: - It has an all female lead, which is so rare but so appreciated. Character development which is something I always love to see, to watch a character learn and grow from their mistakes. Strong female characters who are still feminine. Female character who has a lot of sex isn't vilified or slut-shamed in any way. It's refreshing to see a female character who can be openly lascivious without being put down or shamed by another male or female character. It acknowledges that there's no right way to be a parent and that's okay, whatever way you choose to parent your child is okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few laughs but ultimately sexist. Or lazy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a comedy with a simplistic message that is let down in a number of ways. The set up for the women to choose to be bad moms instead of trying to be good ones and failing regardless is quite weak but somewhat excusable for structural reason: the woman with two kids (Amy) has a full time job and a useless cheating husband. The stay-at-home mom (Kikki) has four kidsl under five. The other woman (Carla) just seems to be useless, but that is part of her charm as the comic relief. There are some good laughs when they initially choose to go 'bad', but it does not really go anywhere from there and instead descends into predictable fare. Amy comes out on top against her battle with the villain of the story (Gwendolyn), manages to separate amicably from her cheating husband, sees improvements in her son's attitude and ultimately manages gets the guy (the hot single dad) as the icing on the cake. A realisation that the role of a mom requires her to be 'good' is the ultimate message of the journey the women undertake and that 'good' may need a bit of redefinition. All that is fine but it is a little tainted by the overly sexist nature of the movie. All the male characters are negative. Amy's husband is a cheat, Kiki's a bully, the headmaster has relinquished his power, the gym teacher no spine, Amy's son is useless (partly her creation) and even Gwendolyn is only the villain she is because her husband is an embezzling cheat and thus yet another victim of male betrayal. The only non-dick is the hot dad but he is merely a meek sex object, devoid of real personality. There is a scene where a fearful woman only turns up to the meeting because Carla threatened to seduce her husband that is delivered well from a comic perspective. But it might propose the notion that all that men need to stray is opportunity. So, even male characters that are only hinted at are negative (think Gwendolyn's embezzling husband). Hence the movie is ultimately sexist. Or just lazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pushed to the limit of possible stress by her husband's laziness, her terrible boss, her unpaid over time hours, two kids, constant unbearable scrutiny from Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), head of the PTA and an overall tireless schedule, Amy (Mila Kunis) one night decides with her new found friends Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) to rebel to the system and to finally let themselves go, embarking in a journey of transgression. Having never been a fan of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in the comedy scene I have to admit that this is definitely their best and most mature effort in feature comedy yet, even if is still bears signs of their usual over-stuffed and slightly uncomfortable humor. In contrast with these writers and directors' previous film I found myself genuinely laughing along with the movie many times and ultimately the success of a comedy comes down to that so no matter how off the rails they go at times, this film is definitely the most tight and coherent film these filmmakers have put together yet. The characters, whilst slightly stereotypical and sporadically going off balance, for the major part maintain an empathetic through line which ultimately, no matter how many clichés the film bumps into, results in a satisfying experience with a very strong thematic undercurrent about what it means to be a mom and how mad and out of control the situation can be. More importantly the film is also about how people unjustly and stupidly judge each other and whilst both these themes might be shoved down your throat towards the end, through the film they are carried out in an organic way, giving the characters something to do and getting out comedy from the hilarious situations that emerge. Highlights of the cast for me have to be Kristen Bell for her usual brilliant timing and charisma and Oona Laurence who continues to nail every performance through and through. This kid is a natural. Another element for which the directors have never distinguished themselves is style and personal touch. Whilst this film carries on that, being shot in the most generic way possible, having absolutely zero shots that stick out as anything but standard coverage, they do get away hilariously with a couple of sequence which benefit from having some really wild and out-there humor and not taking that to the same level of crassness that some of their previous efforts had, resulting in uncomfortable stuff, being there just for the sake of provocation. Here instead, they just nail that balance of shocking you, yet keeping it in tone and genuine, which produced the opposite result: a couple of hilarious sequences of anarchic comedy that had me bursting out with joy and laughter. They really managed to nail those moments of pure joy which I really find beautiful in a comedy. Where unfortunately they fail is in keeping the pathos going throughout all the scenes and have many scenes which feel more like connective character tissue or exposition rather than part of the film. Not to mention that I was kind of turned off by the movie at times for the usual, unpleasant moral ambiguity that Moore and Lucas have had many times in the past: having all the characters just fly off in a billionaire's jet at the end really bothered me, especially for how unnecessary it felt. Fortunately those moments happen rarely and quickly, for the majority we are served a pretty decent comedy with a couple of great moments, some admittedly dull, but overall a very good and likable cast and a fine amount of laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot taken from a cheerleaders movies turn moms being bullied and divided into "gangs" with their stereotypes. Humor is childish and at time racial (On Asian mom responding to the rich American mom "Yes, and I never really like her as she's exotic" about Mila Kunis's character). It's too bad they didn't do a good job with the budget and completely missed a very easy subject. They choose to approach the angle of a rich pre-teen kids school... so many better fun stuff happen with under 5's. If you like your teens movies and your now a mom... maybe you haven't grown up and like this kind of movies? But if you're a mom and you've matured you'll gain more of your time and money to spend time with your kids or just going out with you mom's friend and having chat about fun stuff in a "real mom's life".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really nice surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I went into 'Bad Moms' with low expectations. Almost every female comedy I've been told is good and then given a chance to has let me down. 'Bridesmaids' and 'The Other Woman' are the two most recent cases that come to mind. They were tame and just lacked any genuinely funny moments. So I got a nice surprise when I found myself enjoying the hell out of 'Bad Moms'. An 'R' rating gave the cast so much freedom to work with, and they took it. A lot of the dialogue was seriously vulgar (in a hilarious way) to the extent I imagine a lot of male stars in Hollywood would hesitate at saying a lot of it. The story is simple, but that was all it needed. Just a frame for the these women to then work their magic amongst. There are certainly conflicts and problems to overcome, but that never weighs down the comedy. The main three cast members Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn all had tremendous chemistry together and the rest of the cast fit nicely into the mould and deliver some hilarity of their own. There's also a bit of a 'The Hangover' feel about it at times. Some of the party scenes are so well directed that they put you in the mood to party yourself. The music throughout is perfectly selected as well. This is a very good comedy that male and female audience members will be able to enjoy equally. A great effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm so glad we can still get some R-rated comedies once in a while. When it also features female leads doing outrageous, raunchy things, it seems to be the type of humor I appreciate. Movies like Bridesmaids and Bachelorette, where the women are the focus and can do any crazy thing the guys from hangover could. Well, Kathryn Hahn sets the bar up a few notches, essentially giving us a female version of Bad Santa. The image of her running down the rent-a-cop in the grocery store will forever be burned in my memory. And for anyone who has kids in today's fast paced society, much of the commentary will ring true. Christina Applegate's completely over-the-top PTA mom is as ridiculous as any character from a Monty Python skit, yet rings completely true. Somehow, these are the parents that seem to grow in numbers every year in the U.S. Lots of great moments and biting humor all the way through. My only nitpick is that Kristen Bell is somewhat underutilized.</fullReview>

Very funny movie full of a tad bit of over exaggerated truths of being a mom in America these days. All the ladies in the cast were perfect together. Kathryn Hahn is hilarious. It was refreshing to see a ladies comedy with fresh faces, not the usual Judd Apatow cast, (which I love, but a bit over used) Grab some dinner and cocktails with your gal pals and go see it.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I was surprised to see the negative reviews about this movie, then I realized we don't all like the same things. I found Bridesmaids uncomfortable at times, this is laugh-out-loud for me. The 3 of us over-worked moms appreciated the craziness and flat out raunchy humor. I took off one star because the movie was a little uneven - the family and romance scenes fell a little flat to me. Didn't have the same hint of truth and satire that the mom-friend-outcast scenes had. We had to literally PHYSICALLY brace ourselves every time Kathryn Hahn opened her mouth - snorts, hysterical laughter, cry-laughing - oh yeah, we did all of that. If you 'leak' a little when you laugh, wear a full Depends, you'll thank me.Leave the guys at home, leave the kids for sure... if you don't have kids, you probably won't get it.

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I would give it a 5 out of 5 because it had a legit story line, kept my attention and because the actresses were attractive. I loved the raunchy comedy in the movie. I would recommend this to anyone older than 18-years old, or 16-years or older with parental supervision. It was raunchy but just enough raunchy humor.I thought Gwendolyn, played by Christina Applegate, Amy, played by Mila Kunis, and Amy's daughter, played by Oona Laurence were the highlights of the movie. Christina Applegate's character was easy to hate as she did horrible things to children like place weed in their locker. Mila Kunis's character was a great mom with a jerk husband. She was easy to relate to and felt like an average joe. As for the supporting cast, I was not a big fan. They weren't as exciting and interesting as the main cast. They seemed very plain.

		<shortDescription>Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing a guy, whose reviews I respect, give this a decent rating, I went in, optimistic.Admittedly, guys in their 30's might not be the target demographic; but a well made, well edited, well acted movie, with a fun script, is hard to argue with.Like I said... This is fun. Pure and simple.It's also fairly even handed. The male characters that are schmucks, get called on it. The women, too. In one scene, where Kristen Bell's character bags men, in general, because of her negative experience, Kathryn Hahn's character gives her a look that calls her on it.Don't get me wrong; this is not a deep movie: it's entertainment. If you go in, knowing that -- Which most reviewers seem to miss, then you might enjoy this, as much as I did.And, hey, why not take the entire morning and see a double? This, and Sausage Party.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Bad Moms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Bad Moms (my latest review), Kathryn Hahn, Kristen Bell, and Christina Applegate are perfectly realized as characters. Hahn is a comic force of nature playing single mom Carla. She is for lack of a better word, a promiscuous potty mouth (not to mention the definition of a female Rob Corddry). Bell is spot-on as Kiki, a dorky, socially inept mother of four. Finally, Applegate is pure evil as Gwendolyn, the antagonistic head master of the PTA (you know, the parent-teacher association).Anyway, "Moms" feeling like Bridesmaids meets 1999's Office Space, is the most surprising release of 2016. It starts off as a family comedy only to descend into massive F-bombs, fierce sexual innuendo, conversations about circumcision, and a reference to Fifty Shades of Grey. Translation: It's funny as heck. Yeah it's an R-rated vehicle that takes place in a middle school. Yeah it has child actors in many a frame. And yes, it deals with uncomfortable themes of midlife crisis parenting. No matter. Bad Moms combines the sweet, the moral, and the raunchy all in one fell swoop. "Mother did it need to be so (pause) high?" Natch.Now in normal fashion, I viewed its clichéd trailer recently on YouTube with some of the comments almost making sense (one YouTube viewer actually predicted that it would be quote unquote, "complete trash"). Boy was I wrong after attending a midday screening. "Moms" tries to provide you with a hearty laugh in almost every scene. It succeeds about 90% of the time so no complaints here.Taking place in Chicago for the umpteenth time (what movie doesn't take place in the "Windy City" these days), containing a feel-good ending, and featuring a left field cameo by Martha Stewart (she makes everyone jello shots with vodka, nice), Bad Moms chronicles young and exhausted mother, Amy Mitchell (played by Mila Kunis). Amy has two kids and takes care of them like no one's business. She cooks, cleans, and even works at a coffee company while her husband sits on his butt doing nothing (I guess he has a job but said job doesn't entail too much). Ticked off and fed up, Amy has a meltdown at a PTA meeting and quits to the chagrin of Applegate's Gwendolyn (as mentioned earlier). She then decides to get drunk, have some me time, and join forces with two other moms (Hahn and Bell) in her vicarious plight. They go to the movies during the day, throw a party to get all the other PTA moms on their side, and trash a supermarket without so much as getting arrested. Watch for a sequence where Amy steals her hubby's red Muscle Car and drives like a maniac. Also, look for the reclusive Wanda Sykes in a small role as a jiving marriage counselor to Ames and her worse half (Mike Mitchell played by David Walton).Bottom line: If you're a working mother or a stay-at-home mom, you'll find this flick quite amusing. You might identify with it or you might not. Either way, Bad Moms with its foul-mouthed dialogue and its ode to most things unladylike, is a "good" movie. Ha-ha get it. Rating: 3 stars.Of note: During the closing credits for "Moms", we get to see interviews with the stars of the film (Kunis, Hahn, Bell, Applegate, Smith, Annie Mumolo) plus their real-life mothers. Yeah it's kinda weird to view this at the end of something that's equal parts filthy and coarse. Oh well. Like everything else in Bad Moms, it just seems to work. Oh and by the way, these actresses look almost identical to their parental units (especially with regards to Kathryn Hahn).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parents will probably find Bad Moms funny. I found it hit or miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parents are never perfect. They are bound by nature to make mistakes. I can't count how many times my parents would either not care that I had a big homework thing due in the morning, that I had an event in front of another, or that I even had the right meal for dinner. Even with that imperfection, I still believe that nothing is perfect and that I was raised well. What surprises me is that I used to think that moms had high standards when I was a kid. Judging my how my little cousins parents are, it turns out that I was a part of the Dark Age.My aunt not only puts a lot of time in volunteering at her kids events, but will go out of the way to make sure that none of their food includes gluten, GTN, BTM, and what ever kids are not supposed to eat these days. I may be a parent, but I think it's safe to say that I lived, and so did my parents and their parents. I understand to good intentions of books that want the best for the next generation, but common instinct has always been my driving force. That seems to be the case for Bad Moms. Amy Mitchel (played by Mila Kunis) is a young mom of two pre-teens who tries her hardest to juggle being a top PTA mother, a part time executive for a boss younger then her, and a husband that's more interested in being a third child then a caring spouse. After a very bad day that would cause most people to snap, she finally cannot take it anymore when PTA president Gwendolyn (played by Christina Applegate) calls in an emergency two hour meeting just to talk about how great of a leader she is. Amy storms out of the PTA meeting, taking along fellow stressed out mother Kiki (played by Kristen Bell) to a bar where they find the more rebellious single mother Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn). Its there they all agree to simply stop trying their hardest and to simple enjoy their lives. For Amy, this means no more preparing all her kids meals, no more doing their homework, and especially no more following orders from the PTA. Gwendolyn sees this defy as a major threat and attempts to sabotage Amy's children in school. In retaliation, Amy decides to run for PTA president to finally dethrone the perfect mother. The marketing for Bad Moms have tried to play it off as a female The Hangover, though the story suggests this more as a parent version of Office Space. Both Office Space and Bad Moms have the similar theme of going against the social norms and the latter honestly does fine at it. The script does allow a lot of criticism for the current obsession for mothers that try too hard to follow the Martha Stewarts (who has a cameo in this) and the Pintrest copycats.Our three stars have plenty of moments where they got a laugh out of me. Mila Kunis may seem like a young choice for a mother of two, but it is cleverly explained that she had to adapt young. So with a good setup and some funny actresses, where does this go wrong? Simply, a bunch of the jokes don't fire. I always mention that comedies are hard to do as they require good scripts and the right performers to deliver them, and only half of the time did I chuckle. Bad Moms might be funnier if I had children, but I still feel like they could have gone darker with the material.I'll give this five Pintrest lists out of ten. Bad Moms will probably find an easy audience with mothers who can relate to the problems they face. Maybe even some men as well. It simply just wasn't for me. I can only say that for subjective reasons, you simply have to think Office Space and parenting and figure out if you'll like this or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Bad Moms' Will Make You Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to see 'Bad Moms' on Friday. The movie came in third in the weekend box office?only slightly behind Star Trek Beyond, but a distant third to the new Jason Bourne movie. You couldn't tell that by our experience, though. Our first choice theater was sold out all night and the theater we went to was pretty well sold out as well.The cinema was apparently running some sort of promotional special for 'Bad Moms'. There is a bar in the lobby, but I have almost never seen anyone use it at all?and I've definitely never seen someone bring a drink into the movie. In 'Bad Moms', on the other hand, I think my wife and I may have been the only two people who did not have a drink. Most of the patrons had wine in special, limited edition 'Bad Moms' wine glasses. Let me just say that a theater full of inebriated moms is actually a tad worse than a theater full of teenagers. There was a lot of chatter and giggling, but I digress.This was the funniest movie I have seen in years. In my opinion, 'Bad Moms' would be hilarious for any audience. But, for obvious reasons it resonates more with moms. The production team did its research with real-life moms to identify the events and scenarios that come up in day-to-day parenting.The movie has an all-star cast of females, including Mila Kunis, Christina Applegate, Kristen Bell, and Jada Pinkett Smith?but the one that brought the most laughs for me is Kathryn Hahn. If you have children?especially if those children go to public school and you've had the pleasure of dealing with the "PTA Mom"?this movie will make you laugh so hard you cry.I expect the Jason Bourne movie to be awesome and plan to see it this weekend, but if you're looking for laughs instead of action you need to go see 'Bad Moms'.Side note: I don't want to give away any spoilers, but make sure you stay through the credits. Trust me. You're welcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually modern comedies have a difficult time building any kind of depth without either feeling forced or sacrificing its sense of humor in the process. Bad Moms, with the help of its strong cast, knows how to work around this.While it's not some highbrow character study, it shows all sides of the situation without making it obvious that it's using a traditional path to get there.Bad Moms stars Mila Kunis as Amy, a mother of two who gets absolutely no help from her husband, who apparently likes the dog more than his own kids.Christina Applegate plays Amy's antagonist, Gwendolyn, who is president of the PTA and doesn't allow anything with sugar at the school's bake sale. Amy doesn't buy into her philosophies, nor her manipulation tactics, which causes Gwendolyn to try and ruin Amy's life. Applegate does an excellent job of making the audience despise her, while countering Kunis' charismatic charm.Amy pairs up with two other mothers who are on the same page as her. They're played by Kathryn Hahn and Kristen Bell. The former is always under-appreciated in comedic roles, while the latter is totally unrecognizable as a pushover and naive mother.It's truly the cast that helps carry this film so well. No character is a wash or unnecessary.And the jokes are consistent. They run all along the whole film without ever growing tiresome. Each joke is as fresh as the last--and there is a true sense of cohesion amongst it all. No bit seems out of place.The only thing wrong? The film portrays every husband as useless. Literally. Not one husband in the film is even a little bit competent at being a father or spouse. I guess it bodes well for the film's target audience, but it may alienate some men out there.But regardless, I still found the movie highly entertaining and one that I would watch over and over again.Twizard Rating: 91</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the titles movie title, Bad Moms, fool you. This movie is an homage to all moms out there that work hard to improve the lives around them. It takes place in home where a mom, Ann (Mila Kunis) is stressed out with the hurried lives of her kids and disconnected husband. She also works bringing home the bacon in startup coffee company. She reaches a breaking point and enough is enough. She makes time to step back to help herself before she can help others. In the process she teams up with 2 other moms (Carla -Kathryn Hahn- Kiki -Kristen Bell- )and they make a trifecta coalition. Created a revolution for call of action for all moms. They are not going to take it anymore. A few touching scenes and this movie will definitely make you pause and thank your mother. As the saying goes, mothers could not be everywhere so that is why he created moms. You will laugh and cry in this movie and be more grateful for moms everywhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a comedy that delivers plenty of laughs. Sure there is too much drinking and language you wouldn't hear in the Navy. So what if all the male characters are written like bad cartoons. The performances are good enough. Nobody works too hard. The dog does great work. There is a fun use of music. There is an interesting sequence with the real moms over the end credits.Like pasta to the face, not every joke sticks, but enough of them hit the target. The movie looks good on the big screen and as a comedy it should be a shared audience experience. Lower your standards and just enjoy this popcorn comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . Whatcha Gonna Do When They Come For You?" The timing of BAD MOMS, coming out the week that reports of Webster being Chelsea's Real Dad are peaking, cannot make this attempt to scuttle America's First Woman Presidency any more blatant than if the filmmakers named Christina Applegate's scheming PTA President "Crooked Hillary." Dressed and coiffed as a virtual Clinton clone, Applegate goes around planting illegal drugs in the school lockers of her Presidential Rivals' children. Pontificator of endless speeches, a power elite insider with four yachts and friends such as Martha Stewart at her beck and call, plus a husband who's just been busted for embezzling $100 million from a children's charity, Applegate's character fits the Fox News\Donald Trump caricature of Crooked Hillary to a Tee. BAD MOMS makes Trump's case for repealing the 19th Amendment and taking away the privilege to vote from Hillary's core backers--U.S. women--because they drive the wrong way on one-way streets, perpetrate hit-and-run wrecks, "graze" and spew fluids at their local supermarkets and neighborhoods, and neglect America's kids in order to get high while enjoying deviant sex with their own versions of Webster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rating does NOT do this movie Justice, just as the trailer didn't! It is amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please don't listen to the negative reviews !! I had no expectations for this movie . I went, expecting mediocre based on the trailer . It has by far exceeded my expectations !! I went with my mother, sister, GRANDMOTHERS , and 2 friends . We all equally loved it !! I have not laughed so hard during a movie in a long time. It was a great change! Usually I feel like the funny parts are all shown in the trailer. NOT the case here. If you are uptight , you may not like some of the crude and perverted HUMOR. This is not for the boring prude type that finds everything "innappropriate" . There really isn't any nudity..(one extremely small scenes) Most is language and sex related talk . However, if you can are fun, have a sense of humor , and enjoy this type, you will LOVE it. My mom loved the movie Bridesmaids and it was her favorite prior. This was much funnier! Much better! Yes there are a few things that were cheesy I felt like in the very beginning .. but honestly this IS supposed to be a little over the top. It's a comedy! It was a great laugh. Laughed the most during this movie than most I can remember . Also had a few heartfelt moments. I am going to see it again with other friends and my husband. My mom is going to see it again with my dad. So much better than I anticipated</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea was pretty good, two mothers(Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell) who lead pretty hectic lives, meet a party mom(Kathryn Hahn) and decide to live a carefree life, and just party like crazy.This one joke premise pretty much dies down quickly, cause it just tries way too hard, and the more it loses itself. Chemistry with is there but barely. Mila Kunis is not that convincing has a stressed out mother, maybe it's me but I had trouble buying it. Kathryn Hahn I really liked has the trampy mom, proves has the movie goes on she's a likable 3 dimensional character. Kristen Bell is okay, nothing really terrific here. She and Hahn did give an little chuckle here and there. Jada Pickett Smith is so lifeless in her role has a PTA member. Christina Applegate is okay has an unlikable PTA leader, but she is not giving any funny lines here. And when she and Smith insult her third party friend, and there is no payoff with that.All in all bad, but overly terrible, watchable for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'BAD MOMS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hit comedy flick; about three overworked moms, that bond and decide to liberate themselves from the stress of parenting together. The movie stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn (as the three lead moms); and it costars Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith, Annie Mumolo, Jay Hernandez, David Walton and Clark Duke. It was written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; the duo previously performed both duties on the teen sex comedy flick '21 &amp; OVER' (and they also co-wrote a little movie called 'THE HANGOVER'). The film has done well at the Box Office (so far), and it's also gotten decent reviews from movie critics. I enjoyed it, but it does have it's flaws.Amy Mitchell (Kunis) works, nonstop, to provide for her family. She catches her slacker husband (Walton) cheating on her, one night on the internet, and kicks him out. After that her life becomes a complete mess; until she meets two other mothers (Bell and Hahn) with similar problems. The three become best friends, and they all learn to relax (and party) together. This causes a lot of concern from other (more uptight) mothers, especially the power hungry Gwendolyn (Applegate), and a battle begins. The movie is funny, and I really like the concept behind it. It's also nice to see more raunchy comedy flicks, starring all women (that also deal with real women problems); but it would also be nice to see these films written and directed by more women, as well though. The cast is all decent, but I think Hahn's part is a little too over-the-top; and I also think Smith's talents are wasted (in a throwaway role). Kunis is OK, but someone like Tina Fey could have really made her part work. With that said, Bell and Applegate are perfectly cast (and they're also both hilarious in it). Some of the material is a little weak, as well, but other parts are brilliant. It's definitely a hit-and-miss comedy flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'm Amy Mitchell and I'm a mom": moms gone wild!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bad Moms" (2016 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Amy (played by Milo Kunis). As the movie opens, we hear the voice over announce "I'm Amy Mitchell and I'm a mom". We get to know Amy and how she's trying to cope with her stressful daily routing, juggling an overworked/underpaid job, a do-nothing and cheating husband, entitled kids and, oh yea, a dog with vertigo. One evening Amy is in a bar with two other moms, Kiki (played by Kirsten Bell) and Carla (played by Kathryn Hahn). It's not long before they all agree they've had enough, and decide to become 'bad moms'. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from co-writers/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who seemingly want to perfect the art of 'bad' movies in the best possible ways ("21 And Over", "The Hangover" etc.). Here they touch on a possible raw nerve in our society, namely the insane expectations that are put on moms everywhere, trying to do 500 things a do, and not just do them, but EXCEL in them. In the few serious moments of the movie, there are one or two monologues by Amy addressing these. But for the most part, the movie is about the "moms gone wild", and the movie works nicely at that level. The best moments are when we see the three ladies together. There is a scene in which they discuss how to potentially deal with a man in bed who is not circumsized. It's raunchy but rip-roaring, laugh-out-loud fun. (If raunchy humor is not your then d yourself a favor and check out a different movie.) There is a ton of fun songs throughout the movie, the best being when we see Amy and her two kids driving in the car and singing along to Walk the Moon's "Shut Up and Dance". Priceless moment."Bad Moms" had a very respectable opening week at the box office. Now going into its second weekend, the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended quite nicely, and overwhelmingly women I might add (I was one of just a handful guys in the theatre). Bottom line: if you are in the mood for some mindless fun about "moms gone wild" as I was after a stressful day at the office today, "Bad Moms" is just the thing for you. Best enjoyed in the theater with a bunch of people in a similar mindset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>we have no real lives today, and that's why we need this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More than just an over-the-top silly comedy, "Bad Moms" is a satire on our overly organized lives in the 21st century. The main characters are a group of moms in Chicago who get fed up with their daily schedules - going to work, taking their children to extracurricular activities, etc - and rebel. Basically, they decide to violate all social conventions and live life to its fullest, much to the chagrin of the authoritarian head of the PTA. Everyone in the theater, including myself, was laughing the whole time (especially whenever Carla had a comment).I have a feeling that quite a few moms out there would love to do this. In the meantime, it's been nice to see female-driven comedies this year (along with this one, there's "The Boss" and "Ghostbusters"). I liked the movie, and I hope that the directors do more stuff like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Raunchy and Completely Hilarious, Bad Moms is Carried by the Chemistry of it's 3 Lead Actresses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really surprised where they put Bad Moms on the summer schedule. Going up against Jason Bourne was pretty ballsy let alone movies like Star Trek: Beyond or Ghostbusters. But the phrase "counter programming" comes to mind. Putting in a smaller movie with potential beside a juggernaut is slowly becoming more and more successful. The one that I remember first was Kingsman: The Secret Service being released against Fifty Shades of Grey and Kingsman performed really well despite all the attention that Fifty Shades got. It seems like the same strategy worked for Bad Moms, providing that alternative option for people who weren't interested in Bourne. After being disappointed with Ghostbusters, I'm really glad I got to see this, I laughed a lot and was impressed with what Bad Moms was able to do.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Amy (Mila Kunis) is a mom that has to do everything. Her two kids Jane and Dylan are completely dependent on her. She shuttles them to school, does their homework for them, and takes them to all their extra curricular activities. On top of this she works a part time job which is actually a full time job because her boss Dale (Clark Duke) completely takes advantage of her. Lastly, her deadbeat husband Mike (David Walton) is having an affair online and she kicks him out. She's completely under-appreciated and she also has to deal with the judgmental head of the PTA Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) and her cronies Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Vicky (Annie Mumolo).On the particular day we join her, she has a really terrible day and after they call an emergency PTA meeting where they go through what they can't put in items for the bake sale (trust me the list is just ridiculous). Amy decides to quit after being called out for being late to the meeting. She heads to a bar and bumps into Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Carla is the mom that no one wants to associate with, she ignores her kid and tries to bang the husbands of the other moms. Another mom shows up named Kiki (Kristen Bell) who followed Amy there. Kiki is the mom with 4 kids who doesn't have any time to herself and was inspired by Amy's speech. They drink together and bond over the difficulties of being a mom today. They decide to be bad moms and after a drunken trip to the grocery store, they resolve to try things a little differently going forward.Going into this movie if you see the trailers, it's not exactly the movie that gets advertised. It looks like something similar to The Hangover or 21 and Over (which Jon Lucas and Scott Moore also wrote and directed) and while the movie is pretty raunchy, I was surprised how much development went into Amy's character. There's more than a few scenes where you see Amy bonding with her kids and trying to do the right thing and it actually works pretty well. She's a good character, you're with her when she finally gets so sick of trying to keep up with these unrealistic goals and she never goes too far when she tries to teach her kids to be self-reliant. It can be hard for movies to strike that balance between dirty comedy and proper character development (Unfinished Business missed on it completely) but Bad Moms did a decent job with it.Getting into the actually comedy, there were so many laugh out loud moments. The language in it is pretty bad and they aren't afraid to say whatever they want or make fun of whatever they want. The upside is that for the majority of it, it mostly works. Does everything work 100%? No, you can tell there was a fair amount of ad libbing and not everything is the gold standard. I would say probably around 75% of the jokes made me laugh and for something that could have easily been a throwaway, for me it was more than enough.The real strength of Bad Moms is how well Mila, Kathryn and Kristen work together and they all give great performances. This is the best job I've seen Mila do in a comedy in a while. She has the chops to do the dramatic stuff too and although she initially seemed like odd casting, she was great. Kathryn Hahn finally found the right movie to showcase herself, she's the mouthiest and the loudest of the moms but she steals most scenes she's in. Kristen Bell played her role pitch perfect. I've talked about before how versatile she is, she probably could have played Mila's role but she hits the right notes and rounds out the main 3 well. Christina Applegate was also good as Gwendolyn, the movie gives her some humanity at the end which was a nice touch.I did have small problems with this movie. The whole subplot with Amy running to be the PTA president was a little corny and they make her husband Mike just such a loser it wasn't really believable. In the end though, this was a pretty solid comedy and it delivered on almost all fronts. I don't think a lot was expected from Bad Moms and I would congratulate the team behind it for delivering an impressive low-brow comedy for women that men can enjoy as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So you're thinking of buying a ticket to Bad Moms. Maybe you saw the trailer and you thought the premise looks interesting. Maybe the collective star-power of Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate was just too tempting and you're just jonesing for a fix of bacchanalian comedy. If you do I would like to be the first to welcome you to Half-Baked R-Rated Comedy Land where original ideas are warmly welcomed before being sanitized, pacified and made soullessly marketable for the sake of a healthy domestic box-office. Please take notes and pay attention; with any luck after watching Bad Moms you too can make a mediocre comedy befitting exploitation and completely lacking substance.First you need an "original" comedic idea. It's easier than it sounds, all you need is to take something innocuous and/or innocent, mix it with a few symbols of marketable rebellion and touch on a few cultural lines of demarcation while feigning social commentary to make it look edgy. You also need a sassy title; one that takes a monosyllabic trigger word and somehow links it with the plot, like Bad Santa (2003) or Sex Tape (2014) or Old School (2003). Voila you got your script!"Wait a minute," I hear you cry, "Doesn't a script have like scenes and dialogue?" Not in Half-Baked R-Rated Comedy Land it doesn't. All you need is a few locations on standby, a general idea of the plot you want (heroes journey, the rebirth, rags to riches etc.) and a couple of willing actors willing to chew the scenery and improvise their way through. No need for comedic setups and payoffs when you got game actors, willing to make funny noises and find ever more creative ways to say the word "c**k". Also make sure to have basic coverage in every scene and get some establishing shots on your way to set. Don't worry the editor will find the film in post.Now let's take on Bad Moms specifically and see what makes it tic. Firstly in today's day-and-age it's very in vogue to appeal to women. We've come along way since The Sweetest Thing (2002); thus films in general, but comedies especially need to address the lingering frustrations of working women in the best way two dudes who wrote The Hangover trilogy (2009-2013) can. Again it's frightfully easier than it sounds. Just envision a permanently besieged female protagonist whose life resembles a Family Feud (1999-Present) survey where the the question is "What are the biggest complaints your wife has." Then make the answer to those growing frustrations "f**k it!" because let's face it, chicks are basically men without penises.And of course, if you find yourself questioning your directorial decisions. If you feel a light and dishonest treatment of the real problems of division of household labor, child-rearing, life-work balance and generational entitlement is just too glib; remember the acronym BARP. It stands for Booze, Attitude, Recreational Drugs, and Partaaay with emphasis on the taaaay! Just because comedy can be a force for change doesn't mean it should be. The raucous screams of vodka soaked party-goers will do just as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Had No Idea This Was Going On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the writers of The Hangover, another funny film.In a way this movie could be titled "Mom's Revenge". It is a comedy about how much moms have to do raising kids and how under appreciated they are. With all the humor and punch lines, a comedy with an actual theme is more than a little unusual. What really brings this movie is the cast. The script is more than a little unbalanced. Considering it is about this subject, it is a natural.Mila Kunis leads the parade of mom's here with plenty of good help. She is a bad mom, though here, quite by accident, she turns out to be a good mom after all, maybe. There is verbal comedy, and physical comedy. Warning, there are some very adult themes here too, much less some great skin shown in a few sections. It is a defined R movie for sexual and language references. Christina Applegate actually plays the dictatorial PTA President Gwendolyn in a way that would make Roseanne jealous. She really lines up in the feud with Amy that gives the gags more substance and effect. Mila Kunis(Amy), Kathryn Hahn (Carla) and Kristen Bell (Kiki) work well together as a team. Seems like Hahn gets a lot of physical comedy though Kunis gets some in a couple of parts too. Warning- Do not trying talking on the cell phone while driving like Amy does at home. Remember this is a movie and it does suggest that stupid idea again, even though the folks who try that in real life wind up RIP.This is really a woman's flick much like 9 to 5 was years ago where women rule the day. The men's roles are few and get very little screen time and the attitude is they are "tools" of the women all the way through. The plot itself is quite predictable, but the punch lines carry this movie along well. Especially, watch for the cameos of Martha Stewart, because they are funny.The film is not too long, and really plays like a mom's fantasy of what being a mother with kids can be. This is kind of like Disney World for mom's with a lot of comedy mixed in.At the end, when the credits role, there is a nice sequence added with all the main actresses talking with their real mom's. I think this is a nice touch instead of having out takes at the end. I have a feeling the DVD will have the out takes, and considering how funny the film is, I have a feeling this gag reel will be a reason to buy the DVD. So if you miss this one in the theater, wait for it on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch "Bad Moms" for only one reason, Mila Kunis (Amy). Not only is she a Russian hot-tie but she also has real acting chops whether as an action hero ("Jupiter Ascending") or as a love interest ("Ted"). But I was pleasantly surprised when Christina Applegate, another accomplished actor and former child TV star, showed up as Gwendolyn, the guileful PTA president who pushes Amy to her limit. Emboldened by her two new "mom" friends, slutty Carla (Kathryn Hahn) and mousy Kiki (Kristen Bell), Amy throws in the towel and starts 'breaking bad'. This movie deserves critical applause because of its ending, or rather endings. We cheer when Amy gets up off the canvas and knocks out Gwendolyn, we tear when Carla shows the love she has hidden from her son, we grin when Kiki starts wearing the pants in her marriage, and we smile when Gwendolyn discards her mask and gives back to the group. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely wowed by this movie. I went to go see it with a friend mainly because of Kristen Bell (We are huge Veronica Mars fans.) We were both not too excited going in since we made plans last minute and we weren't sure if it was going to flop like most comedies nowadays do. But at the end of the movie, we both wanted to see it again immediately. I could not stop laughing the whole movie but there were also some touching moments that were very heartwarming. I thought Kristen Bell was HILARIOUS as Kiki. She keeps amazing me with her talent as an actress. Mila Kunis did a pretty good job as well. Kathryn Hahn was also SUPER funny. She made me laugh every time. Also shout out to Annie Mumolo as Vicky, she had me laughing a lot. My friend and I were the only young people in there who were either not moms, on a date or with their mom. This movie is definitely targeted towards middle- aged woman but I definitely think anyone can enjoy it, except maybe not young kids because it is NOT a clean comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was this movie of the year material? Um, no. Was this meant to be a thought-provoking, heart-wrenching epic? Nope. Was this a documentary worthy of some award? Still no. But what it WAS is so under appreciated and the bad reviewers need to take a step back, get off their high horses, and just learn to enjoy. "Bad Moms" was a hysterical (if at times edgy/cringe-worthy) comedy about all of the aspects of being a mom today. My best friend and I went with our teenage daughters, and we ALL laughed hysterically, and even shed a tear at some scenes. While grossly exaggerated/unrealistic in some parts, this comedy did justice to the trials and tribulations that women go through as mothers in the 21st century. From being under appreciated by our children and spouses, as well as at work (if we are a working mom), to the unrealistic expectations put on us by society, just about every type of mom was represented, and it worked. It was meant to be a funny, irreverent, certainly ridiculous, but most of all, an honest representation of motherhood as experienced by many women. So lighten up, people. If you expected an Academy Award winning performance or some wholesome family film, go see another movie that isn't rated R (you DID see that, didn't you?!?) But if you want to giggle, snort, and surreptitiously wipe a tear while nodding your head and thinking "Amen, sister!", then check out this film. You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being A Mom Is Tough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Bad Moms", starring Mila Kunis-Jupiter Ascending, Forgetting Sarah Marshall; Kathryn Hahn-Tomorrowland, Crossing Jordan_tv; Kristen Bell-The Boss, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Christina Applegate- Vacation_2015, Mars Attacks!.This is a comedy that is aimed at a female audience-kind of like a female Hangover-but men can enjoy it, too. At least I did. Mila plays a typical hard working mother of 2. She tries juggling all her mom/wife duties with a career and ends up being overly stressed out. No one appreciates her or what all she does including her husband and kids. Christina plays the head of the P.T.A. and she takes her job seriously. She likes to make rules and gets her jollies enforcing them and lording it over everyone. Mila finally blows her top and says enough is enough with trying to be the perfect mom. Kathryn and Kristen are other moms who agree with her and become close friends in her mini revolt. Basically, the point is about how tough it is to be a good mom and raise your kids to become productive adults-as opposed to self-centered, overachieving, self-entitled little monsters-and still have some 'me' time to enjoy life. There are several good cameos; I remember seeing Martha Stewart, Wanda Sykes and J J Watt-I think he does HEB commercials. At the very end, as the credits start, they have the actors sitting with their real moms and they tell stories about themselves being bad moms. It's rated "R" for language, drug &amp; alcohol content and sexual content- including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 41 minutes. It is a little crude and is definitely not for kids-I saw several people with kids that looked under the age of 10 in my showing-but I thought it was funny. I would probably buy it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad way to spend a couple hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would caution females against seeing this with their boyfriends/lovers/husbands. I felt that there were more than a few times that my spontaneous need to laugh out loud was restricted by the fact that my long-term boyfriend was sitting next to me. There were far too many sexist jokes made re: men, men being big babies, men's penises and so on; jokes that I don't think a great many men will appreciate, no matter how confident they are with their own sexuality and penile attributes. My significant other is someone who is funny as hell himself, but rarely RARELY laughs at others' jokes or any kind of comedy. However, with this film I noticed he had a hard time suppressing his guffaws at several of the jokes made. And, yes, there is plenty to laugh at in this movie.SPOILER ALERT, BIG TIME: I don't want to write anything that will give away any of the many, many great one-liners. Just let me say that, at one point in the movie, I was astounded at how foot-stompingly, crowing-out-loud-with-laughter funny one of the scenes was. Completely shocking, too, and, if your male partner is still "intact," ---- look it up if you don't get what I mean--- then PLEASE don't take him to see this flick. I thought it was RIOTOUSLY HILARIOUS, but I don't think he will see the humor in it----at all.All of the lead women in this film are women I like. Mila Kunis was terrific, but it was Kathryn Hahn as "Carla" who really stole the show. She overshadowed everyone with her performance, and not just because she had most of the best lines, either.As far as the profanity went, I found it a bit overdone. Tiresome, in fact. I know saying "fuck" a lot is oh-so hip now, but sometimes less is more, definitely. Use your big, more clever words, script writers. Thank you.I looked up Jay Hernandez ("Jessie") and was surprised to find that in reality he is only 5'8" (and 1/2"!) tall. Somehow he was made to tower over women who must be nearly 5'8" themselves. Hollywood magic. Please go see this movie with your girlfriends. You will be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude yet hilarious, Bad Moms is immensely watchable thanks to its supporting cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who needs Cyndi Lauper when you have Kathryn Hahn ? the main reason why Bad Moms is a fun film for women of all ages. These girls have a lot of fun, as do we, but make no mistake; this isn't a chick flick in the conventional sense.That's the imprint any male member of the audience will walk away with. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, Bad Moms isn't a soapy sitcom, nor a romantic comedy or a date movie. There are plenty of other films catering to that need (Me Before You being the recent most popular girlie movie). Instead, the approach is in its sincere message that there's no such thing as a perfect family. And spinning this message into a hilarious farce is the second reason ? the fact that the story was scripted by Jon Lucas and Scott More, the same guys who first wrote The Hangover, an outrageous guys-only comedy. Surprisingly, and as men writing this story, their insight echoes the plight of struggling soccer moms as the hardest job in the world. One such case is that of Amy (Mila Kunis), a young mom living out of her minivan while juggling work, kids, and marriage. Making things worse are the so called 'perfect moms' led by super rich PTA president Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate) and her sidekick Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith). A good thirty minutes goes by where Amy wears the face of almost every mom watching this film. Then, buckled by the weight of her world crumbling down, and increasing harassment from Gwendolyn and crew, Amy finally snaps. Enter Hahn and Kristen Bell, fellow moms to Amy's rescue.What follows is an infinite assortment of gags, both whimsy and slapstick, but squarely rooted in crude comic territory. While the premise isn't really original (Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher comes to mind), and the shenanigans they get up to are reminiscent of previous films, the payoff is in the well-earned laughs. We owe this in no small part to Hahn, who once again steals the show every time she is on screen and the main reason why Bad Moms is immensely watchable. Prepare for loose-lipped one-liners, frequent F-bombs, multiple references to other films and TV shows (don't miss the short but hilarious stab at Creed), and before you know it, you end up watching a raunchy film about motherhood; If that makes any sense. Even so, the icing on the cake is the ensuing sorority row between Gwendolyn and Amy, resulting in the latter running for PTA president. After Hahn's promiscuous antics, Applegate is the exact opposite but the icy itch with a capital B that we all love to hate.More coarse language and an outrageous party later, and you get the notion that this may have never been intended as a chick flick. Sure, this is one wild film for a girl's night out but not one to be underestimated by the discerning male audience. There's plenty to keep everyone knee-slapped yet it never gets overly gross to the point that even Martha Stewart would find tasteless. So ditch those fictitious superhero films for a change and watch this film instead, for no other reason than that the fact that Bad Moms ,in the end, is nothing but real superheroes disguised as mothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amusing Night Out - Nothing More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are expecting this movie to be the next Oscar winner for best film, unfortunately you will be disappointed. This isn't an Oscar winning movie, but it's not a Razzie either. The movie is fun, light, and entertaining. The premise is simple, yet realistic and relatable. An overworked, over-stressed, and under appreciated mom has had enough and she decides to take a break from all her responsibilities in life. The cast is a blast to watch. Their chemistry on screen is very visible in what they do. Like any movie, the plot has high-points and low-points emotionally wise. The cast does a very good job of adapting to the situation, to prevent it from being boring or drawn-out.Overall, the movie is a 7 on 10. I score it this grade because it delivers on it's promise. It is a lighthearted, entertaining, and fun movie that is relatable to mothers (and maybe fathers too) from any walk of life. Is it going to win an Oscar? No. Is it the ideal choice for a fun night out with the friends? Absolutely, yes.</fullReview>

When you go to see this type of movies, it is nice to see that you get what you were expecting with a plus (nice message about how hard it is to be the perfect mom nowadays).Also the music is fantastic and it contributes to make a movie a great experience. We loved it and I recommend it to everyone who is looking for a funny movie with all the comedy ingredients. Do not miss it, it is one of the movies that I have honestly enjoyed more this summer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comedy I've Seen All Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is definitely the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. Bad Moms was just a straight forward comedy movie that I loved. Until now, I thought the best comedies this year were Deadpool (2016), Central Intelligence (2016), The Boss (2106), Ghostbusters (2016), and Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (2016). Then I saw Bad Moms. I couldn't stop laughing. I nearly peed! No lie! I saw this opening night at my theater and it was packed. When my mom and I were waiting in line I heard a lady saying, "Oh, I have to go see Jason Bourne with my girlfriends now because Bad Moms sold out." People were laughing every minute. There was not a joke used that people didn't laugh at. It was a great female empowerment movie, too. It could've been a drama about mothers stress but they made an awesome comedy that almost anyone can enjoy. The men who wrote The Hangover (2009) wrote Bad Moms and The Hangover (2009) is one of my favorite movies and in my opinion, Bad Moms is better. I'm astonished that this movie only has a 6.6 out of 10 because i believe it should have a 7.0 at least. Overall, this is a wonderful comedy that is great to see.</fullReview>

The Hangover writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore collaborate again in their directorial debut that attempts to do for the girls what the guys did in their previous film - shock for laughs and do so in their hit/miss shake and bake style with vulgarity and heart in the mix with a trio of newfound mom friends Kunis, Hahn and Bell who face a Cee You Next Tuesday Applegate PTA bitch from hell while also trying to raise their kids in spite of men behaving badly (among other social pitfalls). The lead three are well served particularly comedy vet Kunis who brings her TV talent to full tilt (less said about Bell frankly who I cannot stand and still cannot fathom how she is successful in her plain vanilla blahness well suited for her more demure character here) and the scene stealing Hahn as the blowzy, boozy babe on the make with raunch élan. Funny but could have been hysterical; nice try ladies. 1/2 star also less for Pinkett-Smith who I hate like poison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Lucas and Scott Moore tried something different from Hangover. Bad moms has nice and funny actresses: Mila Kunis as Amy, Kathryn Hahn as Carla, Kristen Bell as Kiki and Christina Applegate as Gwendolyn. It is accepted fact that moms are great and moms have a tough time taking care of their kids. When things get out of control and stress levels are way too high, Amy , Kiki and Carla bond. The bonding between them is so strong, alcohol is swallowed with ease and simplification of differences between circumcised men and uncircumcised men is elaborated in fun filled language. Kathryn Hahn is hysterical with her explanation and Kristen Bell as naive homemaker is wild with happiness just to be with her new friends. The movie is definitely not Oscar worthy but it is fun. There are some scenes where motherhood is appreciated and children are adored. Moms are great. Enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mom's the word in this stupid, silly, surprisingly moral filled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Moms, everyone at some point has had one in some shape or form. Our world today focuses on portraying these lovely women (and sometimes men) as either saints or monsters depending on the acts. Over the years the image of a mom has changed, often gearing towards being a perfect role model who does no wrong and should she make a mistake is cast as a cretin. However, tonight's film decides to explore a different venue, one that is certain to be entertaining to some audiences. Yes, I'm talking about Bad Moms, a comedy that is certain to start up online riots. Hi Robbie K here and I'm back with another review, let's get started. The GOOD ? Delivers what's promised in the trailers ? Short run time ? Decent story with good morals ? Good actingThis review is difficult to write, because I have to keep in mind the target audience the developers had in mind. If you haven't seen the trailers, then you might not know that Bad Moms is an over-the-top, ridiculous comedy geared towards moms, and guess what? that is exactly what you get. If you were expecting something different, then you will be disappointed, but this movie certainly delivers the silliness promised. It's comedy is geared towards what many of my female friends joke about including sexual innuendos, superficial lust jokes, and more meme worthy quotes than you can count. Especially in the beginning, the movie is a one- stop joke box that draws as much stupidity as possible, which kept much of the audience laughing. While the comedy may not have been up my alley, to my surprise Bad Moms had a decent story. Again one shouldn't be surprised that the movie has a plot geared towards mothers and the issues they face. I myself began to roll my eyes at the cheesy drama of the plot and the emphasis on superficial things like sex, alcohol, and a bit of drugs. However, the second act packed that sentimental punch that really hooked me into the movie. The morals embedded in the over dramatic speeches and symphony laden sequences are very powerful and may teach significant others and kids an important lesson. I applaud the directors for being able to drive such a message in a comedy like this, but that certainly gained bonus points in my book. Again, mothers will feel this point the most, but those who have an open mind might feel it in your heart as well Another saving grace is the acting in this movie. I went in expecting really bad work to mold out of the word work and shallow talent. And in truth I kind of got what I expected, but also got some surprises. Mila Kunis did a nice job in this simplistic role, and was able to inject some depth into it. Kathryn Hahn is your number one comedy guru, doing nothing but acting like an ass and having a mouth to go with it. Kristen Bell is?cute, but her character's awkwardness has a limited role of providing a few good lines and very empowering moment. As for the bad girls, well nothing really magical about this performance, other than yeah they are good at being a five-letter word for a dog. The BAD ? Very lazy writing ? Stupid ? Not really uniqueThis is tough to write and not upset people, but I'll do my best. Yes, the movie does deliver what the trailer promised, but that doesn't mean it's the best quality when compared to other films. Bad Moms writing is essentially how many rants, shouts, and one-liner quotes can be fit in a ninety-minute run time. It's fun and enjoyable, but it certainly is lazy writing, especially once the F bombs and penis grenades are dropped. Sometimes these jokes are timed very well, or delivered in a manner that capitalizes the fun (thank you Kathryn Hahn). However, the sheen does dull after the tenth iteration and had me bored until the story picked up. The lack of cleverness also shows just how stupid the movie is as well. Something else that may cross the line is some of the more intense party moments our directors filmed (alcohol anyone). As such, the unique quality of this film is very lacking and quickly falls into the mediocre milieu that plagues the theaters these days. In addition, some of the comedy could be "insulting" to the more traditional member. Therefore exercise caution, pay attention to the rating, and avoid the movie if you are easily offended. The VerdictBad Moms is certainly not the best film to arrive at the silver screen, but it is also exactly what you expected from the trailers. The team certainly created a movie geared toward the mom audience and I have no doubt most in this category, and a few significant others, will laugh their heads off. Therefore I have to give points to the directors for delivering the promised laughs and story. However, it still is a very simplistic movie that does not contain anything really unique, nor the best comedy I have seen. It's just fun. Other than for a girl's night out, I cannot recommend this one for the theater, but certainly take a look at it on RedBox. My scores are: Comedy: 7.5-8.0 (because it delivers to its category) Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's light and breezy, def no Oscar winner (not trying to be!) and I cannot wait to see it again. Laugh out loud funny. Kathryn Hahn was HILARIOUS (actually, I wouldn't be surprised if she snags some award for her role). Went with a gaggle of fellow mums and we all laughed, chortled and slapped our knees 'dying' with laughter throughout. Acting is nothing to rave about (except Kathryn) but who cares, the whole film was totally enjoyable on the whole. The likable Mila is in pretty much every frame, which is fine, she's harmless, and gives good hair. Christina Applegate is always good too. Trippy seeing Kristen Bell as a frumpy mother of four kids. Love that it was shot in New Orleans. Fill up that coffee cup with something fun and go check it out with some friends. Great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always go to premiere nights, so Thursday's are my "movie go to dates"I know for a fact that if I was a mom, my character in real life would be like the beautiful Mila Kunis. I absolutely loved this movie, while chugging down my popcorn all by myself, I found the random person sitting beside laughing more at my "laughter" rather then the movie itself. I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I am not sure why it had a 6.7 rating, I gave it a 10. It was probably because of the language barrier, it had a couple curse words; but for me that's what made it so funny. I haven't had this much fun at the movies and laughed so much in a while now. It does relate to real life situations and the reason why I laughed so much is because most of the things that the movie was about my own mom would do. Mami would go out her way and would do anything for my two little sisters and I, even though I'm a daughter I did put myself in "mom" position while watching this movie. Some people recommend it if your a mo, but I personally recommend it for those who had babysit there nephews, cousin, or anything related to kids because its pretty similar how insane it is to take care of a kid. Director Jon Lucas, Scott Moore were also the ones who wrote it, did such an amazing job at producing this movie. I loved it so much that even the editing and music prod was amazing. I've seen quite a few funny movies, but when it came to comedy for me this is the best summer movie for 2016 I've seen! It also had some sexual content, which I believe it made it even more exiting. Jesse Hernandez was the perfect role for the simple daddy who's majorly attractive. Made me daydream of eventually someday someone like him appeared in my life! I also found out he's playing on the next upcoming movie Suicide Squad! how fascinating!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every minute of this movie was hilarious. There was so much raunchiness and hilariousness with so many amazing lines, it is a MUST see, especially for any moms who know what it's like to be over-worked and under-appreciated. In today's society, it is not easy to be a mom, especially if you work and this movie captures all of it and how us moms sometimes feel like we need to throw in the towel for a couple of days and just have fun. This is likely to be my new favorite comedy (it is up there with The Hangover and Wedding Crashers for me). Kathryn Hahn deserves an award for her role-she played THE best part! Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis were also amazing. So go grab some "to-go" cups with some of your best girlfriends and get to the theater to see this!! You will NOT be disappointed!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No masterpiece, perhaps, but, lordy, it's fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much out of this one, but, man, was it a ton of fun. I can't claim it's a great or deep film in any way, but when I laughed at a comedy as much as I did this one, that's a success. Mila Kunis plays a career woman and mother of two who is ready to drop dead from her thousand-obligations-a-day life. When pushed by ultra-mom Christina Applegate, she publicly gives up. Joining in her rebellion are slutty single mom Kathryn Hahn and secluded, dorky housewife Kristen Bell. The premise, and, indeed, the entire script, are pretty negligible, but it's just fun to be around these three party animal ladies and their drunken escapades (the writer/director duo is probably most famous for writing The Hangover movies). Kunis is a fine protagonist (it's hard for me to accept little Jackie from That '70s Show as a mother of two middle schoolers), but Hahn and Bell own the movie. God, they're hilarious. I hope this finally gets the public to recognize Hahn for the great comic actress she is. The villains (Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith and Annie Mumalo being the rival moms, Clark Duke the too-young boss, and David Walton Kunis' cheating husband) could have used a bit more work, but they were mostly fun. Certainly this was one of the more surprisingly good movies of summer '16. I think it'll be a huge hit, too, seeing as the audience I saw it with was eating it up. It actually garnered applause, the first time in a long while I've heard that in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of the summer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to this movie and honestly have never had this much fun at the movies! My wife was a single Mom for 4 years before we met, and could relate so well to the struggles the ladies on screen were portraying. This movie had such honesty and was so funny! Mila Kunis is a fantastic actress and we were laughing the entire time. Yes, the movie is crude, but come on, when you're a single Mom life can be rough, and I'm sure everyone watching can relate to the ladies on screen losing it and totally letting go. As a guy I found the movie very touching as well as funny. I give it 10 stars because the movie was so much fun! I highly recommend it especially if you're a Mom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ribald and Raunchy--an enjoyable companion to new Ghostbusters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part raunchy comedy and part sharp social commentary, Bad Moms should please those seeking a Bridesmaids relief in the summer doldrums and those seeking insight into modern motherhood. Directors and writers (Hangover) Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have a bold entry into summer comic stakes already well represented by the female-driven Ghostbusters.Amy (Mila Kunis) is a highly functioning mom with 2 adorable kids, a demanding job, and a slacking husband, Mike (David Walton). I like the set up because it is all too real?stressed out modern mom trying to be perfect.What ensues is liberation of the motherly spirit, with a little help from her two buddies, Kiki (Kristen Bell) and Carla (Kathryn Hahn). Booze and rowdiness ensue with some crisp dialogue (pop culture allusions abound e.g. Ike Turner and ISIS), the kind I found lacking in the other buddy film recently, Absolutely Fabulous.Although combat with the uptight PTA president, Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), has an arc you could predict, the commentary about the clash between good-mom and bad-mom is frequently spot on, especially as Amy parses the meaning of "bad mom." It's not what you'd expect, but it is so insightful and encouraging that all good moms and dads will embrace the bad.Some of the sexual humor, notably from socially-rough Carla, downright challenges the R rating but in a good way because without it the bad mom theme has no strength or rather is just too boring to stand on its own. The adults in our preview audience roared as the humor became bluer and bluer, and not just because they were at a free film.If you are a mom of any color and size, or a dad who cares, this fantasy will move you to shake your head in agreement that being a good mom means you have to be a bad one. Go figure.</fullReview>
