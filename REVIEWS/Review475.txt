		<shortDescription>Strangely comical, yet still an excellent film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any reservations that I had about the film being be a turkey, were almost immediately quelled upon seeing the movie. From the offset Mr. Depp throws himself into the role of Icabod Crane with enthusiasm and gusto; portraying excellently a man of "science" suddenly out of his depth in legend. Christina Ricci also plays the role of Katrina van Tassel superbly; a sure sign of good things to come from this talented young actress.I would be reluctant to call this film an outright horror film - the special effects are used primarily to enhance the plot and visual appearence, and the gore level is low. The visual detail is a masterpiece - the sets are fantastic and lighting brilliant. Tim Burton has superbly used music and suspense to build the thrill in the film. However, the comical interjections provide the required break-up of the suspense.All in all a very well put together film, with solidly good acting, and most of all a superb plot. Well worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Version of Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a "story behind the story" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere.The dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's Johnny Depp who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over-the-top portrayal of the anti-hero, Ichabod Crane, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear.The lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman "to life", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before. It's unlikely that this cinematic version will ever be surpassed. Superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly stunning film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has done it again. It seems he can't really go wrong; especially when he's paired with Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. The production is gorgeous in every way; the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, the set design is incredible and the way Burton uses the color red to accentuate the lack of color and dreariness otherwise experienced in Sleepy Hollow is a visual treat. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to watch. The performances are flawless, I have to commend Burton for using such a great array of underappreciated character actors, such as Jeffrey Jones and Michael Gough.. and even poor little Casper Van Dien; the man just can't seem to get any respect (and he doesn't here either). Ricci is wonderful in a role totally against type, and Depp is refreshing as ever. Christopher Walken is just the coolest guy ever, and as the Headless Horseman he's even scarier than normal. The best thing, though, is Danny Elfman's music. Why on earth doesn't the man have an Oscar yet? What is going on?? He should at least get a nomination for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual masterpiece, pure Tim Burton. ***1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) ***1/2Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken Director: Tim Burton Running Time: 102 minutes Rated R (for graphic horror violence and gore, and brief sexuality)By Blake French: Tim Burton is just about as good as they get in the movie business when it comes to creating an atmospheric world to inhabit specific characters. "Sleepy Hollow" is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences. Some of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating.  The film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village.  Once Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own. The Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for "Sleepy Hollow." He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth. Tim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as "Edward Scissorhands," "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and even the best Batman film yet, "Batman Returns."  Johnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear.  Although "Sleepy Hollow" offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average.  The conclusion of "Sleepy Hollow" works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place. It is one of the preferred closings I've seen in a while. Despite a few personal objections, "Sleepy Hollow" is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has again proved his worth with a masterpiece of gothic horror. The whole way the film is made is excellent, from the way the special effects are used to enhance the story, rather than sell the movie, to the superb acting of the entire cast. I must confess I was a little reluctant at first to see Johnny Depp in the lead role, but from the outset my mind was changed as he threw himself enthusiastically into the part with exactly the right mix of assumed self confidence tempered by a realistic portrayal of a man hopelessly out of his depth in the situation in which he finds himself.The story, the sets, the special effects and most of all the cast and director make this a film well worth seeing, definately the best thing out of Hollywood in a very long time. Other directors take note..it's not how big the budget, it's what you do with it. A turkey stuffed with gold is still a turkey, but this film is pure gold, without a hint of poultry.Why are you still here? Go and see this film immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great interpretation of a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this collaboration between Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Washington Irving. Combining such incredible talents as Mr. Burton and Mr. Walker proved quite the appropriate recipe for recreating the Irving classic. I have read may other comments about this movie and I find it very disturbing that most people either compare it to Star Wars: Phantom Menace or complain that it is too far removed from the original story.For these people I have a few comments. First, the only connections and comparisons to Star Wars are the actor Ian McDiarmid and the actor/stuntman Ray Park. Beyond that there is nothing within this movie that comes remotely close to a comparison to Star Wars. In my opinion this movie was better than that box office behemoth. If *****had spent as much time on his script for ***, perhaps it would have been as intriguing as Sleepy Hollow. Next, for those who were not satisfied with the movie's departure from the Irving classic I have but one piece of advice: read the story again. Washington Irving was masterful at creating scenes and setting atmosphere but The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was a 20 page examination of the little village and the loves of Ichabod Crane (women, food, writings et al) The Horseman, though mentioned a handful of times, did not appear until the last couple pages and then it alluded to the idea that Brom Bones was the culprit, in disguise, to frighten the poor hero Ichabod.There have been other writings and interpretations of the Sleepy Hollow story that focus more on the spectral form of the Headless Horseman. I believe this movie was done in the spirit of those other works and is among the best. It brings to life the setting of this little valley and attempts to recreate the feeling that Washington Irving described best in his story. It was indicated that Sleepy Hollow was a magical and dream like place, thus the name "Sleepy Hollow." In this little upstate valley the strangest things occur and such ghosts and goblins roam freely if only in the mind of the inhabitants. Tim Burton manages to capture that sensation and allows the audience to feel as if they stepped not into a theater, but another world.Andrew Kevin Walker's workup and translation of the story also makes for a compelling movie. Allowing the changes for the movie adaptation were a sign of genius. Displacing the hero and introducing him to the Sleepy Hollow atmosphere along with the audience, enhanced the experience. Giving a clear background for the Horseman, which is only briefly provided in the original story, was also an improvement to the movie's story. Let's face it, if they had made a 105 minute movie that tried to replicate the original short story there would have been whole theaters full of "sleepy" patrons.The acting was also superb giving a hand to Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci for fabulous performances. As for the rest of the cast? Fantastic. To see all of these wonderful actors in secondary roles was a treat. Starting with Christopher Lee as the chief magistrate in New York; Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and even Casper Van Dien all did magnificent work.Though the story lagged at moments, they were few and far between. The editing in the beginning was a bit choppy but ran more fluently after the 20-30 minute point. An excellent adaptation of a great story. This was definitely a movie that Burton was born to make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has brought this timeless classic to life! "Sleepy Hollow" is a very fine film, with horrific delights, a touch of romance, and witty humor. I was very impressed with the cinematography and the elaborate costumes in this film. Also, the music and sound effects complimented this frightening and legendary story of the murderous Headless Horseman. Overall, I believe this is an excellent film and will definitely be remembered as a landmark in the thriller/horror genre of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Comic, Evil, Tense, Tim Burton...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw Sleepy Hollow in an advanced Preview show in the UK. I went with a couple of mates, all of whom had seen some Tim Burton before but only I was a big fan. I simply love Tim Burton's surreal style of directing and of all the films I've seen of his (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, etc.) I thought only Mars Attacks! Was less than superb. ESH for example has a superbly innocent atmosphere to it but it extremely dark at times. So now, with the release of a new Tim Burton film (of a story I remember fondly from the old Disney Cartoon of the 50's) I was rather excited to see it! And so, I sat in the darkened cinema at my local Multiplex and was amazed. From the dark and mysterious opening to the more humour-spiked yet no less horrific end this is one of my favourite films ever! I'm a big horror film fan and was so looking forward to seeing what take Tim Burton would have a true horror film. My god, he did well. The look of the piece is both extremely dark and evil (the Horseman kills men, women and children with equal relish) but it retains scenes of beautiful, dreamlike states once again making good use of Mr. Burton's own thoughts and visions. It's a very funny film too. Depp is great as an Englishman (only slipping into American twang in one syllable early on in the movie) who will battle the horseman and inspect headless, beetle filled corpses with gusto but then leap onto a chair, screaming when he sees a spider! Christina Ricci was also very good. Usually, her parts are beautiful yet rather evil characters that look innocent and pure until you look into her eyes?not this time though. She just looks, well, sweet! She's softly spoken, and very caring and that's it, no daggers in the pupils, no sly frowns to the camera. Christopher Walken made the small role he had in the headless horseman (he played him on the few occasions he actually had a head) his own with his usual evil visage and a load of screaming! Plus nastily shaved down teeth. The real masterstroke of this film though, or at least its main bad guy is the use of Ray Park. For those of you who saw Episode One and enjoyed the lightsabre battle at the end, Ray Park was Darth Maul! He brings a very modern look to the fighting, most scenes are fought with a sword in one hand and an axe in the other! Its like a medieval John Woo! But almost every time that he gets hold of a weapon he does some kind of stylish one-handed flip to the sound of wonderfully over-the-top swish sounds! The deaths, most of which decapitations of course, are all seen onscreen in their full, gory glory. Not a single piece of blood escapes the cameras here! The film really does have a lot of blood in it but it's a kind of comic book redder than red blood, which adds to the whole films not quite real feel. The cinematography is once again, from Burton, superb. The vile smog0filled 18th century New York and the Scarecrow at the beginning. My god, the scarecrow, its so evil! Onscreen for a second but its image lasts? But anyway, in short, this is a fantastic film. Burton has never done anything this visually eye-popping before (take a bow Industrial Light &amp; Magic). The plot is both intriguing and whimsical, the acting excellent, it has a cameo from Hammer Horror master Christopher Lee and it boasts one of the most evil, most frightening, most superbly realized supernatural baddies I've ever seen?and I've seen plenty! Go see this film if you like horror or you just want some fast-paced fun? 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drawing from his Gothic roots (Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas) Burton has created a truly chilling horrific fantasy that keeps you guessing at every turn. The use of special effects is seemless and yet again, as in his other films, Burton excels at creating a whole look and feeling for the piece. He has managed to re-work the classic horror genre staying true to his own highly personal style and catering to post- Wes Craven cinema audiences' cynicism without taking itself too seriously a la Blair Witch. It is so refreshing to see the work of an art-house genius who hasn't let a big hollywood budget get to his head. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give charming performances as ever, as do rest of the assembled anglo-Brit. star-studded cast. They all look like they had a ball, as will you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie After A Long time.............</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" has to be one of the best horror movies that I've seen for a long time. The story has been brought to life by excellent camera work and mind blowing cinematography. Tim Burton does another brilliant work directing this movie, securing his spot as one of the best directors in present day Hollywood. Also the veteran Francis Ford Coppola comes back from 'retirement' by being the executive producer for this big budgeted movie. The visual effects are stunning, and the dolby surround sound makes the regular cinema goer feel like he is back to the mysterious village of Sleepy Hollow. The background music is also very soothing, and it sets the tone for the movie.The movie could have turned into "The Exorcist" fame of horror but Johnny Depp uncanny knack of being creative in front of the camera has turned Detective Ichabod Crane into some sort of Comic Relief. But this relieves the tension greatly as the dark and foggy village creates a sense of utmost mystery and drama and makes the viewer believe that something terrible is about to happen.......Christopher Walken, though barely has any lines to say in the entire movie he is concrete and is superb through his body actions, re creating the terrifying Headless Horse man a.k.a. "The Hessian Horseman" Michael Gambon is also very good as the Landlord Van Tassel, and young Christina Ricci portraying the young witch, the love interest of Johnny Depp steals the show away from Miranda Richardson, the evil witch plotting to take away all the gold of old Baltus Van Tassel, even at the expense of her rich husband, step daughter and her own flesh and blood, her sister. The movie can be a bit graphic at certain stages especially during the murders but overall, if you watch this in a movie theatre it is bound to give you the creeps, and it will make you feel jittery for a loong time. Overall 10/10..........</fullReview>

Not for the faint hearted though as this film mixes Gothic, gory and plain heads rolling around with romance, hilarity in a way and filled with the hottest of hot Johnny Depp who plays Ichabod Crane an intelligent yet perhaps slightly wimpy detective. He faints 7 times for crap's sake! I do feel the movie lacks faults as it is always good to laugh at stupid mistakes people make!

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is definitely ranked among my five favourite films (and considering I could be ranked among the ten greatest cinema fans, that is saying something). Johnny Depp gives, as always, a brilliant performance in his spectacularly unique style of acting. The only minute flaw I find is that the plot is quite difficult to follow, and you probably won't get it the first time you watch the film (if you do, have you considered joining Mensa?). This film could more than likely rank as a classic Horror movie.Oh yes, and Christopher Walken was tantalizingly fierce, and Miranda Richardson tantalizingly sinister.For all Horror fans out there, this movie's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now let's not loose our heads... this was an awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton, as always you know my rant on the love I have for this director, when given a dark subject, he always does a great job with it. Everyone knows the story of the famous headless horseman of Sleepy Hollow, every Halloween, we are guaranteed to at least see the cartoon or hear the story. So one of the best known ghost stories of all time stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, the famous scientist who is a non-believer until he finally faces the scary figure. Johnny was definitely a great choice as Ichabod, he brought the perfect amount of strangeness, intelligence and then you have to love that he adds Ichabod being a bit of a coward, which to be honest was very human. Then Tim just had to add the nightmarish feature of having Christopher Walken as the ghost of the headless horseman, that wasn't a pretty image.In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched by his superiors to the Hudson Highlands hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate a series of brutal slayings in which the victims have been found beheaded. A frequent user of new, though so far unproven investigative techniques such as finger-printing and autopsies, Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow armed with his bag of scientific tools only to be informed by the town's elders that the murderer is not of flesh and blood, rather a headless supernatural warrior from beyond the grave who rides at night on a massive black steed. Crane does not believe them and begins his own investigation, until he comes face to "face" with the Headless Horseman. Boarding a room at the home of the town's richest family, the Van Tassels, Crane develops an attraction to their daughter, Katrina, even as he's plagued by nightmares of his mother's horrific torture when he was a child. Delving further into the mystery with the aid of the orphaned Young Masbeth, whose father was a victim of the Horseman, Crane discovers within the Western Woods both the Horseman's entry point between this world and the beyond, the gnarled Tree of the Dead, and his grave. He finds the Horseman's skull is missing though the murders continue until Crane uncovers a murky plot revolving around revenge and land rights with the Horseman controlled by Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, who sends the killer after her.Sleepy Hollow is sure to be a classic down the line, I loved that it's rated R, because honestly I know this is supposed to be a child's ghost story, but if it was made that way with Tim Burton as director, it would have taken away the good scares that Sleepy Hollow provides. This is a pretty bloody movie and does have some really good scares, so I'm warning you ahead of time. But there are terrific actors, great sets and this will be a fun movie to watch every Halloween. Tim Burton gives us another dark classic that teaches us how to get "aHEAD" in life! Lol, you never saw that coming, did you? Yeah, just watch the movie, it's a lot of fun.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>surely this film was hacked up by the studio? perhaps not but i feel there were serious flaws in the storytelling that if not attributed to the editing process could only be caused by grievously bad, criminal indeed, writing and directing.i understand the effect burton wished to achieve with the stylised acting similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhands, but here unfortunately it falls flat and achieves no mythical depth of tropes but only the offensive tripe of affectation. ie bad acting and shallow characterisation even for a fairytale.finally not that scary, indeed only mildly amusing in its attempts. the use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. the mystery of who is the headless horseman would suffice, no need for the myth about a german mercenary, although christopher walken did cut a dashing figure but not that menacing - seeing the horsemans head makes him seem far friendlier that a decapitated inhuman nine foot tall spirit as in the original legend.no real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic in burtons oevure. stilted and clipped as my parting shot...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but very, very close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the so-so parts: While Christina Ricci's cool portrayal of Katrina gives the character an appropriately otherworldly aura, she really could have used more fire at emotional moments. Some scenes are unduly rushed, including a few with crucial exposition, making the plot hard to follow at some points. Finally, Danny Elfman's music is too intrusive at times, distancing viewers when they should be drawn in.That's ALL that's wrong with this picture; everything else is perfect or nearly so. Tim Burton's films are always visually rewarding, and this one has terrifically moody atmosphere. Having lived in hilly, wooded areas close to rivers and creeks, I can testify that there are indeed places that look and feel a lot like the Sleepy Hollow of this movie. Many scenes have so little color that they might almost as well be in black-and-white; this makes the few splashes of color (flames, witchcraft symbols, and of course blood) much more striking. One understands how the movie got an Oscar for art direction.The plot, which as you probably know varies drastically from Washington Irving's original story, is diabolically complex and closer to a mystery/thriller than horror as such. It reminded me of the fiction of Avram Davidson, a noted fantasist with a penchant for complex mystery plots.Anyway, back to the movie. Except for the rushed scenes alluded to above, Burton handles the plot (perhaps the most complex in any of his movies) with exceptional grace, dropping in telling visual details along the way that come back in unexpected places later on. I especially liked the underlying theme about science vs. superstition, and note that while many details of this particular case lie beyond the realm of science, it is still science and reason that crack the case open in the end. The bits of ca. 1800 cutting-edge (so to speak) technology were fascinating as well; my favorites were the magic lantern that threw lighted shapes on the walls, and the thaumatrope toy which combined pictures of a bird and a cage. (It's probably not a coincidence that both of these are ancestors to the motion picture.)Finally, I loved Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod Crane. Even though the character's situation and background were quite different from Irving's version, Depp, Burton, and scriptwriters Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker remain true to the spirit of the original Ichabod Crane. He could almost be a Buster Keaton-type character, an awkward wimp who accomplishes great feats of derring-do by the end of the movie, and for me Depp's portrayal recalls "Sherlock, Jr.", in which Keaton dreams that he is the world's greatest detective. Even though Irving wrote no sequels to "Sleepy Hollow", I'd love to see more of this film version of Ichabod Crane; while the movie looks great and has a terrific script, it's Depp and Crane who put it over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fantasy captures the essence of American folklore using the charms of Burton's film-making. Subtle and nuanced in its approach to the genre, and yet wonderfully horrific at times this flick shines with creativity unlike any film of its type in the past ten years. For those film buffs who have had their fill of sub-par filler fantasy this movie will whisk you away to a mindset you had far forgotten you possessed. All performances throughout the duration of the film where stellar and it is quite easy to tell that this cast (each chosen wisely for their role) where enjoying this film as much making it as I was watching it, which adds hugely to the film's appeal. Extending to an even broader audience this movie puts a heavy importance on its cinematography which casts itself as a narrator that not only introspectively delves into its scenes, but transports the viewer deeper and deeper into this world. Definitely a must see for those of us left with a little imagination and a yearning for out of the ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sleepy hollow is brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>sleepy hollow is a truly brilliant film, there are lots of twists and turns which are guaranteed to keep you on your feet. I was most impressed when seeing it for the first time. As Johnny Depp is in it that is an added bonus most definitely. He is gifted with being able to take on lots of very different roles and there is no better actor then Johnny for doing voices. His character in Sleepy Hollow is certainly nothing like any role he's taken before. The special effects are excellent they all look very realistic. All Tim Burtons films have that magical thing about them, they are all very different to your average movie and are most definitely worth seeing, I would give Sleepy Hollow 10/10 and if you have not seen it already you are missing out because its a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Story Of The Conception Of Sleepy Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day, a board of movie studio executives were gathered around a big, big table. One of them burst out: "Guess what! I just signed a deal to make the Sleepy Hollow story into a movie!"- "Get out!", said the others, "that cool story with the headless knight?"- "The very same", the first one said, "and guess who will be writing the screenplay? Andrew Kevin Walker!"- "No way!", the others shouted, "the guy who wrote Se7en and 8MM? That guy is a true master of the dark and the suspenseful! He'll make that story into the true underbelly of sleaze and grit it deserves! WOW!"- "Wait a second", said one of the others, even though he was as excited as the rest, "won't the story lose the essential storybook feel if a realist like Walker is writing the screenplay?"- "Never fear!", proclaimed the first, "because to direct this movie, I have none other than... Tim Burton! Complete with Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman, as always!"- "Fantastic!", screamed one of the others, knocking his chair over backwards in excitement, "That's simply perfect! Burton's off-beat style will complement the story and Walker's gritty take on the story and make this the movie of the year!"- "The decade!", screamed another.- "The century!", shrieked a third.- "Marvellous!", they cried. "Splendid! Wonderful! How did you do it?"But one of the others, a reedy little man with spectacles, said: "I don't think it will be that good after all."- "Not that good?", exclaimed the others, furiously, "weren't you listening? Burton! Walker! Depp!"- "Furthermore", the reedy man carried on, "I think the end result will be disappointingly tame. There will be no sparkle, the actors will look like they don't really care about anything, and the whole thing will feel like a made-for-TV movie with a special effects budget."- "Ridiculous!", hissed one.- "Preposterous!!", seethed another.But the reedy man was absolutely right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gore-ror film, thin on fright and plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, as well as knowing about other Tim Burton films (Nightmare Before Christmas, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks, etc.), you'd think going into a film such as this that not much could really put you off. Wrong. Despite how I rate it, this film is entirely watchable...maybe even two or three times compared to some other films out there. But, to me, it falls short on several fronts.First, I'm a big-time reader and I thoroughly enjoyed Washington Irving's short story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." So I was disappointed in that this film made more or less no attempt whatsoever to follow that story. In Irving's story, Ichabod Crane moves to the area and is a school teacher. In this movie, he is a constable sent from New York to investigate three murders by decapitation.Second, part of the allure of the short story is Crane's infatuation with Katrina Van Tassel and the friction this causes between him and Katrina's would-be lover "Brom Bones" (Abraham van Brunt). The story alludes to the fact that perhaps the headless horseman is indeed Brom Bones scaring Crane (the Disney cartoon actually hints at this as well); the movie allows no such character interplay.Third, the whole point of this movie seems to be the mindless decapitation of people. And there is a lot of it. A LOT. Men, women, and one child (though the child's decapitation takes place, thankfully, off-screen). And it is gory. Not a whole lot of blood, but plenty of flesh. If you're squeamish at all, that's a good enough reason to avoid this film.Fourth, the evil character's recitation of motivation (a staple among Saturday morning cartoons from 20 years ago, but grossly out of place in a 21st Century movie) at the film's end is drivel. It could have been shortened, "figured out," and almost entirely left out -- although it did allow for one more beheading on camera. Whopee.Fifth, the script (and acting) is pretty poor. Now, I like Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc.) and I think the guy is great at playing unusual characters, but his performance here reminds me of an Al Gore speech. Because he's done so much so well, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and just blame the script. In fact, you can pretty much blame the script for the whole movie.Not all is bad in this film. The swordplay by the horseman is excellent. The special effects are pretty well done (some are meant to make you laugh, but just come across as cheesy). And there is the neat bow-tie at the end as the villain gets it and the good guy goes home happy. Again, it's entirely watchable, just not that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astoundingly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so I'll preface with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie "based" on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship "an'-it-harm-none" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's "The Golden Bough", if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant her to be a blonde.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Tim Burton movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy Tim Burton movies, you will certainly enjoy this one. Although not particularly true to the original story, or even the Disney version, the movie does contain all the elements that make Sleepy Hollow a classic scare story. Also throughout the movie are little touches that just scream Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beetlejuice all receive a nod in this movie (whether intentional or not I don't know).Sleepy Hollow does deserve the rating it has been given due to a few instances of gore. It certainly isn't the Disney story we all remember from childhood. Although, there are just as many laughs as there are squirms. A definite must see if you enjoy black comedy with a dash of real horror thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as exciting as a yawn.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of Ichabod Crane ? played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point ? to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas.Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and succeeded in making it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after cinematographer in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of Depp and Burton's astounding name-recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very successful filming of a nice horror story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, you should keep in mind that what Tim Burton likes and always tries to do is telling stories somewhat reminding of fairy tales. He likes to act like a "storyteller". Therefore, you should not take the story very seriously. For if you do, you will not understand what the movie really tells about.Sleepy Hollow is based on an English folk story about the curse of some killed warrior. Burton's filming of the story is really excellent, for the story is a really short one. Making it a long and whole film with no disturbing extras must have been a really hard job. Burton has perfectly overcome this difficulty. The natural and still thrilling atmosphere is another success of the director. He felt no need to special effects, mostly thanks to his efficient and affective use of the camera. This way, a fairy tale looks like a real story.The actings of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have contributed to the atmosphere to a great extent, as well: It is a horror story, yet we see no over-acting by the two leading characters. Christina's mimic-less face has been subject to criticism, but the fact that we do not know whether Katrina is good or evil is mostly thanks to that mimic-less face. Thus we see a really good acting, I think.The one problem of the movie is its editing. It looks like made in a hurry. But it does not harm the wholeness of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp verily is a great actor - i think he would be just as brilliant in silent cinema, for his face and especially eyes can express any emotion. And he is a remarkable comedian. I love the way he looks in this film, and i adore the image of it in general, cold and gloomy, an excellent atmosphere for something scary to be happening all the time. So it does , but the story once frightening gets a bit grotesque and full of hilarious moments. Depp's play is just flawless, his somewhat crazy character is adorable, Christina Ricci looks amazing with blonde hair, and also i love the inimitable Christopher Walken whose character here is merely ridiculous... ooh, ten lines, finally.

		<fullReview>Tim's got an undeniable knack for visuals... they'll usually be Gothic, mostly breath-taking, and always excellent. He also has a bit of a twisted side to his humor. Furthermore, he is talented in bringing colorful and well-designed creatures and characters, often of his own creation, to life. And lastly, he does atmosphere so extremely well, it's really just about beyond reproach. All of those are evident here. He takes an old and famous legend(which, I should point out, I have not read, all I know of it is what was in this, and that dull made-for-TV movie that I've also reviewed, from the same year and of the same title, save for adding "The Legend of" to the beginning... so I can make no comparisons or judge the accuracy of this adaptation), reinterprets it and puts together a period piece of immense enjoyment even for those not necessarily into such(I should know, I am one). The plot is interesting throughout, and develops nicely. It's not too predictable, and the twists are great. This is a rather satisfying mystery. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, this is never boring, and the action is cool and exciting... you really can not go wrong when you let Ray Park loose in front of a camera and give him someone to beat up or slash at(the choreography is masterful). This has great acting by most... putting Depp(as the squeamish and eccentric Ichabod) and Ricci(am I the only one who can just get lost in those doe-eyes?) in the same film makes perfect sense, especially under this man's direction. Even Van Dien and the children are pretty convincing. Richardson utterly steals the show, and it looks like she was as ecstatic to be in this as it is for us to watch her. The script is well-written, and the dialog is marvelous. In addition to being bleak, creepy and a stunning recreation of the look of the period(with magnificent sets and costumes), this is wacky and comical. Somehow, the tone works. Fantastic score. The FX hold up well, and are used as a tool, not the focus. A young police officer(Johnny) openly protests the horrible conditions of the justice system of 1799, and advocates science in place of imprisoning people based on pure suspicion. A judge(played by Christopher Lee, who commands the screen in his short cameo) sends him to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, under the guise that he is to capture whoever has been killing its citizens recently. What he isn't told until he gets there, is that this is no mere mortal... it is the feared headless horseman(who is built up well, and has an impact whenever we see him in this). Will he have to reconsider his stance, that everything has a natural explanation? And what, precisely, *is* going on? There is quite graphic, bloody violence and gore in this, some material is disturbing, and there is a little bit of mild sexuality and language. The DVD comes with an informational and funny commentary track by Burton, a 29 minute documentary entitled Behind the Legend(I will review it on its own page here on the site), 11 minutes of cast interviews(worth the time, note that they contain spoilers for this, as does the cast list here), a teaser and a trailer for this and finally a small photo gallery. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With dark visuals, impressive acting, and loads of tension, this Tim Burton movie is a stunner for the most part!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first introduced to "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving at a very early age, when I started hearing an audio book version of it. Not long after that, I saw the short animated Disney adaptation of the story. I remember both hearing the audio book and watching the Disney cartoon several times as a kid, it must have been in the early 90's, so I had been familiar with the story for years by the time this adaptation from Tim Burton was released in 1999. However, for some reason, it took me ten years to get around to watching the whole film (I saw just a bit of it years ago), even though I've seen every other Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp. I was expecting "Sleepy Hollow" to be a good movie, and my expectations may have been slightly surpassed! In 1799, there has recently been more than one mysterious murder in the American town of Sleepy Hollow, and the bodies of the victims have all been found with their heads missing! A police constable named Ichabod Crane is sent from New York City to investigate, and soon after arriving in Sleepy Hollow, he is told of the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary sent during the American Revolutionary War who was caught and beheaded with his own sword! It is believed that he is the one responsible for these murders, but Ichabod doesn't believe this, and begins his investigation believing the murderer is a "man of flesh and blood." The constable is boarded in the home of the wealthy Van Tassels, and quickly falls in love with the family's daughter, Katrina. As he continues to investigate, he eventually sees the Headless Horseman himself, and learns that the story is true! One of the things that make this film great is Burton's dark visual style, added to the scenery, full of leafless trees. These visuals are amazing and really fit the haunting atmosphere of this horror movie! The acting here also helps the quality of the film, as Depp puts on a noteworthy performance in the lead role of Ichabod Crane, and the performances from a number of supporting cast members stand out as well, including Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster, who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow, and Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. For the vast majority of the film, there's a lot of tension, which makes most of it consistently entertaining and really keeps the adrenaline pumping! The haunting musical score adds to this. The first romance scene with Ichabod and Katrina is probably the weakest part, but after that, the scenes involving the relationship between those two characters aren't so bad, and don't hurt the film.I know this has obviously been said many times in the past ten years, but Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" does take liberties with the story. Long before sitting down to watch the whole movie, I knew they changed Ichabod's profession from schoolmaster to police constable, and now that I've watched it, I realize there are more differences than that, from what I remember about the story (which certainly isn't everything). However, I'm not complaining. Since the movie is so entertaining, I really don't think it matters how much it follows the source material! Now, unlike some versions of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", this one is not for kids, which I'm sure one would assume with the R rating. But for adult viewers who like horror movies and admire creative filmmakers like Burton, watching this 1999 box office hit could easily be a hauntingly entertaining experience, and not likely a film one could easily forget!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Johnny Depp /Tim Burton movie that i have seen. It is simply an entertaining horror movie with a nice gloomy atmosphere which I much enjoy. I am a horror fan, but I'm not the Exorcist kind of horror fan. I like this one better, it has a more Gothic, beautiful yet dark atmosphere, it doesn't rely on gore and violence, but on the creepiness of the surroundings, like the human-like trees, mist and scarecrows.It's the images that impressed me the most. The hamlet covered in darkness and mist is the most persistent image for me, and it reminds me more of a desaturated painting rather than a movie. The apparent tranquility adds to the creepiness of the whole thing, it reminds of the Grimm Brothers' stories (and of Gilliam's movie which has a very similar look by the way). Another powerful image is the town folks whose' deformed faces are like Halloween masks (the mayor, the reverend, and so forth). They seem like caricatures, which adds to the overall sense of surreal. The interior scenes resemble Dutch Renaissance paintings.Johnny Depp gives a breathtaking performance in his role of Ichabod Crane. He doesn't try too hard, which I like, and carries the whole movie. As in other Burton movies, Depp wears strange glasses at times and uses some sort of steam punk-styled gadgets. The other characters are less developed but enjoyable. I also appreciate the spectacular fighting scenes, they seem like titanic clashes between even opponents, and they are quite memorable.I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a macabre atmosphere as one would expect from Tim Burton, it feels more like a dark fairy tale than a horror film... although like many fairy tales it has its gruesome moments which means it isn't suitable for children.Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane a New York City policeman in 1799 who is sent upstate to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a recent spate of murders. Each has one thing in common, the victim has been decapitated and their head taken. The locals tell Ichobod that they have been killed by a headless horseman who was killed during the War of Independence. As the death toll increases he grows to believe that the people aren't being killed at random, being a logical detective however he doesn't believe that anything supernatural is involved, not until he sees the horseman with his own eyes. While investigating he is rather smitten Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the the town's headman, he is also assisted by Young Masbath, a boy orphaned by the horseman.The film full of good actors, not least Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the lead roles, the lesser roles are nearly all played top quality character actors who viewers will recognise from other well known films. The special effects are good, especially the numerous decapitations. I would definitely recommend this to fans of Tim Burton or of fantasy horror in general so long as they are mid-teens or older, it is a bit too gory for younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This opens with a great hook , maybe not as great as some of the very best hooks seen in DOCTOR WHO and THE X-FILES but still very effective as to pulling the audience into the story . The screenwriters have also written a very well paced script that gives a background story featuring a German mercenary during the American revolutionary war . Yes it`s a good script well directed by Tim Burton who has resisted the temptation to cover the movie in his own bizarre signature , okay he has included a couple of unnecessary ( Probably solely made to give his girl friend at the time Lisa Marie a part ) dream sequences , but there`s not much else that had me think " Oh my god a Tim Burton film , I really must do something more interesting like watch paint dry" as can be the case with his movies . Yes it`s stylized but not to point where it becomes unbearable and I doubt if Burton will ever make a film this good againI mentioned the script and direction but perhaps the best aspect of the movie is the cast . How many movies set in late 18th century North America have characters with North American accents ? That`s right - Far too many so it`s nice to know someone had the common sense to realise that American people of that period spoke with a sort of bastardised Anglo accent and therefore it`s logical that a bunch of British character actors were cast with the American actors adopting none American sounding accents . Johnny Depp so awful accent wise in FROM HELL has no problem with his voice here and the more I see of him the more I think that he`s not taken seriously by a large amount of critics is simply down to the fact he`s just too damned good looking . Depp will one day be remembered as one of the finest actors of his generationSo a good film . Maybe not a classic but it`s well written , well acted and well directed . Almost certainly the best film by Tim Burton</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few films I still watch despite it going against my principles. Like a black man not wanting to have any part of a movie that has racist overtones in it, I, as a Christian, feel likewise with the anti-Christian bias in this film.I'm just such a freak for great visual movies that it's hard for me not to view this DVD every few years as it is one of the most stunning films - cinematography- wise - I have ever seen. Anyway, this visual feast also offers interesting characters and an intriguing story, all of which make the 105 minutes fly by. For the record, what offended me was the overt promotion of "science" over Biblical faith. The Bible is pictured several times, always in a negative connotation, portraying Believers as nothing but superstitious bigots. The reverend in the film is pictured as just as corrupt as the town leaders. Meanwhile, Depp - the good guy in here who solves the crime - points out that science of course has the answer to every question man could have. In addition, the occult is given credence, something the Bible says should not be. So you see why I have trouble with this movie in a number of regards.But, despite all that, ii is not so heavy-handed as to deter me from enjoying the incredible visuals - one of the top ten best-looking films I've seen out of almost 10,000 - and the fact that it's an extremely interesting story with almost no profanity, either. I just look at it as a far-fetched fantasy and enjoy the wild ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful movie to look at, it's gorgeous, Tim Burton's vision of Washington Irving's tale feels alive!'Sleepy Hollow' is the new incarnation of hammer horror, a genre long gone, and Burton is able to get the exact point that made the hammer horror films so unique. The plot is about Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a constable who moves to the town of Sleepy Hollow to solve a series of murders that have been happening there, all murders with the same M.O., their heads removed from their bodies.The screenplay is very based on the hammer style of filmmaking, it is very different from the book, confused, and well... It seems like a Scooby-Doo episode, but that is not entirely bad, the movie still haves a very good conclusion and feels complete.'Sleepy Hollow' may not be what you think you'll get, but it is no doubt a very good film!</fullReview>

I recall having the story read to me and seeing Disney's classic version of the tale in the 1949 animated "The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad". Needless to say, when I saw the advertisements for Tim Burton's take on the story I had to watch it and, to no surprise, I fell in love with Burton's "Sleepy Hollow".The movie is full of Victorian Gothic imagery -- and, as someone mentioned, it has a bit of "steampunk" thrown in to the mix which really adds to all the wonderful imagery in the film.The movie is an exciting mystery which is "peppered" with some (Tim Burton) humor. A very thrilling movie to watch on a dark and stormy night while all the lights are off.This movie is one of my all time favorite films ever! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite versions of SLEEPY HOLLOW was the black and white comic book adaptation by artist Bernie Wrightson; though much shorter than the story upon which it was based, Wrightson's patented style made the comic worth reading. Likewise, Tim Burton's Hammer-driven take is worth a look: it's dark, but light; scary, yet funny. The idea of Crane (Depp) as a steampunk forensics "expert" was sheer genius; that he's squeamish at the sight of blood was a nice touch, too, and his fainting spells make for some fun moments. Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken and every other member of the cast are perfectly cast. The music is memorable; the cinematography to die for. If not Burton's very best (I still tend to lean toward the remake of FRANKENWEENIE, though that may be comparing apples to oranges), it's certainly ONE of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Reason With A Headless Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any resemblance between Washington Irving's whimsical tale of the Hudson Valley and this Tim Burton Gothic horror fest is purely coincidental. Of course that does not mean the film isn't good. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have combined their talents to make a really good film.The original short story involved a bumpkin of a man in Ichabod Crane in love with Katrina Van Tassel who is also being courted by the local jock of the village Brom Bones. When he starts to get serious though the legendary headless horseman who is reputed to be the ghost of a Hessian mercenary from the revolution goes after Ichabad one dark and stormy night and he clears out of Sleepy Hollow. Irving is most cryptic about just what was the Headless Horseman that night.Instead of the bumpkin, Ichabad Crane is transformed into a Sherlock Holmes type constable sent from New York to uncover the mystery behind several beheadings. That's the character that Johnny Depp plays and he's soon courting Christina Ricci as Katrina to the jealousy of Casper Van Dien as Brom Bones.Tim Burton took and expanded the story and we meet the village of Sleepy Hollow who are living in mortal fear. But as Sherlock Holmes would say there is method in the seeming randomness of the Horseman and his victims. It's quite the convoluted plot that brews in Sleepy Hollow. Not only did Tim Burton get a great ensemble performance from his cast, but the film did a great job in recreating the Hudson Valley and at the beginning and end of the film, New York City in the Federalist era of the country. Great Gothic sets, I think Burton was inspired by some of the horror classics that Universal used to do back in the days of the studio system.In addition to those already mentioned, Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Mr.&amp;Mrs. Van Tassel, Michael Gough as the village notary and in flashback Christopher Walken as the Horseman before he went headless should all be singled out.Sleepy Hollow is a well done film and even though it is more Tim Burton than Washington Irving it will give you more than a few frights. As for Johnny Depp as his portrayal was more Sherlock Holmes than Ichabad Crane, perhaps he'll consider doing a Sherlock Holmes movie as a future project. We can only hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an incredible, beautifully crafted film that is highly recommended. I have watched it probably five times now and every time it seems like I'm watching it for the first time. This film has a halloween themed horror genre to it that is very authentic and original because it is based in the late 1700s and there is no modern distractions in it so you an focus on the thrilling plot and keep and in depth look at the characters, especially the main character Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp who does a great job portraying an emotional wreck of a man who happens to be very likable at the same time. Christina Ricci suits the part perfectly of the very beautiful Katrina Van Tassel, the love interest of Johnny Depp's character. This is a great film that should be watched by anyone who likes slightly dark/horror themed where people's heads are cut off haha.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is driven by a bunch of pretty good actors acting pretty well, a few cheap (the maid, etc.) and a few great (Mary van Tassel's sister, Katrina's fiancee) decapitation/gore scenes, a good mystery horror story with comedic elements, many wonderful sets and environents, great stage design, good looking sterile colors, beautiful cinematography and costumes, and of course a hot and lovely Christina. Elfman did a great job on the score. And hey, Ichabod's mother has a sweet pair of bumps there :o)Where this movie lacks most is the directing (Tim Burton is okay, but he doesn't even try to do better) and the screenplay. Ichabod and Katrina are oh so in love but there's not even one real kiss shown in the whole movie. At the end Ichabod's character hasn't changed at all - he's still the same arrogant and snooty looser of a townsman although he has seen a lot since the day he has arrived at Sleepy Hollow. The red blood was too bright, looking artificial and ridiculous (good Hollywood blood - and real blood - has a solid dark wine red color and is not bright red beverage like looking ;-). Many many more holes in the screenplay (and probably the original story too? haven't read the book). I guess we could call the writers "headless"? ;-)My ratings: story 7/10, cast 8/10 (except J.Jones, he was miscast imho), acting 8/10, suspense 7.5/10, action 7/10 (8.5 for the chase scene! probably one of the best scenes in this flick), overall from me: 7.5/10 (horror genre).Just the Worth watching if you like horror movies or blood ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Burton's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Tim Burton's work. He has made four superlative films to date, 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure', 'Beetlejuice', 'Ed Wood' and 'Mars Attacks!'.'Batman', 'Batman Returns' and 'Edward Scissorhands' are also very good, top drawer productions. So it was with a great deal of anticipation that I watched 'Sleepy Hollow'. The posters for it looked magnificent, all haunted sepia and shadows. Sadly, the cinematography, directed by Emmanuel Lubezki, is theabout the only outstanding aspect of this film...that and the musical score by the ever-wonderful Danny Elfman. Can anyone touch that guy for mastery of thegenre?The adaption of the famous story is excellent but the dialogue is stilted and not very convincingly delivered. And I can't recall from the book, read many years ago now, if Ichabod Crane did so much swooning in the face of gore. Was hereally such a wimp? The cast is good but they are hobbled by theaforementioned weak script, though it gets the story across clearly enough. The f/x are inconsistent, sometimes the decapitations are very bloody and juicysometimes dry and unconvincing.Burton captures the melancholy atmosphere of the village in the woods verynicely, but the jokiness of the murders takes the sting out of the thrill to a great extent.The only doubts about casting are with the two leads, unfortunately. I am agreat admirer of Jonny Depp's, his Ed Wood performance is a classic for alltime, and Edward Scissorhands shows him at his most versatile. He is an actor with a very wide range and it is surprising how ineffectual he is as IchabodCrane. He's not bad but I can imagine someone more simpatico to the original character. Cristina Ricci is better. She possesses a pert insouciance thatbetrays a bit too much attitude for this part but she's convincing as a blonde waif up to a point.Will someone tell me why Miranda Richardson over-acts all the time? She'swonderful to watch but in these camp roles she pulls the stock tricks out of her great big bag of professional gurns and smirks and acts on automatic. I've seen her do this in other things she's done and her auto-pilot acting has little to do with the quality of script. Her best work, oddly, was as Queen Mab in a BBCadaption of the old Merlin legend. She is a wonderful baddy however but herstilted delivery of the lines emphasizes that 'Sleepy Hollow' is the ideal kids' Halloween eve movie and not the spine-chilling thriller I had hoped for,something that I think is entirely within Burton's capabilites but hasn't been demonstrated by that very talented director yet. I'd like to seem him tackle some verit mysteries ala Hitchcock.And the scary bits don't really come off. There is a wonderful scarecrow in a September field of corn at the start of the film before the credits and the bloody tree is excellent, ditto the old crone in the cave in the Western Woods but we see all too little of those tasty aspects of the story. The most interesting and truly frightening (and sympathetic) character is the headless horseman played byChristopher Walken. His montrousness is akin to Danny DeVito's Penguin in'Batman Returns', repulsive, demonic and pathetic all at once, likeFrankenstein's monster. Now THAT's a story I'd love to see Burton film!Christopher Walken could play the doctor and the monster! Lisa Marie could be his "bride". She, by the way, is a fascinating screen persona. Her performance as the Martian Girl in 'Mars Attacks!' was astounding, and not a word spoken, as in this film, playing Ichabod's ill-fated mother.'Sleepy Hollow' is a straight-forward telling of the old tale with no frills attached, beyond the limp romantic interest. As usual with Burton the sets are beautiful but his 2 dimensional approach didn't fulfill my hopes for this film. A comic book rendition that seems a bit tired-out. Time for another direction for Tim Burton, I hope.Close, but no cigar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three mysterious murders in Sleepy Hollow bring Ichabod Crane from New York City to investigate. The victims have lost their heads. Crane is a modern thinker in 1799, believing that sense and reason will solve the mysteries. But, it seems, the townspeople are right to fear the headless horseman as Crane's investigations bring more ire and death.Burton's telling of the famous legend looks impressive. The lighting, make-up, special effects, costumes and sets capture the ominous mood and create a grim, spooky world. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is a stunning achievement.But the movie is let down by unnecessarily eccentric performances and some weak writing.Depp creates a character who comes across as a man of strong principle but he's a coward, screaming at the sight of spiders and rightly being put off by the horrible things he sees in investigating the murders. His character comes off as inconsistent though entertaining.The portrayal of apparent romance between Depp and Ricci is particularly facile; almost childish. The script is to blame for Ricci's bland performance. The writing also falters in having the whole movie explained away: movies are about showing, not telling.Burton once more proves that he's a great stylist. His weakness is in the stories he chooses to tell. His characters and stories are too simplistic to achieve an insight into the human condition. Burton here fails to capture any of the childlike wonder or magical fantasy of Edward Scissorhands or the exploration of failure in Ed Wood. He's produced an interesting piece to look at but its pleasures remain superficial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose any comment from me will be suspect, because I usually like Tim Burton's movies (even Mars Attacks!, 'nuff said!). I went to see this movie because it was by Burton: I like Washington Irving's stories in general, but I always considered Sleepy Hollow as a rather stupid story. Just in case you loved the movie and wish to check out the book, I say, well, don't. If I remember correctly in the story Ichabod Crane is a highly irritating schoolmaster, Katrina is a stolid but good-looking future Hausfrau, and Brom is just like in the movie, only it's he who gets the girl in the end. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (he of Se7en), very intelligently turns the story into a fairy-talish comic-horror whodunit, Ichabod into an all-questioning detective whose superiors can't wait to get rid of, and Katrina into a smart witch apprentice. Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod with comic zest, Christina Ricci proves once again to be a quite talented young lady, and the rest of the cast is also excellent, including a stunning Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman (in an uncredited appearance, I believe), and Christopher Lee and Martin Landau also shine in small parts. The Gothic-Old Flemish atmosphere is superb. This is quite the movie for you if you like your movies to be unusual and unpredictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gothic masterpiece from the brilliant pairing of Burton and Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton in my opinion is one of the greatest directors of all-time. Many people would shoot me (Or decapitate me - excuse the pun) for making such a statement. His films are just so original and unique and Burton seems to have a distinctive talent for creating eerie Gothic and dream-like sets. I'm ashamed to say that I have not yet seen "The Nightmare Before Christmas", often hailed as being his gem of the crown jewels, but I have seen many of his other films, including "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" which I thought was better than the original, and the tragic "Edward Scissorhands" and the flamboyant and bloody musical "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street". But this film here I think is his finest hour: "Sleepy Hollow" starring a fine assembled cast that includes Johnny Depp (Which goes without saying), Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Claire Skinner and Christopher Walken - with the iconic Christopher Lee making a cameo in one scene.1799, and Constable Icabod Crane (Depp) is finding his efforts to rationalise the court system in New York City proving to be in vain. His superiors are getting sick of listening to him and at a court sitting where Crane talks out against them again, they decide to send him and his methods to the small town of Sleepy Hollow for a murder investigation - a three day journey from New York City. They send him off only telling him the basics of what he needs to know - three people have been murdered there in a fortnight, each one with their head cut off. Crane arrives at the grim town and immediately meets the acquaintance of the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of Baltus who is the mayor of Sleepy Hollow. After announcing his arrival, Crane is summoned by Baltus to meet the heads of the town - the Reverand, the Magistrate, the Notary and Baltus himself. It's here that Crane is told about the headless horseman, and how he is back from the grave seeking heads to take back to the fires of hell with him. Crane sees this as utter nonsense, telling the men 'the murderer is of flesh and blood and I will find him'. He's given all the help he requires, and soon Crane realises that everything he believed in, and all the assumptions he had made about Sleepy Hollow, weren't true. And his stay in the town begins to unlock some forgotten memories from a past he thought he had forever lost...Based on a short story by Washington Irving, I can't say if Burton does justice to it or not for I haven't read it. But since it's a short story of something like fifteen pages long, needless to say a lot more would have to be added into the film. The romance between Crane and Katrina is handled very well and Depp and Ricci make it very realistic and believable, and it never takes away from the eerie and oppressive atmosphere. Danny Elfman provides an outstanding score that really makes the film I think, especially when put together with the intoxicating cinematography and the skillful directing of Tim Burton. The acting is brilliant all around - I think Christopher Walken's manic performance as the Hessian Horseman was very memorable, and the script was very well written, throwing in some very witty dialog. As horror goes, it's quite intense at times, and the gore is pretty plentiful and the decapitations are done very well. Overall, it's a different kind of film from Burton, using sets and dark, bleak imagery that he wouldn't use quite as immensely as so again until "Sweeney Todd..." in 2007.While it's a horror movie - with some very heavy elements of fantasy thrown in as well, "Sleepy Hollow" can also be taken as a crime film as well with scenes and elements reminiscent of your average Agatha Christie crime stories - with a Gothic twist. Burton and Depp prove once again to be an excellent director/actor pairing - just like Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. I've seen it a good few times now but it's still as fresh as ever every time I watch it. First time viewing, it's very interesting as the plot and conspiracy begin to unfold as Crane tries to win the heart of Katrina, and also - not to be cheesy - but keep his head on at the same time while he battles the past and the present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere Near As Good As Some Reviewers Would Have You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the fourth collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton I have seen (the previous three being Sweeney Todd, the Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands) and I can say without an instance's doubt that it is easily the worst of the four. In fact, if it were not for Johnny Depp, then I would have stopped watching half an hour in to this poor excuse for a film.Lets me quickly outline the plot. Constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) has been called to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the unusual murders of certain town folk, where they have had their head cut clean from their body. The town widely believe that the murders are being carried out by a headless horseman, but Crane is doubtful and wants to investigate further.Sound good? Trust me, the film's nowhere near that interesting. What I found really hard to get over was - what was this film meant to be exactly? The soundtrack would have you believe it's a scary horror - as would all the blood, headless corpses, skulls, torture weapons, y'know what I'm talking about, anything to build up atmosphere and suspense. But it fails, because this film just isn't scary, it isn't even gory (the blood looks ridiculously fake), in fact, I'd say it was Burton's aim to make us laugh, except there aren't even any jokes in the film. The special effects are just plain weird, and apart from Depp and Miranda Richardson the acting on whole is pretty dire. Christina Ricci may look the part but she cannot act, and the two child actors are just as dire (as is Lisa Marie as Ichabod's mother). It's surprising for a film to have so many badly acted parts, and I can only put this down to the fact that actors were chosen for appearance first, and acting skills second. Well, whatever the reason, one things for sure - whoever was in charge of the auditions seriously messed up.Another problem of mine with 'Sleepy Hollow' is how hard it is to follow what the hell is going on. Ichabod Crane seemed to come to conclusions regarding the investigation as if from nowhere (Oh look, a chemical reaction, the head was cut off in a single blow. This women was pregnant, the murderer must be a mad-man (you don't say!). Oh look, a tree with decapitated heads stored inside - this must be a portal to hell). Whaaaat?! Does Burton really assume that his audience is too thick to realise how ridiculous this logic is? I am really disappointed in this film. It was nothing like what I had expected, and a huge let down compared to the quality of other Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films. Do not be led astray by all these 5 star reviews - watch this film if you really want to, just don't expect the greatest film in the world. Or anything close.</fullReview>

The narrative meanders, the dialogue is tedious and forced, and the whole construction is based around a series of mood shots rather than any actual plot. It's uninvolving, it's formulaic, it's overly smug, it's just plain *dull*.And accents... yes, there are some decent attempts at 20th century psuedo-plummy English, but the thing is, people in England in 1799 were talking like Yosemite Sam.

		<shortDescription>Visual masterwork from Burton...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1999 version of the legend of Sleepy Hollow as told through the visionary director Tim Burton really stands out as being unique in many ways. First of all, and most noticeably, is the visuals and the typical Burton style of images. And that is something that really makes "Sleepy Hollow" an impressive movie to look at. But it is also the very impressive ensemble of casted talents that make the movie come to life so well on the screen.Without going to much into detail about the storyline, as we should all be familiar with the legend of Sleepy Hollow. Then this is the story about Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate some mysterious deaths where the victims are found without their heads.If you are familiar with other works of Tim Burton then you know what kind of setting and level of detail you are getting into here. And everything in "Sleepy Hollow" has exactly that. And personally I do love his unique style.The story was well told by Burton and there was a good pace to the storytelling, and a good continuous flow to the movie. So the 105 minutes that the movie runs for fly by in no time.Now, the impressive thing about "Sleepy Hollow" is the cast. That was just spectacular. Of course you have Johnny Depp in the lead, and here again he shows how great in collaboration with Burton that he is, and his acting was spot on for the role of Ichabod Crane. Normally I am not much of a fan of Christina Ricci, but she did a good job here. Miranda Richardson is as always phenomenal and she was so well-cast for her role. Furthermore, there are impressive talents such as Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and Michael Gough on the cast list. And although he has not a single line in the movie, then Christopher Walken was really great in the role as the Hessian Horseman."Sleepy Hollow" is a very entertaining movie, regardless of you being a Burton fan or not. The story is well told, and what is there not to like about the legendary tale of the headless horseman. And furthermore, it is the type of movie that can be watched again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Science or Superstition?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that Director Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is as atmospheric as movies come, but the feature could have much better. It certainly has nice production design, art direction, and cinematography. Loosely based upon Washington Irving's short story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," the stylish period piece (1799) falters from incoherency and a middling script. Even though Burton draws upon Irving's settings and characters ? like Ichabod Crane, "Brom Bones" Van Brunt, and Katrina Van Tassel ? his screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, does a great disservice to the source material as he turns a folk tale into a horror flick. Also, the movie simply does not know which way to turn. Initially it seems to promote progress by referencing reason and scientific knowledge, but then reverts to witchcraft. The original Irving story's main premise involved Ichabod and Brom fighting for Katrina's attention. Here it is hardly played out. By adding a back-story ? childhood flashbacks of Crane's childhood ? does nothing to enhance the drama. It becomes somewhat gruesome with its pile of decapitated corpses. Even the gnarled tree is blood-soaked, and when Ichabod exhumes a female corpse, the blood is fresh.It begins promisingly. Before the opening credits, a coach carrying the town's leading citizen, lawyer Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau) rolls in the fog-shrouded forest at dusk outside the misty Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, two days north of New York City, where "everyone is related by blood or marriage." Strange noises are heard, and Garret is astounded when he peeks outside the carriage window and sees that his driver has become headless. The carriage still rumbles along. When Garrett attempts to escape into a cornfield, his head is also lost. Other equally grizzly deaths follow, and, in all cases, the killer takes the victim's head. The folks of Sleepy Hollow are convinced that they are being haunted by the Headless Horseman, a demonic spirit of a dead German (Hessian) soldier (a mercenary of the Crown) who was slain by Continental soldiers during the American Revolution. He can see without his head, and has his lair in the gnarled tree in the Western Woods.Jittery Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) arrives; he's a constable sent by a judge in New York City to solve the bizarre murders of the ghastly horseman. Crane is not the superstitious schoolmaster of Irving's story. In fact, Ichabod claims that reason and science can explain any unusual feature about the deaths and that a "modern" detective method will solve the mystery. But he misspeaks when he boldly states that people are at the dawn of a "new millennium" (confusing the year 1800 with 2001). Anyway, he sneers at the idea of a supernatural being from Hell. At first it appears that the horseman may actually be the local bigwig, Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in costume, but Ichabod soon learns that he must abandon reason. Brom does attack Ichabod with a pumpkin at the wooden covered bridge. In the original story though, the prank occurs at the end, when the believer in ghosts is easily fooled. As Ichabod's investigation continues he finds himself falling for blonde Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of his landlord, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon)."Sleepy Hollow" is creepy and effective largely because of Director Burton's visualization, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's camera- work, and Rick Heinrichs' impressive production design. However, there comes a point when the main characters have to take the helm, something not allowed by the script (although the main actors do as well as granted). Much of "Sleepy Hollow" consists of the insipid Ichabod, with his bizarre instruments, constantly fainting and bungling to uncover the reason for the horseman's rampage. Then towards the end he finally has much of the puzzle pieced together. (The subplot about who double-crossed whom is convoluted.) Finally in the denouement ? which goes on and on ? Ichabod's skittish character magically morphs into the most heroic man on earth when he battles a demon! Irving focused on the romance angle, but the screen relationship of Ichabod with Katrina appears forced, and there is hackneyed dialogue between them. For instance, he says that she "bewitched" him (Actually she believes in sorcery.). Another time Ichabod inquires why she snooped inside his room. Katrina responds, "Because it's yours." (Ugh!) Positives include an impressive supporting cast. In addition to Baltus' Michael Gambon, several other well-known actors include Miranda Richardson (as Baltus' wife and the Crone), Michael Gough (notary), Ian McDiarmid (doctor), and Christopher Lee (cameo). Lee is the New York burgomaster who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow. Christopher Walken has a cameo as the horseman before losing and regaining his head. Danny Elfman's music score is most suitable while the set direction is superb. Much of the movie was shot with a blue filter, and the Gothic village of Sleepy Hollow has the feel of the period (as does the city of New York). There is a nice, almost surreal touch when Ichabod arrives late. The hamlet appears almost deserted, with hardly a person or horse visible. But when Ichabod enters the mansion of prosperous farmer Van Tassel, a bustling Halloween party is in progress with perhaps most of the village in attendance. Another nice scene occurs just after the Halloween party (presumably 31 October) when the November mist extinguishes the exterior village torches. Its nicely signifies the end of the last bit of warmth and the dreariness of the incoming coldness.The negatives are probably not enough to detract one from watching "Sleepy Hollow," but the movie should have been greater. Naming this movie something like "The Horror of Goblin Hollow" would have avoided the unfortunate comparison with Irving. But the director obviously wanted to capitalize on the famed author's story. A plot focusing on reason and with a conspiracy involving those awful-looking town honchos with a costumed headless horseman may have been a better option. Then again, one cannot deny the uniqueness of the story-line.</fullReview>

Film looks astonishingly, with all Gothic touches, it is definitely of the best and stylish looking movies of all time. The story is very good and intriguing, it plays like good old fashioned mystery with horror elements. Although i don't find this movie particularly scary, it has some spooky moments.Overall, "Sleepy Hollow" is now a some sort of classic. It still looks incredibly amazing, and maybe pacing of this movie suffers a bit there and there, but this movie overall is a lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great elaborated look at the Sleepy Hollow legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow takes a more detailed and closer look in this Tim Burton horror flick, where Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to help solve the murders that were allegedly committed by the mysterious headless horseman. What results are an unleashing of dark secrets one after the other, and soon, it may be that the sleepy town may not be as innocent as it seems.It's a dark and eerie film with a suspenseful plot from start to finish, from the gruesome be-headings to Ichabod Crane attempting to solve the mysterious of the cursed town. The ghost intrigue builds as secrets are revealed and unpredictable moments mount, making this an entertaining and enjoyable movie throughout.The appearances of the Headless Horseman is a fantastic effect, as is the cinematography effects Sleepy Hollow, detailing the town's gloominess, dark atmosphere and turn-of-the-century look. The costumes and set designs were great; it mirrors the classic look of the 19th century.The acting was great for the most part, thought I thought some humor were forced into the story, particularly that of Johnny Depp's skirmish expressions. But, the casting director did a great job assembling such an extraordinary cast of, in addition to Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Casper Van Dien.Overall, great movie about the creepy legend - one that you can say answers all the mysteries surrounding the story.Grade A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Impressive Collaboration Between Tim Burton &amp; Johnny Depp!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marking the third collaboration between a filmmaker who's always been fascinated by dark, Gothic tales &amp; an actor who has a penchant for playing eccentric characters, Sleepy Hollow is a terrific blend of horror &amp; comedy that plays to the strength of both Tim Burton &amp; Johnny Depp and is further improved by its stunning visual design, clever casting &amp; eerie ambiance.Set at the turn of the 19th century, Sleepy Hollow tells the story of a police constable who favours forensic techniques over traditional methods when it comes to solving a case and accepts the alternative to imprisonment which requires him to travel to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a series of murders, believed to be carried out by the mythic Headless Horseman.Directed by Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow packs in one of those stories that this director likes to translate on the silver screen and he does a really good job here. Its aptly twisted story exhibits the look n feel of a dark &amp; disturbing horror but in actuality is far more light-hearted than expected. The technical aspects are expertly executed for the most part, with its visual design being an impressive highlight.Production design team does a stellar job with the set pieces and even the timeline this film is set in is nicely recreated on the film canvas. Cinematography is truly bewitching and the use of smokes, minimal lights &amp; monochromatic colour tones provide a highly Gothic feel to the whole picture. Editing could've been better for there were a few segments it could have done without while Danny Elfman's score brings an energy of its own.Coming to the acting department, Sleepy Hollow features a splendid cast in Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson &amp; others with Depp impressing the most. Getting under the skin of his character from the get go, he is very much in command here and his magnetic screen presence further helps his role while Ricci &amp; others provide good supporting performances in their given roles.On an overall scale, Sleepy Hollow is an incessantly Gothic chiller that's brilliantly directed, finely written, gorgeously photographed, faithfully scored &amp; nicely performed and presents both Burton &amp; Depp in superb form. The scare factor is very much diminished by its quirky humour &amp; comical effects but the ghostly atmosphere nonetheless plays an important role in sustaining its ominous vibe throughout its runtime. Delightfully recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Guilty Pleasure Halloween Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have now come to October, my favorite month of the year, which means I'll be reviewing horror films all throughout the month. Lets start it off with an adaptation of a classic story directed by Tim Burton, that adaptation being "Sleepy Hollow."Probably the best thing about this movie is it's visual style. It has a great Gothic, moody environment, a very classic horror feel to it all. It is the usual Tim Burton style. You can see it in the cinematography, the production design, in almost every frame you have these great visuals. Its to bad the rest of the movie wasn't as great.Its not that the rest of the movie was bad, it just it was just?OK. The acting is fine and sometimes entertaining (Christopher Walken much?), but it isn't anything all that notable. The music did serve the style of the film well, but it wasn't anything memorable. The story was somewhat unique (probably because it was written by the guy who wrote "Se7en") but not as strange or out there as some of Tim Burton's other movies. There were also some uses of CGI in the movie that were pretty bad, and I know that the film also has a bit of a cartoonish tone in some scenes, but even then the effects were still surprisingly bad.Even though I have been criticizing this movie for not being very unique, besides the visual aspect, I still find it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it for next Halloween. Its kind of a guilty pleasure movie, its technically kinda sloppy but still enjoyable. I'd compare it to my reaction to Jurassic World,I didn't think it was very unique, but it was enjoyable none the less.Final Score: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-31 Days Of Horror: Day 2Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an unapologetically gory spook fest that although has genuinely scary moments, is mostly energized by a vibe of pure rollicking fun. Even the violence is a joy to behold, as countless heads are severed and fly about the landscape all throughout the film. Burton takes a rare dip into R rated waters here, and really goes for it. It's almost a throwback to the Hammer horror films of the past (Christopher Lee even makes a nice little cameo), wearing it's influences proudly on its sleeve and thrumming with a baroque, grand old atmosphere of misty grey and earthy brown, punctuated by frequent and ample gallons of crimson blood. Johnny Depp nervously plays Inspector Ichabod Crane, a twitchy detective sent from New York to rural upstate town of Sleepy Hollow, where someone is murdering people in the night, and taking their heads. There he finds intrigue, romance, unimaginable horror, and a bunch of townspeople who are less than exactly helpful, and have secrets of their own. Legend has it that the killer is a Headless Horseman, which Crane finds to be all too true when he digs deeper. The Horseman is played by, you guessed it, a demonic Christopher Walken (there's really no other choice when you think about it) looking like something that walked out of Where The Wild Things Are. Dumbledo- I mean Michael Gambon plays the mayor, Miranda Richardson is a standout as his conniving wife. There's also fine work from Jeffrey Jones, a ghostly Michael Gough looking like he's got one foot in the grave, Martin Landau, Vernon Dursle- I mean Richard Griffiths, Caspar Van Dien, Lisa Marie and Darth Sideo- I mean Ian Mcdiarmid. Christina Ricci is a vision as Katrina Von Tassel, the mysterious mayors daughter who Crane falls for. The film is one of the most absolutely gorgeous looking pieces of work I've ever seen, every frame a breathtaking storybook frame of wonder, menace and atmospheric Gothic horror. The plot becomes more complicated than initially implied, spinning a wheel of intrigue that gives each character something fun to do. And indeed, amid the bloody chaos and suffering, the film never loses its sense of fun, allowing moments of comedy and ironic edges to the violence. Burton beckons us into the haunted house he's so painstakingly created, and he doesn't let us down. It's my favourite of his films, and one hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very stylish and Gothic retelling of Sleep Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is the perfect material to be adapted by Tim Burton. Burton has a love for all things dark and Gothic and this tale is tailor made for him. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a Tim Burton slasher film as it follows a similar template with a heavy dose of mood and style that remains one of Burton's more underrated features.Good: The overall cast does good work here. No one here is overly cartoonish and fit into their respective roles. Depp is really good as Crane delivering a quirky performance, but retaining a likable hero quality to him as well. Ricci is good as well bringing some sweetness to the movie. The supporting cast made up of a lot of character actors are really good cementing the look and feel of the movie. The Headless Horseman himself is a good villain bringing forth an intimidating demeanor despite his lack of a head. The production design and cinematography are the real winners here as it all looks polished, stylish, and beautiful. The head lopping was fun also.Bad: The movie hits a snag in the middle act when it transitions to the investigation portion of the story. It drags the pace down and it isn't as interesting coupled with a fairly mediocre love story despite liking both Depp and Ricci individually. The subsequent plot developments are telegraphed pretty early on so the end result is not as surprising as it wants to be. The CG also looks a bit dated.Overall, it is a very slick and beautifully made adaptation of the book with good performances and a wonderful recreation of the old Hammer horror films. Despite some pacing issues and a not so strong story, it delivers on the Gothic and the violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sleepy Hollow" is good, creepy fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton put his own spin on the classic short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" with the surprisingly good 1999 adaptation Sleepy Hollow. In the movie adaptation, New York detective Ichabod Crane must travel to the mysterious Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of murders that took place there, but realizes the town's dark history and the legend of a headless horseman might be the true culprit. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a highly stylized slasher flicks. There are lots of gory decapitations set against a fittingly Gothic tone, and although it's never truly heart-poundingly intense, there is a great atmosphere and some creepy imagery. Burton does make this movie a bit darker than his previous films (at the time), but there's still a bit of humor in its heart, mostly because of Johnny Depp's role as the Ichabod. Even though it deviates significantly from its source material, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, atmospheric movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Depp or Burton's Finest, but a Good Ride,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a really talented cast. There is a creepy atmosphere throughout and it is certainly one of Tim Burton's scariest films, they normally contained elements of horror but this film is a straight up horror, and Johnny Depp shines in the lead role as usual, further proving his versatile skills as an actor. I have come to expect a bit more from Burton, this film dosen't contain his usual trademarks and many elements that make his work so unique, it didn't feel like he put his own original spin to this, which is a significant thing for any of his films that isn't based on his own work. The build up in the film is great, it's constantly creepy and discomforting throughout as we know something big is coming, and the ending is certainly not disappointing. It's certainly not Burton or Depp's finest work, but Sleepy Hollow is still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery or horror. After three people are murdered by a mysterious Headless Horseman, a man must investigate these unusual killings. Best Performance: Johnny Depp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1799. NYC police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is bucking the system using modern forensic methods and being berated for it. The Judge sends him off to investigate the beheading murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Wealthy Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk and the widow Emily Winship are all found without their heads. He is boarding with Baltus Van Tassel and falls for his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). The elders recount the tale of a Hessian (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary war and has reborn into the headless horseman.Tim Burton brings a brilliant dark moody foggy atmosphere. I love all the designs and the look. Johnny Depp is also terrific as a science geek. I like that he's a weakling and not necessarily the heroic type. Although he has determination. Depp adds a good deal of fun. The horror element isn't very scary but it is fun. It's definitely a movie more intrigued with the style than being a thrilling horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic Tim Burton film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another fantastic Tim Burton film, though not on the same level as "Ed Wood". Johnny Depp is brilliant as the quirky, eccentric and extremely intelligent Ichabod Crane. I think that he's the best of the sadly very few current Hollywood stars who are worthy of being counted with the greats of yesteryear. Depp leads a very, very talented cast of mostly British actors. I don't really see why Miranda Richardson adopted an American accent when playing both Lady Mary and the old crone though when all of the other established British actors used their natural accents. Conversely, Depp used an English accent while Christina Ricci's had a slightly Mid-Atlantic feel to it. That very minor issue aside, the film is thoroughly entertaining with a wonderfully spooky and often downright scary atmosphere. Gothic horror is the only horror subgenre that I like and this is the most effective example of it that I've seen besides the very best of the Hammer films and the 1931 version of "Frankenstein". Tim Burton and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is a match made in Heaven. Or should I say Hell?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child I remember watching this film, Sleepy Hollow, for the first time. I remember being scared of it, but still, wanted to keep on watching it. The film sees Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a police officer who's from New York City travel to the creepy, dark place that is Sleepy Hollow, New York - ultimately, several slays and killings have been happening, and as a result, Ichabod goes to investigate. The victims have been decapitated by an (un)dead horse-riding, revolutionary-war mercenary who kills people by chopping off their heads.Full of blood, chills, gothicness, and fantastic dialogue, Sleepy Hollow is one of the greatest films of the 90s, and it's one of Tim Burton's greatest films overall. It has been a favourite of mines for years and it remains one of my favourite films until this day. It's fantastic. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent enough evening flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>et us get this over with right away. I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton's work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.Unfortunately Ichabod's inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie managed to get ahead of the line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main reason I wanted to watch this movie isn't really because of Tim Burton's directing or the production design style that makes it into every one of his movies, but to be fair that alone is worth a glance. It's mainly because I have had no idea about the original story and I was curious along with Christina Ricci being one of my favourite actresses.Okay so the story, Constable Ichabood Crane is sent to investigate murders occurring in a small town called Sleepy Hollow. Because he tries to base things more on science than anything else when he hears from villagers that the culprit is an undead warrior who was decapitated - This doesn't really go over well. When he sees The Headless Horseman kill someone, he decides to believe a little bit of what they say. So he decides to venture off into the woods where The Horseman strikes and where he was buried, but only two people are brave enough to go with him. He then uncovers the fact that the Horseman does not kill at random so he must find out what the connection is between the victims.Okay onto what I didn't like. I guess the final twist of who's controlling the horseman and their back-story was a let-down. I mean this is one of the few stories that really did keep me guessing what was going to happen next and the conclusion was one of those where I was really let down by it.With that said the acting is good and as I said it is one of those movies where I had no idea what was going to happen next. It doesn't necessarily follow a formula (or if it does I haven't seen many movies that follow it). The Horseman is actually a villain that is kind of intimidating. I say kind of because you cannot get me to stop laughing at Christopher Walken with fangs for every tooth and pale white eyes that doesn't do anything but scream.If you're a sucker for Tim Burton's production design then this is a must-see. I would also say this would be worth a glance if you like watching something that does keep you guessing, however with that said the biggest complaint is the payoff to it. This is a decent watch - If you haven't seen it yet - I suggest you check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Spooky Flick for the Fall Season!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I respect Tim Burton as a great filmmaker, I'm generally not a fan of his films; they usually strike me as eminent examples of style over substance (which, in a sense, isn't his fault since he's not usually the writer). Plus the films he usually picks to direct simply aren't my cup of java (for instance, I have no plans to catch "Edward Scissorhands" anytime soon). But who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure.As for "Sleepy Hollow," this is Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, sent to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated. As usual, Depp is outstanding. He portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.Other than Depp, four things really impress me about this picture: (1.) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2.) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but "Sleepy Hollow" depicts him (it?) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3.) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4.) "Sleepy Hollow" lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror. Speaking of which, "Sleepy Hollow" strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Maybe that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer -- and who doesn't? -- you'll appreciate "Sleepy Hollow."The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention. Not that you HAVE to because "Sleepy Hollow" is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that "Sleepy Hollow" is definitely the ideal creep flick for the autumn, or any time really.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in England and New York.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton Gets Heads Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like it says on the DVD sleeve, "Master storyteller Tim Burton weaves an eerie, enchanting version of this classic tale of horror. Jonny Depp is 'Ichabod Crane', an eccentric investigator determined to stop the murderous 'Headless Horseman'. Christina Ricci is 'Katrina Van Tassel', the beautiful and mysterious girl with secret ties to the supernatural terror." Director Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" gallops very far away from the classic short story read in high school (at least the one I attended); though, the plot enhancements make it a better feature-length film. This version of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" should be taken as a completely different story. Herein, Mr. Depp plays Washington Irving's ugly Connecticut schoolmaster as an attractive, faint-hearted New York constable. He is sent to solve a series of mysterious decapitation murders in small-town "Sleepy Hollow". Squeamish and scientific, Depp is convinced the supernatural forces are not a factor in the crimes, but events continuously challenge his scientific belief system. Interestingly, Depp is given an appealing sidekick, Marc Pickering as "Young Masbeth". The film has the sense of humor welcome in horror, but often goes overbroad with one-liners and blood-splattering "camp". Yet, the fantastical "Sleepy Hollow" world created by Burton, Emmanuel Lubezki, Rick Heinrichs, Peter Young, and the production crew can't be overlooked. Martin Landau, Christopher Lee, and Christopher Walken have small, but stellar roles.******** Sleepy Hollow (11/17/99) Tim Burton ~ Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Marc Pickering, Miranda Richardson</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Originally written 22 November 1999; account moved.I am not a fan or "horror" movies and seeing this movie was a relief to me because it isn't one. It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me. This is done as a brilliant film noir-esque piece.Even the gore was in context.This is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been the resurrection of Hammer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a masterpiece witch brings back memories to the better Hammer flicks because Sleepy hollow has the same style of directing, settings, tongue in the cheek humour and charismatic cast. For many years there have been rumours of a possible return of the legendary Hammer studios. I think that Sleepy Hollow should have been the ideal movie for their resurrection! 9 out of 10 because Mr. Lee deserved a bigger peace of the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word for this Tim Burton movie: WOW! The movie was awesome in all aspects. The cast was great, especially Johnny Depp by bringing humor and those spectacular disgusted faces to the film. Burton has outdone himself with the thrills and chills but also the dry humor. The music by Elfman always sets the mood perfectly. I read the story by Washington Irving, and all I can say is, do NOT expect it to be like the story. Burton has given it a dark and harrowing twist that greatly satisfies. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and see it. I almost missed out on the movie that was to become my all time favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is another score for Tim Burton. The eerie, surreal style of uniquely Burton. The film has a good storybook quality to it. Nobody should take the film too seriously, as it isn't meant to be a realistic period piece. As Burton mentions in the commentary, "I never thought one day I'd be directing a movie where people would be dressed up like George Washington." The blood looks like red paint and the sets are obviously stylized. Simply look at it as a dark fantasy, and you should have a good time. The performances are great all-around. Johnny Depp never disappoints, as he brings much dimension to the character of Ichabod Crane. The film has a good sense of humor, and Depp uses the humor to his advantage. Character roles like this are tailor-made for Depp. The creepy Danny Elfman score nicely sets the tone. And I enjoyed the final plot twist.My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Constable Ichabod Crane, a bit of a bug-phobe but a brilliant deducer, is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to assist in the investigation of a rash of murders that turn out to be motivated by a secret conspiracy. Everyone in the town is in fear of their lives from the grim reaper on horseback, otherwise known as the Headless Horseman. He lost his head in the western woods because one little girl couldn't keep a tree quiet (that scene is a must-see!). Crane sets himself to figuring who is controlling this demonic killer... though he may lose his own head in the process.Great classic style horror opus, the first real outing in this genre for Burton. Handled with great flair by someone with obvious affection for the Hammer horror films of yesterday. Depp gives another all-out performance different from his other roles in Ed Wood or Edward Scissorhands, with great manic comic moments that remind me of Carol Burnett. Christina Ricci on the other hand is a little stiff. But, the real showstopper here is Miranda Richardson. You'll see what I mean if you watch Sleepy Hollow. The modern special effects strangely blend in nicely with the photography. A lot of terrific horror scenes here are sure to become classics. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heads will roll. So, close your eyes. Say your prayers. Sleep if you can..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow comes to us from one Hollywood's more gothic and darker directors, that being Tim Burton. Famous for movies such as Beetlejuice, Batman and Edward Scissorhands, Burton brings an 18th century story to the screen as only he can. It also has much more, with great special effects and a subtly humorous script. Then to round this movie off, it has one of Hollywood's more hunkier guys in the lead role, who I am sure the girls cannot resist, that being Johnny Depp. It is the year 1799 and in the isolated hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, murder most foul has occurred. Three corpses have been found, each killed instantly, all decapitated. Visiting constable, Ichabod Crane, suspects one of the villagers is responsible, but the locals believe the killer is not one of their own and most definitely not of this world.There is a lot to like about this movie. The look of it is truly amazing, as nothing was left to the imagination in creating the town of ?Sleepy Hollow'. The people who were given the task of recreating the life and times of such a place did a remarkable job in making ?Sleepy Hollow' seem incredibly creepy. Another highlight was the use of special effects to enhance the story all the more. The character of the ?headless horseman' and other little bits and pieces, make ?Sleepy Hollow' an even greater visual experience.With all that being said, Tim Burton put his delicate touches to the film and made it very well. Being ?hands on' and very relaxed off-screen, Burton would have been great to work for on this film. It is also very obvious that Burton was apart of the film, as the dark, gothic look of the film has to be his idea. In this instance it helps make the film even greater.The screenplay for the story is quite incredible. Not only is game enough to show a very gory type of villain, it has a hero that is quite eccentric, with all his gadgets, gismos and personality. Then to round it off we have some character that I would call ?different', but in a very good way. I also like the ?tongue in check' humour that was placed within the story and the action sequences which give the movie its variety. The ?Sleepy Hollow' screenplay was very well written by Kevin Yagher.Johnny Depp is the remarkable 1800's character of Ichabod Crane in the movie. Depp recreated the feel of the ?horror film acting' just nicely. I had to agree with his description of his character from a featurette on the film though. He said that his character on the ?outside' seemed very masculine and strong, yet on the inside he was like a ?pubescent girl'. We get to see him many times act like a girl would, fainting, and covering up in a bed, being really scared. I also like how this character makes himself look like such a fool at many intervals, which he does only because he wants to get the job he is working on done. Under Depp is a fine amount of talented actors. These include Katrina (Christina Ricci) who was a fine looking woman in the film. The evil Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) is one character that I was not expecting to be who she was. You have also got to be impressed with how dastardly a character that ?Hessian Horseman' (Christopher Walken) was. It is ironic that Walken plays a character in this movie, considering that his character in the 1983 movie, ?The Dead Zone', refers to the Sleepy Hollow story. He looked so evil when had his head attached to his body, a true credit to the make-up department. There are many other fine actors in supporting roles in the film that I really liked, but unfortunately cannot talk about.There many parts to this movie that I liked. All the scenes which involve the ?de-heading' of many of Sleepy Hollow's town-folk are gory kind of events, but done in such a way that you just have to like. (The effort behind-the-scenes to make this part of the film is truly amazing!) To start the movie the way Burton did was a nice touch. Yet seeing the Headless Horseman go around on his horse was another part of the film that I find incredibly refreshing, as he is different to what we would normally see in the movies. The Horseman's resting place is another creation I find so original, and makes the movie even more surreal and horrific. Then top the movie off, you have the exciting action sequences which left me breathless. The musical side of Sleepy Hollow was also a highlight and had Tim Burton being reunited with composer Danny Elfman from Batman. He did a fine job in bringing out the movies more thrilling moments, with his orchestral cast which he assembled just wonderful. Sleep hollow has a lot to offer to its viewing audience, as it has something for every kind of taste. Themes such as action, horror, humour (comedy), thriller and drama are all within this movie and are used to great affect. One quote I can remember hearing about the film I feel suits it, that being: `it's really brutal, really physical, a really intense movie.' As you will see I was close to giving this movie 5 on my movie rating system (the CMRS), but there is only one downfall to it, and that is the disturbing references to the supernatural and witchcraft. I found them a bit hard to take, but I guess having a ?headless horseman' in one of the lead roles, it was inevitable that those themes would be in the movie. Nevertheless, I still find myself in true admiration for a movie that was game enough to do many things, that even I had thought were not possible. CMRS gives ?Sleepy Hollow': 4.5 (Very Good ? Brilliant Film) </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and imaginative tale caught in genre trouble.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another addition to Tim Burton's series of dim-lit but very entertaining movies, `Sleepy Hollow' isn't a disappointment. The subject is a headless horseman in turn-of-the-century era New York outskirts. Burton's style is perceptible in the gloomy yet deeply moody atmosphere. But the film isn't perfect. The main problem is the lack of audience that this would appeal to. While it is a bloody horror, this seems as though it would appeal to the young male audience. But with the `Dangerous Liaison'-esque atmosphere and periodic settings, this seems like one for the cinematic elite.The film isn't a misfire and there are plenty of good things that stand. The costume designs and set pieces are very impressive and the visual effects are magnificent. But there are other things that decrease the positives. The dialogue is wooden and occasionally unconvincing. It works best as a horror and attempts at humour are laughably bad. But with a cast like this, you feel compelled to their every move, with Johnny Depp as the `Knight in shining armour'. Let's face it, he isn't suited to brawny action. In fact he must be the most effeminate superhero in the world. Unfortunately, he doesn't keep in with the audience and just doesn't cut it as the lead star. Luckily he is supported by a huge supporting cast, including Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Casper Van Dien, Martin Landau, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmuid, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken as the horseman himself. This endless amount of star-power well supports Johnny Depp in the lead and make the film all the more watchable.With so many positives, the negatives are almost completely erased. Yes the dialogue may be shamefully clunky, but Tim Burton could do much worse than this. So overall, `Sleepy Hollow' is a minor success. 6.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost as funny as The Mikado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers hereinTaking Johnny Depp (together with the audience) into Sleepy Hollow, the mysterious village haunted by three murders by decapitation, Tim Burton retained his favorite gothic atmosphere in Batman. Then, as we follow the horse-drawn carriage into the desolate landscape, we also get the feeling that we are going into Baskerville for a lethal encounter with the hell-hound. Finally, we notice that Depp's final destination, the house perched on a low mound, looks uncannily like Norman Bates' house in Psycho. All such collective memories seem to point to a gothic horror.Actually, right from the very beginning, Burton has served notice that he is going to play tricks with us. In other words, things are not as we see. Recall the very first shot of two drops of red liquid which, while obviously suggesting blood, are in fact sealing wax for a will. Then, Burton has us believed for a minute that the entire affair is about Depp using scientific equipments to dispel the myth of a supernatural being the agent of the murder. No so. These scientific equipments and methods are soon discarded, and we learn that there is indeed a supernatural force. Depp's first sight of the headless horsement, however, again turn out to be another trick, a prank by his rival. Finally, the evil eye drawn by the girl, contrary to what has been suggested, is not for cursing him but rather to protect him. Throughout the film, Burton is playing David Copperfield, feeding (and hugely entertaining, I must admit) the audience with optical illusions.Despite the packaging, Sleepy Hollow is not a horror movie. Decapitation is the least horrible among numerous choices of gory scene, on which pardon me for not elaborating. Repeated, and repeated, and repeated decapitation very soon becomes a bore. The excessive use of blood becomes a bit of a nuisance, but is far from being scary. As the movie rolls on, I become less and less frightened and more and more amused.Sleepy Hollow is a funny movie, with a good plot, a good story and good acting. It is not even black humour, such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, in which you see a dead body oven-roasted and served as main course. That is black humour. Sleepy Hollow is just plain good old comedy, and the comic element of Depp dominates the film, in his repeated fainting, among other things. The fun gets more hilarious as the mad chase by the headless horseman becomes a reminder of similar scenes in The Three Stoogers. At the climax of the chase, in the height of the excitment when the intended victims escape into the windmill, we get the ultimate funny line "watch your head". This sort of throwing in a comic quip at the tensest moment is a favorite of great masters like Hitchcock and Kurosawa.The only other piece of performing art I can think of that uses decapitation as extensively is Gilbert and Sullivan's celebrated comedy The Mikado. Sleepy Hollow is almost as funny, and I mean this as a compliment. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a big Tim Burton fan. For the most part, other than this movie Batman is like the only other one he has done that I really like. This one though he did great. His like for darker things helps this movie be as good as it is. This time Crane is a detective who goes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders. The atmosphere and Burton's use of colors really enhance this movie. I also like the change in the story, as a detective is just more interesting than a schoolteacher. Johnny Depp is great as Crane and the rest of the cast is good as well. There is even brief appearance by Christopher Walken and horror legend Christopher Lee. I wish Lee had a bigger role in this one. The story is really good in this one, though near the end it is almost more of an action than a horror. Still a good movie though. I love what happens to the woman in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, there was nothing else on offer .........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could never be a Tim Burton fan, and even less still one of Johnny Depp's. However, on seeing that this film is based on a story by Washington Irving, I thought I would give it a try ??. With the result of a few mixed feelings. My attitude towards both Burton and Depp have not changed in the slightest.Irving gave rather good accounts of stories based on the mythical and fantasy-surrealist, generally in a historic context, that is to say, in a specific place at a specific moment. His tales have become minor classics in a way. I would thoroughly recommend `Tales from The Alhambra' for example.What the film has in its favour is good photography, mostly good musical accompaniment which at times became somewhat overly present, better than good scene-setting and directing, and Christina Ricci; as well as some of the other actors playing very interesting rles. The story is right: the treatment was a little wrong. This is basically because on a number of occasions the scenes being enacted take on a certain comic perspective, which, following Irving's story, should never have become apparent. Maybe another actor instead of Depp. No; that would not have saved the situation: Burton could not repress these comic failures, which lent nothing to the telling of the story.Anyway, it was not a worthless watch: I enjoyed some of it, even most of it. But I wish people would be more faithful to the original story when adapting one for the screen. For example, do not worry about trying to see `The Ninth Gate' starring Johnny Depp, adapted by Polanski from the novel `La Novena Puerta' by Arturo Prez-Reverte (qv): absolutely a sacrilegious outrage which the original book does not deserve at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful cinematography but ludicrous acting and storyline</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge admirer of the calibre of the performances of Mr Johnny Depp, but was so badly let down by this poorly acted, ridiculous story that had all the workings of a cheap "Tales from the Dark Side" half-hour schedule-filler (and could certainly have been edited down to such a length), plus all the schlock naffness of a ghost-trainride in a backwater village in Sussex. The over-all hammy acting from most of the cast, coupled with a story too stupid to entertain an over-imaginative child, meant that yet again I had wasted 105 minutes of my precious life in front of the TV screen.The cinematography was good, yes, but so it should be for $65m. This was a classic case of style over content, fuelled by special effects that would delight no one bar the nerd and the simpleminded.As far as the story is concerned, if it deserves so flattering a description as the word "story", Depp plays Ichabod Crane in the role of the sceptical investigator from New York, sent to Sleepy Hollow to unravel the murder by decapitation of three of the multiply-inbred residents. The locals talk of a headless horseman who has committed the murders but Depp, who prefers to analyse fact from a scientific point of view and refuses to believe in the supernatural, thinks the locals are talking crap. Hmmm, where have we seen this before? Special Agent Dana Scully, sorry, Ichabod Crane, attempts to work out a logical explanation until he too sees the horseman. To say any more about the storyline, if you could call it that, would be to spoil any enjoyment that a reader of these comments may one day sustain, as there really isn't an awful lot more than this. Christina Ricci plays the love interest, and enough said about that the better. The year is 1799 and, as Crane remarks at the beginning of the movie, "The millennium is almost upon us". Whether he meant to say that the century is almost upon them, whether he was being very forward-thinking, whether late 18th century New York was already gripped by Millennium Fever, or whether in fact the script-writer was, I will leave that up to you. But it set the scene for a film that had clearly spent most of the budget on special effects (or rather, on the same special effect repeated throughout, namely the removal of heads) without paying too much attention to the dialogue or to how it was delivered.The worst thing about this movie was that it has made me approach Depp's future films with caution, a feeling I would never have associated before within myself when preparing to watch one of his films. That this superb actor, whose great performances include Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, The Brave and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, could not shine from amongst acting as wooden as the trees in the forests around Sleepy Hollow, must say something more about the directing than the acting, as most of the remainder of the cast (Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson et al) are experienced actors and yet their performance is equally risible. However, director Tim Burton's other films are normally quite good.Something went wrong. Somewhere. Sleepy Hollow, a film I'd rather forget quite quickly. If you like Johnny Depp, avoid this mindless inanity.TRISTN HARVEY E. WHITEI rate this film -3 (on the -4 to +4 scale)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Failures At Chaos Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is plagued by a miserable litany of errors an inconsistencies from beginning to end. You need go no further than the ridiculous 11 minute introduction (10 % of total running time) to realize that the rest of the film cannot possibly catch up, wrap up, or clean up neatly and smoothly in the remaining time. To put it in another light what kind of book requires an introduction of this length (10 pages per 100)? Equivalent to a 120 page introduction for Tolstoy's War And Peace.Well in fact the introduction is so badly mangled that there is nothing to catch up to. It is a truly bizarre experience. Important details virtually flash past your eyes and great amounts of film are given to completely pointless scenes. The items displayed in the first three minutes of the introduction are supposed to be clues to unraveling the mystery that lies ahead. But they flash by you so fast that you can't really tell what they are let alone try and decipher what significance they could hold. Then if that isn't confusing enough we suddenly go for a carriage ride which terminates when the man inside - in his 60's or 70's - leaps from the moving carriage and runs at a sprint to his death by decapitation at the foot of a scarecrow with the head of a pumpkin (they must change the various pumpkins in Sleepy Hollow every two or three days that they look so fresh and new - or they are made of some genetically altered strain of non-rotting pumpkin). This victim is a marvel of endurance and athletic prowess and his wig must be glued to his head, because just before he is relieved of his noggin we see that he is barely winded and his clothes unruffled. Note that blood gets spattered on this very fresh pumpkin; it apparently spurts from a wound that is supposedly cauterized at the instant of incision because the blade belongs to a devilishly hot sword from hell as we are told later in the film (During the course of the film the cauterized wounds spurt in some scenes but don't spurt in others as we lurch through this chaotic mess). At this point (a mere six minutes into the introduction) the filmmakers promptly loose track of the number of accumulating bodies and the fact the carriage driver is the first to loose his head and without just cause thus blowing a perfectly good theory right out of the water.It gets weirder, we are then bounced into New York City where we are introduced to the main character of the film Constable Ichabod Crane played Johnny Depp (yes the credits are still rolling by). We spend a couple of minutes in the penal system (I think to validate the need for scientific additions to investigative technique - like it needs validating) where Crane is given the goods on Sleepy Hollow and ordered by the magistrate to investigate. We now enter the moody atmosphere generating part of the film err sorry - We now enter the moody atmosphere generating part of the "credits". This film spends more time inside carriages than ? never mind. The ride from New York to Sleepy Hollow and the walk into town to the inn takes about 5 to 6 minutes. Admittedly the panoramas on the journey are beautifully rendered and quite effective in creating a wonderfully somber and forbidding mood. They are a pleasure to watch as they pass by us mile after pointless mile. Pointless you may ask? Well we keep getting shoved back into the carriage, and while it is misty and moody outside it is bright enough to read a book and handle and examine medical instruments inside - never mind that in my dad's 1961 Plymouth it was hard enough to read from the jiggling around during the ride on paved roads but in a carriage on dirt roads (??). Well after we have finished the carriage ride our protagonist still has to walk into town (there is apparently a village ordinance against carriages carrying police constables within village limits). Ummm Mr. Burton sir? With all due respect, would it not have been a little "spookier" if the windows closed by themselves? You know? In the background so Crane wasn't even aware that they were closing but the audience was? Just a thought.Anyway Crane completes this epic introduction with his arrival at the inn. He opens the door and - it is very bright inside the inn (probably from all of those quartz and halogen candles) and there is a hell of a party in progress that our hapless hero has to navigate through to try and get the story started. Kiss your moody atmosphere goodbye.It gets no better at any time within the next 20 minutes of the film. No one in town (nor in the film crew for that matter) wants to go out side too much because of that headless dude that is riding around out there, so we spend lots of lovely, safe, leisurely minutes in rooms watching people talk to each other. Okay I'm exaggerating a we bit but not as much as you might think.At about the 30 minute mark of the film one or more of the 8 producers of the film "must have" walked out onto the set and started throwing pumpkins at the director, because the film suddenly gets slapstick, and everyone camps it up complete with nods, knowing looks, and smart ass remarks tossed about like disenfranchised heads. From there on in the film is fun and goofy and senseless, and you basically have a good time watching things happen that still don't make any sense, but you are so grateful that the film has actually come alive that you just don't care what is going on any more, and it is quite safe to sit and watch the truly beautifully rendered visuals of rich colour and scads of detail. Not unlike what you would find in a fish tank full of exotic tropical fish. I mean a really really big fish tank! Like the one they blow up in Mission Impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy, and hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is a pretty accurate moniker for this version of Washington Irving's classic tale--it can make you sleepy, and it is hollow.Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane is way out of his depth here; whether by sheer inexperience, bad direction or bad writing, it is hard to tell. Likely one of the last two, as the accomplished actress Christina Ricci scarcely comes off any better and it is such a shame. There is too much melodrama, too much glowering and too much over-acting, all of which crushes any attempt at subtlety, if any was intended. Some of it is plain ridiculous, and none of it scary for anyone over age ten or with an I.Q. over 70. (Its good points: lavish scenery, and an impressive but-all-too-brief appearance by a very evil-looking Christopher Walken as the head-hungry Hessian Horseman.)And that's just the first hour. I simply could not bother to watch the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why wasn't this scary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton should have watched Halloween and Jaws 50 times each before attempting to make this "horror" movie. He has made more mediocre movies with strong visual style, than great films. "Ed Wood" was his simplest visually and best overall film. He's been on a slump since then, with the awful "Mars Attacks" and the mediocre-but-could-have-been-great "Sleepy Hollow". Too bad really.He fell into the CGI trap. "Look what we can do! IT really looks someone's head is being lopped off! And the setting is so-o-o misty and moody! And look at the costumes and set design - it's a visual feast!" great. But it's not scary. Not at all.This movie really fell apart for me near the end, when it launched into the horribly cliched dastardly-villain-explains-the-plot bit (and I would have gotten away with it to if it weren't for you meddling kids). Good films don't resort to this hackneyed device.</fullReview>

At that point her favorite movie was "The Parent Trap". I stand corrected. After this intense, heavily gory thriller I asked her what she thought. "I loved it. That's my new favorite movie" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. She actually enjoyed it. Then I figured that it might be my dad who enjoyed it. He loved it, too.Ditto for my mom. Yeh, I know what you're thinking, you're probably guessing that I didn't enjoy it. Well ,I did. How couldn't I. A horror-thriller from the director of "Batman"(one of my all-time favorites), this move succeeded in everything it attempted. All in all, a great film, MUST-SEE!!!

		<fullReview>There really has not been a film like this in quite a while. Its definitely a Tim Burton film, it has that darkness and obscurity that typifies most of his films, but it also manages to tie in a love story with old fashioned good vs Evil. Its just fantastic. The photography and set design is just amazing, its visual stunning to the eye and also ties in so well to the story. There is quite a bit of gore, fairly similar to the type of gore in films such as reanimator, Evil Dead etc- its a real horror, but a horror/comedy/romance all rolled in to one. The story in its entirity works really well, it takes a while for the whole plot to unravel, but it keeps all of us guessing. Johnny Depp is in fine form as is Christina Ricci. Its thoroughly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone who likes things that are a bit darker than your average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Burton Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have long been a fan of Tim Burton films, being as big a fan of Mars Attacks! as should probably be allowed, but for some reason I wasn't that keen about seeing Sleepy Hollow.It was tremendous. The film had all the Burton tongue-in-cheek charm (the contraptions that Ichabod (Johnny Depp) uses are a personal favourite), but the most outstanding feature was the appearance of the film. The eponymous American village was delightful, and the special effects were never otiose, just perfect for describing the scenes. Christina Ricci was truly beautiful throughout the film, keeping an air of mystery about her character that so many other actresses would have failed to pull off. Johnny Depp also impressed me ? his British character seemed so quaintly over the top in parts, without ever becoming annoying or clichd. A healthy British cast ? Miranda Richardson being particularly strong, backs up this duet.Many have described SH as a modern fairy story, or something of the like, and in some ways that is what Burton does best ? the modern creation of fantasy, but to call them fairy stories seems to play down the films as childish. While there is no deeper meaning to Sleepy Hollow, it is a film that no one should feel is below him or her. More Burton, more!</fullReview>

Johnny Depp's scientific methods strikingly contrasts the film's predominant supernatural theme. "Sleepy Hollow" is an engaging film that kept me wanting to find out what happens next.

		<fullReview>Warning: POSSIBLE spoilers.What more could you want out of a horror movie? This has it all, a dark and convincing storyline, interesting characters, appropriate settings and cinematography, well done graphics and stunts and a talented cast of veteran actors. I'm a fan of Tim Burton's movies in general (with exception of Planet of the Apes.) He's a dark and gifted director, and has a talent for turning almost everything he touches into dark gold.So what if Ichabod Crane (played perfectly by Depp) is a police investigator instead of a school teacher? It works doesn't it? I give props to Burton also for casting Christopher Lee, and Michael Gough in this movie, however small the role. The cast is perfect for their respective characters. The only one I wasn't COMPLETELY sold on was Christina Ricci. I like Ricci, but still question whether this was her role. But none the less, her performance was acceptable. The real scene stealer here is the Headless Horseman, played appropriately and surprisingly (didn't know he was in it prior to viewing) Christopher Walken, he steals every scene he's in. Ray Park did a fabulous job as the "headless" version of the Horseman. I won't get too much into the story, you probably know it, if not there's several hundred reviews regarding it. The cinematography is beautiful, dark, spooky and appropriate. (There is a real Sleepy Hollow, it's a few hours from where I live). Danny Elfman's score only adds an extra layer of darkness. One of the things I was impressed about the most was all the subtle background things incorporated into the scenes. (Check out the shapes in the flames that flare up in the fireplace at the midwife's house when the horseman is coming. Couldn't ask for a better horror movie, a true solid 10/10, one of Tim Burton's best works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another Tim Burton winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strange, the bizarre, old legends have always fed Tim Burton's imagination and so, he had to discover and to get enthusiastic about the legend of the Headless Horseman. At the very end of the eighteenth Century, Ichabot Crane (Johnny Depp) is a young inspector who only trusts rationality to clarify the numerous murders in New York and he is indignant at the imprisoning ways for the culprits. To put his convictions to the test, the leaders of the city send him in a small isolated village, Sleepy Hollow to investigate on a series of murders committed by a mysterious headless horseman. As it was expected, his rational thoughts collapse but don't stop him from slowly garnering clues about the horseman. The whole affair involves manipulation, witchcraft and the authorities of the village seem to be the targets of "the monster".Every time we're about to discover a Tim Burton piece of work, we can be sure of one thing that can be proof of artistic achievement: the aesthetic beauty that shrouds many of the filmmaker's works. From this perspective, "Sleepy Hollow" is an aesthetic refinement with its somber cinematography that highlights the disquieting landscapes, especially when the headless horseman appears. But also the shady places of the village. Black and gray are the prevailing colors of this Gothic tale. This visual splendor redeems certain clumsy steps of the plot where the interest somewhat depletes like for instance the moment when Depp is shaken in his bed because he realized the headless horseman existed and also the nearly end of the film when too many explanations about the horrid facts were given in one sequence. But the strong visual appeal of this tale which reminds the ones we used to read as children makes you effortlessly forget these weak points that also include the inhabitants' perception towards Crane. See his arrival in the village when the villagers close their shutters in front of him.Once again, Johnny Depp owes a great deal to Tim Burton to have given him a role worthy of his wide acting skills. With "Sleepy Hollow", the filmmaker gave us a Gothic tale for adults, teenagers which is bound to remind them of their childhood nightmares as well as a momentous work in a prestigious filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trite plot, but great visual experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a good example of how a movie can work even when its plot is sub par or lacking substance (Terrence Malick's The New World also comes to mind). The score, cinematography, and art direction are all superb, but the main plot is rather unoriginal and uninspired. The film piques your interest from the start but eventually devolves into a standard murder mystery. Yet in the end, the film remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, if only for its sensory value.Tim Burton successfully creates a hauntingly beautiful Gothic setting in post-independence America, with many memorable dark scenes that will be sure to tickle your macabre fancies. Ichabod Crane's back-story is particularly disturbing yet simultaneously fascinating. The contrast between light and dark is intentionally stark, and it helps create the supernatural setting. The town of Sleepy Hollow has an uneasy feel about it, as expected, but interestingly enough, Burton's portrayal of New York is even more harrowing. The city is shown as a sort of puritanical version of Gotham, which is of course Burton's bread and butter.The film has a remarkable cast, and most of the actors turn in excellent performances. Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual, and he truly becomes the methodical Ichabod Crane who is haunted by a dark past. Christina Ricci is quite believable in her role as the down to earth and sensible Katrina Van Tassel. Miranda Richardson is the only real weak link in the cast, as her performance seems over the top and contrived. Also be ready for a let down if you are a Christopher Walken fan, as I am; though he is magnificently terrifying as the Horseman, he does not get much screen time at all. (The Horseman is headless after all--I just wish the writers could have found a way around this small detail.) This movie is a must for all Tim Burton fans. If you don't particularly care for his work however, and if you absolutely need a strong plot to interest you in a movie, you may want to pass on this film. But if you're looking for a visually stunning and creative piece of fantasy, Sleepy Hollow will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous, Bloodthirsty, Funny, Evocative Horror Story About A Headless Horseman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1799, a series of gruesome murders take place in the small New England town of Sleepy Hollow and are attributed to a ghostly local legend, the Headless Horseman. Sceptical New York police constable Ichabod Crane is sent to investigate, and is more than a little alarmed at what he uncovers ...Produced by Francis Coppola's American Zoetrope, this is a funny, scary, gleeful, atmosphere-laden gem of a horror movie from start to finish, with a fabulous cast, a terrific story and stunning direction. Christopher Lee's brief pre-credits role sets up perfectly what this is; Tim Burton's variation on an old Hammer Horror picture, complete with spooky forests, busty women, Victorian melodrama, terrible goings-on and a classic monster. It's fantastic fearful fun all the way through, with Depp's comic-sympathetic performance as the hapless yet heroic Ichabod sparking off against Burton's nightmarish photography and grand-guignol stylings. I love the way it keeps both the scares and the laughs coming without ever being self-conscious and hip, but also maintains a great mystery storyline as well. We're with Ichabod as he tries to solve the puzzle and figure out who's who, but there are no lulls in the action, with plenty of great fights and chases along the way. Everybody is terrific in this picture, especially Richardson, the quintet of old geezer conspirators, Walken (in a flashy part as the Hessian mercenary), Park (Darth Maul from The Phantom Menace) as the Headless Horseman, and an unbilled Landau as the first victim who kicks the case off. Technically, the film is near flawless, shot almost entirely on stages, with amazingly clever use of sets, effects and filters - it's almost a black-and-white film that isn't black-and-white, all greys and muted tones one minute and evocative colour the next. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work, Rick Heinrichs' production design, Danny Elfman's music and Nick Gillard's stuntwork are all absolutely top-notch, as is the work by co-writer, co-producer and effects supervisor Kevin Yagher. The excellent script is only loosely based on the original tale (which is largely about the countryside, vanity, food and courting rituals) in Washington Irving's 1820 collection of stories, The Sketch Book, but this is neither here nor there. Richly reminiscent of the classic horror films of both the thirties and the fifties, this is a spine-tingling modern-day grim fairy-tale to curdle the blood on a winter's night. Magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>80 % Wonderful ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released well before Johnny Depp's star exploded in the form of Captain Jack Sparrow, this is nonetheless a well-crafted, superbly entertaining piece of film. Set in a spooky, beautiful Gothic fairy-land, the plot follows 18th Century New York detective Ichabod Crane (a man whose beliefs are rooted firmly in science) attempting to solve a very supernatural mystery in the small village of Sleepy Hollow. Surrounded by local conspirators and aided by a fearless local girl, Katrina Van Tassel, and a plucky servant boy (known to all as young Masbeth) Ichabod sets himself against the town, its elders, and an utterly terrifying foe in the form of a headless (and very dead) horseman.Depp's rising star is much in evidence as he portrays the bright, well-meaning, eccentric, scared witless but ultimately heroic Crane, with only slightly more restraint than he's brought to the likes of Willy Wonka or Edward Scissorhands. A variety of good actors and actress flesh out neatly sketched supporting characters, and there's a truly ace mystery to be solved within the film. The set pieces are stunning, the action fantastic (though very very gory) - so why the 80% rating? Plot and dialogue, sadly. The 18th century speech is often cardboard in its stiffness, and only Depp manages to liven it up. And as aforementioned, despite the excellently plotted mystery, the storyline is cluttered up with a complex (but totally unnecessary) back-story for Crane that rather detracts rather than adds to the essence of the film's major goings-on.These criticisms aside however, this is a great film and a fine way to distract yourself on a dark evening ... leaving the light on, of course.</fullReview>

But Ichabod doesn't believe them because in New York they don't believe in ghouls and goblins. But he sees this murderer and finds his resting place which is a tree. Successfully sleeps three times in which he has three flashbacks.

		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" was an interesting movie that caught my interest and attention from start to finish. At first, I was hesitant to watch this film because of the what critics had said about this film, but I thought to myself that everyone should judge for themselves.I thought "Scream 3" was scary but with "Sleepy Hollow" I found a movie that equaled it. "Sleepy Hollow" did a great job of grossing everyone out by showing the severed heads and even the insides of he heads.This movie turned out to be an incredible murder mystery that tested the mind as to figure out what the real plot was. Furthermore, I enjoyed how Tim Burton maneuvered the cast into not revealing too much of the true plot until just the right time.My favorite scenes in this movie came when the headless horsemen came out of the dead man's tree. However, every scene in "Sleepy Hollow" was excellent and my favorite because it kept my interest as well as wanting to know what would happen next.Depp knew just what to say and when to say it. I was truly blown away by his performance.If I ever saw a movie that was underrated, it would be "Sleepy Hollow." I recommend this movie because it has thrills, chills, action and dramatic scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well directed gothic fairy tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1799 Constable Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a spate of murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. The townsfolk believe that the murders are the work of a headless horseman who beheads his victims but Crane believes it is a matter for logic and science. Crane investigates however his faith in science and logic grows increasingly threatened when he is confronted with things that cannot be explained away by modern police work and logical ways of thinking.I'm a Tim Burton fan, only finding a few of his films to be misguided or poor. I greatly looked forward to this film, hoping for a nightmarish fairy tale feel to it and for the most part I was rewarded for my expectations. For the majority of the film we are treated to the horseman gleefully wrecking havoc while Crane delivers humour as well as being our wide eyed observer.The plot itself is pretty free flowing until the last 20 minutes where it becomes a more standard detective mystery of sorts. Many feel this is a letdown and in a way it is mostly because it is a change of pace and style. However it delivers well and has good action and stunts with a good pace. The tidy ends may go against the nature of the film but I still enjoyed it. Up till this point it is very dark and bloody and Burton has stamped his vision all over this.The cast is full of well know faces and is mostly very good. Depp is funny and deadpan and carries the central role well. On the downside Ricci is pretty poor. She looks good but she has no chemistry with Depp and is pale and fails to make an impact. A support cast of Gambon, Jones, Richardson, Van Dien, Lee and Griffiths all do well and deliver interesting characters. Walken may be limited in terms of screen time but he is an inspired bit of casting and has a strong presence as the horseman.Overall the majority of this film has Burton's vision stamped all over it. He carries the film well with gleeful bloodletting and a good humour. The end may be all a bit mystery-solving but even it is delivered with some good action scenes. Not Burton's best film but an enjoyable gothic fairy tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, Burton succeeded in what he was trying to do.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>which was to make a homage to the old British Hammer films of the 60s. The film could have been following a checklist:Does it have dark, gothic set design? CheckDoes it share a title with a work of classic literature? CheckDoes it bear absolutely no resemblence to said classic? CheckIs it instead a needlessly complicated whodunnit with an anticlimatic resolution? CheckAs far as costume design, does it think mainly of tight corsets straining to contain amply endowed women? CheckDoes it contain overwrought and melodramatic dialogue straight from a penny dreadful novel? CheckDoes it conain oodles of blood? CheckAnd Christopher Lee? CheckWith "Sleepy Hollow" Tim Burton forgets the cardinal rule of homage; refer but do not recreate. The film's main fault is that it is not so much a homage to Hammer horror as a carbon copy. Fidelity is not always a virtue, for while the film manages to capture all that was good about Hammer horror, it also manages to capture all that was bad.I have to say that "Sleepy Hollow" had one advantage over its source, there were moments in this film that were genuinely scary and suspensful, and I can't remember being scared once while watching any Hammer film. However, Hammer's failings ultimately undermine it. Most of the cast deliberately camped up their roles, and so did disservice to themselves (Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci, and Johnny Depp are all excellent actors and it is a bit depressing to see them as they are here) but Christopher Lee, who only appears briefly, reminds the world why he is and always has been the greatest conveyor of primal menace in the history of film; a fact Burton makes all the clearer by pairing him with his lesser modern counterpart, Christopher Walken. I find it interesting that Lee's career shot into the sky after this film was released.Given its aims, "Sleepy Hollow" could be called a success. But since it was aiming so low I can really only call it a failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has made a few adult movies but I fear this one went down the wrong tunnel. For one Sleepy Hollow reminded me of Edward Scissorshands with its snowy landscapes and odd fantastic sets, and of course Depp. That Burton felt the need to add dozens of forced graphic decapitation shots was the only thing that spoilt what could have been a spectacular family movie. The headless horseman was a great concept, but sadly he does little but take off head upon head whilst the rest of the cast figure out what's going on, before he strikes in typically predictable fashion. The climax is a little abrupt and felt a bit comic-like and unrealistic to me (Burtons niche is allowing fantasy films to show realism and convincing story lines without too much ridicule).Sleepy Hollow isn't too bad a film, it just isn't that good. It feels too empty to encourage watchers to see if they missed anything on a second watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. I love the story of the Headless Horseman, and this new version of the classic tale is original and different. Tim Burton is an amazing director and has created a beautiful and haunting atmosphere. Although the movie is dark, it is very funny, and the two of these categories fit well together. This may appear to be a scary movie but, although there are some scary parts, you usually end up laughing at the end of these scenes. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and is very comical. If you don't have any other reason to watch this movie, Johnny is the reason. The rest of the actors play their parts well and are enjoyable to watch. Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers and with this movie he does a wonderful job adding to the emotion of the scenes. If you like darkly comical movies, you will like Sleepy Hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Washington Irving would roll in his grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up IN the ORIGINAL Sleepy Hollow I've walked down the streets and through the graveyard. I've seen the landmarks a dozen times, toured Washington Irving's home, and read his original work more time then I can remember. As usual, the powers that be have taken a piece of literature and so twisted the story around that for all intents and purposes "Sleepy Hollow" is a completely differant story then it was. To start out with, the entire look and landscape is almost completely differant then the actual area. It is much spookier, darker, and stranger then anywhere around here that I know of. In actuality the area is actually quite pretty, sitting right on the Hudson river with only the occasional fog and rain. Second of all, the Headless Horseman never had an axe, nor did he decapitate his victims, nor did he even HAVE any victims. The original story depicts the Headless Horseman as a story, a myth, a legend of which there is no real evidence to back up his existence. Bodies were not found all over the area and the towns people were not genuinely frightened by his supposed presence. Perhaps the biggest mistake made is that of Johnny Depp's character, "Constable Crane?" Where did THAT one come from? Read the original story and Ichabod Crane is a clumsy, bumbling school teacher that is sent to the town as just that, a teacher. Depp's character is more reminiscent of a Van Damme or Stallone-type action hero then Irving's original character.In and of itself the movie is well done, Tim Burton chalks up another point for his visual imagery and all of the actors do their jobs well, particularly Depp, Walken, and Ricci. The only problem that remains is that again, a studio has taken a masterful story and butchered it in to a more gruesome, bloody, and differant story than it was back when Washington Irving first scribed it. Finding a copy of Irving's original text is not difficult, I urge anyone who has seen this movie to read the work and then make up your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Looking, But Out of Balance Tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gorgeous looking and designed period setting for the movie seems to capture the dirty, chaotic, but simple and supposedly less frantic urban life of contemporary society. The movie begins with a finely honed balanced between terrible horror and the amazing subtle Johnny Depp performance of charmingly odd and eccentricity. For the first half of the movie Depp is able to deftly insert an entertaining light, weird sense of humor among the more dark and definite nasty evil invading this quaint town. While the story teeters between science and magical horror, the second half of the movie seems to descend into a runaway riot of the fantastic that even Depp's character can't charm himself back into balance like the first half of the movie.This is a dark comedy, horror thriller that for the most part offers up sinister villains though there is something uneven and not completely convincing by the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually arresting dark tale is gory, but a clever piece by Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Embracing a dark, quirky vision and engaging characters from Washington Irving's novel 'The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow', this film sees Johnny Depp collaborating with director Tim Burton for another fantasy adventure, but with more blood and gore and less kid- friendly material than most of Burton's. With Burton taking place in the director's chair, it is only anticipated that the director captures his trademark macabre storytelling and Gothic visual atmosphere, take a look back at Burton's 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' for an example. As expected, this film embraces it beautifully, if a bit creepy. So the movie takes place in near the dawn of the 18th century where we witness a wealthy farmer, his son, and a widowed woman as they riding on a stagecoach in the middle of a dark field when they suddenly beheaded by the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). A New York City constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) is appointed by the government to travel out an old town of Sleep Hollows to investigate the grisly murders and bring the headless slayer to justice. Upon his investigation, he meets Katrina Can Vassel (played by Christina Ricci), the daughter of the wealthy townsman Baltas Van Tassel (played by Michael Gambon) who he gradually falls in love with. As the body count in the old town continues to rise, Ichabod is accompanied by Katrina and Masbath (played by Marc Pickering) to put an end to the Headless horseman's tyranny.This Tim Burton fantasy picture is with zero doubt creepy in both the visual and narrative department, not to mention quite gory as decapitations occur more often than a slasher flick by Wes Craven. Calling this a slasher movie set in the Victorian Age however, does a feel somewhat of an overstatement as this film's main element is visuals and storytelling than a plot of individuals getting picked off one by one. Nonetheless, there are definitely some scares to endure here as we experience some of Tim Burton's dark, creep trademark imagery, one of which includes a living tree filled with severed heads from the Headless Horseman's slayings. The visuals suite the story quite well and make up for the story's eerie atmosphere. The costume design and makeup, particularly done on Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane is dazzling and captures an accurate feel of the Victorian Age setting. The character development is fine, though the manner in which they are written give them a feel of more like caricatures than lively characters. Then again, this is Tim Burton we are talking about, and the slight quirkiness of the characters only deliver an appropriate feel for a Tim Burton picture. As Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci's character develop a relationship, we experience a romance that feels pretty weak than realistic. As a result, it is hard to buy into these two falling in alive, especially considering the heavy age gap between the actor and actress. Overall, the film's engaging, solidly paced storytelling make up for the flaws, with plenty of surprises and twists to experience. Sleepy Hollow is a visually arresting work of art by Tim Burton, one that is definitely worth checking out, but perhaps not for non-Tim Burton fans. This movie may plague with nightmarish imagery and gruesome violence, but it is done a genuine manner that never feels gratuitous or exploitative. In the end, Tim Burton's macabre storytelling, characters, and artistic visual aspect are certainly worth admiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow (1999): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Christopher Walken, Michael Gambon: Everything that comes to mind when reflecting upon the tale of the Headless Horseman is created here including the dead trees, the corn fields, the windmill, the small village, and that ominous pumpkin head. Sleepy Hollow is a place that sleeps unsoundly with hopes of awakening again. Johnny Depp plays a New York constable summoned to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate strange reoccurring murders. Residences fear the Headless Horseman whose victims are missing their heads. The plot is clever with lots of graphic head lopping. Director Tim Burton showcases exquisite special effects that complete the film's ominous appeal. Depp combines curiosity and humour while sheltering a childhood nightmare. Christina Ricci figures into the plot in an enchanting way. Miranda Richardson steals scenes in a role that shelters secrets. Christopher Walken is featured as the Headless Horseman whose head lopping violence is repetitious but we learn of the character's background and defeat and why he slays specific persons. Michael Gambon plays what appears to be the leading residence, and he ties into the dire situation. This is Burton as his visual best with innovative entertainment that is far from hollow.

		<shortDescription>It is so obvious he wants us to laugh with fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a classic, a witch and haunted classic. Since it comes from a very distant time, 1799, in 1999, to celebrate the millennium anyway after celebrating an older millennium, when everyone was expecting the end of the world and the Apocalypse, there is no need to play at "suspending your disbelief" because in 1799 they did believe in ghosts, in curses, in the devil, in witches and many other things like that, though deeply motivated by inheritance, property, possessions, riches, land owning, and a few other things like that. And sure enough Tim Burton does not bother to bring the old story by Washington Irving to the level of disbelief of the last year of the twentieth century. On the reverse he aggravates the case for our enjoyment. Because that is all it is, enjoyment of the living dead, the headless riding ghost, the fear and the fright of these simple people of these old days who were afraid of some sorcery, of a curse from one woman who wanted both her vengeance against a landlord and the means to capture his fortune.And this time the film is a real jewel, a gem that we enjoy sip by sip and sniff by sniff, gulp by gulp and glimpse by glimpse. Finally Mr. Tim Burton found a real Halloween story to tell us that we all knew was a Halloween story and that we could enjoy peacefully since the only objective was to enjoy our temporary pangs of fear with the riding vengeful justice ghost who will finally manage to get his vengeance and his carnal pleasure with the witch who had been able to control him because she recuperated his skull from his ostracized grave where his decapitated skull had been buried. But it took a young constable from New York playing CSI before it was ever invented, serial killers and profiling before they even were or had been heard of to sort out the truth from the fable, the ghost from the criminal, fear from reality and he was able to bring back to New York, the happy schmuck, a future wife and a valet. You will necessarily enjoy it especially since you will have to wait for the very last scene to understand the whole business, because it was business before all and above all.And you know time is business, so let's save some time, hence some money, and let me tell you, this one is a good film by Tim Burton though it has little philosophical and ethical value. Shallow but really suspenseful and maybe a little bit surprisingly frightening. The morbidity of this film is just the necessary salt, sugar and pepper to make the medicine go down.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert!!! This is a nice awesome Gothic-themed slasher film about the legend of the headless horseman. It is filled with awesome decapitations, a great twisted storyline, and awesome atmospheres. The cast is just perfect for this movie and I really think this is Johnny Depp's best performance besides Edward Scissorhands. I also must say this is ultimately one of Tim Burton's best films of all time! It is a little bit better than Edward Scissorhands and Bettlejuice, I think, but it is not as enjoyable as Mars Attacks or Batman! Tim Burton really should consider doing awesome films like these because his dark themes really add to the creepy factors of these kinds of films. If you are not doing anything I recommend you check it out if you are a die-hard Tim Burton or horror movie fan. I give it a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of Johnny Depp's better works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, Johnny Depp was amazing in Edward Scissorhands. Sleepy Hollow however was certainly not his best acting job, nor was it a very good movie. I'll likely get a lot of 'unhelpful' votes on this review, but here's my opinion: Basically it follows the classic story of schoolteacher Ichabod Crane, but in this version directed by Tim Burton he's a police officer sent out to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate murders done by a mysterious headless phantom. He falls for Katrina, who is played by the actress who was Wednesday in The Addams Family movies.Ichabod Crane, throughout the film, is hard to take seriously at the best of times. He is kind of a wimp and all through the movie I just kept thinking, "okay, the fainting thing is a little old now!" With his Gothic look, nearly inaudible voice (I had to keep adjusting the sound on my television to hear him) and strange gadgets, it's extremely hard to take the movie seriously at all. The film was incredibly boring; the scenery was just a bunch of trees and 1800's-style houses, nothing to make it stand out. Aside from Christina Ricci, the acting was pretty bad. The soundtrack was boring and unmemorable.Johnny Depp is definitely one of the best actors I've seen. The problem is, he's in nearly every Tim Burton film, and he always looks about the same, sounds the same, and it's hard to think of his roles as each a separate character in each film.I wouldn't recommend Sleepy Hollow unless you're a Johnny Depp fan. If you want to see better Tim Burton films, try Batman (1989), Edward Scissorhands (1989) or Beetlejuice (1988).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Brazilian's main channel television used to exhibit this movie like always, I always wanted to give it a chance, but I felt I was too young to watch it by myself. Yea, I was a scared child. "Sleepy Hollow" shows, from the get go, how mysterious and cartoonish it will be. Johnny Deep, who I felt much like Jim Carrey, plays an eccentric police officer that needs to investigate the murderers in a small community, and as you can imagine, things aren't that easy. For some moments, I was capable to relate the story with some Scooby Doo's, except for the more mature version of the "horror elements". There is a great soundtrack that fits well in every moment it's utilized, proving that filmmakers were professional at producing it. The photography and overall directing are also GREAT, reflecting a big moment in Tim Burton's career. It's just very dark like some of his older works, like "Batman" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas". The outcome is reasonable and somehow unpredictable-- at least for me and for Mr. Crane haha. It's just not better because it doesn't want to be taken seriously, otherwise it could've still been better. Definitely recommended, unless you feel like you're too old to enjoy innocent stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You may find yourself laughing so hard that it will be hard to keep your head attached...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K., any film director who can make you laugh at the sight of heads being chopped off (not to mention throats slit) is my kind of director. Tim Burton has been keeping me laughing ever since he had Pee Wee Herman ask where the basement in the Alamo was. Then, he had me sobbing (along with the Danny Elfman music) to Johnny Depp making ice sculptures in "Edward Scissorhands", martians chatting unstop in "Mars Attacks!" while dissolving people, and of course, the newly dead learning how to scare the living in "Beetlejuice". All of these films are now modern classics, and "Sleepy Hollow" is up there because of the artistic way it has modernized Washington Irving's classic and the themes of vengeance and terror it combined to make a riveting view of hell on earth.From the moment you see Johnny Depp here, you are back in his Chaplin- esque world of screen acting, a true artist at work, and the Lon Chaney of our modern film world. He is an eccentric who has no idea he's eccentric, and when you see him suddenly being squirted by the blood of the dead as he operates on them, you instantly are given a priceless reaction that isn't "eew", but "I knew that was going to happen." Depp's Ichabod Crane isn't the tall, skinny scaredy cat of the classic animated film, but a sexy crime fighter whose mind has been warped by the lessons learned in childhood. "Villainy wears many masks. None so dangerous as the face of virtue", he says, and that is evidenced here, first by the religiously intolerant father who murdered his mother for apparent devil worship, and then by the seemingly noble perpetrator of all the evil that the headless horseman (Christopher Walken in flashbacks) must commit in order to be reunited with his missing face.There's an art to making decapitations funny, and Tim Burton works overtime to make each one of them memorable. Just as he did with "Sweeney Todd", Burton prevents making them gory by making them hysterically funny. Yes, there is plenty of blood and carnage, and two deaths are extremely gruesome. But when heads roll, they sometimes spin first, unable to ask questions later, and in one case, Depp finds one of the heads rolling towards him in a particularly vulnerable area. Then, there is the "tree of the dead", a visual so evil looking, that it can only be described as the entrance to another world best not visited. The next time you walk through a park or through wooded areas, you will notice trees of many different shapes and may even spot one that at night will appear much spookier than it is during the day.The cast is uniformly excellent, with Christina Ricci an appropriately vulnerable heroine (whose motives are always in question), Miranda Richardson as unforgettable as always (here, resembling Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction"), and a supporting cast of male stage and screen vets who each contribute in one way or another. Richard Griffiths is particularly fine as the local magistrate, and of course, Walken (doing nothing but a Frankenstein grunt) makes his evil character totally menacing. This is one of those films that you might find yourself watching over and over again (like most Tim Burton films) and sharing with those who haven't seen it. In spite of the gory nature of the story, the laughs come frequent, are never juvenile or gratuitous, and add to the fun and fast-moving nature of the Gothic tale being unfolded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A different take on the Sleepy Hollow tale. This one takes place only twenty years after the Hessian scum has been killed and buried. He has returned and is slaughtering people right and left. Johnny Depp plays the forward thinking constable sent up from the big city to solve the cases. He teams up with the son of one of the killed men since he is the only one who has the courage (or stupidity) to assist the constable. As things progress Depp goes to what I guess is a with. She does a conjuration using bats blood and gets a prosaic quote. Riding on he comes across Christina Ricci, the mayor's daughter, in the woods. They team up and find the death tree. Here is where the heads are stuffed into it and Depp surmises that the horseman is reaping heads until his is returned. Casper Van Dien actually gets a decent role in this movie, it seems he usually gets the B movie action roles. There are some dream sequences that fill in some back story Depp's character. Also Ricci appears to be a witch of some sort as she brews a potion to help Depp recover from the Horseman's attack. After seeing a family tree Depp finally figures out what the connection is between the murders and the horseman. He finds out that it is a conspiracy between the four town elders to ensure the passing down of a large fortune to the right person. The real question is who is the one that stole the horseman's skull, that is who is controlling it to do his bidding. Turns out it is the stepmother who is using the horseman to exact revenge for her family's displacement from their farm. Anyway Depp, Ricci and the boy climb to the top of a windmill which goes up in an explosion of flames with the horseman inside. Since the horseman was already dead he survives and chases after the escaping trio. Of course he catches them and there is a fight scene. Coming across his skull at the end the horseman ends up taking the stepmother as his bride? and the rst is film history.s</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How come that Christopher Walken has absolutely no speaking lines in this film, yet he's the best thing in it? All his character, the Headless Horseman, does is scream, stare at you creepily and then lop some heads off. That's it, but I'll be damned if he still wasn't the funniest, the most memorable and all around the best character in the entire film. But that's Christopher Walken for you. Only he can pull off such a feat without even making an effort.Not to say that the rest of the characters were bad or anything. Johnny Depp does a convincing job as Ichabod Crane, the rational detective sent to the countryside to investigate a mystery murder. Though I'll be honest and say that I never really saw the character. Rather I saw Depp playing his trademark quirky oddball character with slight variations. But in the case of this film, that works, so I have no complaints. The rest of the actors didn't leave any lasting impressions, but they were okay.But in all seriousness, the best part of this film, aside from Christopher Walken, is its production values. The film looks and sounds great. The costuming is topnotch, the cinematography works beautifully and all around it's a very impressive looking little film. This is a good thing, because the story itself is a bit too campy to be taken seriously, but the outlook of the film, aided by the performances of both Walken and Depp, allow you to relax early on and just enjoy the experience. I was more amused than bothered by the inconsistencies and questionable story twists, which were eventual and not as bad as they could have been.Do you require highly logical and consistent plot lines and characters to enjoy a film? Then this one isn't for you. Are you a fan of campy popcorn horror flicks with a good dose of self- and genre-awareness? Then this one is definitely for you.</fullReview>

Christina Ricci plays his love interest Katrina Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother.Gothic film has a fine cast and superb set design &amp; art direction, and a clever script, though is marred by too many decapitations, when that should have been left more to the imagination.

		<shortDescription>Don't lose your head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1999 film "Sleepy Hollow" is another collaboration by Johnny Depp (in his mid 30s at that point), already a huge star back then, and Tim Burton almost 10 years after the great "Edward Scissorhands". This story has been done many many times back until the early silent days of cinema, but Burton's take probably took over from the animated short film version from 1949 as the most common adaptation of this horror tale. If you didn't know it was by Tim Burton or about his affection with the supernatural, you could still think early on, this was not a mystery tale, but a crime story. The protagonist hears about a couple of beheading in another town and travels there believing some mass murderer was on the run. When he is played a prank on by some of the locals who dress up as the headless horseman, this tendency stays alive. However, when Ichabod Crane runs for the first time into the real monster, it becomes clear that something supernatural is taking its course.While I was admittedly never too interested in the story, it still made for a good watch. Especially Christopher Walken is a perfect casting choice for his part and Christina Ricci looks like a gloomy version of a mysterious modern Disney princess here. Michael Gambon I occasionally mistook for Geoffrey Rush and that's of course really a compliment. I'm more of a fan of invisible danger and horror ? la "Blair Witch Project" than of Burton's mostly very graphic style, so I wasn't really scared, but I was entertained for the most part. The finale got a bit messy admittedly, but that shouldn't take the focus from how solid everything before that is, especially the visual side, but that's almost a given with Burton. The effects, the bleak landscape and the whole setting are certainly the highlight of the film. Lovers of mystery films will probably have a much better time watching this one as I did, but even if I'm not too eager on watching it in the near future again, I'd also recommend it to everybody else who's not completely opposed to the genre and even then you could still enjoy it from the period piece angle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad For The Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Purchased this DVD for 2.99 used, so not a bad deal at all. Pretty solid horror film to boot. However. . .One of the problems with horror movies with blood and gore involved is that the audience is so used to the special effects these days that the shock value is no longer there. Therefore the strength of the plot becomes more important to retain the audiences attention for the duration of the movie.To this end Sleepy Hollow is a novel way of turning a "slasher" movie into a period slasher movie. The problem with this is that the villain "or the suspense" associated with the Headless horsemen loses its scare factor after about 20 mins into the film. After than it is the inevitable ending that you come to expect with the hero saving the day.Thats the problem I have with this movie, it promises so much yet you feel a little disappointed in the end that it never quite achieved what it set out to do.Johnny Depp is a little annoying as the bumbling constable whilst Christina Ricci's character is not developed enough. She seems to fit the bill perfectly for her character, but we never get to see that enough in the movie.As far as horror flicks go its not too bad. Maybe I have just come to expect more in a storyline these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Burton Adaptation!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Christopher Walken and Christopher Lee star in Tim Burton's 1999 horror film based on the novel, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." This takes place in the late 18th century where New York investigator, Ichabod Crane (Depp) is sent to a dreary down, Sleepy Hollow to find clues leading to a mysterious killer who beheads some of the residents. Ricci plays Katrina Van Tassel, Richardson plays her stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, Gambon plays Katrina's father, Baltus, Jones plays Reverand Steenwyck, Griffiths plays Magistrate Philipse, McDiarmid plays Dr. Lancaster, Gough plays Notary Hardenbrook, Lee appears briefly as Burgomaster and Walken plays Hessian Horseman. This is a good adaptation from Burton with a good cast and excellent score by Danny Elfman as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SLEEP HOLLOW and watch your head!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to 1999, a friend of mine invited me to go the movies to see a film about a headless horseman who was decapitating people in a small town in 1799. I wasn't sure whether a YES could be good idea, but I accepted anyway. First of all, when I go to see a film that I am not convicted about it, I see who are the cast, the director, the producers... Well, the whole crew. That's when, I read the names Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. They reminded me Edward Scissorhands (1990), one of the worse films I had ever seen, I simply hated it. For a moment, I almost gave up. Truly! But my friend had lucky, I always keep my promises. The only thought that came to my mind was: Let's see heads roll down. Sleepy Hollow is based on The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, a short story written by Washington Irving. The main character is Ichabod Crane, a police office who believes more in science than supernatural events. He was sent to an agricultural town to solve a mysterious case of murders. There, local people tell him the legend of a Hessian horseman whose comes from the world of the dead to cut heads off and take them with him to darkness. Ichabod denies this possibility and affirms the murder as a flesh and blood human being. The investigation begins? The conflict between science and supernatural/superstition is evident in every single scene. All is connected to somehow. None of the characters is mere a secondary character, he/she has an important position in the plot, no matter what. I know it is a kind of horror film thriller, but I recognized a comedy atmosphere from Johnny Deep sometimes. It is interesting and worth to noticed, very clever. At the end of my odyssey, I was stunned. The movie was spectacular. I loved the visual effects. Although, the visual effects crew and photograph director work is incredible, the colours were the diamond of the film. From my point of view, they were used as painters paint their paintings. YES? I had to admit to my friend that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are amazing and I was totally wrong about them. I didn't know that time, but Sleepy Hollow would be an important piece in my academic studies. You will know why in the next review about The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Very soon!More review: http://inessabooksandfilms.blogspot.com.br/Inessa Silva</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the head of a horseman is stolen, the horseman returns from hell to take the heads of the people of Sleepy Hollow until his is returned.Ichabod Crane is called in to investigate. He learns of the legend of the Headless Horseman, but he doesn't believe that the stories, until the horseman takes off the head of one of the elders right in front of his very eyes.Now he must find out the origins of the horseman in order to send him back to his grave for good, whilst battling his own demons....It's your typical Burton movie. Depp is the star, Elfman scores, and the colours are saturated, it's like we've gone back 12 years to when we first met Beetlejuice, and although the movie is very dark in tone, it's very funny.Depp proves he didn't need to be in the Caribbean to make a film his, and every time he faints, its genuinely laugh out loud. Ricci is a little miscast as the love interest, but Ryder wasn't available.The effects are wonderful, even though Ray Park does overdo the Martail arts a little, I mean Walken can dance, but those sort of skill? I very much doubt it.The final third goes a little over the top, but it's Sleepy Hollow, done by Burton, and you get what you expect.A Gothic treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is typical Tim Burton style but this has got to be one of his best movies. The special effects and visual effects are amazing and the cinematography is stunning. The only real flaw with this movie in my opinion is the story line but that had nothing to do with Tim Burton as this story already existed..This movie is about a young detective who is sent from the city to invesitage 3 murders in a small town. He goes there with a logical frame of mind but as rumors from the towns people include a headless horseman he is forced to think outside the box as this might be true.This movie was pretty good just not the best. I frankly don't like the story line but the way Burton did it was stunning. He made it very visually pleasing and that has to be the best part followed closely by Depps acting who is always great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is directed by Tim Burton and co-adapted to screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and Kevin Yagher from the The Legend of Sleepy Hollow written by Washington Irving. It stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Marc Pickering, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones and Casper Van Dien. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.1799 New York, and Ichabod Crane, a timid but forward thinking detective, is sent to the way out village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of decapitations.A perfect match of director and actor to the source material, Sleepy Hollow unfolds as a fun filled creeper of such visual and aural pleasures, it's a wonder nobody thought to put the combination together earlier than 1999. Story is familiar, though with a few changes, and although some of the comedy ends up a bit sillier than is tonally appropriate (really, Ichabod, stop pushing the effeminate angle to breaking point) , film runs along at a fair old clip and never wants for period devilment. It's never really scary when Walken's headless horseman isn't part of the scene, but it's very unlikely that Burton or Depp were aiming to soil underwear anyway. More a case of charming you whilst caressing the tingler on your spine. A case of style of substance? Yes, to a degree, but the source story still comes through the lavish eye candy painting to reveal itself proudly.Burton had created a world of Gothic mysticism, a blend of Hammer horror values and Brothers Grimm bad dreams, a land of swirling mists and tall shadows, where black, red and purple are essential colours. From the quaint duck pond in the centre of the village, to a creaky old windmill, there are visual treats galore here; which are enhanced magnificently by Elfman's foreboding rumbles. Costuming is first rate (Colleen Atwood), as is Lubezki's colour lensing and Rick Heinrich's production design. The cast are led superbly by Depp and appear to be pitching performances at just the right tone, such is the director's want. Although Ricci is sadly underused in a key role, and we could have done with more Richardson since she is wonderfully catty and yummy in equal measure. But with bona fide thespian quality in the support ranks (joining Gambon and Jones are Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths), picture never falls short of scene enhancers.Period peril with a glint in its eye, Sleepy Hollow is a delightful nights entertainment by the fire. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly Worthy of an R Rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton takes on Washington Irving's classic ghost story in this 1999 adaption with Johnny Depp in the lead and Christina Ricci as the love interest. The film tells of Constable Ichabod Crane who travels to the quaint village of Sleepy Hollow to solve the rash of murders by the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken who is unseen for most of the film except for two flashbacks and the finale). The film is quite spooky for the majority of the film, but hardly a rated R movie. The only moments when that rating plays in is when the victims are decapitated on-screen. Johnny's performance is one that emasculates him at times in the movie, but he amuses me too. Miss Ricci is a sweet, but mysterious presence in her scenes throughout the film as we uncover the truth behind the mystery of the Horseman. This film is worth a viewing if you aren't too squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie back in my high school days, and watched it for the third time recently. It was every bit as wonderful now as it was then.I think this movie is escapism in its purest form. For those of us who love the idea of atmospheric, mysterious, dangerous and thrilling places, it's pure joy to look upon Sleepy Hollow - dark, Gothic and very real. So much of this movie is the look and feel of this world and its characters. When you see the headless horseman on his horse, riding in the dark night with the wind blowing wildly, it is visual ecstasy.The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is fantastical and reinforces the magical quality of Sleepy Hollow. His score is a wonderful, pulsating accompaniment that energizes the action and mystifies character scenes.I love this movie for what it is, and I am grateful that there are movie makers who love to create what seems outlandish and unrealistic to skeptics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this film I had some apprehensions that it would be the same a Sweeney Todd which, although Sweeney Todd is one of my favourite movies, would have been dull and repetitive. Sleepy Hollow, however, was in my view, of an entirely different genre and feel altogether. The movie is dark and mysterious, as are most Tim Burton movies, and the colour palette of greys blacks and whites means it has a black and white movie feel, without being black and white. Suspense is high all the way through and it manages to be gory and scary in parts, without being unwatchable for a squeamish audience.The cast of this movie is superb despite the fact that there are few supporting characters and there are actors in the film like Christopher Walken who has no lines at all! Johnny Depp was perfect, as ever, and his portrayal of a determined yet fairly quiet man, haunted by his past was thoroughly believable and entertaining. Christina Ricci I felt in some scenes lacked emotional depth, but otherwise was well cast and I believe she has the perfect look for Katrina Van Tassel. Miranda Richardson is an actress who is often overlooked in films as she often plays a supporting role but I feel it is hard not to mention her. She just has such a "Sleepy Hollow" look about her that she blends perfectly into the background for the greater part of the movie and appears as a quiet and subdued lady of the house before turning to reveal the mass murderer underneath which I felt she pulled off flawlessly, she is brilliantly watchable, as always. Michael Gambon, though his accent throughout the film is British, still somehow manages to fit in with the people of Sleepy Hollow and the rest of the cast are all completely in character and capture the strange and eerie feel of the movie. Overall, the movie is brilliant. I have never heard a telling of the legend the same as this one and there are many references to early visual effects through the cardinal illusion and the lantern in the midwife's house. The town, forest and windmill, all constructed physically within 3 months gives it a rustic atmosphere and the use of mist, horses and coffins adds to the slightly Gothic allure of the overall piece. The acting is perfect, the set, music and story are ensnaring and the twists and turns in the plot had me guessing until the end. I would not give it 10/10 if I could find something negative about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has yet again made another masterpiece in his whole movie making career. It is very beautifully shot, well directed and the acting was top notch. I thought the decapitations in this movie looked so realistic an they are very graphic. Johnny Depp was absolutely amazing in his role as Ichobad Crane. He has such a great charisma and plays his role with such believability. My favourite scene in this film is when the fat guy gets decapitated and his head rolls down into Ichobad Cranes crotch and is then picked up by the horseman and then he faints. After I saw that scene, I just laughed my head off. Sleepy Hollow is a very scary horror masterpiece that is not to be missed.</fullReview>

While searching for his own missing head. Reining terror upon anyone left remaining, so they called upon Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who was a very peculiar detective. To help solve this horrific crime, before anymore headless corpses popped up. But when they did the whole town blamed him for being a bad omen and a coward. So then it is up to him this young orphan and the enchanting Katrina (Chritina Ricci) who won the heart of Ichabod. With her white magic, it was up to those three . To stop the evil witch her step mother, find the horseman's head . And save the town, I love this version because it is a lot more entertaining .Than the original!

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's finest pasty skinned, overblown, Gothic moment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only realised that since Beetlejuice in 1988 I have seen every single full length film Tim Burton has made, but scrolling down the IMDb page today I can't say that aside from this film I found any of them especially memorable.Granted Burton has undeniable visual flair and his movies POP out of the screen, also inarguable is his willingness to experiment and try new things, I mean who else has a musical, a big budget comic book adaptation, and stop motion animation films on their resume. So while I've admired his output and will continue to check out his films he has never made anything that resonated with me like Sleepy Hollow does ? and besides some of the more obvious reasons I can't explain why I like it so much? When Constable Icabod Crane (Burton muse Johnny Depp) is reposted (but really shuffled out of the way) to use his advanced investigation and new fangled means in detection to ascertain why the average height of the locals is reducing he obeys only as it is his duty.Upon arriving in the small town and meeting with the locals he is sat down and sombrely informed that the 3 recent victims who no longer have use for nice hats were allegedly abbreviated by a serial killer who is similarly headless, only this one rides an undead steed and tops his victims with swords, axes and scythes. The Horseman is essentially dead, so bullets and swords do little damage, he also looks a lot like Christopher Walken (in a wicked cameo) when his bonce is perched on the shoulders, and his teeth are filed into fangs for a more imposing and unnerving appearance.Now Icabod is above all a creature of logic and reasoning and all this sounds too far fetched, so his takes his Lil Sherlock bag filled with self made tools and looks into things, vowing science and analysis will do the trick.When his initial findings bring up little of substance Icabod turns to the locals and commences questioning those that might know, it seems that everyone in the quiet town has secrets and everyone is somehow related in some way by blood or marriage, but ultimately like the recently deceased he comes up short.The more senior town officials ? namely the men who requested police assistance in the first place ? are particularly cagy and there is much muttering and conspiring behind closed doors.Icabod is quartered in the loft of a well-to-do farmer Baltus Van Tassell and his wife Lady Van Tassell? and daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). Icabod and Katrina have a spark between them, (which seems logical, after all one is 21 Jump St and the other the only young chick in town and also someone who wears a dress so tight her cleavage is up around her ears!).When still another victim is taken Icabod takes on the newly orphaned son as his apprentice and dogsbody ? and the two continue the case, often with young Katrina alongside.Before I cut descriptions of the plot short ? so to speak ? I must say that at one point Icabod indeed learns that the Headless Horseman is not only possible but he is perpetrating the crimes ? though possibly with the guidance of others.Through the remainder of this excellent film Icabod is given cryptic messages and gradually his investigation and interpretation leads him to the truth which involves witchcraft and deeply buried local secrets.He not only discovers where the Headless Horseman "resides" but how he came to be in his current state, and more importantly how he selects his next victims.I believe that Sleepy Hollow was predominantly shot on one massive sound stage, which is amazing considering just how many scenes occur outdoors, including horse-and-buggy chases.The sets and costumes are all grayish and pale and the countryside forever coated in light mist ? is that why Johnny Depp has such flawless skin? ? all the better to highlight the garish unnatural looking red of the blood that frequently spurts and gushes, often onto Icabod himself.Being a Tim Burton film there are constant Gothic touches, odd imagery and the afore-mentioned blood, this is undoubtedly his most violent film too (Sweeney Todd is runner-up), aside from the frequent and graphic decapitations citizens are impaled and severed in half.As I mentioned earlier Sleepy Hollow has all the base elements that make up a Tim Burton film so we know it will at least be interesting and a visual treat, but Sleepy Hollow goes a couple steps beyond the normal Burton effort, as well as the everpresent Johnny Depp, the formal sounding dialogue, the amazing visuals and the attention to detail this one has a reasonably effective plot even with an undead assassin and witchery.It is the story that often gets set aside in Burton's flicks to make room for more odd antics and intricate visuals, Sleepy Hollow though has a plot that keeps you interested in more than what you are seeing, so even if this looked banal and flat it would still be worth watching ? the fact that the story is aligned with a Burton production elevates Sleepy Hollow above all other Tim Burton efforts.Final Rating ? 8.5 / 10. The stars finally align for Tim Burton, at last a film that looks great but is backed up by performances and plot comparable to the backdrop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loosely inspired by the 1820 short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', Tim Burton Directed 'Sleepy Hollow' is a Stunning Film! Eerie, Creepy, Gruesome, Gorgeous &amp; Entertaining, this 1999 box-office hit, is truly a Great Piece of Cinema. 'Sleepy Hollow' Synopsis: Ichabod Crane is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of 3 people with the culprit being the legendary apparition, the Headless Horseman.'Sleepy Hollow' is a great combination of Horror &amp; Excitement. The film begins superbly &amp; culminates in the very same manner. Its Frightening, Gruesome &amp; Engaging. But, this film is NOT meant for the Faint-Hearted at all. The eerie moments as well the excessive violence, will surely not work for them.Andrew Kevin Walker's Screenplay is very entertaining &amp; engaging. Tim Burton's Direction, is unforgettable. The Prolific Filmmaker has envisioned this film with razor-sharp detailing. Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, is magnificent &amp; captures each moment with flourish. Oscar-Winning Art-Direction by Rick Heinrichs &amp; Peter Young, is truly marvelous. Costume Design by Colleen Atwood, is flawless. Editing by Chris Lebenzon &amp; Joel Negron, is good.Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, is lovable. The Versatile Actor is at his best, yet again! Christina Ricci excels. Miranda Richardson is convincing. The Ever-Terrific Christopher Walken appears as The Headless Horseman, and he's worth watching, as always. Marc Pickering is decent. Sir Michael Gambon is fantastic. Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones &amp; Richard Griffiths leave a mark. Sir Christopher Lee &amp; Martin Landau appear in cameos.On the whole, 'Sleepy Hollow' is amongst Tim Burton's best films. Two Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few other than Tim Burton could have realised such grand, brooding, black comedy as 'Sleepy Hollow'. It's filmed on a sumptuous scale and positively oozes Gothic terror.This movie could be said to have 'made' Johnny Depp, who gives an excellent turn as the would-be Sherlock Holmes, a police detective dedicated to the logical evaluation of crime, only to be dispatched to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, where everything BUT logical crime prevails. There's a hint of 'Edward Scissorhands' in some of the style and characterisation, but Burton makes this movie unique in its own right. Filming is highly evocative. There's tremendous depth of focus in some takes, when the whole world seems to be minutely observed. At other times, night and mist are used to excellent effect. Under the phantom horseman's dire spell, the village is drained of colour, there's a damp, eerie sunless gloom even to the daylight. Architecture is imaginative, set-pieces highly detailed and well chosen. Close observation is rewarded, as indeed is repeat viewing; the makers having slipped all manner of sly details that may go unnoticed first time around.I would have liked a slightly clearer development of the plot; there were moments when it seemed a bit haphazard. And the otherwise excellent theme and incidental music was occasionally too strident for my ears. But these are small enough whinges. The cast do a decent job with an adequate script. There are plenty of familiar faces, with Chris Walken as the phantom and Micheal Gambon as a conspirator.This is how Hammer should have made their vampire, werewolf &amp; Frankenstein movies, Though neither the imagination, creativity or budgets were available in those days.Engaging, unique and well worth a watch, though lacking that essential WOW factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's best film!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not a big fan of Tim Burton's films, most of his films don't move me as they do many. However, Sleepy Hollow (SH) is the exception. I really can find no fault with this film. I think Burton's take on a two-hundred year old story is, in my opinion, fresh. I prefer Ichabod Crane the constable to Ichabod Crane the teacher. In SH Crane is not only investigating the Headless Horseman but the less than supernatural conspiracy behind the murders taking place. SH boasts an acting cast about as perfectly cast as can be had, with nary a bad performance to be had. Depp's portrayal of Crane is one only Depp could have delivered. What I enjoyed most were the set designs and locations. Burton was able to somehow create a sense of beauty and foreboding in this film. The special effects were spot on and even over a decade later do not seem dated. SH is an excellent blend of story, imagery, special effects, and suspense. I watch it every October as it fits right in with the season as do apple cider and pumpkins. Watch this on a chill and dark autumn night and I bet you will get the wonderful scary sensation that will send you to sleep feeling nervous and leave you feeling frightened when you hear a board creek or the trees rustle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great movies of Tim Burton alongside Edward Scissorhands, it has very effective visual effects and is gorgeous. Beauty and atmosphere are everything in this film that creates a Gothic but convincing world for the person who watches the movie. In many ways, it is closer to poetry than to horror.Johnny Depp is as good as usual and the whole cast is of great quality. The only flaw of "Sleepy Hollow" is, of course, that it doesn't follow the story of the book of Washington Irving with very different characters and a completely different end... But only the most snobbish watchdogs of American culture will really be bothered by that. Everyone else will really enjoy this nearly perfect film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific Gothic Horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sad to say, and the line feels clich, and yet it's true. They just don't make them like this anymore.This is a true Gothic horror movie, the first of it's kind to come along in years and the last of it's kind for years to come afterward.Sleepy Hollow is a spooky and atmospheric Gothic horror story in the vein of Hammer Horror. The use of color and shadow with the bombastic and heavily haunting scoring of Danny Elfman certainly give it the feel of a Hammer horror period piece like Horror of Dracula or Frankenstein Created Woman. It's both refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. Every scene is full of sublime, surreal visuals.This is a wonderful film that is part supernatural thriller and part murder mystery. It has a complexity to be appreciated. Unlike most recent horror films it does not condescend to the audience or make the viewer feel like a child or a half-wit. I was seventeen-years-old when Sleepy Hollow came out and I saw it in the theatre twice.A part of the story involving the ancient symbol of the pentacle caught me by surprise. Originally It seems the symbol is being used for evil. This bothered me because the symbol is, in reality, a symbol of ancient faith and protection representing the five elements of nature. Earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. Later though our protagonist is made to realize that the symbol was being used as a protection ward and this greatly relieved me and my fear of misuse of the symbol.Though this is not a faithful adaptation of Washington Irving's short story (which would be difficult to make into a full length feature) I actually feel this story is an improvement on the original incarnation. Ichabod Crane is a lot more relatable and likable in this version of the story. He is shy, geeky, awkward, and faints at least three times during the course of the movie. He is like a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Roddy McDowall's character from Hell House. Our nerdish hero is masterfully played by Johnny Depp. And the ending of the film is very satisfying.I strongly recommend this for anyone who loves Gothic Horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kind of nearly but not quite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so terribly vexed by films like this. Washington Irving wrote a perfectly good story - look, you can see it lurking just on the other side of the doorway into Tim Burton's film. Burton has taken the location - perfectly realised - the notion of a headless horseman, the name of the character Ichabod Crane, and then refashioned everything to suit his own purposes. One now recognises that this is Burton's long standing modus filmandi - take what you want and mould it to fit your own vision.In the case of Sleepy Hollow, what results is good. Johnny Depp delivers a reliable characterisation, as usual, production design is great, the eclectic and starry supporting cast are all excellent, special effects are terrific (and frequently quite gory), and the story gallops along as speedily as Christopher Walken's eerie and genuinely creepy (usually) headless horseman.But I suspect that Washington Irving might have been a bit upset.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this one. It's like a Johnny Depp-Tim Burton classic and it's one of these films that will never get out of my mind.The movie starts and gets going astonishingly, with a very mysterious story and an interesting plot and very good acting...............................BUT..................................Why such a perfect, well-directed horror had to end like this?!!! Somehow, everything gets quickly fixed, the horseman gets his head back and takes the bad lady in hell with him, and we all watch a happy, unrealistic end which destroys all the mystery of the film.If someone watches some movie like that expects not to see the well known, predictable Hollywood ending: but the movie does not avoid this and disappoints the viewers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has many moments of succeeding, but like most Burton films, a mixed-bag overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) The cruse of the headless horseman is the legacy of the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Spearheaded by the eager Constable Ichabod Crane and his new world ways into the quagmire of secrets and murder, secrets once laid to rest, best forgotten and now reawakened, and he too, holding a dark secret of a past once gone.Tim Burton is an artistic Director, no doubt about that, but he often does it to the point of overkill in his movies. I remember watching this as a teenager, and being wowed by it, unfortunately that wasn't the case this time around. The creepy atmosphere is clearly apparent, and Johnny Depp's out there sort of style benefits the film immensely, but the film as a whole is very inconsistent. The whole Headless Horsemen ordeal should have been much more powerful than it was, and Christopher Walken's screen-time is precious, and not as much as I'd have liked. It tries to balance a romance (Unconvincing one I might add) a creepy horror story and a heavy Gothic atmosphere all in one, and it just isn't able to do it.Performances. Johnny Depp is better then the movie itself. His weird facial ticks, his presence, and his unique style are a treat to watch. This guy is capable of anything, and it shows here. Slight criticism, his chemistry with Christina Ricci fell flat. Christina Ricci is OK, but nothing noteworthy. She looks elegant, but her part felt vastly underwhelming. Miranda Richardson has a creepy presence, and did eerily well in her part. Michael Gambon is good, while people like Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, add some English class. Casper Van Dien is wooden in his part. Christopher Lee is sadly wasted as a Judge, while Christopher Walken could peel potatoes and look creepy doing it.Bottom line. I enjoyed bits and pieces, but the over-kill hampered the overall enjoyment for me. It's certainly worth a viewing experience, but it's not as good as the 7.5 rating indicates in my opinion. Too many inconsistencies.6 ? /10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is one of those rare horror movies that I actually enjoyed. I am not a fan of genre and I usually avoid horror movies but since this was based on a tale I read growing up and it starred Johnny Depp and was directed by Tim Burton, I had to see this film.This is about Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders are are believed to have been done by a headless horseman.The acting is pretty good. The supporting cast is what amazed me. It seemed like they all starred in Harry Potter in one film or another. Miranda Richardson character is pretty sinister.Overall, this is what I call a classic horror film. I would want to see this again. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most atmospheric movies of all times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie 11 years ago in the cinema. I loved it back then, and became a huge Tim Burton fan. I wasn't sure if I'd still like it 10 years later - but I do. It's one of the most atmospheric movies of all time. While the story can't be taken serious, it is very entertaining and keeps you interested. Actors are amazing, everyone fit perfectly in their role. The set was beautiful. For the eye, there hasn't been the slightest flaw. (But some Computer - effects that can't hold up to todays standards.)I can't see any real flaw in this movie. It could have been a bit more serious and a bit more scary. But it's actually fine as it is: with a few comedic elements and a "wiking eye".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton finds the perfect material for his brooding atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Absolutely one of the most satisfying films visually that I've ever seen and it looks great in Hi-Def on a big screen.The visual treats are too numerous to mention, but all the way through this dark tale the camera lingers on some awe-inspiring shots that almost have a Currier and Ives feeling about them.The famous tale of the Headless Horseman by Washington Irving gets a new spin here with the plot elaborated so that JOHNNY DEPP is not a timid schoolmaster but a constable given the assignment to investigate the brutal murders taking place in Sleepy Hollow.Depp is marvelous in the role and it's easy to see why he was Oscar nominated. MIRANDA RICHARDSON is outstanding in the large supporting cast and Christina RICCI, while improbably cast as Katrina, finally convinced me that she's an appealing actress.Danny Elfman's score contributes greatly to the mood of the piece, drumming up the excitement for all the action scenes, one of which includes a mad chase in the forest with Depp clinging to the back of a horse drawn carriage while sliding on the ground on his belly.As usual, Burton gets a chance to show buckets of blood, so the faint of heart may want to turn away for the gruesome moments--and there are plenty of them. But overall, a very impressive film with expert costume designs and muted visuals that capture the right feel for this kind of story.Burton's elaborate revision really works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few bumps but will please any Burton fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ichabod Crane (Depp) ventures to Sleepy Hollow, a place of frequent murders by the apparent legend of the Headless Horseman and soon Crane finds himself deeper than his intention.The visionary director of darkness Tim Burton delivers another darkly stunning stroke of a creepy legend that sees Johnny Depp star as a detective investigating the strange happenings at the uncomfortable settings of Sleepy Hollow.Based on Washington Irving's story, Burton's 1999 take is dark and grizzly with his typical dark styling any fan would love. The design and shots of the Hollow are typically haunting and exudes the moment in the script to be sharp and interesting, giving audiences the occasional jump along with awe at the accomplishment of the idea of a mass murderer in Burton's wonderland.Since he launched on our screens in the 1980's the director has certainly created a vivid depiction of happy is sad and sad is happy with a florescent wave of dark semiotics and appreciation of the story, Edward Scissorhands and Beetle juice stand outs.Here, with the story arguably one of the darkest he has ever tackled bar Sweeney Todd, we see him take up a more action orientated agenda. Chases in woods on horseback, spooky magic connotations and deathly sword swipes give a strong vibe of excitement and bliss to fill the room with engaged faces.There are a few drawbacks to this motive, particularly given the story's intentions. For one, the opening stages with Crane in court and then riding towards the Hollow is all very formal and rather drab and then encoding spurts of action in the story's moment doesn't feel quite right. One example would be when in the forest and Crane goes inside the tree trunk and the bizarre happenings in there feel disorientated in the plot's motive to suss out the villain.Marginally Burton salvages these with the wonderfully shot action moments anyway but the feeling of the story is never quite right in its overall intention as a crime and with horror to justify, there was too much ambition intended.Depp, like in From Hell, puts on a brave accent that, whilst articulate, doesn't get away from his character being incredibly frustrating to watch. The nervous and confused detective is often misbalanced through dissecting a body then crying over a spider that won't give any edgy viewers confidence.Not that there are too many frights anyway, which given the story of a headless serial killer, is a shame.The supporting cast of Ricci, Gambon and Richardson do the necessities of back filling historical foundation well enough and Danny Elfman's score once more is inch perfect.Given the promise it is a slight let down but regardless Burton carves up glorious set design and action that will please his army of fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp stars as Icabod Crane in a fantastic re imagining of Sleepy hollow. Sleepy hollow is a scary film that doesn't even care if it breaks rules. For instance, children in this film are murdered. Now how often do you see that in a horror film? Not often because Burton isn't like any other film director. He has no horror film rules. He does it the way he wants it. That is the way a lot of directors do it. Sleepy hollow is loosely based on Washington Irving's story. I can't remember the name cause it's very long. Icabod Crane(Played by Johnny Depp) is sent down to the town of Sleepy hollow to investigate a few murders. He soon finds out that there are from a guy named the Headless horseman. It's pretty obvious why they call him that. Soon enough Icabod finds out some shocking facts. Some of the stuff being sexual. Other stuff, well, betrayal.Burton has taken a short classic and turned it into something scary. The film has it's share in blood. Lots and lots of blood. Sleepy hollow is a creative movie. With a lot of twists. I left out a character. Katrina Van Tassel(played by Christina Ricci) is the love interest. There are a lot of other celebs. Like Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman. This film is very creative. Filled with a few unexpected twists involved. I love horror films like this because I am, sure I would run from this guy. If I was getting chased by Scream, I probably wouldn't be too frightened. Tim Burton's Sleepy hollow will frighten you no matter who you are.Sleepy hollow:****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure exactly what to say here. Wait... yes I do. This movie is absolutely creepy! The script is well-written, the actors do a very good job, and the suspense just kills me. Well, not literally though. I also thought the costumes were top notch. I mean, the costume designer must have worked 24/7 on them. An honourable mention goes to Danny Elfman, who has done another fantastic job on the music. May your career live on for the rest of you life, Mr. Elfman. One caution though: I *highly* recommend that you keep your young children away from this film. My little sister was at a sleepover with her youth group, and I'm glad she didn't see this. Otherwise, she would have screamed at the sight of blood splattering all over the floor. If you can stand the sight of blood, and if you love being scared, this is the movie for you. I should warn you though: this is pretty tame for a slasher flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More from Burton's bag of tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sleepy Hollow' is right up Tim Burton's alley and he's made a visually beautiful and gripping film of it. I'm not sure why he decided to make Ichabod Crane such a wuss but Johnny Depp's interpretation of the character has charm and mild pathos which make for a rounded believable character and displays Crane's queasiness about blood and decapitated bodies without making him a city sissy. The cinematography is the most beautiful in any of Burton's films, all sepia and silver-toned grays. I'm not sure how much (if any) of this was filmed in the Hudson Valley of NY but it certainly looks real enough in the outdoor scenes. The studio sets are obvious enough when Burton's signature gnarled, beast-like trees start popping up in the landscape, and as usual the sets are just as beautiful and fascinating as the spooky woods surrounding Sleepy Hollow.Elfman's scores are always great enhancements to Burton's films and this one is one of his better and more hard-hitting compositions, but still with the charm of boy sopranos and eerie violins at the top of their range.The cast is stellar, as in full of stars, English mostly, who will be familiar to film buffs who watch a lot of BBC and Masterpiece Theatre as well as feature films from the U.K. They are all so good that none stand out above the others. Unfortunately Christina Ricci, as the romantic heroine, is not up to the same level simply because she's too modern in her delivery. She looks great but she delivers many of her lines in a quick and robotic manner that jars after so much eloquence from her colleagues, occasionally speaking so fast that she slurs her words together and is almost unintelligible if your not listening closely. But she is not exactly a detraction, simply a cut below the others. I'm still waiting for Burton's perfect nightmare legend to hit the screen. The upcoming 'Alice in Wonderland' looks like it is animation so I don't think it will be the ONE. Sometimes I think Burton might do well to do a couple of remakes, like the Invisible Man or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or maybe even Dracula... ALL with Johnny Depp!This is a very good movie but not for young children. The blood and chopped heads are typically Burton-style and not sickening but the abundance of both do have a cumulative effect, especially as its a veritable blood bath at the end.Not one of his greats, those kudos go to 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Big Fish', but it is one of his better films, and the visual aspects of it are splendid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A highly unusual film by Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a great example of an entertaining film which takes us all back into past times where it was absolutely impossible to provide a rational explanation regarding certain obscure,occult events. This film is set in a time when murders were a common event and it was practically impossible to get hold of the criminal.It must be stated that it is a pure coincidence that this Tim Burton film shares a lot of stylistic similarities with a famous yet not so well known French film "Un Roi Sans Divertissement" directed by Franois Leterrier.It is difficult to say which of the two films is better but due to the advent of huge media publicity,it can rightly be assumed that Tim Burton's film made in 1999 appealed to more people then that of Franois Leterrier's film made in 1963.Sleepy Hollow would turn out to be an important film for all the admirers of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton as it will give them a good idea of how both of them prepared for their future individual endeavors "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street".A must for all the lovers of Jean Giono and Washington Irving</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is the third collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Depp plays Ichabod Crane in a NYC police officer in 1799. He gets sent on leave for speaking out in court to a place called Sleepy Hollow, a creepy little town in upstate New York. While there, he investigates a series of gruesome be-headings. The townsfolk say it is the work of the Headless Horseman, a Hessian mercenary who was killed in the winter in '79 and is brought back from the grave for vengeful purposes. Depp is great at putting up a stoic front for someone who is essentially....a sissy. Christina Ricci is also quite good in the film, but one of the down points of the movie was her annoying accent. The movie doesn't skimp on dazzling effects and set pieces and the film is actually quite exciting. With Sleepy Hollow, Tim Burton has crafted a perfect horror movie for late night viewing. It can easily be enjoyed....aside from Ricci's accent. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun pastiche of Hammer horror, Poe, Irving and others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to love Tim Burton. Being a sf/fantasy/comics freak from childhood on, Burton was one of the few Hollywood filmmakers separate from the Lucas/Spielberg axis who was making stuff that I could always count on seeing with my non-film buff friends who were into the same sort of genre stuff I was. Loved "Edward Scissorhands", "Beetlejuice", and "Ed Wood", and always looked forward to what came next.But in the past decade or so he's disappointed more often than not. His "Planet of the Apes" remake was an abortion, and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", while not terrible, didn't seem necessary or particularly necessary either. "Sweeney Todd" was a little bit better, but still didn't make me particular worry about having missed a couple of his more recent works. I caught up to one of those the other night though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified."Sleepy Hollow", first of all, has very little to do with the Washington Irving story which it is "based on" according to the credits. "Inspired by" might be more accurate, and the film takes equal inspiration from the works of Edgar Allan Poe (specifically his prototypical detective character, Dupin) and Hammer horror films from the late 50s and early 60s - going so far as to cast Christopher Lee in a small role at the beginning of the film.The cast is certainly a big, big part of the fun here, with such wonderful character veterans as Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Martin Landau and Christopher Walken all getting juicy (if generally small) turns in this story of a New York police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), with "advanced" ideas being sent (more or less as punishment) to the small Hudson valley town of Sleepy Hollow to deal with a series of gruesome beheadings, in 1799. As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).It's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic. My only real problem with it comes in the ending, which is too much like a Scooby Doo "aha, I've got you now" episode; most of the film managed to keep me guessing at least a little bit but the finale is all too typical. Oh well; this is certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while, and there's even some interesting stuff below the surface - the whole colonial/witch-haunted/Protestant New England of the 17th-18th centuries brushing up against the coming of modern science and the Industrial Revolution and secularism is quite expertly handled, though it never gets in the way of a good old-fashioned story. Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd-favorite Burton film at the moment after "Ed Wood".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow Directed by Tim burton. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker. Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken. Music by Danny Elfma, Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki, Edited by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron.Johnny Depp shines in this film about the haunting story of the headless horseman. Both him and Christina Ricci do well in this stylistic period thriller, which is successful, because its original, fresh, and despite the dialogue which is heavy, its still entertaining throughout. The acting and atmosphere is what sets it apart from mediocre films of its kind. This movie is suspenseful because the music, cinematography and acting all contribute to keep it frightening, yet compelling. Another solid Johnny Depp performance and film. At times it seemed a bit long, but the third act picks up the pace and does well to finish off strong. I would have liked the build-up to be a bit better, but unlike a lot of films that fall apart trying to finish the story, this film does the opposite and doesn't do the best job setting up the plot, but the final 25 minutes or so are very good. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Instant Classic of Horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, Tim Burton is an artist. He has proved that when he brought us Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands. This time he outdoes himself with Sleepy Hollow. He brings back that Gothic horror from the Hammer Films, but with a fairy tale fell to it. Sleepy Hollow is set in the 1800 and tells the story of Ichabod Crane (played by Jonny Depp), an odd, open minded New York constable who is sent to investigate mysterious murders in a small village known as Sleepy Hollow. Crane relies on weird gadgets and sometimes odd theories to solve crimes, but this time he will face a supernatural force he had never come across, The Dreaded Headless Horseman. This movie is a master piece and has one of the most beautiful set designs I have ever seen. Christopher Walken and Ray Park (Darth Maul) give life to the Headless Horseman. Also, Christopher Lee makes a guest appearance at the beginning of the movie. The plot is great, the cast is phenomenal, and the photography is gorgeous. This movie is among one of my favorite smart and entertaining horror films. If you haven't seen it and you like classic horror film like the Hammer Films productions from the 50s and 60s you will love this one.</fullReview>

Whats special about depp's character is that he displays bravery and at the same time succumbs to fear . This results in classic gallows humor . The locations are classy . Costumes are truly Victorian and the the background music gives a creepy touch . On the other hand Christina ricci proves to be the perfect cast as katrina in this movie based on Washington Irving's novel. But ultimately its Depp who steals the show</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton and Horror is a (Super)Natural Combination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent away from New York City to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, where he can use his unorthodox detective skills without bothering anybody... and maybe solve a murder along the way. What he stumbles on is not just any murder, but an ongoing killing spree of epic proportions.Anyone who is familiar with Tim Burton's work is going to wonder why he doesn't do more horror films. "Ed Wood", "Edward Scissorhands", "Nightmare Before Christmas", "Sweeney Todd", and others have that dark vibe... even his Batman films were rather dark compared to other incarnations. How can this be his only true horror flick? It is done so well.And, of course, he wasn't alone... this is the product of skilled people across the board. It was written by Andrew Kevin Walker ("Brainscan", "Seven", "8MM") and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, two horror veterans that are never bad to have around.The cast? Ricci, Depp, Walken, Lee, Jeff Jones... each one could get a paragraph of praise. I don't know that this is the best work of either Ricci or Depp, but even their less than best work is better and more entertaining than most others in the acting profession today. And together? A dream come true, if you're a Ricci fan -- Depp already knows how to interact with Burton, so that's a given.The film itself is great in the art department, lighting, cinematography... more or less in every way. It's a very polished, very artsy film. What you may not notice is the use of forced perspective, which I think they hid very well. Most of the outdoor shots were actually shot on set, so if you pay close attention you'll notice that you can never see too far back or too far in the sky... and camera angles were chosen to skew distances. It's a clever tactic and works.The film's audio commentary with Tim Burton is slightly disappointing, and not nearly as good as the film itself. He talks about the difficulty in finding cardinals, and jokes about Dutch masters, but doesn't offer as much insight as you may expect from a director. Many commentaries have a steady discussion going, but Burton seems comfortable to stay silent often and just watch his own film. If this film ever gets deluxe treatment, hopefully a second commentary is added because Burton -- as soothing as his voice is -- can't do it alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is an incredibly fun and nearly flawless slasher.**SPOILERS**After a series of strange deaths, Constable Ichabod Crane, (Johnny Depp) is sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the strange murders. Starting the investigation with Baltus Van Tassel, (Michael Gambon) and his family, Lady Mary, (Miranda Richardson) and Katrina, (Christina Ricci) before turning to the other members of town, Brom Van Brunt, (Casper Van Dien) Reverend Steenwyck, (Jeffrey Jones) Magistrate Samuel Phillips, (Richard Griffiths) Dr. Thomas Lancaster, (Ian McDiarmid) and Notary James Hardenbrook, (Michael Gough) who all seem to have a strange connection with each other that goes back generations in the town, and who regale him with stories about an undead headless horseman who is the culprit in the murders. Unwilling to believe such stories, the murders continue and eventually he is forced to accept that the stories are true and that there's a more sinister reason for the rampage, putting him and the rest of the town in severe danger from the ravenous killer.The Good News: There was a lot of stuff to enjoy with this one. One of the film's best features is that there's an incredible look to the film which makes it incredibly fun to watch. The town here looks incredible, from the town being completely enveloped in darkness that gives it an eerie, claustrophobic feeling of evil surrounding everything and everywhere, and the muddy landscapes and weather-beaten surroundings do add immensely to that feeling. Perhaps the best example of that is the woods surrounding the town, which are just incredibly spectacular and worthwhile in creating an impressive atmosphere. From the look of death on the trees to the thick, heavy fog bank that overhangs the ground constantly throughout the entire film and adds an extra dimension to it all with it's atmosphere. Even more visual prowess comes from it's locations, as the different areas in the forest represented, from the Tree of the Dead to the witch's cave and the burned out shack are just fantastic-looking places that work wonders here. The fact that the killer here manages to get a lot of good stuff about it works quite well. From the imposing appearance to the fantastic back-story to the proclivity to decapitation and the different rules about his behavior, it has a lot going for the killer here and he manages to steal many scenes because of who he is. The first scene, where he attacks a couple on a carriage without being seen, is a masterpiece and a later scene where he is confronted by a couple of swordsmen after performing a task, resulting in a rather well-done and exciting fight with the weapons that ends in graphic bloodshed, but everything before it is so good that there's a lot to like about the scene. Pretty much most of the scenes here are just a blast and there's not much that can be wrong for this. The fact that there's a lot more action scenes here than expected, and that really helps the movie hugely. From the chase through the woods with the two horses and the different ways that are brought up from the killer chasing them, to the great finale that gets a lot right about it, this one has some fantastic action scenes in here. In the finale is the best, from the great showdown at the windmill that results in some really explosive action to the fantastic, full-on carriage chase and brawl atop it as it's moving along that works fantastically, this one has a great ending and works really well. The last good plus here is the film's body count, which provides plenty of good stuff about it. This one is mostly built around tons of gags for decapitations, which mostly work well, but there's also other great deaths as one is sliced in half with an ax, stabbed in the leg with a large knife, impaled through the chest with a pointed white picket fence and stabbed with large wooden poles, among other deaths in here that give a fantastic body count. These here are the film's good points.The Bad News: There was hardly anything not to like about this one. One of it's only flaws is the fact that there's a rather convoluted and really more in-depth than required back-story here. There's a point where having too much doesn't really help a film but rather harms it because spelling everything out either contradicts something known previously or it seems thrown in for a twist when there's no reason to add one, which is what happens here. This one here works so much better as a film about a horseman killing townspeople in a remote village, but everything with the village elders and the secret-keeping and the twist and betrayal at the end just overly complicates the film for no reason and really could've been simplified here or dropped altogether. That, coupled with the fact that some might be put off by the fantastical elements that creep in during the finale, are the film's real flaws.The Final Verdict: With a lot of great stuff to this one and only minor, barely-detrimental flaws to hold it down, this is an incredible film. Highly recommended to those who likes visually-stylish horror films, the old-school Hammer films or of the creative crew, while those who don't should heed caution.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A love letter to the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow runs a close second to Ed Wood as my favorite Tim Burton film so far, and represents perhaps the quintessential "Tim Burton-as-brand-name" experience. To date it is his only genuine horror film, though it tends to run much closer to tongue-in-cheek black comedy, and as such serves as something of a coat rack onto which Burton hangs the dark fabrics of horror films stretching back a full century. The (rather obvious) use of sound stages and the economy of imagery reminds one of silent films such as Nosferatu or the John Barrymore version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, along with a visual scheme that is often almost monochromatic in its use of sepia tones, dark blues, and blacks and whites. The copious, and sometimes ludicrous, splattering of blood against pretty much every clean surface brings to mind the orgiastic excess of grue that characterized slasher films of the eighties. The lavish set design and the abundance of fog and mist, along with the "inspector" element of the story (and the casting of Christopher Lee in a minor role), pay tribute to the Hammer films of the fifties and sixties, particularly those helmed by stylish Technicolor maven Terence Fisher.Probably the biggest influence on Burton's style, however, is the late Mario Bava, a cult figure whose visually sumptuous low-budget films of the sixties and seventies have been worshiped by filmmakers as diverse as John Landis, Dario Argento, Edgar Wright, Joe Dante, and Quentin Tarantino (but is otherwise relatively, and regrettably, unknown, even in his native Italy). Most apparently reflected in Sleepy Hollow are Bava's Gothic chillers, Black Sunday and Kill, Baby...Kill! Bava, often criticized as a "style over substance" director who cared more about the way his films looked than about story or characterization (a charge often, and probably not coincidentally, leveled at Burton), was a master of mood, with the ability to charge even the most heinous act of murder with a psychosexual beauty, and the knack for soaking even the thinnest plot in an atmosphere that is erotic, gorgeous, and unnerving.Bava's sensibilities are also reflected in the film's quirky sense of humor as well, which makes use of a fantastic cast. Michael Gambon, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Richard Griffiths, as key members of the community who have a connection with the mystery at the heart of the Headless Horseman murders, all turn up the eccentricity level to 11, with Johnny Depp fearlessly leading the way as the strangely effeminate inspector, Ichabod Crane, sent to investigate the rash of recent murders in a superstitious New England town. Crane is certainly an unconventional action hero--he faints no less than four times throughout the film--and yet his squeamish prissiness works superbly within the off-kilter execution of this dark fairy tale. Who else but Johnny Depp could have played this role? Katrina Van Tassel, as portrayed by Christina Ricci, is a somewhat underdeveloped love interest, but she's got enough courage and heart to keep from fading into the background, and her purity and virtue actually keep her sympathetic as opposed to boring or self-righteous. Another stand-out is Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, sort of the Robin to Ichabod's Batman. A preteen sidekick could have potentially become a desperate and annoying bid for the attention of the high school demographic, but the character both as written and as played by Pickering steers clear of the usual clichs to become just as interesting, funny, and worthwhile as everyone else. And, needless to say, Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken are equally fascinating and fun to watch in their respective roles, and former Burton fiance Lisa Marie has just the right "Women of '60s Horror" look to her in a small but pivotal role as Ichabod's mother.Odds and ends: Kevin Yagher's special effects work here is astonishing. The decapitated heads, even when seen in close up, are phenomenally realistic, more so even than in many films that have come out in the decade since. (Yagher, incidentally, was on board to direct the project in its early stages.) Danny Elfman's score, as usual, is fantastic, hitting all the right notes of portent, eerie grandiosity, and excitement. The cinematography, by frequent Alfonso Cuaron collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, is gorgeous, and Colleen Atwood does her usual stellar work as Costume Designer. Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard, most famous at the time for his choreography on The Phantom Menace, helps bring to life some fantastic action set pieces that somehow manage to stay within the boundaries of a Gothic horror piece. And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the script by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker. Of course, fans of Washington Irving's original short story may not share my enthusiasm, since Walker discards Irving's themes and decides that the Headless Horseman really is supernatural (and who can blame him, since most of us forget the bones of Irving's story anyway and only remember the ghostly apparition that didn't actually exist).All in all, Sleepy Hollow is a supreme fright flick, entirely appropriate for any rainy day or spooky night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Irving's Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of Washington Irving's classic scary story, but I was surprised to see that it was being made into a full-length movie, because the actual book is under 150 pages. Watching it, I expected to see a timid, superstitious schoolmaster named Ichabod Crane. However, I am displeased to find it is a constable sent from New York to investigate murders. This is simply laughable. Johnny Depp's performance was mediocre; it was simply Jack Sparrow in 17th century New York. However, this movie did have some good parts. First off, the setting and set creation was extraordinary. The eerily creepy Sleepy Hollow was exactly the way Washington Irving imagined it. The costumes were great. And although I do hate Kevin Yagher for ruining the plot of the story, the dialogue was believable and well-written. Tim Burton did not disappoint with his direction, although some scenes could have been better. All in all, if you are a fan of the book, you will not be seeing the original story. Just a terrible rip-off involving a legendary character, the Headless Horseman (who looked incredible).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Of A Murder Mystery Than A Horror Movie - And A Pretty Good One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being totally unfamiliar with the original story by Washington Irving (all that I knew about it was the obvious fact that it featured a headless horseman) I waded into this movie with no preconceived notions and no expectations of what was going to happen. The end result was a pretty enjoyable ghost story. Johnny Depp seemed perfectly cast here as Ichabod Crane - the New York City policeman (sort of a Sherlock Holmes-type) who gets sent to the sleepy village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to help investigate a series of murders in which the victims' heads have been cut off and never found. It was a typical quirky sort of role for Depp, who's teamed again with director Tim Burton. Crane wades straight into the legend of a Hessian soldier beheaded during the Revolution who now haunts Sleepy Hollow until his head is returned to him. The mystery is around who he chooses to kill and why he chooses them.That mystery is pretty well put together, although a bit confusing at times, and while it does all make perfect sense in the end, I had absolutely no idea who the person responsible for the horseman's killings was going to be. I did make a guess and it turned out to be wrong. As always, Tim Burton puts together a perfect blend of story and atmosphere that makes the movie very realistic to watch, and the special effects are very well done. Although the murders are graphically depicted, they're not especially bloody considering that they feature beheadings (especially compared to, say, the bloody gore of Burton's "Sweeney Todd," which also featured Depp) and I would tend to call this a murder mystery rather than a horror movie as it's suspenseful rather than frightening. Enjoyable though it was, I found there was a period in the middle when the story seemed to lose its hold on me and I had to force myself to concentrate on it, and I'm not really sure why. I also thought Crane's arrival in Sleepy Hollow - an isolated 18th century town in which most everyone is related to everyone (a point made later in the movie) was accepted a bit too nonchalantly, given that he was a complete stranger, and small towns - even today - tend to view strangers (especially city folk) with some sense of suspicion. That may be considered by some to be an unimportant detail, but I did notice it, and it caused me to question the story's credibility from the start. Still, it's a pretty good piece of work by all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside Tim Burton's strange, nightmare, Gothic world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching "Sleepy Hollow" I was struck by certain similarities between Tim Burton's work and some of Terry Gilliam's films such as "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" and "The Brothers Grimm". Both directors have a vivid visual imagination and a good eye for a striking image. Both are fascinated by myth and legend and by the clash between Classical reason and the Romantic imagination. It is noteworthy that "Sleepy Hollow" takes place in 1799/1800, just as the eighteenth century, the Age of Reason, is giving way to the nineteenth, the Age of Romanticism. The film is very loosely based upon Washington Irving's story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". New York police constable Ichabod Crane is sent by his superiors to the upstate village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders in which the victims have been found decapitated. He is informed by the local people that the killings have been not been carried out by any flesh-and-blood human but by a mysterious Headless Horseman, believed to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier killed during the War of Independence. Ichabod dismisses such tales as mere superstition, as he is a rationalist with no belief in the supernatural and a great belief in modern, scientific methods of police investigation. He suspects that the village's richest citizen, Baltus van Tassel, might be behind the murders, which is unfortunate as he has fallen in love with Baltus's daughter Katrina. As his investigations continue, however, and several more killings take place, he is forced to conclude that something supernatural might be occurring, that the Headless Horseman is real and that someone might be controlling him.Despite the film's American setting, it was actually filmed in Britain, with numerous British actors such as Sir Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and Richard Griffiths in the cast. (Like Gilliam, Burton appears to be something of an Anglophile). The strongest influences on the film were the horror films produced by Hammer Film Productions in the sixties and seventies; Christopher Lee, who starred in many of those films, has a cameo appearance here. The village of Sleepy Hollow, with its half-timbered houses, is more reminiscent of the sort of fantasy Mittel-Europa seen in Hammer films like "Twins of Evil" than it is of colonial America; this look may also have inspired the village seen in "The Brothers Grimm". The film has its weaknesses. The plot is little more than standard Hammer fare and the acting, at least in the leading roles, is not always of the highest quality. I have admired Christina Ricci in some of her other roles, such as "The Opposite of Sex" and "Monster" (a film I did not otherwise care for), but here, as Katrina, she seems too deadpan, never showing much emotion even when people, including members of her family, are killed in front of her. Johnny Depp always seemed too fey and effeminate. He stated that he always thought of Ichabod "as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl", but this characterisation makes it difficult to believe in Ichabod as a courageous action hero, which he develops into in the latter part of the film. This was the third film collaboration between Depp and Burton, but I must say that I preferred his performances in "Edward Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood". "Sleepy Hollow's" greatest strength is its distinctive visual style. Although most Hammer films were made in lurid colour, Burton apparently contemplated shooting the film in black and white. This idea was later abandoned, but the look of the finished film is almost monochromatic with a colour scheme dominated by blacks and dark greys and few bright tones other than the red of the blood. (Len Wiseman was to attempt a similar look in "Underworld"). The idea was to give the film an eerie, otherworldly, look, and Burton succeeds well in this aim. He takes us inside a strange, nightmare Gothic world, a world of headless horsemen, of trees of the dead and of haunted windmills, a world of graphic violence leavened by a certain grim humour. It is the sort of film where style is indeed more important than substance, and style is something it has in plenty. I would not, however, rate it as highly as Burton's best films, such as "Edward Scissorhands" and "Big Fish", where he combines his distinctive visual style with material of greater substance than anything in "Sleepy Hollow". 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ichabod Crane: "It was an evil spirit possessed you. I pray God it is satisfied now, and you find peace. The evil eye has done it's work; my life is over, spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep, waking each day to grief. Goodbye, Katrina." In the early United States of America, young policeman Ichabod Crane is sent to from New York to the fledgling settlement of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of ghoulish murders. On his arrival, the town council informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman - it is the ghost of a Hessian sent by the British during the revolutionary war, and he was caught by redcoats and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates - and he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Balthus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer - and whose daughter Ichabod is falling in love with...I knew this film would be good before I even got to see it well for starters, its a Johnny Depp-Tim Burton collaboration who has made several films together and almost all of them, quite impressive. This one is another one of those impressive films by said collaborators. The magic of the Depp-Burton killer combo works really well when they're making dark, brooding films and the vibe alone will make you shiver. They did it with Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd. This film is no different. Tim Burton's vision is pretty amazing when put on screen.From the enormous sets built to the small details in the costumes and the masterful screenplay by Kevin Yagher, add to that Johnny Depp's commitment to the lead role and you get a pretty amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been one of these girls who go all ga-ga when they pass Johnny Depp memorabilia in shopping malls. Like him as an actor, but he's not my idea of beautiful (don't throw stones at me!) Yet, I must say, I was "enchanted," to say the least, seeing Depp play this sweet, mild-mannered, quirky, terrified, and heroic (in the under-dog way) character, Ichabod Crane.For those of us who have actually read Washington Irving's novel prior to seeing the film, it is NOT the same story...No spoilers, I promise, but one thing I truly love about this film is the quiet little romance subtly weaving through the entire film: Ichabod and Katrina. I never realized to the full extent the intriguing beauty of Christina Ricci until this film. She expels a sort of Catherine-Linton-aura about her, which makes her bashfully breathtaking. I love the quiet courtship that goes on between the two characters.That is why I classify this as a love story. A love story behind a bizarre and bloody nightmare that IS Tim Burton, and my number one favorite Johnny Depp film.</fullReview>

Although they altered the story, like the headless horseman cant cross the bridge in the book, he does here, don't really care gives it more suspense. The opening scene kinda reminds you of Sweeney Todd, and when he lets the bird go, that reminds me of the street scenes from Sweeney Todd.Well written and done, im still watching this now, and i know that i won't be disappointed .

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's take on the classic Washington Irving story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I get a nack for literary movies, even from the classic horror novels, with literature's famous monsters : Count Dracula, The Frankenstien Monster, Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, The Phantom of The Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and...The Headless Horseman. Also I love Tim Burton's films, I have a few of them actually. Out of the versions of this classic Washington Irving story, I love both the Disney animated version narrated (and sang) by Bing Crosby and this gruesome, Gothic film version starring two of my favorite actors - Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.In this version, Ichabod Crane is a constable from New York in 1799, who is most concerned with all the new scientific gadgets that will allow him to do his job better. However, he is quite squeamish about his latest assignment: traveling to the town of Sleepy Hollow, where there have been a series of murders involving people whose heads have been cut off. Upon his arrival, the four town elders informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman. It is the ghost of a vicious Hessian sent to aid the British during the revolutionary war, and he was caught by revolutionaries and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates. And then, he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Baltus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer - and whose daughter (Katerina), he is falling in love with.Overall, this is an awesome film. Johnny gives it wit, humour and charm. This film is also great for the October month, close to Halloween...or any month</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Tim Burton.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is visually stunning, filled with great sets and a perfect mood to capture the horror and creepiness of the situation. Tim Burton is a master of this genre, and he uses his skills with special effects to give some really effective scenes involving the Headless Horseman chasing down people and taking their heads. What is different about Washington Irving's legend is the story. Burton takes the famed character Ichabod Crane, and turns him from a gangly, unsightly school teacher to a mild-mannered, handsome constable who wants to use modern-day techniques to discover murderers and cause of death. Johnny Depp is very good, as usual, playing Crane as a smart intellectual who sometimes lets his fears and emotions get in the way of his work. Christina Ricci is good as well, but looks to be about only 12 here. What doesn't work here, like many of Burton's films, is the story. The opening quarter is very scary and suspenseful and pulls you right in. The last fifteen minutes or so really drop off and don't really take the audience any further. I was expecting a bigger twist here, since this is done by the man who wrote Se7ven. Still, this is a scary thrill-ride that feeds the emotions but not the brain. If only Burton would start doing that, he might be one of the best in Hollywood instead of one of the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a die hard fan of Washington Irving's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. This is based on that story but just barely. I would call it an original story with the same names and some of the same back stories. If you want to see an exact adaptation of the story, you will be sadly disappointed but if you're looking for a great horror film from Tim Burton, there is no way you will have any problem with this. I would say it's one of his best films.Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp), an investigator sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow where a number of bizarre deaths involving decapitation have taken place, comes across Katrina Van Tassel(Christina Ricci), Baltus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon) and The Headless Horseman(Christopher Walken). As you can see, the cast is awesome and there are many more awesome stars other than the ones I have mentioned. The story is very creepy and intense the entire way through. There are also some great special effects and the gore is absolutely spot on. Tim Burton has become one of my all time favorite directors and this is definitely one of the movies that put him in that spot for me. His direction is amazing.As I said earlier, you're going to hate this film if you want it to follow the original story. However, it is a great movie on its own and that's exactly the way it should be watched. The Horseman comes, and tonight, he comes for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns, director Tim Burton reinvents Washington Irving's "Sleepy Hollow" into a rapid horror journey where no time is wasted after the credits roll into screen.Excuse the pun when I said roll, but heads will be rolling.After a series of murders in a small community in Sleepy Hollow, the people summon officer Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) to investigate the murders in the area where hopefully his eccentric techniques will help get the case solved. Along with way, Ichabod hears stories of a dead soldier by the name of Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) with many of the townspeople (Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough, Richard Griffith) telling him that maybe the dead rider has come back to claim the heads of even more victims after his death. Ichabod befriends a fatherless boy while meeting with Katrina Van Tussel (Christina Ricci) who develops a small crush on the cop and does her best to aid him."Sleepy Hollow" is not only a Tim Burton movie filled with various trademarks and eccentricities among the characters, but feels more alive with the visual effects and the background setting. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the hero where he portrays an early version of Captain Jack Sparrow before donning the pirate suit; Christina Ricci is a marvel as the damsel in distress, but the real hero is Tim Burton for making this great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This DVD is worth the purchase just for the striking cinematography and visual imagery of this macabre film. Tim Burton uses all of his best elements in this supernatural thriller, the result being a slightly over the top but exceptional comedy horror fest.Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, a young, fidgety and eccentric forensics expert who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow to uncover its nasty secrets. At night, a cloaked figure on a massive black horse is stalking and murdering a seemingly random string of the town's residents, and clearly has no intention of stopping unless Crane can solve the mystery.The town is a series of stunning old fashioned architectures and is shot in a gloomy, dense fog. All in supreme Tim Burton fashion, the visuals and special effects especially stand out in "Hollow". Another intriguing aspect is Christina Ricci as the pale, beautiful girl Katrina Von Tassel, who aids Ichabod in his quest for the truth- and survival.Although it all sounds dark and it is, with loads of blood splattered over it (tastefully), the whole film has a heavy undertone of black humor and it never takes itself too seriously. When the horseman cuts off heads, they spin around before hitting the ground. How seriously can you take it? All around this a jolting atmospheric horror comedy which boasts loads of Tim Burton's creative style and spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton was made for Sleepy Hollow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's entire career has been based on films that provide the paradox of a hauntingly magical style. I believe that Sleepy Hollow can be described as the perfect Tim Burton picture in the sense that it captures everything that comes to mind when you think of the man. The Gothic style, haunting ambiance, bizarre and wickedly charismatic humor and a sense that you're living in a dark fairy tale for a few hours. It stays morbidly entertaining all the way throughout and never fails at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Burton crafts another phenomenal work that utterly defines his unique style.Everyone knows the story of the Headless Horseman from their childhood, but this takes a much darker and necessary tone to the tale than seen before. The technical aspects of the feature certainly help to achieve this and create wonders for the eye to behold. The sets are vast and glorious, creating that perfectly Gothic ambiance and almost Wicker Man-esquire eeriness. In fact the entire film has a lot of similarities with The Wicker Man from the supernatural ideals to the suspense of knowing that something is going on that is much bigger than what we believe. The cinematography, costumes and visuals all add to create a poetically dreary experience that is sure to please in every element.Burton also shows his strong ability in the casting category. The choice of Depp for the leading role of Ichabod Crane (a character who was portrayed as brutally unattractive in the story) is an odd one at first glance, but the decision to show his flaws through personality made Depp the perfect man to nail this one. I've always thought that the contrast between Ichabod and the Horseman is an interesting one; Crane is a man who lives inside his head and seems bizarre to society, Horseman is a man with no head and strikes fear into society, and Depp certainly captures the quirky eccentricities and creates one of my favorite performances of his. Burton also showed his sense of humor through the casting, by picking out wildly charismatic men to play the leaders of the community (Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths being the two best examples). Miranda Richardson also delivers a fantastic performance and almost steals the show. All in all, a wickedly entertaining picture that is sure to delight through and through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a fantasy/horror rich on visuals and plot and featuring outstanding performances from all actors involved. Sleepy Hollow is Tim Burton's adaptation of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. This movie is a feast for the eyes from the spooky, Gothic-like town of Sleepy Hollow, the fog that is everywhere and the dark, foreboding woods where the Headless Horseman emerges from to claim his victims (and their head).Which brings me to the story, which is rich and packed full of twists. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is New York Police Constable sent to the farming village Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre and gruesome murders. The victims are decapitated and their heads taken. Here he meets and falls in love with Katrina van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of Baltus van Tassel (Michael Gambon), the head of the village. He also meets Reverand Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), Magistrate Philipse (Richard Griffiths), Doctor Lancaster (Ian McDiarmid) and Notary Hardenbrook (Michael Gough) who all tell him the story of the Headless Horseman, the villain who is responsible for our headless people.All of these actors, especially a troubled Johnny Depp and Christian Ricci, are excellent in their roles. The costumes the actors wore also need to complimented, they were excellent and they definitely deserved the Oscar nod they got. The special effects were excellent, with plenty of bloody decapitations and sword fights. Also on that note, the Headless Horseman was a very creepy, brutal character and portrayed very sinisterly by Christopher Walken when he had a head.Kudos must go to Burton for his direction, though. Without his style this movie would not have been half as good as it is. The dark, Gothic style really suited the story and the mood he created. Sleepy Hollow is highly recommended to anyone that loved Tim Burton, Johnny Depp or excellent fantasy/horror.4?/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up there with Burton's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say that this, along with Ed Wood, is among Tim Burton's two best films. Okay, along with Batman, among his THREE best films. It can be difficult to winnow down the best of Burton.Johnny Depp is fantastic as Ichabod Crane. He somehow manages to make Ichabod a seamless combination of solemn, mysterious, priggish, brave, fussy, humorous, and gentlemanly. I can't remember if Depp was nominated for any awards, but he definitely should've won a few.The rest of the cast, including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Gough, among others, is also first rate, with the possible exception of Christina Ricci. She certainly had the right look for the part of Katrina, the ethereally beautiful daughter of the most prominent family in Sleepy Hollow who intrigues Ichabod from first glance, but I found her acting to be a bit wooden. Ultimately that's of little consequence, though. This film had so much more going for it. Another beautiful score by Danny Elfman, a well-paced script, fantastically cartoonish special effects, Halloweenish atmosphere to spare, and a great uncredited psycho turn by Christopher Walken.I enjoy watching this one over and over again, especially 'round All Hallows Eve time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning version of Washington Irving novel with particular Tim Burton style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable version about known Washington Irving's novel, titled The legend of Sleepy Hollow. It concerns on Ichabod Crane(excellently personified by Johnny Depp). He's a N.Y. constable assigned to investigate brutal murders in a little town named Sleepy Hollow. Crane is housed by Balthus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon), whose beautiful daughter(Christina Ricci) falls in love for him. At the beginning Crane denies to believe that a rider without head committing the grisly killings, but he's early convinced when seeing the graphic evidence of his own hands. Meanwhile, wealthy authorities and rich proprietaries (Richard Griffiths,Ian McDiarmid,Michael Gough,Michael Gambon) from village reunite to planning and defending against the amazing beheaded creature.Finally, all it leads to an unexpected twist and breakthrough ending on what's happened before.This is an agreeable and effective film, still has shock value from grisly killings .It's proceeded with a Burton style and containing colorful images and wonderful dreams with Burtonized narrative. The movie is plenty on suspense, thriller, grisly terror and sensationalistic set pieces horror when the decapitations take place. Wide use of gore and now famous decapitation , for those who like this kind of things. Casting frankly extraordinary with several famous actors and exceptional secondary cast and special cameos by Martin Landau and Christopher Lee .Glimmer cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sensational musical score by Danny Elffman, both are Burton's usual. The film is lavishly produced by Francis Ford Coppola-Zeotrope studios- and Kevin Yagher-famous makeup expert- .The motion picture is marvellously directed with visual style and fair-play by the great Tim Burton. Rating : Magnificent flick and better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lush, gorgeous, glitteringly dark--a gloomy, misty landscape of twisted, black trees, and looming shadows--Sleepy Hollow is visually breathtaking. Budding directors, cinematographers, and set directors should be required to watch this film as a textbook study into how one establishes atmosphere. Elfman's score is a jewel as well, the perfect complement to all this visual mastery. At once sumptuous and ominous, brooding on horrors seen and horrors to come, it sets off the misty, haunted look of the thing perfectly.Beyond this, cast and casting are inspired--a wonderful gallery of oddly matched talents, note-perfect in their various roles. Depp is a strangely lovely Ichabod Crane, faithful, all the same, in spirit to the original: quirky, overwrought, his constant efforts to exude competence and confidence are continually undermined by the brutal reality that he is never more than a few short steps from becoming entirely unhinged by the wanton irrationality that abounds in this haunted rural corner of early America. This is Crane as a would-be man of science; uncomfortably finding himself on the trail of a headless ghost, he's determined nonetheless to rise to the challenge and see that justice is done. In his portrayal, Depp achieves a stammering, flustered delivery and gawky physicality that evoke the character perfectly. Ricci, for her part, is cast smartly half against type: playing a coolly beautiful, wide-eyed fairy tale princess, she brings a note of self-assurance and self-possession to the part that makes it as memorable as any of her more overtly dark roles: she's a heroine to complement Depp's Ichabod, composed where he's addled and alarmed, in her element where he's out of his depth. And yes, they do look awfully good together. Add to these principals a wonderfully mixed and matched stable of fine, nuanced English character actors, one icon of the horror genre and a few familiar old faces and favourites of Burton: Richardson, Lee, McDiarmid, Walken, Gambon, Jones, and there's some serious wattage on the screen, here, all generally put to very good use. There are some nice flashes of dark comedy, too, as you'd only expect from Burton. All of which makes the film, all in all, a fine mix of beautiful things.That's what's great about Sleepy Hollow; see it, if for nothing else, for all that mist and shadow--on the big screen or in the gorgeous HD DVD version, if you possibly can, for Burton works this canvas beautifully, and you do want to see it in all the detail you can. And see it for Depp and Ricci, Lee (in a cameo, technically, but it's a key one, and he makes every second count), and Richardson.There are, however, also more than a few weaker spots, here. Burton billed Sleepy Hollow as an homage to the classic Hammer horror films, and it does evoke that very feel, frequently--both for better and for worse. Yes, there's mist and mystery, a suggestion of supernatural dread lurking in every long shadow, and some reasonably affecting horror--but there's also a fairly liberal dash of fake blood (occasionally used for a nice comic effect, but then overused), and a little more latex gore than I've a taste for, personally. The failing is a common one in horror: the old 'too much on the screen/not enough left to the frightened imagination' problem. Having established that beautifully spooky, haunted atmosphere, Burton seems to think he can lean harder on it than he can, goes all kinetic and bloody, in the end, and the whole winds up a good notch or two more overt than it probably should have been, reveling just a little too much in the gore, and inevitably failing, therefore, to use it as powerfully as it might have to terrify. The horseman of the title itself, especially, though brilliantly menacing, initially, loses much of that menace as it becomes too familiar a presence on the screen, and this only gets worse and worse as the film proceeds. I found myself almost wishing Burton had had slightly less effective effects at his command: it might have helped, a little, if he'd been forced by technical limitations to keep his beloved whirling headless horseman o' death in the shadows a little more, let us be a little more afraid of what we can't see.All that said: yes, it's quite worth the time. Absolutely do see it. Against those weaknesses, the sheer dark beauty of the visuals and the general brilliance of the cast make it well worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant horror classic that never lets up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's put this in simple terms: Sleepy Hollow is pure Tim Burton at it's finest. The story revolves around the legendary Headless Horseman aka the Hessian, a merciless bounty hunter turned headless demonic psycho as he haunts a tiny town called Sleepy Hollow. It's up to Ichabod Crane and a few others to solve the mystery of him before he goes genocide on the whole town.The characters are very well conceived, the acting is amazing, and the story has some very interesting twists that were made Tim Burton style.There aren't many movies out there that compare to Sleepy Hollow and only Tim Burton can make it this damn good. If you are a true horror fan and you love a good story, gore, and Johnny Depp, you'll love Sleepy Hollow. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie about a terrible disease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnnie Depp Christina Ricci Sleepy Hollow is the stylish, nightmarish tale of one man's descent into the world of narcolepsy.Johnny Depp plays the title character, a New York detective who's life is turned upside down when he is stricken with the rare sleeping disorder. For those of you who don't know, narcolepsy causes the victim to suddenly fall asleep at random times, often when faced with sudden stress or excitement. It can happen anywhere: at the grocery store, while waiting in line at the bank, or during a top secret mission to assassinate a central American dictator.Depp's brilliant performance takes us deep into the realm of narcolepsy. Some will criticize the role, pointing out that Depp spends most of Sleepy Hollow's 3-hour running time snoozing. But even when sleeping, the actor is somehow able to spill forth the emotion that locks us into this story. It's not an actor up there, pretending to be sleeping. This man is really sleeping; you can feel it.The man's tale becomes more and more horrifying with time. The disorder disrupts every aspect of his life, including one sadly humiliating scene where he and his girl go bowling, and he falls asleep just as he's about to roll the ball, and goes flying. He eventually loses his driver's license, due to his disorder. From that point on, he is forced to ride horseback, bringing ridicule from those around him.Finally, near the end of the film, Depp suffers the most devastating symptom of narcolepsy. During the advanced stages of the disease, the vertebrae in the neck become so over-stressed that eventually the entire cranium dislodges and falls off the body. However, the heartless townspeople show no pity, instead mocking him by referring to him as "The Headless Horseman." I can only hope that this film brings some understanding and insight to this terrible disease, so that maybe the public will show more tolerance than the people in Sleepy Hollow did. I also think Oscar nominations should go to Depp, as well Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's granddaughter in the film.I give Sleepy Hollow two stars.**</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opening Journey to Sleepy Holow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the opening scenes, we see Ichabod Crane traveling to Sleepy Hollow along the Hudson River from downtown New-York. If it is indeed the Hudson River, then why does the Hudson River appear on the right side of his carriage instead of on his left side? I'm sure Ichabod didn't cross into New Jersey to travel to Sleepy Hollow! Not in 1799! Other than this one obvious mistake, I rather enjoyed the flick and intend on re-reading the book when I get a moment to do so. I have always enjoyed Tim Burton's films and hope to do so in the future. Plus, I can't wait to see the next Johnny Depp/Tim Burton masterpiece. I know it will be just as great as their other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Positives: Visually stunning- beautiful scenery and photograpy; unbelievable special effects; well played- for the melodramatic way it was presented; humorous moments along with the scary; and well...it's Johnny Depp!! Negatives: Actually, every not so great moment in the film can be wrapped in the shroud of "trying too hard". As a huge fan of suspense, but not gore, I think Burton went way too far trying to shock with gallons of blood instead of brain. Other than the name "Ichabod Crane", there is very little in the movie which resembles the original-and far scarier-Washington Irving story. It seemed that the goal of the show was to make the audience go, "EEWWW!", instead of hold its breath in fright. I realize some people are into gore...if that is the case then this is one you shouldn't miss. As for me, as a Depp fan- one viewing all the way through was enough. But I do pop in the DVD occasionally and skip through the spewing and squishing to Johnny's clever, sensitive, melodramatic Ichabod. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>do not show to children!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will be very disturbing to children: it not only shows about a dozen closeups of beheadings, but often makes the victim a parent who dies right in front of their kid. Paradoxically, the film may not be very scary for grownups, as each bloody shot is held just a little too long, enough to put it in the realm of silliness, and Burton seems to have forgotten anything he might previously have known about suspense or the power of suggesting an event, rather than showing it outright. He seems to prefer just making things gross, and the heavy foreshadowing leaves the audience simply waiting for heads to roll. (A few scenes could be used to argue that Burton is simply being cruel to his audience.) The characters don't have much depth. For example, Ichabod Crane, here a New York constable rather than a schoolmaster, is sometimes fearless and take-charge, and sometimes comically squeamish, with nothing to explain the change. Katrina Van Tassel is the typical "feisty love interest" of many modern movies, with not many personal details to help the audience get to know her. In addition, the film follows "Scream" in the disturbing trend of having characters who don't care very much when their neighbors, friends, and relatives are killed, as long as they are safe. In one scene, Katrina says that she is done crying over the latest murder victim--who has only been dead a few hours. The film also jumps from storyline to storyline, in a way that I found unsatisfying, but can't detail without writing spoilers. The film lacks period authenticity (Katrina hangs out talking on Ichabod's bed), but Burton said on the DVD he wasn't attempting that. However, I found the inexplicable accents annoying: Johnny Depp does a 7/8ths English accent, Christina Ricci does a 2/3rds one, but Miranda Richardson speaks in a virtually flawless American accent. I did enjoy much of the dialogue, which is written in a suitably old-fashioned style, and most of the design, though I thought the bleached color added to the movie's coldness and artificiality. Many people enjoy the stylization of Burton's films, but here I thought it put too much distance between the characters and the audience. I had a better time watching the documentary about the movie's special effects that was included on the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is Director Tim Burton's latest (and in my view greatest) horror/mystery thriller, based on the 18th century book by Washington Irving. The original was set up in the great gothic tradition, and the movie definitely does not disappoint as it is set in late 18th century New York with brilliant work done in regards to it's feel, the village of Sleepy Hollow is definitely believable. It is faithful to the custom-entrenched, and sleepy dreamy like state of the novel, as the super-natural occurs naturally. By the end of the movie, I could've left my seat and gone outside to see a tree open up and swallow a woman whole and my senses would've accepted it due to the brilliant cinematography. Enough about the movie however, it's real merit is the gothic aura that surrounds this great, under-appreciated work that I might have otherwise skipped.Gothic Romance in general was a theme largely developed in the 18th century, with novel's written in rural Europe by author's growing up in the shadow of objects of immense intrigue.Castles or Large Manors left over from the feudal ages of Lords and Kings. This new genre was concerned with the realm of the paranormal, away from everyday life. Of Beautiful Maidens and horrifying monsters, of strange events that defied reason. This was its essence, of dark tones and bright bursts of light of contrast of both extreme ends of the spectrum at once. Mysterious pasts are also key, as history always plays a major role, usually with an aging male figure, or one who is deceased, yet undead. Family history is also integral most likely stemming from the period's obsession with oligarchies and inherited traits and titles.Sleepy Hollow draws on all these ideologies to create a complete gothic experience.dark background and all, with a twist of contemporary horror thrown in. Even if you had no prior knowledge of what makes Goth gothic, the film serves its purpose by the viewer walking away with a wonderful sampling, even if they still could not identify the topic. One of the film's greatest underlying tones in my view, is its emphasis on the supernatural, it's greatest juxtaposition lies in Ichabod Crane, a man consumed by knowledge, ahead and behind in the times, encountering a world he believes does not exist, that oversteps logic's vast grounds. His knowledge and avant-garde approach coupled with more than contemporary instruments do not measure up in the slightest, to the dead horseman's appearance from the land of the dead into that of the living. Of course, you can't have romance without the rhapsody of real romance. In this work the plate is definitely full, as you have many, if not some undeveloped, affairs and flings to take account of. The ageless question of, `what is love,' is explored briefly, as the diligent viewer is worth to ponder its meaning. most likely because the director does not have any real answers himself, just the initiative to raise more questions.In all, a great work that I would have admittedly skipped. A movie that came seemingly out of nowhere in my universe, and with little fanfare, gained my respect. Great to watch, if not to observe the underlying themes of what a Gothic Romance is alone. This film, in my opinion, is a very solid ***1/2 stars (out of 4).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who loves their stylised horror films, and in particular British horror films should check this out. This is no standard hollywood blockbuster.Burton proves once again that he is master of dark visuals. He lavishly recreates the atmosphere of a hammer horror film. The sets look amazing, you get a sense that the production designer wanted you to know that most of the outdoors scenes were filmed inside, to add to that hammer feeling. The gore and blood is completely over the top in a dark comic fantasy type of way. Both the American leads are fine (although Christina Ricci looks far to young for Johnny Depp), and they are helped out by a quality British cast. The best performance of all is given by Christopher Walken as the brutal headless horseman (while he has his head, of course). The score by Danny Elfman adds some great atmosphere to the film. This is more than pure entertainment. The dark visuals turn this film into a classic.</fullReview>

This film is a good example of how, if minor characters are played well, the movie gains a great sense of atmosphere. Adding to the atmosphere established by the characters is some inspired set designs, which have Tim Burton written all over them, and a roaring score by the great Danny Elfman. Of course, atmosphere alone does not make a great movie, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it goes a long way to helping its appeal.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

If Elfman's music (one of my favorite of his scores) doesn't give it away over the studio logos, the first glimpse of the film's visual atmosphere will.The cast of Sleepy Hollow is almost unprecedented for a horror film--the legendary Christopher Lee and Ian Mcdiarmid, Michael Gough, Christina Ricci, and Johnny Depp to name a few all give a performance to be expected of them. Heck, even the Headless horseman (fight double is Ray Park from Star Wars 1), and the actor who plays the horseman when he has a head--a nice surprise that should not be spoiled. There is no one else for that role.And really, I can think of very little else to describe the film other than the name of the Director "Tim Burton". You either like his style or you don't, and if you know the name of this director you should have a pretty good idea of what you're in for. Sleepy Hollow is the adaptation of the classic novel, and the film itself is something purely Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty but lumbering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A quite lovely-looking gothic fairytale/detective story(more the latter) that suffers from unimaginative and conventional storytelling. Depp, Ricci et al. inhabit their roles well, but are merely adrift in a movie that lacks focus and tight direction. Had Burton made this a more magical and mystical fairytale, he might have been able to sweep us along on a journey through the darkly amusing world he has created. Instead, too much is made of the rather tiresome murder-mystery(complete with predictable-twist-ending).The horseman looks impressive, but the mystery surrounding such a charachter gets thrown out the window as soon as he dismounts from his horse and starts lumbering around Terminator-style, hacking people to bits using Darth Maul-esque swordplay.Danny Elfmans music is appropriately gothic, I suppose...even though I often find him overdramatic rather than lyrical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film three years ago when it was in theaters. It is excellent and memorable. I still remember some of the nuances of Johnny Depp's performance, even after all of this time. I liked the way he grimaced at things like the sight of blood, which was ironic since he was a policeman who investigated homicides. That little touch made me laugh at the time, and injected a slight tongue-in-cheek effect to the whole film.Also, Christopher Walken is wonderfully ghoulish as the Headless Horseman. This is worth seeing, if you like films of this genre.</fullReview>

I was never frightened of the actual Irving tale, I thought it was stupid. But when I saw this, it was wonderful. The more I watch it the better it is. Burton is amazing.

		<shortDescription>One of Burton's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton knocks one outta the ballpark with his rendition of the classic Washington Irving short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Versatile actor (and Burton regular) Johnny Depp owns the role of Ichabod Crane, a police inspector sent to upstate New York to investigate a series of beheadings allegedly committed by a headless horseman. Depp's comic performance is matched by a stellar cast of mostly British actors. Only Christina Ricci, as the mysterious Katrina Van Tassel, seems a bit uncomfortable in her role. Of course, none of this really matters since the real stars of the show are the headless horseman himself and the marvelously creepy set design. With its blue/gray color palette, twisted trees and arching houses, "Sleepy Hollow" is destined to become a Halloween staple.</fullReview>

Those looking for that, would do better with the 1999 TV movie, or the Walt Disney animated version. Instead of Ichobad being a school teacher he is a crimminologist investigating the recent crimes with new scientific instruments that he invented.

		<fullReview>Breath taking adaption of the classic tale from the mind of Tim Burton. This time around Ichabod Crane is played by a very funny Johnny Depp. He is sent in to investigate a series of murders in which the victims are found headless. He wants to apply logic and reasoning to the crimes even though the town's citizens warn him of the headless horseman. His main suspect and love interest is Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci). Lush costumes, razor sharp editing, frightening score, and a terrific cast more then make up for the so so ending. Rated R; Graphic Violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great horror/comedy film but then what else are you to expect from Tim Burton?This had great use of suspense and had no plot holes unlike the Blair Witch Project. The horseman is brilliantly played by Christopher Walken and when he had his head he looked psychotic!The story is based on a legend as many people know, a man from New York called Icabod Crane goes to investigate murders in a rural town. Each person dead being found decapitated. A young man called Masbath who's father has been murdered helps Crane find the murderer and goes into the western woods with him.There is a twist to this story but unlike The Sixth Sense, you won't work it out.This isn't the best horror of the decade(that title goes to Children of the Corn 3) its not the best horror from 1999(Deep Blue Sea, Stir of Echoes) but is a must see for all horror/suspense fans!I give this an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

While true followers of the story will be upset over the major change in the story (witchcraft, science, the fact Crane is not a teacher), one cannot look pas the great cinematography and lighting throughout the film. Coupled with a great production design and some interesting camera angles, one cannot help but fall in the love with this world locked within the bounds of German Expressionism.

		<fullReview>once again, i have travelled to the mystic world of tim burton. his creations are unique works of art, that deserve their attention, and more.sleepy hollow was in many ways the best horror film i've seen, and i was quite surprised the rating wasn't higher. note, i do not enjoy horror movies in general, because they are always about senseless violence.in 'sleepy hollow', the evil IS really evil and scary as hell, but it's more. it's a great detective murder mystery, a love story and most of all great art.the costuming, effects and cinematography are breathtaking, and burtion keeps it all together quite enjoyably indeed. oh, and not to forget the great, haunting musical score danny elfman created for the occasion.johnny depp (my favorite actor) is splended as the scary little man ichabod crane who finds surprising courage to face evil but he is nr. 2 in this movie since another great actor christopher walken is just AMAZING as the headless horseman, hats off gentlemen. walken's best performance ever. maybe because he isn't talking in this one. ;)the thing in burton's movies is, always has been and hopefully always will be, is the magic that as ichabod crane said in the movie 'has bewitched me'. the fascinating, gothic worlds burton creates are something unique, where light and dark always has tremendous difference, but they can still be upside down, not always as the viewer would expect.if you want to look for something negative about 'sleepy hollow', it's miranda richardson's not so good performance and, if there is one, i would be most interested to see the director's cut. i was left with a feeling that the movie fast forwarded to the end, which might please some of the viewers, but i wouldn't have minded a little more character developement and detective work of crane.in conclusion, a very very good magical atmospheric old school horror story. me likes!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a headless horseman! I saw him! 9 of 10.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the movie that shows why Tim Burton is the master of the Gothic horror genre. He gives a classic story a new make-up and creates a wonderful atmosphere by adding to the fantastic set all the right colours, textures and music. His attention to detail and ritual make this a magical experience, a dark fairy tale. The cast are all superb, but it is Burton's screen alter ego, Johnny Depp, whose mesmerizing presence steals every scene. Let's admit it, the back of his hand is more expressive than some other actors' faces. His Ichabod Crane is not only endearing and intelligent, he is also involuntarily funny much of the time. And it is this sense of humour that lifts this movie above even the good ones of the genre. The moment when Crane finally meets the Headless Horseman face to... er... missing head, and faints, and afterwards, when he regains consciousness and tries to convince everybody of the existence of the demon - that's just pure brilliance. This is Tim Burton at his best, with a film that firmly belongs in my Top Ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton is a master in the creation of the 'distorted' fairy tale for the screen. Sleepy hollow is a thoroughly gloomy but gripping film. The charcters are excellent, Burtons Ichabod draws certain similarities to Edward scissorhands in alot of ways.The settings for the film are brilliant - dark woods, gloomy fields, old houses all add the the upsend of the legend of the headless horseman. The film itself has a slightly confusing, yet compelling storyline wich almost makes the legend of the headless horseman possible. Depp again is great as Ichabod, the nervy, cowardly yet brilliant policeman who never seems to fit in with his surroundings at sleepy hollow (a common theme in burtons films). All in all a great film with some excellent scenes - the horseman storming the midwives house, the carriage chase and brom fighting the horseman along with some grisly horror scenes. If you love burton, you will love this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have been a Best Picture Contender.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why should have Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" been a Best Picture contender? Simply because it is one of the best looking, beautiful pictures ever made.  It also had great performances and a clever, humorous, and twisty script written by Kevin Yagher and Andrew Walker based on the story by Washington Irving.  The costumes, cinematography and sets were among the best looking in history. The movie was nominated in all of those categories, but the people who put the film together should have been nominated too (those being the producers)as well as director Tim Burton who put his unmistakable stamp on the movie and put everything to good use.  Emmanuel Lubezki shot some of the best looking scenes in history. The scenes with Lisa Marie as Lady Crane are magnificent, they are literally breathtaking. Other scenes include the flashbacks with Christopher Walken as the Hessian, the scene in the church, the last scene in New York City, and many others.  The costumes by Colleen Atwood were the best in her long career. She has been nominated for Oscars for the films "Beloved" and "Little Women" but her costumes in "Sleepy Hollow" were her best ever. Especially good were her costumes for Miranda Richardson. There is one scene near the end of the movie (in a flashback)where she wears possibly the best looking costume ever designed.  The Art Direction and set decoration did win an Oscar for Rick Heinrichs and Peter Young. The entire movie was shot indoors but their sets are so realistic and great looking that you would think the movie was shot outside. Especially good is the twisted tree.  The actors are also very good. Johnny Depp gives a very funny, convincing performance that ranks among his best. Christina Ricci also gives a very good performance as does Miranda Richardson. Also good in supporting roles are Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, and Christopher Walken. Walken creates a truly horrifying character and is excellent in the small role as the horseman.  Overall "Sleepy Hollow, is one of the best looking films ever shot, and is funny and well acted, hugely underrated. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton is known from his original and quite gothic style of directing. He can create a whole new (and usually dark) world with extraordinary features. And Sleepy Hollow is no exception. The master of imagination has done it again.I don't want to tell anything the plot or describe any of the characters thus I want everybody to make their own interpretations and because it could spoil someone's experience of the film.So what was so amazing about the film? It was visually astounding. Every ray of light, every flower, every house..EVERYTHING was set so carefully. My eye didn't catch any imperfection or anything that didn't please me. It was just like from a fairytale, and that it certainly was. Pure fantasy, pure imagination that took my breath from the very first second. and the cast seemed to live -not act- in that dark and gloomy but nevertheless fabulously imaginative world.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has a mind of a child and at least a hint of imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton once again delievers a great film. So the story may not be like the original but who the hell cares. Example: Ichabod in the book is a school teacher not a constable. I guess Burton did this to make Ichabod a more cooler guy? Christina Ricci is an excellent Catrina and no one could have done it better. I especially liked all of the elders of the town. Each one of them had a special personality. The characters were very well developed in this film. You could have guessed right away that this was a Tim Burton film because of the dark atomosphere which was simply amazing. Minus all the blood and decapitations this is more of a mystery than a horror film. Even with the R rating I think all types of people will love this film. It is an american lengend relived with some twists. 9/10 for this blockbuster film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad period horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with horror movies with blood and gore involved is that the audience is so used to the special effects these days that the shock value is no longer there. Therefore the strength of the plot becomes more important to retain the audiences attention for the duration of the movie.To this end Sleepy Hollow is a novel way of turning a "slasher" movie into a period slasher movie. The problem with this is that the villain "or the suspense" associated with the Headless horsemen loses its scare factor after about 20 mins into the film. After than it is the inevitable ending that you come to expect with the hero saving the day.Thats the problem I have with this movie, it promises so much yet you feel a little disappointed in the end that it never quite achieved what it set out to do.Johnny Depp is a little annoying as the bumbmling constable whislt Chrisina Ricci's characted is not developed enough. She seems to fit the bill perfectly for her character, but we never get to see that enough in the movie.As far as horror flicks go its not too bad. Maybe I have just come to expect more in a storyline these days.</fullReview>

Combined with good performance by Johnny Depp, playing New Yorker who is brave and determined to find the killer, but in a same time squeamish and disgusted with what he is seeing. The only thing I don't like is that his character is to smart, and he finds resolutions to quickly. But nothing is perfect, so I say this movie is stable 10. I definitely recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how the tale should be told and made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good old-fashioned and gothic-like thriller that provides some "real" nail-biting moments that's based on the novel by Washington Irving. The tale follows Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a moody constable who is sent up to the small community of "Sleepy Hollow" in upstate New York to investigate a series of strange and grisly murders. When Crane arrives, he doesn't get a lot of cooperation from the locals even though they tell him that a "headless horseman" committed the vicious murders. Plus, Crane is told that the horseman was a former Hessian mercenary, played by "a very scary" looking Christopher Walken. The performances (Depp, Walken, Christina Ricci, etc.) are great and so is the musical score by Danny Elfman and Emmanuel Lubezli's photography of the gloomy scenery. I like the fact that director Tim Burton ("Batman") doesn't let his screenwriters (Andrew Kevin Walker and make-up whiz Kevin Yagher) follow the same story as several other adaptions have done before this one. Martin Landau appears unbilled. "Sleepy Hollow" shows that this is how the tale should be made and told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(possible spoilers) The first thing that I think of when I think of Sleepy Hollow, is BLOOD, BLOOD, BLOOD!!!!!!!!! I will never have a problem seeing decapitations again.I had a hard time getting, "attatched" to the characters. For example, when Magistrate Philipse was decapitated, I laughed. When Brom Van Brunt was cut in half, I laughed. I laughed when most things happened that weren't supposed to be funny, and things that should have been funny, confused or bored me.I thought the special effects were fairly well done. If possible, see this on DVD, and watch the special features. It is very interesting learning how they did everything, like make the prosthetic heads and train the horses, etc.I would have liked there to be a little more explanation in the plot. I was never entirely sure what "5 victims, 4 graves" added up to, but its possible that it went in one ear and out the other. I also didn't completely understand the flashbacks that Ichabod had (with his mother) but I won't drag on that to much.Overall, I enjoyed this film. Even though I laughed alot more than I screamed, I was entertained, and that is the purpose of any movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider this to be Tim Burton's best movie ever, except for maybe "Batman". It only had a couple of small flaws, which I will list now, so as to save the good stuff for last: 1. Many of the fine supporting actors should have been given more screen time, particularly Casper Van Dien and Richard Griffiths. Both of their characters should have been given bigger parts. 2. There is one part of the movie that I didn't get:In the scene when the Horseman goes after that family (a scene that offended many reviewers), why did Tim Burton feel the need to have him go after their young son as well? You find out later why he went after the parents, but he had no reason to try and kill that poor child. However, these two small problems are more than outweighed by the many strong points of this film, which I will now list: 1. Danny Elfman's score. I don't get why any reviewers could be put off by his excellent music. I love how he combined the various types of music which he used in Mr. Burton's other films. By this, I mean that he used scary, thrilling tunes like in "Batman", "Batman Returns", and "Beetlejuice" during certain scenes (such as Ichabod's terrifying encounter with the Crone in the Western Woods, and during the final chase scene), yet in other scenes (like the flashback sequences and the film's final end scene) he made haunting, beautiful melodies like the kind you heard in "Edward Scissorhands". 2. The costumes/ makeup/set design. The costumes were beautifully accurate, and they should have won the Oscar for Costume Design instead of "Topsy-Turvy". The makeup was great, particularly for the scenes when you see the Horseman's real face. You almost couldn't tell that it was Christopher Walken, because the makeup made him look so scary. Tim Burton has created his own little world with the sets. He actually had the village completely constructed, and the Western Woods looked even better, with the dried leaves and the gnarled dead trees everywhere. I'm glad that this movie won at least one Oscar due to the set design. 3. Johnny Depp's performance. I LOVED what he did with Ichabod Crane, and he performed with complete perfection. During the scene when he questions the Notary, he reminded me of Sherlock Holmes. He should have won more awards for his performance. So, basically, if you have a strong stomach, I highly recommend that you see this great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTRAORDINARY set design. PLUS! It's a excellent movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once thought that Tim Burton was a bad director. Edward Scissorhands and Mars Attacks were his first two movies that I saw (and they are his worst) so you can guess I got a bad impression from the start. So once Sleepy Hollow came out in 1999 I was like "Oh great, another Tim Burton movie" and once I saw it I realized that this Tim Burton person wasn't bad at all. Infact he was excellent! From then on I saw his masterpieces such as Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Batman Returns, Beetlejuice, the highly underrated Ed Wood and his short film's Vincent and Frankenweenie. Now, probably the only thing that made me want to research into this guy and see his films was because I thought that Sleepy Hollow was a good movie with it's acting, plot, etc. but the one thing that really amazed me was his SET DESIGN. His views on how a movie should look set wise are brilliant! Lets also take his character design from the SUPERB movie A Nightmare Before Christmas. Sure he didn't direct that movie but the set and character design was phenomenal! So back to the movie I'm reviewing here. Sleepy Hollow is as everyone knows or should know is a classic fairy tale about the misfortunes of poor Icabod Crain and his encounters with the headless horseman. This new version for the 90's is different than the original, in a good way, but there's not a single time in all of Sleepy Hollow where it forgets it's roots. The characters and even the town of Sleepy Hollow are as I remembered them from the original and it even includes the classic flaming pumpkin. But this film also provides a fresh new look to the tale. The story of how the headless horseman becomes and the inner plot within this movie are new but don't forshadow it's realism to the book. But there are two things I wasn't fond of in this movie: PLOT SPOILER! DON'T READ ON! WARNING! (1. the headless horseman's motives were different than from the book and (2. Icabod Crain lives in this version. Now I thought the ending of the book was excellent because Icabod just dissapears, no one hears from him again, and that's what makes it so good because your left wondering unlike in the movie Icabod lives and goes back to London to live happily ever after blah blah. Now, as I was saying earlier, fabulous set design. I was amazed that this movie didn't contain one tiny little beam of sunlight through the entire movie. Either it was gray and foggy or totally black. Now that to me is art and skill provided well by Tim Burton. Also how all the woods in the film were man made. Can you imagine how pain stakingly hard that must have been? Or how one part of the woods was 3 miles long to catch the realism of the horseman going on his rides of head choppiry. As in most Tim Burton films there is a kind of eerie darkness (excluding Pee-Wee's Big Adventure). Good examples are both Batman movies which were phenominal with there set design and Beetlejuice. Tim Burton is obviously a director who cares a lot about his movies but also a lot in the way they look. You will not find a movie of his that doesn't contain some bizarre set pieces. He's a man of great movie skill. Also be aware that this is not like the old Disney version of Sleepy Hollow. This movie contains quite a lot of graphic head slicin' and dicin' which is ok for me but people that expect something within the range of the Disney version will be surprised. So my suggestion to those who have not seen this movie is as soon as possible go to your local movie store, rent this movie, go home and prepare youself to look through the eyes of Tim Burton. Enjoy the feast of solid cast, plot and astonishing set design that only Sleepy Hollow can provide. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome back to the unique world of Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewing a film by Tim Burton is almost like describing the most fascinating incident in your life, you never know where to start. To begin with, what hasn't been said about this complete "auteur" that I could probably say now, almost nothing. Since the beginning we can see that the places portrayed by Burton are not the real cities, but how he sees these places. New York is colorless and boring, and yet crude. But the town of Sleepy Hollow is something else, is mysterious, is dark, mistyful, and yet with certain cosyness; Sleepy Hollow is a place far different from the rest of the world that makes us feel like we are in another very weird dimension that reminds us his previous films.Again Burton uses the elements that have made his previous work famous, such as horror, the fight of one man against the whole world just because he is different, the animated cartoon-like effects, the wind mill that in a way represents his mind put on screen as a physical part of the environment through which the characters confront the nemesis, and a certain touch of elegant humour that could be even cataloged as dark. It is just impossible to see this films without thinking "this is totally a Tim Burton film", and again he wouldn't be complete without a score by Danny Elfman whose best scores have been the ones he's made for Burton's films. All in all, I don't see a reason not to like this one, and as for me, it has already become one of those films I will never get tired of watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The set designs are absolutely breathtaking; Tim Burton is a genius. The plot itself is an excellent adaptation of the original story. I wouldn't expect to be too terribly frightened as the movie is more of a mystery than anything else, and the ending is completely unexpected. The acting is wonderful; Johnny Depp is excellent and Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson are great, as are Christopher Walken and Ian McDiarmid. The Horseman, despite his lack of any lines whatsoever, is really brought to life very well thanks to Nick Gillard, Ray Park, and Rob Inch (hey, I'm *obligated* to give props...they all also worked on the fights for The Phantom Menace ^_~). Overall, Sleepy Hollow is a very worthwhile film to see (but if you're going to rent it, try to get it in widescreen. Pan &amp; scan just cannot do justice to the visual nature of this movie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Tim Burton Lost His Head?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Burton has issues. Deep-seeded issues. On an intellectual level, I can appreciate what he's trying to do, but come on! Do we really need to see over 30 decapitations in one movie? Oh, yeah. Not to mention a lovely view of the mess an iron maiden makes and some poor fool who develops a split personality.For once, the Disney version was actually truer to the original than this. While I suppose changing Ickybod from a schoolmaster to a colonial James Bond was inevitable (education isn't cool anymore, as we all know), the movie should have ended with the famous pumpkin scene. But no. It keeps going and going. More and more heads pile up ad nauseum and eventually ad tedium. We start delving into dark themes of witchcraft, occultism and sadism. When will it all end?The head-chopping grows old real fast, despite the "clever" ways the same action is shown. One fellow's head spins on his neck like a demented top before rolling directly toward Ickybod. Another poor schmuck gets his head caught between the bars of an iron gate, making for an easy swipe. When the Horseman had his head, we see two dozen soldiers attacking him, but every swipe of the Horseman's sword takes off at least one head. Is that even remotely possible?When he has no head, he runs wild, swiping noggins left and right. He has an extremely offensive killing orgy in a midwife's house. People shoot at him, but they acknowledge it as worthless, as he is already dead. Would it be so hard to shoot the sword out of his hand? Chop off his arm, so he can't use his sword? And what about killing the horse?This film has as much to do with Washington Irving as "Oliver &amp; Co." had to do with Charles Dickens. This travesty takes a nice story and pulls it to unspeakable depths. Did anybody think of pointing that out to Mr. Burton? Then again, he'd probably say "Shut up! I'm trying to see if I can have a guy lose his head while he's eating!"Basically, this film was another excuse for Hollywood to butcher another classic story and for Mr. Burton to dwell in the horror and misery he loves so much. However, I must confess that this film has given me new appreciation for my neck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go, another horror movie made in the "modern day era" of the genre, and a disappointment. It's actually one of the more excusable products made after the decline of horror in the early eighties, if for no reason other than that THIS FILM IS GORGEOUS TO BEHOLD. Every single frame is sweet candy for the eyes, and has the "look" of a great horror film. AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.I was so excited that Hammer Horror Veterans Christopher Lee and Michael Gough were given parts in this film, and I suppose Johnny Depp is one of the better actors today (which doesn't mean much). But even with these three assets, I got bored.How many decapitations do we need to see? In the good old days, if you got even ONE severed head it was exciting, and it was a "money shot" worth waiting for. But if you see endless and similar shots of heads rolling, it just gets tired REAL fast. What a shame it is that the horror genre that flourished from 1910 to 1985 is so damned D-E-A-D today. No matter how close a film comes to capturing something (and for the sheer beauty of this movie alone, this one came close) it always misses its mark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I may sound a little preachy, but viewers of this film who did not like it simply do not understand its ability to be pure art. The set design, the cinematography, and the story is a horror tale, an urban legend, a drama, and a mystery all rolled into one. Most of all, I like how the color red stands out from all other colors, giving the film an almost "black-and-white-and-red" look. This, of course, brings out the red blood that shows up in the film from time to time. Burton surprised me in this film, as well, with the twisted story line and his choice of cameo actors. Burton films are not well known for being presenting a surprise ending, but this one proved to be effective. A film is much more enjoyable if you try to find its full potential and don't hold so many expectations of it. Sure... it has a few flaws... but so does "American Beauty" and it was voted Best Film in '99, not to mention it is my favorite. "Sleepy Hollow" is a wonderful and creatively creepy retelling of the classic tale that we all remember. It is a mature look at the tale and though it is not entirely scary, the film is a work of art good for a night of popcorn and scary movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is another film that almost succeeds at style over substance. The film is beautiful and appropriately creepy. I've read that Tim Burton shot the entire film using a blue filter on the cameras and it is extremely effective. Virtually every shot is dripping with atmosphere and the detail and work that went into each scene is amazing.But then the flimsy plot begins to rear it's flimsy head. This is another case of not as much attention being given to the plot, but the visuals instead. None of the characters are genuinely interesting and the narrative structure stumbles along and has to be wrapped up with a Scooby-Doo style explanation of the preceding events.It's really a shame because the scenes involving the headless horseman are fantastic with effective but discreet uses of gore. If you want to be blown away from a visual perspective, this film can't be beat. If you're expecting a deep and coherent plot, you're not going to find it here. rating:6.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being from New York myself, I found "Sleepy Hollow" a real horrifying film. The writers' idea of making "Ichabod Crane" as a scientific policeman instead of a wimpy schoolteacher was brilliant. Johnny Depp was sensational as Crane. Christina Ricci has come far since her days as Wednesday Addams. Here she is, at 19, playing a good romantic role as Katrina Van Tassel, leading the constable on a roller coaster ride of "she loves me, she loves me not". Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson are magnificent as Lord and Lady Van Tassel. Jeffrey Jones is as menacing as ever. Ian McDiarmid (Senator Palpatine of "Star Wars: Episode 1") delivers a fine role as the town doctor. Casper Van Dien comes across again as a romantic figure in the form of the town smithy (unfortunately, he shoes no horses). Young Marc Pickering is a talented youngster and will probably prove himself to be a fine actor in the future. An unbilled but recognizable Martin Landau gives a great, but all too short and silent, portrayal of Peter Van Garrett, one of the Hessian's first victims. "X-Men"s Ray Park delivers one heck of a performance as the Hessian (sans head) as does Christopher Walken (with bright blue eyes and saber-teeth), even though he does little more than growl and snarl. It was also a change of pace seeing Christopher Lee playing someone other than Dracula. Washington Irving's original story of an actual murder spree in upstate New York, circa 1735, is improved on, turning it from a light, scary Halloween story to a fantastic whodunit murder mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's macabre and lyrical movie-making style are put to use in `Sleepy Hollow,' a fine horror film for adults.Burton says that he grew up fascinated by the "beautiful horror" (as he calls it) of Britain's Hammer Films (Hammer star Christopher Lee has a cameo in this film), and he tried to replicate that style in `Sleepy Hollow,' which is loosely based on the Washington Irving classic.Johnny Depp plays Icabod Crane, who in this incarnation of the legend is a New York City constable/crime scene investigator circa 1800 who is sent up state to look into several murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. The murderer not only decapitates his victims; he also takes their heads. Crane soon learns he is dealing with a supernatural foe, a headless horseman.Depp says he modeled his performance on Roddy McDowall (particularly in `Fright Night') and Basil Rathbone. He does well, although he struggles with a British accent. But the film seems to have a problem with accents, anyway. It is set in a colony populated by Dutch immigrants, but almost everyone speaks with a British accent (the movie was filmed in England) except Miranda Richardson, who is English! The film also has a problem with fainting. There are almost as many faintings as decapitations.I won't give away who the headless horseman is. Let's just say he is perfectly cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gothic masterpiece from Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has always been a maverick amongst Hollywood directors, and Sleepy Hollow is no exception. Written in his unique, heavily gothic visual language, it is a fascinating exploration of the boundaries between reason and magic, and the way that evil leads to evil, violence inexorably to more violence until justice is done.The film is carried along at a scorching pace by a riveting plotline, eschewing the horror convention of not showing the ghost until at least halfway through the film. Instead, the conspiracy at the heart of the plot reveals itself in deepening layers, each one implicating more and more of the people in the town until the horrible secret is revealed. With each twist I thought we had found the culprit, only to be thwarted by yet another level of complexity. The denouement was both surprising and shocking.As with all Burton films, Sleepy Hollow is visually very striking and creates a world of its own, a world where ghosts and ghouls are real and interact with the living for very good reasons. As with Beetlejuice, the atmosphere is both sinister and comical, although a lot more emphasis is placed on the sinister here than in the earlier film. And at the heart of the film is Constable Ichabod Crane, puffed up with an absurd self-confidence and belief in reason which rapidly crumbles under the weight of evidence of supernatural goings-on. Johnny Depp is fantastic as the 19th century "modern man" who trusts reason over superstition, slowly revealing the horrific facts of his own history through dreams and visions as the film unfolds. Christina Ricci excels (yet again) as his love interest Katrina, the beautiful innocent who falls in love with him and sets out to help him unravel the mystery. The rest of the cast are also terrific, particularly Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Katrina's father and step-mother. Burton always seems to get the best out of his actors, and they pay hearty tribute to his talents in the "Making of..." film on the DVD.There is so much to say about Sleepy Hollow that it would take more than a brief IMDb review to cover it all. It explores the limits of the rational approach and the way in which belief and understanding are based on a combination of reason and openness, the union represented by the blossoming love between Katrina and Ichabod. It deals with evil and its consequences. It shows how love can bloom out of horror and how the apparent horror on the surface of things can belie the true horror caused by social ostracisation and rejection. Burton's gothic fantasy world is not there to help us escape from our own but to help us understand it, and Sleepy Hollow is yet another masterpiece from a true Hollywood genius. Burton is a man who knows why he makes films - look on and see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the first scenes of this magnificent piece of art started passing my eyes,my brain could not believe that it was a movie!Everything looked so artistic and exquisite, I felt like I was visiting an art exhibition and looking at some geniuses dream paintings! If we could converse one movie still into a painting, it's almost certain that art critics and historians would be having quite some job for many years! Everything looks so alive and fluid and I had the feeling the background itself was narrating the story as well...An astonishing work by Tim Burton who now has set the standards so hight that I think the only director can pass them, is himself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so impressed with what Tim Burton had done to The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow. Anyone who has read the story, or is familiar with it, will know that Headless Horseman wasn't real at all. Which is why this movie works so well - the Headless Horseman is very real indeed.You put Johnny Depp together with Tim Burton and you get gold. This is no different from their other collaborations. Brilliant mood, art direction and costuming makes you feel like you are watching the Disney cartoon come to life. I was applauding Burton's nod to Disney's animated short with an almost exact replication of Brom Bones throwing the flaming pumpkin at Ichabod Crane.Andrew Kevin Walker changed the story for the better. If they had remade the original story, people would have been bored to tears. This is a wonderful action film that is filled with great imagery, human emotion and quirky humour. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is fantastic. I didn't watch this movie in theaters because I didn't especially like the cast and that I absolutely hated Tim Burton's Batman movies. He makes everything so dark, you can't tell whether it's day or night and a lot of times you can't even see squat!However, his style works great on 'Sleepy Hollow'! The scenery is believable and the costumes are very nice. Depp, Ricci, and pretty much everyone else did a great job, they are all very talented.and the Hessian Horseman is my new favourite villain, he is so cool, I bet you he can kick both Michael Myer's and Freddie Krueger as*es! The sword fighting scenes are very exciting, almost as good as the Highlander movies. But the sad thing is that the headless horseman (Ray Park) is not credited.So please do yourself a favour and rent this movie. My only regret is that I didn't watch it in the theaters.10 stars out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton manages to capture some of look and whimsy of very best Hammer productions - including wrangling Christopher Lee for a small part - but his slick, overly precious take on the classic American gothic ghost story never manages to rise above its' own sense of good-naturedness to scare anyone over the age of reason. Thinly drawn characters, tedious narrative, and an overused monster conspire to bog down what should have been an easy sell. The legend has never been given the big budget treatment and the very idea of a headless horseman resonates as fresh as anything in the era still fascinated by hockey masks and chainsaws. Perhaps it is Burton's curse to forever whistle in the fog. Like a Magritte scene that is equal parts in darkness and light, the director cannot commit to absolute terror nor can he make a simple fairy story. Each extreme seems too maudlin, too lacking in irony. Take for example his drawing of Depp's Constable Crane. A nebbish man of reason in a haunted world. Since this is a popular motion picture you can rest assured that Crane's balloon is ripe for pricking from the get-go. But Burton is not satisfied to simply use Crane as a foil for comedy relief. He is shown at intervals to be a man of passion and, when called on, native courage. Depp probably deserves a great of the credit for this; he manages a degree of nuance when shifting from the priggish coward to the energetic crime fighter . Unfortunately, much of the rest of the cast is not accorded this freedom within the narrative to move about. Christina Ricci's white witch only hints at the beguiling seductress within the tight bodice while the four town elders who collectively make up the details of the central plot are as anonymous as the ubiquitous bloody neck stumps. Only Crane's boy assistant , played by Marc Pickering, really stands out in the supporting cast as he tranforms into a spot-on Dr. Watston to Depp's Holmes. The look of the film is stunning, perhaps the directors most completely realized visual accomplishment. Of special note are the opening and closing sequences in eighteenth century New York. I know others have noted this and perhaps Burton will return to it one day. The few minutes in this film are too brief. In small details, Sleepy Hollow comes on like a Cronenburg production with its fetish for sharp, suspicious tools, wounds, and places of crossing over - the vagina-like opening to hell at the 'tree of death' from which the horseman emerges. Of course, in Burtons hands these objects take on almost satirical proportions - like some in-joke within the popular avant guard of contemporary cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow, although being somewhat pompous at times, does not fail to keep one nailed to his/her seat and admiring the amount of work put into the movie. Johnny Depp's star shines even brighter as usual, as he projects the character Officer Ichabod Crane, a rational man who does not believe in the headless horseman at first.The scenery and sets are crafted with an amazing skill (Although the smoke is a bit over-the-top), and the superb music to score by none other than Danny Elfman also has its share with the mood.An excellent movie, although the dialogue is rather pompous at times.

		<fullReview>I had heard Sleepy Hollow was very good, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. One of the most spellbounding and best films ever constructed. This film is totally flawless, everything about it I loved.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a small-town constable, is sent by his superior (Christopher Lee) to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of brutal murders, Crane arrives, appropriately enough on Halloween, and quickly learns that all the victims were found beheaded and their bonces never found, Ensconed in the home of Sleepy Hollow's finest, Baltus Van Tassell (Michael Gambon), Constable Crane is told the story of the Hessian Horsemen (a pointy-toothed Christopher Walken) - a former German mercenary who specialised in decapitating the locals during the War of American Independence. It is his ghost - the Headless Horseman - whom the locals believe is responsible for the killings. Crane believes nothing of the sort until he comes neck to neck with demonic being. In between fainting with fear, leering with desire at the Van Tassell's daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and several more attacks from the headless one, Crane begins to uncover the true story behind the towns killer...Tim Burton, as usual, delivers stunning direction, and his film is easily his best one yet. The actors are all amazing, Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have amazing on-screen chemistry. Emmanuel Lubezki's camerawork is immaculate, he deserved an Oscar for his amazing cinematography. The music is another stand-out for Sleepy Hollow, Danny Elfman's score is engaging.If you miss Sleepy Hollow, you'll miss out on what is probably one of the best films of the 20th century.I rate Sleepy Hollow 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The fact that it bears no resemblance to the short story by Washington Irving really didn't affect my opinion of it. I think if Burton had approached it as just another chapter of Sleepy Hollow people would have been more accepting of it. The biggest complaint I hear about it is that it isn't like the story. Aside from that it's a great story and has some incredible effects. DVD really affords the viewer the luxury of watching the heads get whacked off in slow motion. Let's face it Walken is the most frightening individual ever to grace the screen (with the exception of Batman 2). I was very creeped out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE VERY STUFF OF FAIRY TALES AND THEIR MACABRE NATURE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW is easily the best movie yet made by Tim Burton,surpassing the previous contender EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.His BATMAN movies were pure and absolute junk and as someone who generally only submits reviews for action movies and TV shows I would not even dignify these awful movies as being worthy of that genre and a waste of writing time.This wonderful treatment of the Washington Irving classic is however somewhat of an instant classic and Burton has succeeded in capturing on film the very elusive and macabre nature of a classic folklore tale.Johnny Depp is nothing short of a revelation as Ichabod Crane,surprising from an actor who has knowingly shown a petulant dislike of the action genre in the past and while SLEEPY HOLLOW is not by definition an action movie there is plenty of rousing stuff going on here.This is the first Burton movie to contain any decent fight choreography and he is helped in this by the presence of Ray Park,doubling for the headless horseman and Park's work here is ten times better than the tedious torch waving that pretends to be fighting in the dire PHANTOM MENACE. Depp is supported by a stalwart British cast including the ever excellent Alun Armstrong in a tiny role.Of the Americans Christopher Walken is brilliant and even Casper Van Dien does not disgrace himself here.All in all SLEEPY HOLLOW is destined to become a true classic of fantasy cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed, a most curious thing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is destined to be a Halloween Classic ? certainly with me - with a pumpkin head behind every tree. Depp's performance as the agitated constable is in direct relationship to the original, school teacher, Ichobold Crain, while Depp also plays the determined detective who believes in `cause and consequence' rather than `sense without reason'. Yet one of the morals to the story is that so much of life is `without sense or reason'. The film's backgrounds, costumes, and props, as well as the script, is an authentic yet nightmarish twist of the time period. There is an unusual quality to the cinematography ? colourless, misty, mystifying and typical of Hell, except with the colourful dream sequences standing out like Dorothy's first view of Oz. The swordsmanship and horsemanship is certainly the finest ever put on the screen, with the Spanish Black Steed, Daredevil, deserving of a Special Oscar.All of the script reads with an Edgar Allen Poe quality, while Depp, himself, looks like a young Poe (Poe is the grand-daddy to all detective stories). A few views of Ichobold's ledger gives us a view of what he's thinking, which may be the first time such an unusual device has been used in a film to let us know what's going on in a character's mind. The symbolism is incredible and subliminally works on the subconscious mind, often beyond our conscious depths, to produce an uncanny feeling in the soul of the viewer. In particular, the pumpkin `heads'. The blindfolded Katrina with the dream of the blindfolded Mother (love is blind). The Mother's and Katrina's connections with witchery. The bullet stopped by the book to be kept close to the heart for protection. The `blood red' cardinal ? Ichobold's pet released; Katrina's favorite bird that she can't cage ? as she must feel trapped in Sleepy Hollow; the optical toy; and the decapitated cardinal in the witches den. There is also a sense of `travelling into the unknown' emphasized by several scenes moving down roads or tails.The film obviously took several comical ideas from the original Disney cartoon as well as the horror of the old Hammer Horror films ? in particular, the gimmicks, gadgets, and the desecrated graveyard corpses of the Frankenstein films - which seems to have been intended. All in all, a romanticized yet diabolical faery tale designed to give big and little children nightmares?.. Sweet dreams!?..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is one of the worst films of 1999, a big embarrassment for the Paramount Studios and everybody involved with this mess. Tim Burton directed this macabre and bizarre story with the generous doses of sadism that are actually a common thing of his whole career. Extremely violent to the point of being unpleasant, with over-the-top and exaggerated performances by the main cast and a story full of holes, Sleepy Hollow is such a disappointment that Johnny Depp should avoid to come closer to Burton for the next hundred years.The only thing that saved this bomb from the total failure was the presence of Casper Van Dien, who provided some few interesting moments and stole every frame he was in but ended up disappearing just as quickly.Even a horror film must have a script that gives to the story a clear and concise development, so the audience can understand what's going on and get involved with the movie, but Sleepy Hollow is more like a huge "gluing" of scenes that have no connection at all. If you really want to watch a good horror flick, rent Hellbound Hellraiser 2 or Deadly Friend.</fullReview>

But I can't seem to figure out all the other times when the horseman walked past the guy but the when they ran away and crossed the bridge the Horseman sudenly attacked it made no sense why then, why not before? anyway, the way the Horseman fought on the bridge was breath taking thumbs up on Christopher Walken's performance!

		<fullReview>I sometimes feel that Tim Burton's luscious visual style comes at the expense of substance. I could be wrong, but my sense is that in Sleepy Hollow Burton took what might have been a very intelligent script about a rational man of the Enlightenment coming face-to-face with living proof of the supernatural, and he merely played that aspect up for laughs, and for camp (as with Ichabod Crane's bizarrely fantastical portable crime lab). Also, to the degree that this was about a rational man confronting the irrational, Burton's depiction of 1799 as a time of transition from brooding medieval darkness (symbolized by the prison and the smokey New York skyline) to an Age of Reason (symbolized by the proto-Victorian "White City" at the very end) is questionable, narratively as well as historically. Reason lost a battle simply by discovering that unreason exists, and was able to conquer the supernatural only with the aid of the irrational--i.e., love and witch's charms. That being said, it wasn't a bad movie at all--a visual treat, and a nice homage to one of the best old American fairy tales.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the leads, lend their solid performances with the gloomy settings. The inisde jokes were good relief, in the midst of the gruesome plot. There was at least a few good references (wink-wink) to the 1958 Disney telling of this story, as well. The supporting cast was also quite good, with Jeffrey Jones, who always lends his best in any picture I've seen him in. The cameos, including the legendary Christopher Lee, were fun. Add Christopher Walken, who chew up a scene as if it were mincemeat, and we've got some great inspired casting. He clearly relished his role. Good for him! The music score by Danny Elfman was outstanding. Overall, a good pcture. The only drawbacks I encountered was the story twists started becoming predictable, and that resolution seemed pretty weak. A rather lackluster wrap up, to an otherwise exciting outing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid work of ART.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Sleepy Hollow has apparently two distinctive characteristics among most of the movies I watched. These are: 1- It was one of the few movies which I can really regard as a "work of art", 2- It was almost excellent in EVERY aspect. Yes; briefly, this masterpiece was almost excellent in every aspect: Marvelous costumes; impressive music by Danny Elfman; fabulous cinematography, which should have got the OSCAR instead of American Beauty; breathtaking plot by A. Kevin Walker ( se7en ) and Kevin Yagher ( what a brilliant idea to make a new version of Irving's well-known story); great direction and art direction, which brought it a well-deserved OSCAR and wonderful cast including Martin Landau and Christopher Lee--- I especially loved Christopher Walken's cool portrayal of the Hessian Horseman and certainly his teeth! For now, he is my favorite villain. On the other hand, the most obvious aspect wrong with this movie was the crucial exposition, which was unduly rushed and could have been much longer in order to let the audience fathom the full plot. ( Warning: STOP here. This might be a spoiler for you.) Now, I would like to reply to the friend who criticized this movie for the exploding windmill. Here is an article that states that windmills DO EXPLODE in particular circumstances such as the ones in the movie: Cinefex says: "An explosion is precipitated by clouds of stirred flour, which have made the air combustible. It is a strange fact, but you can have explosions in flour mills." stated Paddy Eason. "Ichabod throws an oil lamp into the mill and everything goes bang..." (Spoiler END) Finally, I would like to point out that you may not like this movie since it does not appeal to everyone, but it is still a great movie then. I give it a well-deserved 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having missed Sleepy Hollow on the big screen I looked forward with delight to viewing it on DVD. What I saw left me smile, if a little sadly. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is a thing of rare beauty, perfectly capturing the gothic creepiness of the classic tale while oozing the macabre lushness for which Tim Burton is famous. What disappoints is the story. This should not have been a problem considering the screenstory and screenplay were brought to us by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, The Game). What really bugged me about the story was the ultimate motive of the eventual villain. Money and revenge, normally noble motives for murder and death, seemed distinctly out of sorts with the gothic nature of the story. I for one was expecting something much less cut and dry, something more in fitting with the magical nature of the Horseman.Another aspect of the story that did not seem to sit right was Ichabod Crane's all too hasty acceptance of a supernatural headless killer. Crane begins the story as a determined detective armed with firm scientific ideals and a disbelief of anything magical. Too quickly does Crane disown these principles in favour of a more open attitude. It would have been much more satisfying if Crane's internal struggle between the rational and the supernatural had lasted just a bit longer.One thing worth commenting upon that definitely got the thumbs up was the costume selection for the female cast. One word: CLEAVAGE. Cleavage is cool. Good acting and stuff too. It's a rather good movie that should have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't really all that excited about seeing Sleepy Hollow, it didn't look that good. But I was stupid to say that it didn't look good, because this film is instantly a modern-day classic. It would also probably be in my top 5 films of all time. It is just so entertaining, engaging, enthralling and exciting that I couldn't resist it. I give all my praise to the people who worked on this film, particulary Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Christina Ricci. In every area this film is absolutely perfect, the visual effects are stunning, the costumes are eye-opening, the sound is chilling and the editing is noticeably full of effort. Don't miss out on this outstanding, unforgettably haunting masterpiece.Rating: 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely a quirky adaptation of the original Washington Irving story. It has Tim Burton's handiwork all over it, just look at interesting camera angles, dark scenes and quirky humor.I think Johnny Depp played the slightly unbalanced Icabod Crane quite well, keeping Burton's dark humor just under the surface of the character. Besides, Depp is at his best in a character role, i.e. Benny &amp; Joon, Cry Baby, Dead Man, Ed Wood, etc. Christina Ricci also performed well as a Burton character, though more on the beautiful but mysterious side rather than the dark humor of Depp's character.I recommend it to horror/suspense fans, especially Depp, Burton and Ricci fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Best Film Ever... 10+ (5 stars)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton made some alteration from Irvings version of Sleepy Hollow, but it still was a GREAT movie. For instance...Ichabod Crane was a teacher in Irving's version...Burton's - he was a constable. The movie had spectacular special effects and I'm not just saying that because I love special effects. I liked how Burton incorporated his own touch in the first scene..where VanGarett ran into the corn field and turned around and saw the scare crow with the pumpkin head...The pumpkin head face design looked very similar to Burton's character in "The Nightmare before Christmas." I highly recommend this film if you like horror/ thriller movies, a Johnny Depp and/or Christina Ricci fan, and you like special effects.. This movie is for you.</fullReview>

All i can think of is that i couldnt tell if the actors and actresses were playing a serious roll or comedy rolls.

		<fullReview>I wasn't too thrilled about the acting in this new take on the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Most of the other reviewers here have stated that Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were both spectacular, but in my opinion, almost any actor could have delivered a similar, if not better, performance. The plot, which is very different from the original story, was innovative, but the screenplay nearly ruins it by explaining the whole background in one speech towards the end instead of showing it to us.However, this movie is not a complete loss. It is almost fully redeemed by stunning cinematography and set design, as well as top-of-the-line special effects. The whole movie, from its opening scene to its ending, carries an appropriate, gloomy atmosphere. Director Burton perfectly captures the essence of 1799, better than other historical movies have been able to do. Okay, so I wasn't scared at all by this movie--it takes more than gore to frighten me--but it was an entertaining two hours. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Highly Recommended Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TITLE: Sleepy HollowRATING: ***1/2 (out of ****)A Review by BroncoWe've probably all read the classic tale "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving. If you're expecting a movie out of that story, look elsewhere. The plot is completely different and the only thing similar are the character's names. But this is definitely not a bad thing because this is a very good movie.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is an 18th century constable and uses forensic science. So a magistrate (Christopher Lee) sends him to Sleepy Hollow to solve murders where the victims were beheaded. So in Sleepy Hollow, he meets Baltus Van Tessel (Michael Gambon), his wife Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), the daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and a bunch of other people.So they tell him about the headless horseman (Christopher Walken), a hessian who loved to slice people's heads off. At first, Ichabod doesn't believe it until he sees the horseman himself and Ichabod's investigations go a little furthur and he has the help of young Masbath (Marc Pickering) and Katrina. Ichabod also happens to be haunted by visions of his childhood when his mother was killed by his father.This movie is very entertaining and will scare a lot of people. All the performances were done well but I thought Christina Ricci was a little miscast. Don't get me wrong, she did an excellent job but I just thought she was miscast but this is just a minor gripe. The beheadings all look very real and not phony. This is the first film that Tim Burton went full-blown horror and he did an excellent job.This was probably definitely one of the most entertaining films of 1999 (it was definitely the best horror film of 1999). I really enjoyed it, almost everything was done above average. The only major gripe I had was the miscasting of Ricci but that's minor. A very good horror film that horror fans should definitely see if they haven't already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has to be one of the best filmmakers in recent memory. He set the standard for the first 2 Batman films, he astounded us with his visual creativity with Edward Scissorhands, and he made everything that appeared in A nightmare before Christmas seem believable. Now he has brought us Sleepy Hollow which has to be one of the best films he has directed thus far. his vision for this film made it a truly great one.Here's the basic plots. In the small town of Sleepy Hollow murders are being committed where the killer is claiming the heads of it's victims. Constable Ichabod Crane is sent there to investigate and he believes the killer is of flesh and blood but the towns people know of the true horror in sleepy hollow and it's in the form of a headless horsemen. Soon crane discovers that all the victims are connected and that there is a conspiracy at hand.The acting in this film is great. Johnnt Depp is the most versatile actor of our generation. Crane is by far one of the best characters he has ever played. Chrstinna Ricci is good also but i do agree with the other comments that she needed just a bit more energy but she was good nonetheless.I truly recommend this film, but beware you might lose your head. j/k.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp impresses and Christina Ricci does her usual best but this is not a definite must see. Amazing sets, cinematography and solid visual effects can't seem to lift it beyond okay either.

		<fullReview>The basic plot: A skeptical and modern investigator, Ichabod Crane ,is assigned to a supernatural-ish case in small Sleepy Hollow, but soon descends into a dark web of murder,madness, and witchcraft.The praise: A spooky, dreamlike film.Johnny Depp is a tense object of nervous waves and intense delicacy in a great performance. Miranda Richardson is also very good in a good- hides-evil type performance. The film is incredible with it's mood and damp atmosphere , and as it exudes violence and grotesquerie , the combination of those two and the dark fantasy of the magic or supernatural scenes helps for perfect atmospherics. The inclusion of magic lanterns , technically complex crime toys and gadgets, and a frigid score help. Excellent cinematography. Great suspense and technical engineering at the end. The last shot is a picture perfect one of 18'th century New York, in a sophistacate snowstorm. This film literally DRIPS Burton from top to bottom to top. Ultraviolent.The flaws: The plot can seem tattered or confusing at times , and Christina Ricci gives an insubstantial performance.Note: The headless horseman looks like Sid Vicious! I'm listening to the Talking Heads singing "Burning Down the House" right now just to pad this review out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! The most fascinating movie I EVER SAW!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: this "might" contain spoilers..) Tim Burton again proved himself an extremely creative director through this movie, which- I think- the best among all his work. With the exception of the rushed exposition of the events, everything in the movie was excellent. While watching the movie,I was first fascinated by the marvellous music of Danny Elfman during the scene in which Van Garret was completing his will. Actually, the music was so impressive throughout the movie that in some scenes, you feel suspense not because of the scene but because of the music (e.g. the scene in which the doctor, notary, magistrate Philips and Reverend Steenwyck was discussing among themselves,etc..) Then, I was again fascinated- this time by the magnificient cinematography ( every time gloomy and colorless; causing us to feel the fear of death ) created by Emmanuel Lubezki, who won numerous awards by his great work in Sleepy Hollow. However, he could not win the Academy Award although he was one of the five nominees, and "American Beauty's" winning the Oscar for the best cinematography is - I think- one of the biggest mistakes in the 72-year-history of Academy Awards!! Moreover, the casting was wonderful- perhaps the greatest of this year. The only problem was that Christina Ricci could have played more enthusiastically, but that is all; everything else about the cast was perfect or nearly so. I especially loved Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman, yelling cruelly every time. Also, the makeup was so great that he seemed much more horrible than any of the characters in "Hammer" horror films. Besides, Johnny Depp's performance as "Ichabod Crane" and Miranda Richardson's both as "Lady Van Tassel" and "The Western Woods Crone" were really outstanding. Also, it was a nice surprise to see Christopher Lee, one of the biggest stars of "Hammer" horror films,in this movie. Though short, his performance as the burgomaster was absolutely impressive,adding much in the beginning to the moody atmosphere of the movie. Finally, the story was extremely breathtaking; no chance to get bored!!!! Perhaps, this was the greatest movie of this year!! 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Update of the classic Hammer Horror formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not a literal reading of Washington Irving's story, and only the most naive moviegoers would expect it to be. What it actually is, is a very clever update of the classic Hammer horror film formula.Hammer Film Productions produced excellently creepy British horror films in the late 50s, 60s and 70s, most of them involving Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (or occasionally Vincent Price) and truckloads of actresses stuffed into "buxom wench" costumes. The Hammer formula was to take a well known story - usually something by Edgar Allen Poe - load it up with sex, gore, bosoms, and weird plotlines - and let it loose.The presence of the venerable Mr. Lee himself at the beginning of this movie is a dead giveaway; this is Tim Burton's tribute to the classic Hammer Horror films. As such you're not meant to take it too seriously. Like the original Hammer horror movies it emulates, "Sleepy Hollow" is strictly for entertainment. Slightly gruesome entertainment, yes, but since when have horror movies been tasteful? And bear in mind the Hammer films were also criticized for the heapin' helpin' of gore they provided as well.However, Burton goes Hammer one better by giving us a complex storyline that would be well-suited to a detective movie, with suspicion swirling around everyone. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is delightful. His Ichabod Crane is always balancing between wanting to fall over in a faint at the horrors he sees and wanting to investigate the weird happenings he comes across in Sleepy Hollow.I never thought to use the words "sexy" and "Miranda Richardson" in the same sentence, but it happens here. Christina Ricci has been criticized in other reviews for giving a subdued performance, but her primary purpose in this movie is to look sweet (which she does) and fill out a corset and some low-cut gowns (which she also does to perfection). In short, she plays the same type of role as Hazel Court used to in the Hammer Horror films this movie recalls. That doesn't require acting skills so much as it does a soulful gaze and major cleavage, both of which Ricci has in abundance.To sum up, this movie is a lot of fun, and should not be taken terribly seriously. Burton does manage to throw a few barbs at fundamentalist Christianity, and at times he seems to have a definite sympathy for what appears to be a version of Wicca that some of the characters practice. However, this is really nothing to get riled about; once again, refer to the Hammer Horror precedents for this movie (The Curse of Frankenstein, The Horror of Dracula, etc.) or The Wicker Man (another Christopher Lee film) for a similar sideways look at Christianity, twenty to thirty years earlier.This movie works as both a suspense flick and a respectful but tongue-in-cheek tip of the hat to Hammer Film Productions. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you want a good evening of horror film fun, rent this, Vincent Price's "The Fall Of The House Of Usher," and "Horror of Dracula," and have yourself an evening of 19th century horrorifics. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a creepy, dark, yet strange fantasy / horror flick in the likes of well Tim Burton. Only he could make this the creepy fairytale it has become. But it is not merely his doing that makes this one such a good film. Johnny Depp (as the New Yorker who at first mocks the small - towners for their beliefs and then becomes astonished and terrified after witnessing the Headless Horseman) and Christina Ricci (as the fair, enchanting, mystic, big breasted (she's not playing that you must know????? ??.DAMN) maiden who is attracted to Depp) are really good + they also have good chemistry. By the way, another comment on Ricci, I like what she does, always playing non ? ordinary women + I like the way she looks, no too pretty and painted and plastic, but normal, natural an pretty good (THANK GOD, NOT EVERYONE IS A BRITNEY SPEARS - -LIKE MODEL, which also is true of the pretty Kate Winslet of course. GO GIRLS!!!!!!!!)The supporting cast is good too, as is the music the decoration, the blood, the story and of course the Headless Horseman (note: THE HEADLESS ONE). That stuntman (RAY PARK) is really great, swinging that axe and sword and fighting. He's GREAT just as he was in The Phantom Menace (please HOLLYWOOD ? PEOPLE, choose him more often. A creepy fairytale to remember!!!!!! (Watch it with your girlfriend if you can!!!!!)8 out of 10 (Recommended!!!!!!!!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of fun if you don't expect too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ads promise that "heads will roll"; this is decidedly not metaphorical. Indeed, from start to finish in "Sleepy Hollow" noggins are lopped off with alarming frequency. Tim Burton's sabbatical from directing (since 1996's befuddled "Mars Attacks") is gleefully broken by his take on the "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", in this instance a murder mystery that is only tangentially related to the Washington Irving classic. Depp is convincing as Ichabod Crane, a foppish constable devoted far more to "cause and consequence" than the paranormal. His reasoning is severely tested when charged with solving a series of mysterious and graphic murders in the eponymous hamlet in upstate New York. Confounding his analysis are clues defying scientific approach and his attraction to the ethereal Katrina (Ricci), leading him to suspect that the vengeance-driven 'Headless Horseman' is all too other-worldly. Not unexpectedly, Burton's reputation for evocative production design and photography is well-evidenced here. Awash in a spectrum of greyish hues resembling a charcoal drawing (save for occasional splashes of crimson), his vision of a spooky village and surrounding wood help serve an only-satisfactory tale of mayhem on the eve of the 19th century. Buoyed by a lively finale and spectacular stunt work by the 'Horseman' (Ray Park, who impressed as Darth Maul in "Phantom Menace"), this edition of Sleepy Hollow is an amusingly creepy diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>marvelous costumes and scenery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.The worst thing about the movie was the music. It was quite dreadful and lacked any sort of synchronization with the ongoing plot. Mystery music continued through the comical scenes so much that it confuses the watcher and almost hides the comedy itself. It did very little to strengthen the plot and most of the scenes could have done without music entirely as the scenery, color, sound, plot, and acting were more than capable of sustaining the movie's quality.I really didn't know what to expect when going into this. Some critics bashed it for not sticking to the book and others praised the costumes and scenery. I don't see the veering from the book's plot a weakness at all. In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.I was a bit confused about Ichabod Crane's character and personality. Although Depp appeared to play what was directed, the character itself seemed to lack the intelligence, experience, and couth you'd expect from the character in the original story. But alas, this is a rewrite, so I probably should not criticize for this.Christina Ricci (Katrina) definitely shows promise although she appeared to lack enthusiasm. For that much money, you would expect her to be able to "fake it", but it was still a decent job. Miranda Richardson (Lady Van Tassel) had some good moments, but she also lacked enthusiasm and seemed very distant at times. She has proven worthy with perfect performances in "Merlin" and "Alice in Wonderland".Fabulous performances by all of the members on the town's council, but Jeffrey Jones is still stuck in my head as "Charles Deitz" in "Beetlejuice".Christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!! Don't worry, you won't miss him. He was a perfect choice for the role and will be the face to remember the movie by (Sorry Johnny).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow has everything you could ask for in a scary horror movie. A CREEPY killer, a creepy setting and a creepy plot. The setting is magnificent and the art direction was the best of the year. Sleepy Hollow was a great setting because they never got any sunlight and it looked majorly depressing and deadly. A creepy sort of fog was always appearing. Now, Ichabod Crane was the big mistake the movie made. He was a psycopathic lunatic who probably should have been thrown in the Sleepy Hollow asylum. His voice was high and stupid sounding while his tactics were pathetic. The horseman should have come after him the first chance he got. The plot of the movie tied in with a strange event that happened about thirty years before when a beheading criminal was executed in the forest in front of two apparently ANGELIC young girls. Then it takes off from there, the horseman killing old men to six year old boys hiding underneath floorboards. You will definitely like Sleepy Hollow if you're a horror fan, but if you're not you won't care how Ichabod got the strange marks on his hands or why the horseman only kills certain people...</fullReview>

It looked really nice but lacked substance. Dreams sequences of Crane's Victoria Secret clad mother had to be added as filler. They had nothing to do with the story. Most of the female leads seemed dressed in wonder bras. Unfortunately missing was the legendary Ricci cleavage.</fullReview>

Though the story has been changed somewhat from the original Washington Irving's story, the tale's suspense is kept in tack.

And Tim's streak is still alive in this awesome movie with great perfromances by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (who for once is not playing a slut) Now I will admit that Tim Burton has a weird mind but a good one and he shows it all in this movie. Everything was great about this film. The acting, the story, the direction by Burton, the music, and the special effects. There's also a little bit of darkish comedy. Very like Tim Burton. And the violence in it is pretty bloody so watch for that too. There's not much to say except if you like Tim Burton or you're a big fan of the book, or you like bloody movies that get right to the point then this is your movie!

For Christmas I received the book sleepy hollow that was written from the movie and then the real story by Washington Irving afterwards. It was so good because it made you want to read it all the time until the end and I finished the book in 3 days. (not constantly reading of course, I'm not that slow of a reader) It described the gory details so vividly that I thought the movie was going to be really gross and disgusting with blood. And then I found out it was. Well, not really. My imagination made the book good. But I absolutely fell in love with the movie. I think everyone loved Johnny Depp's portrayal of Icabod Crane. I know I did. (tee hee) His acting was so good because of his facial expressions and the fact that Icabod is so timid and meek that he faints every time something graphic happens. And hats off to Mr. Burton. He rocks at making scary movies. My favorite is The Nightmare Before Christmas. Keep on rollin'.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is quite good as the constable Ichabod Crane. He plays Crane as an analytical fussbudget with a weak stomach at the sight of blood which makes for some of the more humorous elements in the film. Alas, Christina Ricci is not effective at all as Katrina. No passion, no depth. Quite a waste really. The rest of the cast features some great performances by leading British actors and the addition of Christopher Lee was a treat! The sets and backdrop were perfect.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but overly ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I see a Tim Burton film, I usually come away with a sense of awe and bewilderment. I am in awe of his visual imagery (though I don't particularly like his penchant for dark exposures and washed out colors) and I am perplexed at his use of this genius to create such bizarre and twisted films.What is most disturbing about this film is that it tries to pass itself off as being based on Washington Irving's classic short story. This is not even loosely based on that masterpiece. It bears no more resemblance to the ?Legend of Sleepy Hollow' than Johnny Depp bears to Ichabod Crane. To put Irving's name and title on this goes beyond artistic license to shameless artistic forgery for its commercial value.This is not to say that this isn't a good story. It is an excellent story. I just object to the artistic deception. What is sad is that we have a whole generation who will never read the story and believe they know it because they saw this film. That being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres. Burton attempts to create a comedy horror action adventure mystery romance. It has too many competing elements that distracted us from the main plot. The comedy element is the least effective. Burton's wry attempts at humor are sophomoric and puerile and detract from the better elements of the film, namely the horror/mystery aspect.From the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful. The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel. The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology. The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.Johnny Depp did a fine job as the bumbling constable. He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation. Christina Ricci was well cast as the coquettish Katrina. Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.I rated this film a 7/10. It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts. And Washington Irving it ain't.</fullReview>

For one, Depp makes the same motion/face too many times during the film. The actors did not turn in believable reactions after seeing countless people decapitated.The plot twists become far too complex at the end, and i could not figure out just what the secret villain was conjuring the horseman for.The three highest points: the villains, art direction, gothic eerieness. There are 2 villains- The horseman as a german mercenary (christopher walken) and the horseman as he appears in the previews. Episode 1's ray parks portrays the horseman in the hand 2 hand combat scenes, some other person plays him in the riding sequences. All three provide the film with terror in style.</fullReview>

I pretty much loved this movie. Christina Ricci was fun to watch in this movie. I would consider this movie one of her best. Johnny Depp is strange as usual. He so looked his Edward Scissorhands best. Some of the whigs in here are recognizable, and totally fun. This was also classic Christopher Walken. He was born to play roles like this. It wouldn't be a horrific movie without him. ---POSSIBLE Spoilers:::::Some points I didn't like was the very end of the movie. I would have thought just cutting it after he faints woulda been fun. Or ending the movie at sleepy hollow somewhere would have been fun. As always, it's always tricky after changing the ending of a classic (ie The Scarlet Letter (demi moore)... which actually I didn't mind that change. however The Crucible (Winona Ryder) didn't change the ending and it also did a good job.)I also thought having some idiot placing that idiotic flaming pumpkin scene was unnessessary. Why have it? It wasn't pertenent to the story. I haven't ever read the book, but I just thought it distracting.I give this a 7 out of 10. But very entertaining it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thrilled from start to finish, I can certainly understand the rave reviews throughout much of Europe for the recently reinterpreted (and slightly renamed) "Sleepy Hollow: The legend of the headless horseman" by Tim Burton and now featuring three-time collaborator "par excellence" Johnny Depp who - as I have said before - is the most under-rated actor of his generation in Hollywood. Between this and the recent "Ninth Gate", I find myself at odds as to which is Depp's very best performance, but viewers will find he just keeps getting better and better with time. How he continually escapes notice at awards time continues to amaze and cause no small amount of chagrin. The film is top-notch, I don't care what language you see it in, JUST GO SEE IT. Rating 5 stars (of five !), and with greatest pleasure. (Honourable mention to British veterain Michael Gambon and a very well-matched Christina Ricci, too!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Burton's best films are a personal labor of love. "Beetlejuice", "Ed Wood" and "Edward Scissorhands" are all great because Burton's infectious enthusiasm ends up being projected throughout all elements of the film - from the actors to the set designers and the soundtrack composer (invariably Danny Elfman). The results are fascinatingly bizarre characters, fantastic visuals and entertaining off-kilter moods that more than compensates for the director's (self-confessed) deficiencies as a straight storyteller."Sleepy Hollow" is no different. A grand gothic mystery set in an expressionistic vision of rural New York in the late 18th Century, Burton paints a picture of people under siege from supernatural forces, while a lone outsider (Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane) attempts to rectify the situation.The look of "Sleepy Hollow" beats anything Burton has done before. The intricately detailed set design brings out every nook and cranny, makes every wooden door, thatched roof, even the leaves seem real enough to touch. The cinematography is amazing, seeming to leach the color out of every surface to the point that the movie almost seems black and white, so that when color does appear (usually the crimson red blood of the Headless Horseman's victims) it is like a rich visual eruption that focuses your attention. I've never seen anything like it, except maybe Neil Jordan's "Company of Wolves".The special effects are all seamless and perfectly suit the action. Decapitations, stabbings, rotting corpses and hideous witches all done with typical professional aplomb by Kevin Yagher (make-up) and ILM, making the magic come alive. Also, kudos to Nick Gillard and Ray Park from "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" to bringing their physical gifts to "Sleepy Hollow" in order to make the skull-challenged Hessian warrior truly a force to be reckoned with.The acting is wonderful - everyone camps it up to the perfect degree - whether to express dread or menace. Johnny Depp is a bag of surprises, as always, adopting a Colonial English accent and fussy, scared demeanor that suits his smart, educated, but definitely inexperienced New England constable, and makes him a memorable character. I also thoroughly enjoyed seeing some of my favorite Brits - Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Steve Waddington and Michael Gambon. Miranda Ricahrdson was wonderful as always, and Christopher Lee's cameo reminds you of why he was Hammer's No. 1 guy. Only Christina Ricci disappoints. The fire her more recent film roles have displayed is nowhere to be seen. It seems like she's trying to hard to be "respectable" here, and it's boring.I've read a couple of reviews that criticized the divergence from Washington Irving's original story. I actually like the the way in which "Sleepy Hollow" deviates from its source; it is very much in keeping with the way the old Hammer horror films (and their American counterparts at AIP)- Burton's admitted inspirations for this film- messed with their stories. Regarding the addition of very modern action scenes to the story - anyone remember the blood and thunder climax of "Horror of Dracula" in which Van Helsing goes mano y mano with the Prince of Darkness? Personally, the results are wonderful.I noticed that "Sleepy Hollow" was produced by Francis Ford Coppola, who also produced versions of Dracula and Frankenstein, making this his third foray into old-style Gothic horror. In my humble opinion, this is the first time he got it right.</fullReview>

At first, I was hesitant to watch this film because of the what critics had said about this film, but I thought to myself everyone should judge for themselves.I thought "Scream 3" was scary but I found a movie that equalled it. "Sleepy Hollow" does a great job of grossing everyone out by showing the severed heads and even the insides of he heads.This movie turned out to be an incredible murder mystery that tested the mind as to figure out what the real plot was. I enjoyed how Tim Burton maneuvered the cast into not revealing too much of the true plot until just the right time.My favorite scenes in this movie came when the headless horsemen came out of the dead man's tree. However, every scene in "Sleepy Hollow" was excellent and my favorite because it kept my interest as well as wanting to know what would happen next.Johnny Depp's performance in "Sleepy Hollow" was his best since his portrayal of Donnie Brasco "Donnie Brasco." Depp knew just what to say and when to say it. I was truly blown away by his performance.If I ever saw a movie that was underrated, it would be "Sleepy Hollow." I recommend this movie because it has thrills, chills, action and dramatic scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though not his best movie ( I liked Edward Scissorhands the best), the Direction is excellent. Though I was not scared out of my wits, the atmosphere was eerie. Christopher Walken was very good, and Johnny Depp was adequete. My favorite scenes were right at the beginning of the film and the scene which explains the story of the Headless Horseman. Worth watching...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's best to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to make a really good scary movie. There's so much to achieve: eye-catching art direction, zany yet followable cinematography, chilling scares, and a never boring story. Few scary movies have accomplished these tasks at once; "Aliens", "Scream", "Bram Stoker's Dracula", "Child's Play", and "Psycho" are just some of the few. "Sleepy Hollow" is, in my opinion, Tim Burton's best film yet. Better than "Batman". If you add up all of "Hollow"'s successes (box-office, Oscars, reviews), it's easy to see why. It might not have been a big a blockbuster as "Batman" or "Batman Returns", or won as many Oscars as "Ed Wood", but it got just as good reviews, and grossed over $100 million.The reason I loved this movie so much was because I barely knew anything about it. The trailers didn't give anything away, and luckily I missed the making of it, which really spoiled it. I won't tell you much about the movie except that the Oscar-winning art direction is excellent (along with the Oscar nominated cinematography and costumes), Johnny Depp shows us another side to himself (like in "Ed Wood), and the unbilled actor who plays The Headless Horseman is the only one who could do it (if you don't know who it is, catch the MTV movie awards on June 8, he's up for Best Villian).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For a bad film, very good indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's better for a film to have good art direction than a good cast. Not that I want to begin by complaining about the cast. It's always a delight to lay eyes on Christina Ricci, all the old codgers of the town are very well done, and Johnny Depp is more or less tolerable role that appears to have been written with Rowan Atkinson in mind (it's a pity he wasn't available). But a good cast can't rescue a bad script, whereas good art direction, to some degree, can. And, to some degree, it does. This is a gorgeous, amazingly CONSISTENT looking film. Sleepy Hollow is not so much a town as a world. And the woods outside, and New York itself, belong to the very same world. There are one or two neat cinematic ideas: the two girls with the twigs, Christina Ricci's ambiguous white cloak ... actually, that's just two, but I wasn't taking notes.But, too be honest, the visual ideas aren't THAT great. Look at this work next to a REAL masterwork of design and the difference is at once apparent. Many of Burton's images don't even justify themselves, let alone the narrative digressions they necessitate - such as the laboured, overwrought and irrelevant whodunnit. There's a limit, after all, to how many people can die in the attempt to prevent further deaths before it all becomes just too ridiculous, and that point is passed after an hour or so, with half the village still to die. I don't think I've ever seen so many corpses in a detective story. Furthermore the explanation given for Ichabod's so-called obsessions is the usual kind of childhood-rooted psycho-analytical rubbish, put in because the writers read somewhere that characters need `motivation' and didn't realise that THIS kind of motivation reduces a flesh-and-blood character to the status of a simple wind-up toy. All that guff about the poverty of reason which WE must endure because of Ichabod's childhood trauma is predicably trite. Basically this a confused film, at war with itself in too many ways for me to tell you them all. Let a single instance suffice. After all of Burton's effort and guile has given us a good Headless Horseman, he becomes just another guy on a horse in the chase scene towards the end. Ichabod actually pinches his horse! and a black denizen of Hell suddenly becomes as alarming as a spare bicycle.I wasn't kidding earlier when I said that the poor script is - to a degree - rescued by art direction. It's refreshing to see a really-well crafted fantasy world, one that isn't just our own world in disguise. Of course it matters that what HAPPENS in this world isn't worth recounting, but strangely it doesn't matter as much as you might think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely creepy, but not really Burton's forte</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ever-so-slightly odd director Tim Burton and his favourite actor, the similarly bizarre Johnny Depp, returned to the silver screen in this retelling of Washington Irving's literary classic.Depp plays Constable Ichabod Crane, a methodical detective from New York. He is sent to the backwater of Sleepy Hollow in upstate N.Y. in the year 1799, in order to investigate a series of decapitations. When the culprit turns out to be the headless ghost of an evil mercenary (Christopher Walken with head, Ray ?Darth Maul' Park without) Crane is forced to re-evaluate his scientific principles. His detective skills are still relevant as a pattern to the supernatural murders emerges with a conspiracy not far behind. In the meantime, Crane falls for local beauty Kristina (Christina Ricci), daughter of the wealthy Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon). Johnny Depp turns in a predictably idiosyncratic performance as the squeamish Crane, giving him an infectious enthusiasm and a silly accent. The rest of the cast camp it up, as you would expect ? it is hardly stretching for the likes of Ian McDiarmid or Miranda Richardson. Christina Ricci has a strange, elfin quality that Burton obviously admires, but she seems out of place ? too old to be playing Wednesday Addams again, perhaps.As you might expect from a Tim Burton film, style abounds. Burton invests the town of Sleepy Hollow with a low-key gothic look that adds immeasurably to the creepy appeal of the film. For this is not really a horror film, despite the obvious Hammer influences (Christopher Lee has a cameo as Crane's superior). The gory beheadings and action sequences feel out of place with the tone of the rest of the film, especially Crane's dreams. Rather, this is an eerie mystery with more than a touch of compassion and humour in which the subject matter of the plot does not fit particularly well. Well worth seeing, this nonetheless feels as though the director and the story are wrong for each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The creepiest movie in years,with a delicious visual flair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing this movie gives one a real understanding of how important detail is to the tone and context of a movie.The entire Sleepy Hollow town gives a sense of surreal foreboding and excitement,and the Woods give a sense of a maze-like Hell:each tree looks like a gnarled creature.Noticing things like that takes a second viewing,though. When you see Hollow the first time,you're swept away by the main character:NO,not Ichabod.The Horseman!The Headless Horseman steals the show almost instantly.Not since the T-1000 in Terminator 2 has a villain moved with such unstoppable motive and force:when he stomps towards a victim,twirling his axe with supernatural style,you know instantly the poor sap is doomed.Ray Park did a fantastic job with his fancy sword-work,horse riding,and just basic movement.This villian is truly amazing,and the effects are seamless and amazing.This monstrous villian is the #1 reason to see this movie.Aside from that and the backrounds,the costumes,props,and Elfman's fantastic score are great.Hm?Oh...the acting.Well...it leaves a little to be desired.You end up losing track of the victims' names,which becomes very important to know later in the movie.The drab,gray scenes take their toll when there's supposed to be an emotional scene-it's just too drab to show anything but apprehension.I was a little surprised to find that a good deal of the movie had mystery elements,when it was obviously advertised as a horror movie.Those are somewhat excusable though-it's just a movie that's better seen than heard(quite a coincidence that the best character-the Horseman-has no lines). So don't wait to see this one.Press the mute button and enjoy this Burton masterpiece!</fullReview>

It had great actors and actresses, it had great speacial effects, it had great costumes, it had a great setting, and it was a lot of fun. Now I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and of Tim Burton.

I will definetly be on line on opening day for the next Tim Burton film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Best--Stunning!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you see Sleepy Hollow, it's quite apparent that this is a Tim Burton film. It is visually stunning, with each detail in the frame carefully seen to. While the plot differs dramatically with Irving's original story, I personally like this version better. While Christina Ricci brings a fresh, cool take on Katrina Van Tassel, her performance can be slightly flat at times. However, I don't feel this detracts from the film at all. The true jewel in this movie is Johnny Depp. His fine performance as the slightly cowardly-yet-intelligent Ichabod Crane drives the film, bringing a complexity and real-worldness to the character. Ichabod is not your typical action hero facing down a bloodthirsty ghost--what other movie hero do you know that responds to danger by pulling the nearest child in front of him for protection, or jumps onto a chair at the mere sight of a spider? Depp pulls this off marvelously, and his facial expressions masterfully convey terror, queasiness, embarrassment, and confusion throughout the film. Mr. Depp should be proud of his performance. Sleepy Hollow is a film I highly recommend; Depp makes up for weaknesses in Ricci's acting and the plot line, as well as the weaknesses in the character of Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson). In short, see this film--Burton, Depp, and the film's composer, Danny Elfman, deserve high praise for their work on it. I highly recommend the soundtrack as well--it is Elfman's best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW is an exceptional film, in my opinion Tim Burton's best. It's everything a film should be - brilliantly imagined and executed. The cinematography and editing are exceptional and should have won Oscars. Also top notch is Elfman's dramatic and eerie score, the crisp and sonorous sound and the Oscar-winning Art Direction. The gore is not gratuitous, though I would not recommend it for children at all, even with parental attendance. Depp is quite fine in the lead and the character actors surrounding him have a field day. Did any bird watchers notice the error in assigning the cardinal to New York State (twice in the film)? In 1799 this was a strictly Southern bird that never made it north of the Mason Dixon line, only doing so within the past fifty years. A wonderful feast for the eyes and ears - edge of your seat excitement all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy Hollow is wide awake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has got to be one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Even though I did not get to see it at the theatres I was impressed by the scenes none the less. Sleepy Hollow is loosely based upon the story by Washington Irving, in which Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is out to find the Headless Horseman ( Christopher Walkin), while winning the heart of Katrina (Christina Ricci). This is the only thing that the film and the story have in common.Despite this minor inconsistancy, the film is a wonderful success. We haven't seen Johnny Depp in such a memorable role since Edward Scissorhands. Christina Ricci look absolutley stunning, have matured more in her film roles since playing Wednesday Addams in the popular Addam's Family movies. But I have one question for all of you reading this....Did the woman who played Ichabod's mother in the flash backs look like Alanis Morrisette?????? I thought it was her twin!!This movie is visually stunning and the ever popular controversy of Science vs. Religion figures in well in this film. I did not feel that this movie was rushed at all. All the questions I was asking during the film wrapped up in the end and left me completely statisfied. Tim Burton has done a wonderful job reviving this classic tale for the big screen, this is the best adaptation since Walt Disney's version. I give this instant classic a 9 out of 10....Get out there and see it!!!!!</fullReview>

I've pretty much grown up along with Christina Ricci and she did a great job as mysterious Katrina.The cinematography and Colleen Atwood's beautiful period costumes were perfect.

Tim Burton seems to be breaking new territory with this film in a style that can only be defined as "Burtonesque". Sleepy Hollow is very gory for a Burton film and can easily be called a horror movie, but I think it will still please viewers outside of the genre. I was afraid after seeing the flop Mars Attacks that Burton's career was over, but Sleepy Hollow has proved me dead wrong. This film is pure entertainment and excitement and was very intelligently made. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

The girl that witnessed the beheading said that she "sold her soul to satan that moment."It is well pounded in my head that witchcraft has nothing to do with satan, but in the movie, satan and witchcraft were paired up once more.I also found the clash between science and religion (Christianity) and paganism and religion interesting. I.e., the comment of "The only book you need to know is..." (WHAM) - the Holy Bible plopped in front of the constable.Good movie, nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Sleepy Hollow,' though no worse than dozens of other similarly designed films, seems as good a spot as any to pull back and ask ourselves this question: are special effects ruining the movies? Time was when filmmakers, sorely hampered by technological limitations, were forced to make a virtue out of necessity and develop scripts filled with subtlety, imagination and humor to help sustain an audience's attention. Now, all a filmmaker need do it seems is provide the barest essentials in terms of plot and character development in the vain hope that the astonishingly realistic special effects will single-handedly carry the day. Such a philosophy, however, far more often than not, leaves the audience feeling assaulted, detached and empty, both mentally and emotionally.Like so many films, `Sleepy Hollow' starts out promisingly. No one is better at establishing a mood of bizarre, otherworldly eeriness than director Tim Burton and `Sleepy Hollow' is certainly a total triumph in terms of its art direction, set decoration and cinematography. Through these elements, Burton creates an entire sunless world of mist-shrouded bogs and forests, filled with twisted, gnarled trees, somber graveyards and dreary lonely roads that greet many a quaking traveler with doom and destruction. For, in this quaint New England village of Sleepy Hollow, a number of citizens have been recently dispatched in a most inglorious way - cut down, literally, by the avenging headless horseman, their heads sliced off and carried away leaving only the decapitated bodies behind as a reminder of their earthly existence. Into this scene of inexplicable death and carnage comes Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York investigator sent to the town to unravel the mystery.Very loosely based on Washington Irving's classic tale, `Sleepy Hollow,' almost inevitably it seems, violates the spirit of the original through the customary reliance on over-literalization. The headless horseman, like so many figures of classic horror literature, is a creature best left in the abstract, for once he has been realized on screen, much of the majesty and mystery that comprise his aura simply evaporate. Absolutely nothing is left to the imagination. He is interesting and frightening as long as he remains off-stage. The moment he gets off his horse and starts swinging his sword in full view of the camera he loses those qualities. Despite the magnificent atmosphere, we find ourselves growing more and more restless as the body count begins to swell, especially since the explanation for the horseman's actions, when it is finally revealed to us, comes across as both confused and uninspired. Once again, a film filled with so much quality and potential at the beginning simply collapses under the weight of conventional storytelling and over-reliance on special effects.The writer attempts to bring humanity to Ichabod by emphasizing his nervousness, hesitancy and squeamishness, yet Depp is allowed to play the scenes with such a comic undertone that he undercuts the thriller aspects of the work. This technique worked brilliantly in his portrayal of Ed Wood because that was a film filled with warmhearted affection for its subject. Here, the tone works against the intended mood and leaves the audience confused as to just what type of film `Sleepy Hollow' was intended to be. The flat performances delivered by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson don't help a bit either.Thus, `Sleepy Hollow,' though definitely worth seeing for its many technical marvels, fails to emerge as a very compelling film overall. Though I know it has become fashionable lately to pooh-pooh `The Blair Witch Project' for its lack of visualization and cinematic finesse, I sincerely believe that the sense of terror lurking in its forest far surpasses that found in Burton's, for all the latter's big budget impressiveness. Once again, a movie proves that money alone - and great visuals to boot - cannot buy - or guarantee - a quality film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I want to start by saying that this film definitely had the best lighting/visual image of 1999. I in fact have never been so impressed by a films "look." This is one of the reasons that it is very high ranking on my best-ever-movies list. My compliments to the special effects &amp; art departments.I hadn't noticed until recently how good an actress Christina Ricci was. After watching her performances in 'The Opposite of Sex', 'The Ice Storm' and 'ahem 'Little Red Riding Hood'; it spurred me on to want to see her in 'Sleepy Hollow.' And for those of you who haven't seen it yet, she doesn't disappoint. The same can be said of Johnny Depp (who I'm actually not a great fan of - but after this movie, I may have to become one!) and the rest of the cast.The story is very good as well. Not the most intellectual film ever, but then not every movie has to be. This film may not be Oscar material, but it excels in its field of capturing, holding and entertaining the viewer. It's like a book you'll read again and again and won't want to put down. I have been waiting anxiously for 4-5 months for it to come out on DVD, and I never say that about a film!Put simply, this film is great. Great acting, great story, great look. Go see it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is Tim Burton in more realm style. A bit like Edward Scissorhands with Ed Wood style. The story actually a bit similar with the X-Files, an unsolved mystery, hidden crime, and supranatural matters... Trust No One... But here, Tim Burton, still with his favourite actor, Johny Depp presents more mature ways of movie story telling. The casts are played strict to their characters, and even Danny Elfman score seems more mature, not playful as Mars Attack! or other Burton-Elfman scores, but makes bigger score this way. The effects are usual (for this time), but to be noted, some interesting appearance from Martin Landau, Casper Van Diem, and off course Christopher Walken. Very impressing. Christina Ricci, again after Beetlejuice plays a character which has an attraction to witchcraft. But this time she was covered by Johny Depp strong plays. The picture are beautiful. The Production Designer really do well here. And the cinematography are equal to them, and able to intrepert the story and moods needed. Outstanding movie destined to be another Tim Burton's classic.</fullReview>

Barton's headless horseman is unstopable machine of horror and death, you could feel the despair of his victims. The main character Ichabod (Like Captain Ahab, this character also have a cursed name - indignity) is magnificently played by Depp. His overacting in the tradition of the 20s silent pictures makes his character both funny and powerful. Alas some of the other characters are dwarved next to him and acting like a cliche. I give this picture 8.5 out of 10, and in my scale that's a lot. Go see the picture, unless of course, you are too scared of blood and severed organs, hahahaha....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't passed through such a joy of perceiving the image for a long time. This movie has an absolutely brilliant image, lights and thus atmosphere. It's visual pleasure at its best! Great special effects as well but wisely inserted here and there so that the unaware eye won't notice.I also enjoyed the discreet humor opposing the dramatical plot. The only drawbacks are the classical story (due to the 19th century book) and some evident commercial compromises like the explosion of the windmill which made the public burst out laughing.But again, magnificent image!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hauntingly grotesque, in a good way of course...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane, an officer of the law, deported to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, where quite a few headless corpses have been found. He believes in science and is no man of superstition and therefore when the villagers tell him its the acts of a certain headless horseman (Cristopher Walken), he (of course) does not believe them... At first.This is a one and a half hours pure entertainment. From the ghoulish opening with Danny Elfmans (I must say brilliant) score drumming through your head to the bloody finale. It's a clean mixture of horror, comedy and dark fairy tale. Tim Burton ("Edward Scissorhands", "Batman") has succeeded in making a really good, clean horror film reminding a lot of the "good old days" when Hollywood was still young. I'm referring to such classics as "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" with many others.I haven't seen a real, good and funny horror film in years. If you like horror, Tim Burton and the crazy music of Danny Elfman this is absolutely something you should go see, and if you haven't heard of Tim Burton or of Danny Elfman and dislike horror films in general, give this one a shot. Believe me when I say that it's different. Different to the kinds of horror we're used to. Gives frights, laughs and chills.It really deserved an Oscar for Best Set Design. The sets are marvellous! Astonishing!Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie could've been much better without all the nasty decapitations. This could even have been a good family movie, but no, they had to throw in all the ketchup to scare us. Well, it didn't scare me, it disgusted me.Aside from the excessive amount of blood, this horror film is not bad. Some scenes really are frightening, like when he finds all those heads in the tree and when he meets the dead sister. What sort of disturbed me was the romance between him and the girl, it was really boring and very clich. What i did like about it (the movie), was that it was very unpredictable, i could never guess what would happen next. Sometimes Danny Elfman's score was too loud, especially in the opening credits. It almost deafened me! Cinematography was very good, great costumes, great overall look.If you like these kinds of stories, i guess it's worth seeing, but you have to know a little bit what it's about, or you'll be confused!(one more complaint: the ending was too exaggerated and farfetched when compared to the rest of the movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well that's for sure. What is most striking for 'Sleepy Hollow' is its extreme visually attractiveness. Everything looks the way it should. Or: everything looks as imperfect as it should. Does this make 'Sleepy Hollow' a realistic movie: no (even besides the practically unrealistic story). But that won't decrease the fun watching the movie.The characters are quite one-dimensional. Johnny Depp's part though is quite realistic since it is one of the rare heroes that is actually more afraid than heroic. Ricci's part is as flat as all the other parts in the movie. But maybe this was Burton's intention anyway... to do some self-parody.The visual effects are amazing though which makes up for a lot and the beginning credits are hauntingly beautiful.This is just a movie to watch not to look at all the little mistakes in the screenplay (like the American flags that look very much like the current one although the story is set somewhere in the 1790's).I would say: 8 out of 10, but that's because it's Tim Burton and because of the visual credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most amazingly beautiful films I have ever seen. The costumes, the cinematography, the production design, the two leads (Depp and Ricci) et cetera. It is worth it to watch this film just to experience the dark beauty of it. However, the film is quite good in its own right. It's a nice mix of horror and beheadings and a little comedy as well. Depp is brilliant as Ichabod Crane -- he does a lot of swooning while trying to remain calm. But hey, if a headless Christopher Walken on a black horse was coming after you set to separate your head from your body with a long sword, wouldn't you swoon at least once as well? :-) "Sleepy Hollow" definitely got that dark Tim Burton-feel over it, while it is not as strange as some of his other films, and there's some comic relief as well and thank god for that because otherwise all those beheadings would have been insufferable.

		<shortDescription>An admirable version of a classic story (there may be a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is a very well-done film that deserves to be recognised. The acting is excellent through and through. Johnny Depp excellently plays the superstitious (and humorously frightened) Constable Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci is even more excellent as his love interest Katrina Van Tassel. If anyone is not expecting this film to be different than the Washington Irving novel and the Disney cartoon, well, it is, and far more detailed. It had to be, in order to make this movie full-length. For instance (this could be a spoiler), The Headless Horseman (excellently played by Christopher Walken) is controlled. But every new plot element is NEEDED in this film, and none are unnecessary! The art direction (and the acting, again) is marvellous. Even the sky is gray until the end. The gore level is low and the comic relief (mostly by Johnny Depp) makes the movie seem less scary (by the way, it is not very scary for the most part, but that's OK). Also, one can certainly read the novelette and see the Disney cartoon (and enjoy both) before or after they see this movie. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with each version. I read the book shortly before I first saw this movie (I've seen the movie 3 times since before Thanksgiving), and have always loved the cartoon "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", which is very much like the novel. The novel is somewhat wordy and can be hard to follow, so I only suggest one reads it if they like tackling hard stuff. Otherwise, go ahead and enjoy these three classics!</fullReview>

This is what Depp is trying to find out while the murders still continue.Excellent support provided by Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken who is outstanding yet again.The whole film is brilliantly made with some breathtaking cinematography, and an authentic gothic atmosphere.Although there is a lot of heads rolling the film is not very violent as it manages to keep a comic-horror look in everything.Easily the best film Burton made in years and the kind of films that only he can do.Hugely enjoyable and not to be missed.</fullReview>

And I didn't understand why the character of Mr. Depp, Ichabod Crane, often knew what to do, even if he believes in science and logic and had to fight against spiritual things.

There's a strange atmosphere in this movie, I think it's a perfect "Halloween Movie" with mystery, death, fear and a splendid art direction. The tribute of Burton to Hammer is perfect, because it respects the rules of the good horror movie "Not blood but fear. Not screams but subtle terror". It is perfect with a great Johnny Depp and an evil(fantastic her final monologue)Miranda Richardson (she deserved and Oscar nomination). Great cameo by Martin Landau. I hope that the 3 nominations will become 3 Oscars. You know, I think that Jack O' Lantern isn't a legend. It works in Hollywood and his name is Tim Burton. I'm right, do you agree?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all, it's very difficult to comment on this movie.At first I have to say that the atmosphere was great, with this I mean the music, the fantastic set, the costumes and so on. The actors were great, too, especially Mr. Depp and Christina Ricci. But, unfortunately, there are many bad things that can be said about the movie. The first bad thing is the story. It might be true that everyone in the United States knows the story, but we here in Germany or even Western Europe don't know it. That's why I personally had problems with following the story: Who murdered who, the scenes in which Crane explains this are much too short, while the action scenes, especially those at the end, are much too long. SPOILER! And I really think that the idea that the stepmother controls the hessian horseman to kill this other family is a bit weird. The worst thing about the movie is, that it can't be put in any genre. This might be good sometimes, but here it isn't. I wasn't scared while watching the movie, because there were to many funny scenes. And it wasn't really a Whodunit, as i expected it to be (I didn't know the story, as told above). well, after all, some scenes were really great, SPOILER! for example when Crane finds his mother, so after all I give this movie 7 / 10 points.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>more laughs than horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I am not actually a big fan of Tim Burton. but..... this movie is far better than I expected.First of all, it is as stylishly throughout and with some nice, grotesque teasers ( Icabud Crane's "surgery" implements seem to have come right from the 'Edward Scissorhands' set ) and very consequent camerawork, both with regard to lighting, viewing angles, cuts and a deliberately limited palette of colours used, as one has come to expect of Burton, whatever else his directing shortcomings ( if any) may be. Visually it is an all too rare treat of shadows and pale, misty light, giving it a chilly and menacing atmosphere. This is almost worth the ticket on its own.The story itself though is far more comedy ( and some suspense) than horror - there is little gore ( some bouncing heads, some beheaded corpses and some blood spurting from off-camera are the upper limits - slasher-movie types need not apply....), very little shock ( The - btw excellent - soundtrack usually gives ample advance warning ) and nothing ultimately disgusting. There are some slightly unsettling and eerie flashbacks, giving a little depth to Cranes obsession with science over 'mere' belief. As to the nature of the horror though, there is little question, and only the motive for its appearance, while eluded too quite early in the film, stays unknown for any amount of time. Any horrific transformation of the characters ? De nada, senor !So folks, lets face it, it's NOT a horror movie ( unless ones DOES regard 'X-files' as horror.... ), merely ghostly suspense, with, perhaps its single fault, an overdose of relieving humour. There is quite a lot of comically grotesque scenes which will make the viewer laugh - typical for Burton's films, but not really (?) appropriate in a spooky and dark ghost story.Its a clichee-rich story, too - spooky witches, cursed woods, innocent pale girls, frigid stepmothers, Jack O'Lanterns and cornfields, as well as black stagecoaches all have their turns. Actually, that is the most disappointing part of the film, as there are very little innovative details in the telling and 'painting' the darkness of the tale.The cast is a superior one, Depp and Ricci giving able, if not really inspired performances, Christopher Walken having a few short, but very impressive scenes and several well known faces turning up in supportive roles - even Christopher Lee 'dropping-in' in a cameo, so no quibbles on that count.Actually I liked the film very much - just do not expect it to be a 'horror' film - suspense with some mystical overtones and a good, hearty laugh at some blackish humour is much more appropriate as a description. 8 out of 10 should give you an idea as to its quality.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton outdoes Irving by a country mile (or maybe two)...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the risk of sounding somewhat heretical to the purists who decry adaptations as inferior product, I cannot claim much affection for Washington Irving. As I was talking to a friend of mine who is a literature major, we both agreed that Irving had a lot of good ideas, BUT his execution of them sucked. I've always found him too wordy, too meandering, and too coma-inducing to be considered interesting (and I've read more classics in the last five years than I did the entire time I went to high school). So, this said, it would have to be Tim Burton who would get Irving's most famous tale right.While I'm not a fanatical Burton follower, I do have a great deal of respect for his craft and films that many of his detractors lack and I think that I can safely say that this is probably the most serious film of his that I have ever seen. That may sound strange considering the fantastical elements of this story, but unlike previous Burton efforts (and I include the original Batman on this list), Sleepy Hollow feels more grounded in reality, even if more than a few historical liberties were taken. The mystery of the decaptations, which I expected would be rather quickly resolved (after all, practically everybody in America knows who did it, right?), surprisingly turned out to be central to the plot, which I felt was a good move to give the story a solid backbone. However, it is not a mystery in the traditional sense that the audience can figure out the clues with the detective. Burton does drop a few subtle hints that you're likely to miss because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO. It seemed to me as though he wanted the audience to follow Ichabod's thinking, deductions, and conclusions rather than veer off on their own, thereby adding to the shock when the real culprit is revealed. Such a style requires subtle, painstaking work and it's to Burton's credit that, in my case at least, he succeeded.For all it's decaptations, blood, and somber atmosphere, the story does take a few Burtonesque touchs of humor that you can't help but at least smile at. My favorite has to be during the flashback to the Horseman's death (played with over-the-top relish by Christopher Walken). The Horseman makes a shushing sound to the two little blonds he runs into. One of them promptly snaps a branch to get his pursuers' attention. You have to see it to believe it. Another good one is when Nesmith asks Ichabod, "Is he dead?" Ichabod's logical but funny reply: "That's the trouble. He was dead to begin with." There are a lot of others but I won't reveal any more. Rest assured, though, they are there.Now as to the main cast, what can I say about Johnny Depp (positive or negative) that hasn't been said before? I will say that he is one of my favorite off-beat film actors (still love his stuff in "Ed Wood) and his portrayal of Constable Ichabod Crane (no, you haven't wandered into the wrong movie; that's one of the changes that was added on early) is perhaps one of the most unlikely anti-heroes ever shot on film. A prim and proper shell of a man driven by reason and science, burnt by anguish over a very nasty childhood, Crane brings to mind Sherlock Holmes minus the nerves of steel (his teaming with young Nesmith would seem to verify this observation). This has to be the only movie that I've ever seen where the hero faints more often than the heroine. Speaking of said heroine, Christini Ricci admittedly does not have much to work with, but she infuses what she has with commendable skill. Perhaps one of the reasons for the minimalist screen time/performance was to increase the uncertainty about her true nature. As to what that might be...I'm not going to tell you. Though his name isn't mentioned often, I honestly feel that Casper Van Dien, considering what I have seen of his mediocre acting skills, was born to play the part of the brave but brainless Bram Bones. His best moment has to be his fight with the Horseman (a piece of macabre comedy that Buster Keaton could have admired).The only other thing I've left to add about the film is that it is best that you pay attention to every detail, major or minor, during the movie. The biggest suprise of the whole film for me was how all the little pieces scattered here and there fit together at the film's climax. It'll be most interesting to see what Burton will pull next from his magic bag of tricks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BURTON'S BEST IN AGES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an engagingly florid adaptation of the classic ghost story.Know that phrase about trying to keep your head while all round you is losing theirs? That pretty much sums up the action here, as the decapitations come thick and fast.Rather interestingly, Burton has chosen to film an American horror classic as a Hammer horror, complete with many of the stalwart British actors you'd expect to see in such a movie.And it's enormous fun, with Depp investing a good deal of beguiling naivete and charm to his portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Good to see him looking relaxed for a change and almost enjoying himself.His is the only developed character here though, the rest are all mere caricatures.And here's a first - a pallid and very weak performance from Ricci.Lubezski's lensing though is quite the best thing with its swirling mists, and Elfman gives full throttle to a full-blooded score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moody masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my film of 2000. I know, there hasn't been a lot of 2000 yet, but still... I went to see this as a curiosity, as I like Tim Burton's films generally, and was expecting a competent film version of Washington Irving's story (luckily, I'd managed to avoid seeing any trailers, so I just knew the story of the Legend). What I wasn't expecting was such a perfect film. For me, it succeeded on all fronts. There was something almost indefinable about the exterior sets which gave the film an amazing feeling of pervading evil, and it's perhaps this which made the film succeed so well. The acting was universally suitable (including a small part for Hammer veteran Christopher Lee) - Depp, in particular, managed his usual trick of being fascinating to watch, and even turned out a good English accent; the direction was strong - I was glued to the screen throughout the film (never a thought of "How much longer to go?" or "What time is it?"); the film's script was intelligent and compelling - Depp's character being, quite rightly, the core and most important invention to "flesh out" the Sleepy Hollow Legend into a proper cinematic story; the Horseman was perfectly realised - none of the old unbelievable "extended shoulders" trick (I later read that they painstakingly deleted the actor's balaclava'd head from EVERY frame of the film in which the Horseman appears!); and all of this was supported by thebeautifully-lit sets, which, as I say, sustained a mood of nightmare-like evil all through the film. I can't wait for it's release on video!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow: When the New York judiciary grows tired of a Ichabod Crane, an inspector who believes in justice of all things, they dispatch him to a small New England town to solve a series of ghastly murders. What appears to be a routine investigation of a serial killer that likes to hack off heads turns sinister when it becomes evident that the murderer may not be human. First, this is not Disney's version of Irving's classic tale- it is dark, gory, and scary. Indeed it is not really Irving's story anymore, with several of the main details having been changed. Finally, this version is extremely well executed (no pun intended).After such fantastic debacles as "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" "The Astronaut's Wife", and "Mars Attacks" it is a pleasure to see Depp and Burton back together again. Depp is wonderful as Crane, the, pale, skittish, intelligent man of few words (you might call him Ichabod Scissorhands?) trying to uncover a killer as he tries to understand his own past. Ricci, meanwhile, is enchanting, as the mysterious seductress and leaves you wondering - is she good or evil? And Walken is darker than he's ever been - a man whose dedication to evil and killing actually brings him back from the dead. But acting alone does not make a movie.Burton masterfully translates his vision to the screen, creating an atmosphere that is spectacularly gloomy, oppressive, and enticing at the same time. In addition to fabulous sets, and great action sequences, the film is remarkably well paced with no wasted scenes or downtime - I was amazed how quickly it was over.  I will be adding this to my collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny yet scary, dark but beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's do this Up to date my favorite Tim Burton film was The Original Batman. Sleepy Hollow just changed that. The Film is so well done that in retrospect only Tim Burton could have done it justice. It's a Film that's full of contrasts. Dark, yet beautiful, Somber yet camp. One of the funniest things about sleepy hollow is the acting. It's straight out of the Hammer house Movies. Apparently that's exactly what Mr. Burton wanted. He gave cast members full access to his hammer house film library. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Crane Ichabod, the investigator who quickly finds himself out of his depth in the spooky town of sleepy hollow. Christina Ricci is okay as the love interest but to be quite frank considering all she really does is scream and faint, any number of actresses could have played her part. The rest of the supporting cast is quite brilliant with Tim Burton bringing together a strong British and American crew. So what's the Story you ask. It's quite simple really. The Town sleepy hollow is haunted by a headless Horseman who has a bad habit of Chopping peoples heads. In Comes Ichabod Crane who's been sent in to investigate the rumors. He is of course skeptical to say the least. This changes very quickly and he finds that not only must he confront the demons that haunt sleepy hollow, he also as to come face to face with his own. Enjoy, if you want good old fashioned entertainment go see It.SmoothBond</fullReview>

Christina Ricci is again hauntingly beautiful as a blonde with enticing and brooding dark eyes.Ichabod's flash backs to childhood are an inspired piece of theatre. The lead members of the cast are richly supported by British (and European) character acting talent and it is a joy to behold.The feel of the film put me in mind of the Hammer Horror productions but this was sleeker and sharper with much more skill behind the camera. Of course the addition of Christopher Lee to the cast adding weight to the links to Hammer is an act of genius.Not a film that everyone will enjoy but for me this is one from the top drawer, 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph for Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always admired Tim Burton's abilities as a visual stylist - his movies always have a unique and totally off the wall look - but I've never been truly satisfied with him as a director. His inability to tell a clear, focused story - or to get anything out of his actors except over the top performances - or to stage action in anything but a perfunctory manner. . . have always made him suspect to me. I felt his promotion to the rank of director was unwarranted - that he should instead be making his living as one of Hollywood's most in demand cinematographers or production designers.Having seen Sleepy Hollow though, I'd definitely have to say that Burton has made considerable progress. His distinctive visual touch is still present, though he has reigned in some of his wilder extravagances in order not to overwhelm the story. His ability to stage action sequences is much improved, resulting in some truly hair-raising chases and fight scenes (you're left to wonder what his Batman films could have been with this new found talent). Furthermore, the relentless jokiness which usually undermines his movies has been replaced by a brooding and operatic tone which better fit the story. For example, the flashback sequences here provide some of the most haunting and poetic images Burton has ever created - and they feel sincere, as if they come from a very deep and genuine place inside the filmmaker, and are not just flung at us to dazzle and tickle us with his visual ingenuity.All of which is not to say that Burton is no longer any fun. It's just that he has put his humor into better perspective. There are many nice wry touches in Sleepy Hollow, none more so than in Johnny Depp's truly outstanding performance, which straddles the poles of absurd comedy and genuine heroism. Even as we come to feel for Ichabod Crane and to admire his steeliness and pluck, we are never far removed from laughter at the character's prissiness and squeamishness. Depp walks a real tightrope act here, and it will probably not be to everyone's taste. I thought it was one of the best performances of the year, and represented a perfect marriage between Burton's tendancy toward campy theatrics and his newfound maturity and grace.Some caveats: Christina Ricci is not used particularly well here; her part is too blandly written to give her prickly screen persona much room to breathe. Too bad, as she would make an ideal Burton heroine (I hasten to add that every other single actor in the movie - including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and yes, even Christopher Walken in a wordless cameo - is solid). And what's with this story anyway? It's a pointless bastardization of the original tale. While it's true that the original is pretty threadbare, it is certainly suggestive enough that a writer could spin out compelling backstories and elaborations without having to resort to coming up with a completely new murder mystery plot (which is kind of overplotted and confusing, anyway). But, taken on its own merits, the script certainly works well enough, and anyone not familiar with the original story won't notice anything amiss.Ok, now that I've said all that - the real reason to see this movie. . . those decapitations! The advertising slogan was "Heads will roll" but never in my wildest imagination could I have guessed with what frequency and in how many different kinds of ways. Burton eschews realism or gory details here, and instead goes for a stylization that is at once giddy, horrifying and strangely beautiful. The fact that each decapitation is played slightly differently - either in how it's shot or how it's perpetrated - keeps it from becoming routine and, indeed, every instance of it involves some new kind of twist or surprise. Some may say Burton is sick for focusing so much attention on this aspect of the story, but this is the Headless Horseman after all, and Burton's courage in not backing away from his grisly deeds gives the monster his full due. Although I wouldn't call the film frightening exactly (that is, to anyone but the most absolutely faint-hearted), it is suffused with a powerful sense of creepiness and dread that prove extremely effective.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and a signal of even better works yet to come from Tim Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's great comeback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is not my favorite director, but is certainly one of I most admire. His dark style, present in a great part of his films, is just amazing and magical. Talking about magic, he is able to pass it to the audience in each of his films. In "Batman" and "Batman Returns", he adapted very well the story of the man of shadows in Gotham City, what didn't happen in the two Joel Schumacher films. "Edward Scissorhands" is one of the most magical and sweet films of the '90s. In "The Nightmare Before Christmas", Burton did an inventive and weird animated movie. In "Ed Wood", maybe his best film to date, he could do a biographical story at the same time controversial and hilarious. And "Mars Attacks"... Well... It's his weakest film, but still that rather enjoyable. To repair this small mistake, he wonderfully adapted an old American tale- "Sleepy Hollow"- and did his great comeback."Sleepy Hollow" tells the story of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York detective who believes only in what he sees. He goes to a small village in order to investigate some strange decapitation murders. The inhabitants claim that they were commited by a weird creature who is part of the folk of the place- the 'headless horseman'. Crane, of course, doesn't believe in anything at first, but a childhood trauma and a romance can help him with his mission. I won't tell more things about the plot, because I don't want to spoil your surprises, and so that the film gets more enjoyable and intriguing to watch.It is difficult to say if "Sleepy Hollow" is Tim Burton's best. It doesn't have the sweetness of "Edward Scissorhands", or the ingenuity of "Ed Wood", but it is a very special film. It is original, dark, with a strange black humor and sometimes scary. If I had to define the genre of this movie, it would be fantasy. More than comedy, horror, mystery. Because, in the deep, it is beautiful- and don't forget there is a romance! The acting is fabulous, specially Depp and Christina Ricci- one of the greatest promises of Hollywood for the future. Its dark, wonderful cinematography is definetely Oscar-worthy, and so are the costumes, the art direction, the special effects and the make-up effects."Sleepy Hollow" can be not of the 10 year's best, but it is one of the most enjoyable, exciting and entertaining films of last year.So prepare for some scares, much fun and a great twist in the end. HEADS WILL ROLL...8 and 1/2 out of 10</fullReview>

Heaving bosoms and lots of blood!It was visually stunning and very atmospheric, though unsurprisingly the countryside did look very English in some parts. The special effects were excellent too. There was good acting from the main actors, but some of the accents were a bit bewildering. It was interesting to see such a lot of good 'jobbing' British actors in the film, presumably economics played a part in using them rather than bringing over American actorsI actually thought that it had a lot of humour, but that doesn't mean that it didn't have it's gruesome moments. But I think it lacked real horror and there was nothing that really came as a shock or even a surprise.Having said all of that, it was a good evening's entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I was absolutely gagging to see this film. I had heard so many bad reviews for it, and with this being a Tim Burton film, I got me wondering how a fabulous director like him could have got something wrong. So I went to see it with an open mind. The first thing I must comment on, is whether you liked the film or not, I'm sure no-one could have failed to like the look of the whole thing. The film should certainly win an award for best cinematography because every single frame was beautifully composed. The atmosphere was brilliant, and it definitely had the name 'Tim Burton' written all over it. I must give top marks to Johnny Depp for the portrayal of his character. It was not always convincing, but he really threw himself into his role, and carried it off well. Not too sure about Christina Ricci, though, maybe it was because we did not see very much of her, but I didn't find her very believable. Unfortunately, to me, she is still Wednesday Addams, but I hope to catch up on her most recent films, because I know that she is a fine actress. I have to hand it to her, though, she looked stunning in 'Sleepy Hollow.' One final critism. I don't know what everybody else thought, but I didn't sense any electricity between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. If this film was to be a romance, then I think more should have been made of their relationship.Anyway, criticisms aside, I thought that 'Sleepy Hollow' definitely sparkled with polish, and it has obviously been carefully crafted. All I can say now is that I can't wait until it comes out on video!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed with this film.. it would appear that the films distributors wanted to make as much money as possible from this film, therefore cutting a whole 9 minutes of action from the 18 rated US version and releasing it as a 15 certificate.The story could be concluded in a single line - a headless horseman has been killing people in a place called Sleepy Hollow.. and that was essentially it. The film wandered around aimlessly trying to entice people with what will happen next, but it was all too obvious and predictable. There were no surprises, maybe because they were cut from the English version. The script was poor, and the actors were struggling to deliver to their true potential, partially because there wasn't enough of it to go at.As for directing, Tim Burton did a reasonable job, but I would not go as far as to say as I enjoyed this more than Batman, for example. The special effects were reasonable and the cutting of heads was nicely done. Although I'm sure there would have been more horror for if it were not cut itself onto the editors floor.I hope if Tim Burton reads this that he will restore the film to its full length and let it have its 18 Certificate it should have, maybe then I could enjoy it and not fall into a Sleepy Hollow when watching it.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp in a Tim Burton film ? You're kidding !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few directors in Hollywood that exist entirely(and can translate to the screen)their own private world.Terry Gilliam can do it,and Tim Burton can do't.For ten years burton has been delivering some of the most visually outstanding movies ever created.The majority of them appeal to a darker sensitivity,(Batman,Edward Scissorhands)and while he has never made a truly adults-only film,only Pee-wee Hermans Big Adventure is one specifically "for the kids". Sleepy Hollow is Burtons most beautiful film,and the best looking horror film ever made.Burtons palette is restricted to greyscales and earth tones,and the village of Sleepy Hollow seems to be in perpetual darkness,no matter what the time of day.This dreary creation gives maximum effect to the only harsh colour Burton allows himself--blood red.The death scenes are incredibly extravagant(with Darth Maul standing in for a brilliantly growly,pointy-toothed Christopher Walken in the fight scenes)and while the blood looks very real,and the violence is at times repulsive(see the nasty old witch slicing off a bats head)but it is never really scary,the violence and gore is not explicit,its more cartoon horror than anything else. The casting of Sleepy Hollow is indeed genius.While the background is mostly fleshed out by British stalwarts(Richard Griffiths,Ian McDiarmid,Miranda Richardson)who show little depth,portraying their characters as cariacatures,18th century stereotypes,the two leads are exemplary.Tim Burtons joined-at-the-hip alter ego Johnny Depp brilliantly portrays himself as the cop with inner conflicts,slowly becoming more aware of himself(through a series of misty flashbacks)and his past,and seemingly growing in his obsession to defeat the headless horseman as a way of exorcising his personal demons.Christina Ricci is the scariest looking starlet in America,and perfectly plays what is essentially a dual role-the love interest spilling out of her corset,and the mysterious young girl with a hint of witch to her.A fleeting appearance from one Christopher Lee reinforces the feel that this is a modern day Hammer film(albeit one with a whopping Hollywood budget)and one that despite the rolling heads and the sight of Casper Van Dien donating a little more blood than can be healthy for him(Its no more than he deserves-have you seen Starship Troopers ?)its one that kids shouldnt be denied.Spending a couple of hours on Tim Burtons planet can not be bad for anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone else noticed, or is it just me ? Horror movies or movies where "things go bump in the dark" are becoming the best comedy movies. Perhaps, this modern phenomenon dates back to Evil Dead but Tim Burton understands the genre perfectly. The movie is crafted as clinically as the Headless Horseman's precision in decapitations and with such aplomb. Thud !The casting is perfect from the New York flatfoot, Johnny Depp to the cameo role of the Horseman's early victim, Martin Landau. Set in 1799, nice millennial touch, New York and New England are fantastically portrayed. And the woods of Sleepy Hollow are not the kind of place where anyone would want to go for a picnic.So who or what is the Headless Horseman, who will be the next victim, what is the conspiracy, can the Horseman be stopped ? These are questions put to the audience and it is a great fun finding out the answers of this exciting Gothic mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still not sure whether I enjoyed the film. Performances were good all around. Johnny Depp was good balancing the role between enjoyably camp and annoying well. Unfortunately the story itself weak and underdeveloped. Capsule synopsis: People get heads cut off, somebody to blame, (too) obvious suspect is love interest, suspects love interest, &lt;cue quick obvious weak twist bit&gt; rides to rescue love interest and right all wrongs &lt;role credits&gt;. Nearly an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...then again, atmosphere itself doesn't make a great film - but together with some fantastic set designs, unintrusive (but incredibly effective) music by Danny Elfman, Christopher Walken being as cool as usual, although the amount of time he's on screen is considerably smaller than we had been led to believe by all the publicity, Christina Ricci's eyes.......er....sorry, getting carried away. Anyway - I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and will definitely try and see it again, even if it's just to fathom out precisely what accent Johnny Depp is supposed to have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic thrills with beautiful scenery and fine acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always liked Tim Burton's movies and this film didn't make an exception. From the very beginning I was stunned by the beautiful scenery and gothic surroundings along with a near perfect camera handling. This movie is a fine example how to make a simple story interesting using suspense and adding clever little twists into the plot. Crane's dream sequences are astounding, colorful thrills themselves. Good acting, beautiful images and great acting. One of the best movies I have seen this millennium this far :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely masterpiece. Here's why *these might be spoilers, but only slightly*:1. The scenery was breathtaking. It was very beautiful and kept the film visually stunning throughout.2. In my opinion, much improved from Washing Irving's original, rather monotonous story. The story was complicated, and somewhat hard to follow the first time. On viewing the second time, however, it was far easier to understand how Ichabod was picking up those little clues.3. Flawless acting. I can say nothing bad of any actor/actress in this film. The cast was also well-chosen.4. The atmosphere created by the scenery was well-fitting. The sky was always gray, and the air nearly always foggy. 5. The horseman scenes were fast-paced, but not not lame like an action film. It was exciting to watch.A definite 10/10. Lovely film. I am without a doubt, going to buy this movie on DVD. I thoroughly disagree with anyone who disliked this film for the slightest reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw the trailers for this previously. Was not too impressed. We see the Headless Horseman so I was immediately under the impression of: oh, so that's the story then. Hack, off with your head. However, after seeing this, I was proved wrong. I like a bit of humor, as these sorts of flicks that take themselves too seriously often end up hideous. The sets were like outdoor versions of the House in the Haunting. Astounding, beautiful Gothic Forest! But by gosh the Horseman knows how to throw his sword around! The sword-swinging scenes were awesome. He was actually played by the stunt man who was Darth Maul in THAT movie. Impressive! Sword fights get 10/10.Although a flick directed by Tim Burton, who seems to love making movies out of children's fairy tales, this one is most definitely not for the children. The Tree of the Dead was a particularly frightening example - especially when Constable Crane chops and hacks at its roots and blood begins to spew out. What comes out next... well, I don't want to put in too many spoilers!!I don't have many negative views, probably the only minus would be one too many heaving bosoms... take for example Crane's mother. Most of her scenes seemed focused on her bosom and nothing else. CONCLUSION: If you are squeamish, you may want to give this a miss, there is a lot of blood and gore. However, I still give this excellent flick 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of the 1990s. No ifs, ands or buts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the preview for `Sleepy Hollow,' where the main character is a forensics expert/detective, a week before its release when I went to see the tepid `Bone Collector,' which, ironically, also dealt with a forensics expert as the main character. The preview was well done, but when I discovered who was starring and directing, it became an afterthought. Then, something inexplicable must've happened because I relented and decided to see SH after all when it was released.Well, what followed were 22 viewings in 39 days until it was pulled from my local theater. Now, a film has to be pretty damn good to warrant such a hot streak. I simply haven't seen anything this awesome in years. SH has everything: great plot (I'm sorry, but anyone who calls this a `Scooby Doo' mystery didn't pay much attention to the story), colorful characters, incredible visuals ? was I the only one who liked Ichabod's dream sequences? ? and phenomenal production design. This is the first film that's commanded my attention through every frame; no scene ever lags or gets boring. Heck, this movie has more Vans than U-Haul (as in 3 Tassels, 2 Garretts, a Brunt played by a Dien, and a Ripper), and more faints than a Backstreet Boys concert. What's not to like here?I won't delve into the plot since everybody knows it by now, but I will say that transforming Ichabod Crane from the lanky schoolteacher into a constable (a word I will always associate with `Mary Poppins') was a terrific idea, and since I am a huge fan of police/detective stories, this was right up my alley. The special effects fit like an old shoe; that's how natural they looked. Granted, SH is hardly scary but it puts any modern bunk like the insipid `Scream' series, which go for blatant blood and guts rather than an actual plot to scare viewers, to shame.Every performance in SH is beyond my reproach, especially Johnny Depp's, and I don't count myself among his fans. This blows away his previous top effort, `Donnie Brasco,' because it takes more talent to pull off an Ichabod Crane than a Joe Pistone. His Crane, deeply committed to his occupation, is perhaps the most believable action hero, as opposed to the usual muscleheads usually seen in the action/detective genre (ahem, Arnie). He is a perfect combination of Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Clouseau as he has no problem performing autopsies yet freaks out at the sights of blood, spiders and horseback riders without heads, like any of us would. He may also be the most nonviolent hero in recent memory: he never raised a hand to or threatened anyone, he played peacemaker (or tried to, anyway) on several occasions, didn't swear or spout any misogynistic lines, and for all the times he pulled his gun, he fired only once while trying to protect his two charges from the Horseman. His grand speech in the notary's office was simply amazing.Christina Ricci is equally impressive as Katrina Van Tassel, though I was disappointed at how she downplayed her character. `I play the stereotypical damsel in distress,' she says. To me, she was the opposite. Rather than a sexpot stagnating on the sidelines, she was part of the action: assisting Ichabod in his investigation (an early version of the script had her helping Ichabod dig out a grave), leaping onto a horse from a speeding carriage and jumping from a flaming windmill. Some have complained about their `romance,' yet I instead considered it a very genuine friendship. Her delivery was excellent as she goes to market with this role. There is a particularly touching moment with her and Young Masbath (awesome Marc Pickering, who is everything Macaulay Culkin should have been) in the Western Woods. Her singing `Pickety Witch' made my blood run cold. Never mind Depp being nearly twice her age, it doesn't hinder their relationship. She just might be the first case of a miscast character that instead has a positive effect on a movie.The supporting cast stood out well with the lead players; they fit into the film nicely and no role was overshadowed. All ? the Van Tassels and the town elders (1799's version of Grumpy Old Men), among others (including much-maligned Casper Van Dien as Brom ? give the guy a break already, folks), were fun to watch, particularly Michael Gough as the notary, but with his body language, notably his plodding like a rusty Tin Man from a funeral.Who better than Chris Walken to play the fanged, pre-headless Hessian? Let's face it, it would've killed the spooky, maniacal aura of his character if he had any spoken lines. Seeing Christopher Lee (who was an absolute steal for 1997's terrific `The Odyssey,' also produced by Francis Coppola) was a nice treat as well.Some of my favorite performances were also by the Killian family (Steven Waddington, Claire Skinner and Sean Stephens). The line `Don't pick your teeth, you teach Thomas bad habits!' always made me smile.However, I'd be lying if I said SH was a perfect movie. I thought the characters of Lady Van Tassel and Brom were somewhat underdeveloped. I was disappointed with the ending only that I had expected it to have the oomph `Seven' did (considering who wrote the screenplay), but this is merely small potatoes as the climax formidably holds its own anyway. The runaway carriage scene left me slack-jawed; this is what today's lackluster car chases should take notes from. The Headless Horseman leaves Darth Maul from last May's disappointing `Phantom Menace' and any other horror villains in the dust. Incredible swordplay, especially in the fight under the famous covered bridge.Go see this right away, you won't be disappointed. This was the final film I saw for the millennium...perfect. If SH does not garner any Oscar nominations in the technical categories, then I'll make someone tie me up with telephone wire and watch `The Postman' for 24 hours straight. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The team of Jonnny Depp and Tim Burton come up trumps again. I can't think of another director who could have carried this off as well and what could have been just another revamped children's story from the Hollywood production line was turned into a gothic fantasy that managed to keep me interested from start to finish. The village and the wood were straight out of a storybook and even the graphic violence ie the heads being lopped off was done in a humorous manner, that Burton specialises in.I don't think it's a classic like Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, but it matches them im style and cinematography. One or two criticisms could be made, but it's not really worth carping and the film turns out to be a thoroughly enjoyable two hours, which is a welcome relief after the over-hyped films coming out of America, which have proved to be disappointing ie. Fight Club and Blairwitch Project. If your a Tim Burton fan this is a must-see.</fullReview>

It is not bad, but you want to know more. This is a feeling that I get after seeing almost every Tim Burton film. Maybe it's because I love them sssooo much. If you have read my Batman reviews, you may have a feeling of dj?-vu in the following lines. This director made the most stylish movies of this decade. As opposed to most commercially successful directors, he really has a style of his own. I really love his movies.

		<shortDescription>Not the best film from the greatest director we have, but still towers above everything else.(possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richer than it appears on a surface level, this is still a bit disappointing from the director who gave us the greatest film of the last 20 years. It is not immediately apparent what is lacking. Burton's visual style is as ravishing as ever, if not as expansive - sometimes it feels as if he is working on a smaller budget than usual. Part of the joy of Tim Burton is that, like you, he has seen the wonderful imaginative possibilities of Roger Corman and Hammer Horror foundered by a lack of money to see them through, and is determined to rectify this.The muted Gothic of the dusks, the forests, the late-eighteenth century mansions and towns, the austere churches, the horses, the villagers, the public rites, are astonishingly evocative, much more so that the rather perfunctory special effects. Even better are the stunning dream sequences - a mixture of gleaming white, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS-like pastel and emotion, snatches of lurid red, dream and violence - that are among the best things Burton has done.The actors have been criticised for favouring caricature over character, but people forget that what made the figure of Edward Scissorhands, say, so moving was not Johnny Depp's performance, which, if taken in isolation, was rather stiff and unyielding, but Burton's visualisation of Edward's emotional subjectivity, like a great melodramatic director, though colour, composition, set design, and camera movement. The failure is not Depp's performance, which is often amusing, but Burton's inability to anchor it expressively.SLEEPY HOLLOW is quite brilliant at undermining its surface narrative. Washington Irving's tale, and the book it derived from - 'The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon' - is often seen as the starting point of American literature, and cultural ideas about the notion of America, as it struggles to free itself from the dead weight of Europe. Burton's film, 200 years on, has the opposite vantage point, at the end of these notions: he knows how they have developed, and what they have led to. He has also open to him tools never available to Irving: e.g. Freud, Lacan, Derrida etc.So, on one level, the film deconstructs the creation of American history, dramatising a prosperous, seemingly self-made, professional nation at the mercy of both the returning repressed, and the unbreakable codes of Europe. This is seen most clearly in its treatment of women, in the obscene gap between Ideality and reality. The only unadulteratedly positive female in the film is a murdered dream figure. Crane is quick to demonise Katrina as a witch whenever he can't rationalise a problem; ditto Lady Van Tassel, whose grievances are just, and whose oppression is firmly rooted in European feudalism.This demonising can be seen as the fruit of Crane's movement from scientific rationalist into a supposedly religious society riddled with pagan superstition and fear. The move to America from Europe has only resulted in the transplanting of the old Ideas - the murders concern either land or sex. And yet, paradoxically, it is the conservative entity of the family that suffers most, representing the conventional society Lady Van Tassel wreaks merry havoc on.One of the film's dominant metaphors is that of seeing, perception. Crane is a scientific detective (a lovely joke: the man who earns his living using his head investigating the Headless Horseman), arrives in Sleepy Hollow with new-fangled, self-created tools which include elaborate machines for improving what he sees. This allows for greater accuracy in studying the dead, the past, but as the legends of Sleepy Hollow begin to prey on his mind, allied with the demons of his own past, Crane becomes less able to see with scientific detachment.With all the scenes of Crane in bed, and the attendant implications of dreaming and madness, as well as an increased hysteria in the action, the status of what we see - is it truth, or just Crane's colouring of reality - is called into question, making even more ambiguous Irving's rather facile ironies. Burton makes sure not to show us the murderer at the beginning: it doesn't materialise until Crane has heard the legend.This ambiguity is largely achieved by completely changing the character of Ichabod Crane, a teacher in the tale, not a detective; someone who passes on tradition and learning rather than uncovering it; someone so susceptible to the supernatural that he actively seeks it out, both by studying it, and by listening to old wives' tales. Irving's Crane is far from a hero: physically grotesque, cruel, sadistic, greedy, cowardly. Depp's Crane is more fastidious than a wuss. By using the figure whose role is to find, see and interpret, Burton is better able to undermine him.What confirms the doubtfulness of what we see is Crane's Oedipal confusions, his idealisation of a mother, who was killed by a brute, bible-bashing husband; and Katrina, who is constantly linked to her - he rejects her when she refuses to be as passive and ideal as he would like, becoming an artist and director with her Evil Eye. The two women murdered have maternal association - the widow murdered with child, and the midwife: examples of fertility and corporeality that threaten the ideal.For Crane is a virgin, and is terrified of real, sexual women - the profusion of blood squirted on him; the visual play of red and white; his only illusory ability to cage the bird (traditional emblem of female captivity), compounded by its red setting. Lady Von Tessel only becomes the villain after Crane sees her having illicit sex, her maiming herself both a Hester Prynne-like mark of her sexual sin, but also proof of her own sado-masochistic control of her body and sexuality.This so offends Crane, and the new America he represents, that he must cast her out, link her to death and castration (the Headless Horseman), to perversion of nature (the extraordinary Tree of the Dead, Munch-like in its harrowing grief). As with all his great films - BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, MARS ATTACKS! - Burton uses the perceived detritus of its popular culture to express profound disillusion with the nature of America. A brilliant, honorable failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Sleepy Hollow" is cinematographically breathtaking. Tim Burton manages to create an incredible atmosphere in this film by combining beautiful scenery with some nice special effects, a touch of action and a lot of smoke machines. Johnny Depp is good as Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci's performance grows on you as the film moves along. The plot is beautifully simple and although it's inclusion of the occasional humorous moment detracts from the gothic atmosphere, it is refreshing to see a movie like this being made today with what appears to be a reasonable sized budget.

		<fullReview>After the pretty variable Mars Attack, Tim Burton returns to what we know he does best, dark Gothic movies. The cast of Sleepy Hollow includes some actors that have worked with Burton in Johnny Depp, Michael Gough and Jeffrey Jones. Most of the rest of the cast is British. The story is that a number of murders have been taking place in the isolated New York village of Sleepy Hollow. The village think that is the infamous Headless horseman, who was beheaded near to the village, and who was risen from the grave. Constable Icabod Crane is sent to investigate the murder. He initial thinks that it is the work of one of the local offical. But after discovering the horseman at work on night, he finds the evil deeds are at work within the village.It good to see a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. There is lots of black humour, especially from Depp who play Crane as a sort of Early Sherlock Holmes. The sets are beautifully gothic, and darkly and help to draw you into the film. George Lucas take note! The horseman himself is a pretty mean with a sword, as could be expected as he is played by the stuntman who played Darth Maul. The English cast is very good especially Ian McDiarmid, Miranda Richardson and Michael Gambon.To conclude the best film I have seen since the Sixth sense, and miles better than End of Days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp...coming back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Johnny Depp?" "Yeah. Heard of him?" "No. What was his most recent film?" "Ummmm?.I think?."Nightmare on Elm Street." He played the kid who got eaten by the bed." "Oh, yeah! Him?yeah, I guess so?Hey, he was also Edward Scissorhands!" "REALLY?" This conversation may have been slightly exaggerated, but as a whole it could certainly be possible. No offense to you Depp fans out there, but Johnny hasn't exactly been setting standards in Hollywood. He seems to me to be rather reclusive or selective or what have you. Mr. Depp has not appeared in a great deal of films which have been widely accepted by the public, and after "The Astronaut's Wife" fell, some wondered if he ever would have a career. However, all of this may be ready to change. Johnny Depp has just appeared as the main character in a box office hit that came out the week before Thanksgiving of 1999: "Sleepy Hollow." This film may be the stepping stone he needs. "Sleepy Hollow" is a wonderfully dark film by Tim Burton (as if he does anything besides dark films), which is based on the Ichabod Crane story by Washington Irving. Depp plays Ichabod, a constable in 18th century New York, whose scientific means of criminology are alien to the old school torture lovers who are his compatriots. He is sent to investigate three murders in a small town called Sleepy Hollow (hence the name). There he meets up with the Van Tassells, a rich family who practically owns the town. Crane also runs into Mr. Van Tassells' mysterious daughter Katrina, played by Christina Ricci ("Casper"). Ricci is one of the few actresses whose career I have watched throughout my life. It's always interesting to watch Wednesday Addams and the nice girl from Casper go on to star in "The Opposite of Sex," but anyway? Ichabod is informed of the situations of the murders by five important men of various occupation. A little back-story is included, where the origin of the horseman is revealed. An interesting trivia fact is that the growling Hessian horseman is played by Christopher "always playing a villain" Walken ("Pulp Fiction"). Afterwards, the shaking Depp tells his informers in true Shatner-like speech that "the killer?is a man of? flesh and blood, and I will?discover him." And so the search begins. As Depp is preparing, we see Jonathan Nesmith, one of the citizens of the town, get chased down and decapitated by the horseman, whom we now see. After this tragedy, Jonathan's son decides to avenge his father by helping Ichabod. More heads get cut off, and more violence ensues, until Ichabod, Katrina, and the Nesmith boy go to a huge, strange looking tree in the forest. It is discovered that the tree bleeds, and inside of it are all the heads that the horseman has collected. More importantly, the Hessian's skull is missing, and it is immediately deducted that whoever has the skull is controlling him. Pure genius. They don't have much time to sit around and think, though, for as it gets dark, the Headless Horseman flies out of the tree on his steed and heads out to get another victim. Even more violence ensues, and more heads roll, but names shall not be given to protect the ending. Aside from the regular plot, the audience is often given flashbacks which help illuminate Crane's childhood, and explain how he thinks now?the effect is amazing. This movie is rated R only for violence: no profanity, and only one slightly suggestive scene (with nothing actually seen). There is blood and bone galore in this film, the presence of which is heightened by the sheer darkness of the film. The choreography of the killing scenes is astounding, especially the sword play, which I can't even begin to describe. It can only be seen. Other plusses: good acting, good setting, not too modernized, and Christina Ricci is hot. Some minuses: it may freak out some people, it may trouble the weak of stomach, and it may bring back bad memories for those who have already been attacked by a Headless Horseman. However, the biggest minus is the movie's cruel and unforgiving portrayal of the skull-deficient among us. Headless people well definitely be offended by this awful stereotype, but apparently this movie is not attempting to appeal to them.  Instead, it appeals to everybody who likes a good action movie, a good mystery, a good drama, Tim Burton, or anybody who loves dark movies. I know I do, and I loved this movie (Johnny Depp shall live again!). So go to the theater, watch "Sleepy Hollow," and revel in your bliss?but don't lose your head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sumptuous visuals gloss over incompetent storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most appalling thing about Sleepy Hollow is how good it could have been. You have a gifted director, a wonderful cast, and a reasonably intriguing premise. And yet what has actually been committed to the screen is trite, unimaginative, and ultimately quite boring.What immediately strikes one about the film is the amazingly hackneyed and uninteresting dialogue, as Andrew Kevin Walker's script fails to convey any great amount of entertainment. An opening snatch of speech ("What have you found, Ichabod?", "A man, lately") promises a film steeped in a wonderful sense of the late eighteenth century period, but time and again we are left with bland, standardised conversations, and a clutch of direly out of place lines ("Watch your head.").Moreover, the film offers little to no surprises in terms of storyline. In the first scene in which Depp ecounters the residents of Sleepy Hollow, it isn't the work of two seconds to deduce what role each character will play, many of which are entirely unnecessary roles ANYWAY, such as Caspar Van Dien's quite useless and missable turn as Ricci's alternate love interest. The whole thing smacks of Hollywood.Another tragedy is the amazingly generic score composed by Elfman, who's normally touching and lingering melodies seem to be lost in a mire of average cinematic orchestration.The acting is adequate, save for Depp who turns in his usually marvellous performance as an idiosyncratic outsider. However, the accents are utterly laughable, as a cast of Brits and Americans can't seem to decide which side of the Atlantic they reside upon.On the visual side of things, there is much to be commended. The town itself is a wonder, and the sense of colour and tone is approached with an exacting and well realised skill. The costumes are all quite visually appealling (although there is something of an over-reliance upon heaving bosoms).The first occasion upon which we encounter the Horseman following Crane's arrival in the town is well handled, and a feeling of action and motion is very well controlled. However, this gives way to a series of repetitious and dull encounters which do nothing but bore.A lack of characterisation, some pointlessly gimmicky effects which muddy Burton's excellent visuals and some final revelations which aren't particularly revelatory also contribute to this, what should have been Burton's finest hour. This is a bad film, largely due to the incompetence of Walker. Very disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The headless horseman galloping through the countryside lopping heads clean off their respective bodies, a late 18th century "rationalist" detective, a superstitious village community and Christina Ricci as well (the best person to develop from child acting).Brilliant!! This is an excellent and absorbing story.As I have not read Washington Irvings story I did not really know what to expect. It became clear very early in the movie that there was indeed a supernatural cause behind the series of deaths (i.e. there was no faking the phenomenon by an errant villager for instance). The film does not however then plunge into a mass of pointless special effects and gore (although these were present in a significant way). It does in fact manage to blend a whodunit into the supernatural stew and a very tasty stew it is too. Despite the early knowledge that the immediate cause was supernatural there remained the mystery about who raised the horseman and who pulled his strings.The film is not for the squeamish but is highly recommended to fans of supernatural suspense.</fullReview>

What really let it down those was the over acting; only Depp could get away with it.Overall a great film, and probably Burton's best to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully crazy, like all of Burton's good work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reworking of a classic Washington Irving short story, "Sleepy Hollow" was expected to be Tim Burton gone subtle, and his prestigious bid for Oscar success. But it is in fact as distinctively crazy as all the rest of Burton's work -- a visually splendid, thoroughly exciting special-effects extravaganza set in 1799 that plays like a cross between Thomas Hardy and "The Evil Dead". Johnny Depp hilariously reinvents the famous literary figure Ichabod Crane; the superb visuals make the action climax stunning, and redeem some of the slow, confusing patches along the way. This film is further proof that the offbeat crannies of Burton's director's mind are worth visiting, and he knows how to take us into them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful magical film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is one of a few Directors who can not put a foot wrong. Every film he makes is a must see. I had been looking forward to Sleepy Hollow for a while and I was not disappointed.This is everything you'd expect from Burton.The wonderful Johnny Depp who was great in Edward Sissorhands and wonderful in Ed Wood is superb again as Ichabod Crane the Detective who has to solve the strange murders. He does a really good English accent and is very funny.Christina Ricci in her first Burton film, (i have a feeling it won't be her last) is wonderful, she's one of my fav actresses and one of the most beautiful woman alive. She is so pretty in this film and gives an enchanting performance up there with the best.A great supporting cast to with good turns from Michael Gambon and Christopher Walken as the headless horseman himself. The scenery is all so beautiful it has a rather eerie feel to it.And yet again Danny Elfman does a great score.Sleepy Hollow isn't going to win many Oscars but it will win many hearts.A superb film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave the film imdb's highest rating, but Sleepy Hollow has me a bit torn. On one hand, the plot, characters, and dialogue (basically, the script) were nothing special. However, the acting, music, and cinematography were stunning. Danny Elfman's score perfectly captured the mood of the film, and Johnny Depp was fantastic as always..but even more so.And the cinematography...my God... Sleepy Hollow actually looks like it was painted instead of filmed. Every wide angle shot and long shot in the film looks like a painting, and many of the close-ups look like portraits! Tim Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki have created what is possibly the best LOOKING film of all time and, to my eyes, that feat deserves a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just seen Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow at the first Swiss press screening and I'm absolutely delighted by this thoroughly stylish movie. I can hardly wait until it.In Sleepy Hollow, Burton combined all his skills to create an original, though classic blend of horror, fairy tale and even fantasy. But it is undoubtedly a work mainly for adults, in contrast to some of his earlier films (e.g. Batman, Mars Attacks). There are quite many gory scenes that also make this film great fun for Splatter freaks (I proudly admit that I am one). Sleepy Hollow delivers and kicks other recent horror films you know where (especially the terribly overrated The Sixth Sense).NOT TO BE MISSED! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</fullReview>

Depp is policeman/amateur pathologist (yes, suspend any sense of reality right now!) Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to solve the mystery of murders in which people are decapitated.Without spoiling the plot there's the compulsory love interest (Ricci), the wonderful Miranda Richardson as her step mother and plenty of gore and blood with the special effects of heads being removed at source.It was fun though, and does justice to one of the more famous scary stories you read as you were growing up.

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest cinematic retelling of the Washington Irving classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a moody, brilliant work, but fans of director Tim Burton have come to expect nothing less from the filmmaker.As with all great films, Sleepy Hollow is anchored by a great screenplay, and this film features yet another dazzling effort by former Tower Records-clerk-turned-Seven writing phenom Andrew Kevin Walker. (Walker also shares a "story-by" credit with Sleepy Hollow's co-producer, and special effects artist Kevin Yagher.)Walker's script changes to Irving's tale are minor, but clever and incredibly effective. No longer a schoolteacher, Walker's vision of Ichabod Crane - perfectly played by Johnny Depp - is that of a skittish, eccentric police constable from New York City.On the eve of a new century (1799, that is), Crane is sent by his superiors to a quaint Northern New York town known as Sleepy Hollow, so he can use "the latest in scientific techniques" to apprehend a head-severing perp known to the locals as The Headless Horseman. Indeed, much of the humor of Depp's character stems from his use of his own nascent version of forensic pathology, and Crane's unconventional investigative techniques - in a time of witchcraft and superstition - cause immediate friction with the locals.Once in town, Crane learns about the Horseman's legend, which purports he was once a bloodthirsty soldier sent to hell after his own head was taken by his enemies. And the awkward young constable also meets the daughter of a prominent town figure, the beautiful Katrina Van Tassell (Christina Ricci), and she and Crane immediately gravitate toward one another. However, the Headless Horseman's affinity for lopping off the noggins of townspeople puts their budding romance on hold.Crane soon realizes that - science be damned - there's no debunking to be done in Sleepy Hollow, and the Horseman is terribly real. Burton's vision of the Headless Horseman is truly frightening - an adversary possessing unspeakable power and unbelievable fighting prowess. Played for most of the film by Ray Park - the multitalented martial artist behind the tatooed face and double-bladed lightsaber of Phantom Menace's Darth Maul, the Horseman is more than a match for Crane, or any of the townspeople - except for the one who summoned the dark rider from hell.The movie also stars Christopher Walken, veteran character actor Jeffrey Jones, as well as legendary British thesp (and another Phantom Menace alum) Ian McDiarmid. Miranda Richardson is also brilliant, as is the bevy of lauded British stage actors, including Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee (soon to appear in Lord of the Rings) and Michael Gough.Tim Burton's latest achievement was a dream project for many of the film's principles, and it shows. Sleepy Hollow is a masterpiece, securing the director's place among cinema's greatest storytellers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton at his best. Dark, atmospheric and fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is all about what director Tim Burton does best, combining spectacular sets, dark plot and a sharp sense of humour. Sleepy Hollow should appeal to all fans of the dark and macabre alike, as well as anyone else with a morbid imagination. The scenes involving the horseman himself are simply stunning and while the plot hardly veers from the predictable, still maintains your attention. Some scenes are positively dripping in blood which may not appeal to some tastes, but it never gives the impression of being over the top. Top all this off with dazzling SFX, plenty of laughs and fine direction, Sleepy Hollow adds up to a pretty good film. There are times when I felt Ricci and Depp lacked chemistry and come the ending you may feel it's just another slasher movie, however there's no denying it's all been done with a sense of style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant masterwork of gothic fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography in this film is the best I've seen in a movie. Every scene is a gothic work of art, and it's worth seeing just for that alone. It also features the brilliant and charismatic actors Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, and a fantastic gothic score by master musician Danny Elfman. Put it on your "Must See" list!I have to give this film a ten out of ten because it thoroughly deserves it. Personally, I would have preferred Depp to have played his role seriously, rather than as a parody, but because I know others will enjoy it all the more for that, and because the film is so perfect in other ways, it would not be fair for me to reduce it from its ten points just for that one personal preference.For those who don't already know, the story involves a headless horseman who has risen from the dead, and rides through the countryside wielding a sword and cutting off other people's heads, in revenge for losing his own. In this version of the story, there are more details than the other film versions, giving the story a more interesting plot.The original story was a poem by Washington Irving (1783-1859) called "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". Some scholars believe that the poem was based on a story by Karl Musus (1735-1787), a German academic writer, who was among the first to collect and write down German folktales. If Irving didn't get the idea from the German folktale, the similarity is remarkable.Although heads are cut off, in gory detail, please don't be put off from seeing the film because of that. It's done more like a nightmare fantasy, rather than realistically, so every teenager and adult would be able to watch it without difficulty, though it's certainly not for children. I would strongly urge everyone to see this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am NOT a big fan of scary movies. Well, I'm not a big fan of anything scary. My best friend, however, is not scared of any movies or haunted houses. So, obviously, she tries to get me to do something scary about once a month. And this month, it was a scary movie. She had tried to get me to watch Carrie a while back and, of course, I chickened out. Now, the only scary movies I'd seen before Sleepy Hollow were Scream 2 and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. So believe me I was a bit skeptical when I walked into the theater Thursday night. But whatever small amounts of enthusiasm for horror flicks I had obtained through haunted houses and cheap horror flicks were greatly increased when I saw Sleepy Hollow. It was everything a scary movie should be, and more. So to all my fellow skeptics out there, this one will restore your faith in horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderfully atmospheric film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen some of the so-called classics that The Hammer films produced, nor have I seen many of the classic horror films that Lugosi and Lee and Price have made. But from what I have read and heard, those films were very atmospheric and had many shots of murky graveyards, dark streets with only dimly lit lights and monsters that seemed unstoppable to the average human being. And it may be true that it has been about 40 years since those kinds of films graced our screens, but I think Tim Burton has produced a film that is a throw back to those types of films. I have never been a huge fan of Burton's work but I must say that this film is as atmospheric and entertaining as I could imagine it to be.What makes this film so well done is the fact that the time frame allows for many of the abnormal shots and situations. The year is 1899 and this is before electricity and cars and automatic weapons. This is a time when light is shed by candle, people get around on horses and the weapon of choice for most is still the sword. Thus the possibilities are endless with what you can do. Tim Burton wisely gives us much to marvel at. The opening sequence that has one of the townfolk decapitated is so well done that you are almost afraid that the rest of the film can't possibly follow in the footsteps of the brilliant first ten minutes. But it does and it does it consistently. There are many scenes with dense fog and dark nights, and that is the real strength of the film.The film also contains some rather humorous parts with Depp, as Ichabod Crane, using his new scientific methods of detective work much to the awe and sometimes chagrin of the town folk. In one rather funny scene, Crane arrives at the scene of a decapitated body. He inspects it and as he does so, he knows the body has been moved. "Have you moved the body?" he asks the confused man. "Yes, I did." he replies. "You should never move the body at the scene of a murder." Crane tells him angrily. And then with a confused tone and bewildered eyes, the man responds, "Why not?" And then Crane pauses for a minute and then says hesitantly, "Because, you just shouldn't." It is a perfect scene. Crane is just discovering many of his scientific theories and he knows that you shouldn't do something but not really why. His confusion is humorous to us, the audience and many other scenes are played for laughs in the same way.But let's face it, we didn't go to this film to be humoured, we went to be at least mildly frightened. And I have to say that fright was not something that I experienced watching the film. The headless horseman is a vicious villian and he is relentless in his pursuit of heads, but he is not really scary. That is not to say that the film is poor because of this, it is just to say that scares are few and far between in the film. The rest of the experience is a positive one and I honestly have to say that the decapitation scenes are a wonder. I understand that they can do much with computer animation now, but the cut from live action to computer animation is so subtle that you cannot even remotely tell what is real and what is a CGI. Similarily, if anyone remembers the first Friday the 13th film when Kevin Bacon dies, he gets a spear through the throat and they had to do that by cutting from one angle to the next and then put a replica of his body under the covers. As the spear came through the bedsprings and the mattress and into his throat it had the appearance that it was really going through his body when in reality his head was nowhere near the fake body. They then added some coloured chocolate syrup to make it look real. But you can tell that there was a deliberate cut in angles to complete the affect. In Sleepy Hollow there is no change in camera angles, it really is quite impressive.Sleepy Hollow is a fun film, it is not great but it is worth the ten dollars that you will spend at the theater to watch it. Christopher Walken is priceless as the Horseman and even though he has no spoken dialogue he is one of the more entertaining actors and charcters in the film. Depp is good and so is Ricci. Principal Ed Rooney is also quite good in his small role. And some of the British actors are perfect in creating the atmosphere that you need to pull a film off like this. One in particular I think I recognize from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, he was Duncan, the man who gets his eyes removed. At least he looks like the same actor. All around, this is a good film and anyone who likes atmosphere will surely enjoy it. It is also nice to see Francis Coppola in the producers chair again.7 out of 10</fullReview>

Like many people, I was a bit dissapointed with Christina Ricci's part in the film, but I still have a lot of confidence in her as an actress. I saw this movie with my mom, and for more than half of it she was curled up in a little ball in her seat, griping my arm so hard that it lost circulation. I didn't think it was exactly scary, but that might be because I was busy ooh-ing and aah-ing about all the cool-looking things going on.

It didn't scare me in the least. If you are looking for depth and soul-searching, or tormented and deep characters, don't see this movie! Not quite as campy as Clue, this movie delighted that part of me who hates a complicated movie. It is a bit of a who-dun-it mystery, one that if you pay close attention to you can figure out, but you really have to watch, in the way of Mission Impossible. The characters are admittedly two diminsional and the humor admittedly juvenile. What makes it acceptable is that, with the exception of that misleading trailer we saw tagged to Blair Witch, the film doesn't take itself seriously. It has a cute little beginning, with jokes that made me roll my eyes, and a cute little end (is that a spoiler? I don't think so..), with blood and fainting jokes splattered(no pun intended!) through the middle. Johnny Depp's accent isn't that great; you can't tell if Christina Ricci is even supposed to have one (why would she?) or not. All in all, I loved it. I want to take my family back to see it. Not for the small though, bloooooddy. Hey, they knew it wasn't going to win an Oscar when they made it, so why expect it to be that kind of movie.

		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is Tim Burton's "Sistine Chapel Ceiling." It is a terrific, complex, funny, film that ties in every known movie genre known to man. This movie would have sucked BIG TIME had some other, less visionary director taken the reigns, but Mr. Burton is a truly gifted artist. I've heard many complaints that the movie is too cliched, too cheesy, too hokie, to formulaic. THAT'S THAT POINT! It's Burton poking fun at the "by-the-book" horror movies. To me, some of the funniest parts in the movie were the most cliched because it's ALL tongue-in-cheek. The movie's got the usual cliched chase scene, the usual "villain-tells-plans" scene, the usual cheesy lines ("You've bewitched me."...."Is he dead?" "That's the problem. He was already dead."), but that's what MAKES this movie, the fact that it can completely poke fun at the genre while being a great movie on the side. Not only is Burton a master at this sort of double-handed perspective, his visuals, the dark and foreboding world he has created, is something which must be seen in order to be believed. He truly is a visionary of film. And the actors/actresses....if I were to start with them, I'd be here typing all day. Let's just say that each one is PERFECT for their given roles, Depp and Ricci, especially. Same goes for the score. In closing: GO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lopping Heads</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When an Oscar-winning actor (Martin Landau) can't make it past the first minute of a film, there is something wrong. Indeed, Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is a special effects vehicle looking for a movie. The Washington Irving story depended upon imagination to give it a creepy, frightful rendition. This film spoils everything by showing lopping heads, headless horseman flying off the bark of an old tree, and pursued victims who meet their vividly bloody demise. Like the striptease artist, Burton leaves us with little to imagine. "Sleepy Hollow" becomes boring, predictable, and not very scary. Its main characters mirror the unnecessarily complicated plot by becoming obtuse and dull. Johnny Depp, like his earlier film, "Dead Man", comes across as flat and uninspiring as Ichabod Crane. Christina Ricci is miscast as the young virgin that she is not. Even Miranda Richardson's role is terribly undeveloped until the end when she is thrown at us both as a way to neatly end the film and also to explain to us how all the missing pieces fit. "Sleepy Hollow" is a sad example of how modern day technology can spoil an earlier work of horror. When there is little to imagine, you can't help but ask when the movie will end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, the dark star of 8MM and SEVEN, must have envisioned this adaptation of Washington Irving's Headless Horseman legend as another of his dour, black nights of the soul; he even manages to work in decapitation of a pregnant woman #2. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) was clearly painted, in some early draft, as a variant of the Nice Guy Charlie cops played by Morgan Freeman and Nicolas Cage who discover the world is a dank and evil place.But then Tim Burton set to work turning Walker's trendy angst-cloning into another of his campy pastiches of the horror culture of yore; and Johnny Depp tweaked the conceit further still. Depp added to Ichabod two elements clearly un-present in the script: the squeamish physicality of a snooty twelve-year-old girl (we like that) and a tendency to blanch, sissy-pants style, at the least sign of mayhem (we found that got old on the first try).Christina Ricci, bless her heart, surely must join the ranks of other talented young actresses--Claire Danes is one--who must never, ever again be cast in a period movie. Limping back from the avant backlot of ED WOOD and MARS ATTACKS! to Main Stream, U.S.A., Tim Burton had a hit on his hands here that surprised me --its success must surely derive from the fact that today's teens on dates, pace BLAIR WITCH and SIXTH SENSE, like movies that seem to be "horror movies" without actually being remotely scary. Burton's model here seems to be Hammer horror, but even the tackiest, late-in-the-cycle Hammer is rich in characterization. SLEEPY HOLLOW, in comparison, is as human-being-free as a Jerry Bruckheimer speaker-blower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I've always loved about this story is that the hero never wanted to be a hero. This movie portrays that so well. Another thing I like is how well the mood was set. You knew from the first sceen that there was trouble in the town. The camera work, computer effects and the acting made it a movie that I am deffinatly going to get when it is on video. I send my complemants to Tim Burton and everyone who worked on "Sleep Hollow". I give this movie a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of the original Washington Irving story, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". Growing up in New York State, it was almost required reading as a New York citizen, especially at Halloween time. The story was chilling and creepy, with deep dark lonely woods inhabited by a ghostly colonial headless horseman. So when I heard Tim Burton (a very stylish director, the current master of film gothic) was adapting the story for the screen, I was looking forward to seeing the finished product. I was not disappointed. "Sleepy Hollow", written by Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker ("Se7en") delivers. Although some story elements have been changed from the original (Ichabod Crane is now a New York City constable rather than a school teacher), the creeps are still here. Director Tim Burton has fashioned a small town in 1799 upstate New York into a place straight out of a gothic fairy tale but still seems believable. There is copious amounts of fog and one can almost see the colonial stone and wood buildings leaning at an angle like drawings from a book of fables. The set design is fantastic.Johnny Depp, as progressive constable Ichabod Crane (he believes in a scientific approach to crime solving), confident in his largely untried methods to solve any homicide but handicapped by his underlying fear of the unknown, is powerful. As he demonstrated in "Ed Wood", Depp is an actor to be reckoned with, displaying great emotionality when fighting his own fearful past. Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, has come a long way from "Casper". She has developed into a competent actor who exudes the repressed sexuality demanded by her role, creating tension between herself and Depp's Crane. Miranda Richardson wonderfully immerses herself in the role of Lady Van Tassel, a character with several faces. And Christopher Walken, as the Hessian (soon to be) Headless Horseman, proves he can dominate the screen even when his character has not one word to say. His facial expressions and body language alone is frightening. The music, by former Oingo Boingo band member Danny Elfman (his origins will always be remembered by those of us who were in our mid 20's during the 1980's) is as rich and haunting as any film music he has composed in the past. He stands with John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith and James Horner as one of the best film music composers in Hollywood. I personally consider his best work to be the soundtrack for "Batman", and he has equaled this with his music for "Sleepy Hollow".If there is any flaw in "Sleepy Hollow", it is the intrigue and conspiracy surrounding a last will and testament. The criminal act involved with this brought the film out of the supernatural (where it works best) and down to reality (where the film should never have been). Although this element is essential to the plot, thankfully it is briefly touched on and we are quickly returned to the chills of the netherworld."Sleepy Hollow" is great entertainment, a much better made film and much more chilling than "The Blair Witch Project" ever hoped to be. Although not perfect, "Sleepy Hollow" is a solid film. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY good ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's incarnation "Sleepy Hollow" sends viewers on a journey with Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who has been exiled to investigate a series of mysterious murders in upstate New York so as to rid New York City courts of his objections to their methods of ringing in justice. Armed with a plethora of investigative gadgets of his own making, he is much like a panicky, somewhat slow version of Sherlock Holmes ... if he fainted a lot.Crane meets the cast of town elders and their juniors, as well as Catrina (Christina Ricci), the somewhat enigmatic daughter of the host who summoned him from NYC.The story follows Crane and his young sidekick, an orphaned boy who is perhaps slightly more bold than Crane himself, as they look into the murders, search for the missing heads, and attempt to deduce exactly what the motives could be and who is behind the murders, not to mention who or what the horseman actually is.I enjoyed this film immensely. It had the characteristic Burton touches, where even the use of shades of brown would perhaps be considered too flamboyant for the screen. It used flashbacks effectively to flesh out the Crane character, using bits from his childhood which give the viewer an insight into how he is constituted.Depp delivered an extremely fine performance as the fish-out-of-water constable, and the comedy of the movie reveals itself through Crane. Ricci's performance was acceptable. There really wasn't a great deal that could be done with her character and the voice given Catrina, so no performance would have really shone through. The young sidekick, as well as other supporting characters (including those portrayed by Jeffrey Jones, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken) were played very well, also.The story itself wasn't anything special, nor was the way it was presented. You know what to expect when you go to a Tim Burton movie, and you get it.The intangible this film delivers is, for lack of a better term, fun. This is a FUN movie to sit back and watch. The chase scenes and fight scenes are top-notch and invite the viewer in to the point where you feel almost as though you're there, trying to avoid becoming the next victim to fall prey to the horseman's sword or axe.It was shot beautifully, had solid performances, and takes the viewer on a ride that eclipses any single element of the film. Not for the overly-queasy, but definitely worth a big screen nod. (12/16/99)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film all around, and in many ways (visually for one) Tim Burton's best work yet. Superb casting (Depp, Ricci, and Christopher Walken--could you think of any three actors who more perfectly fit Burton's style?) direction, set design and cinematography make this a must see.On a different note, anybody notice the Phantom Menace "parallels"? First I notice that one of the main characters is none other than Ian McDiarmid, AKA Senator Palpatine/The Emperor. Then about 3/4 of the way through the film, there's a scene that, without giving anything away, looks like a straight take-off of a famous TPM scene involving Darth Maul, only in this case it's the "Headless Horseman". THEN I find out that the stunt double for the Horseman is none other than Ray Park, AKA Darth Maul! Pretty odd stuff. Anybody know if it was intentional? Is Burton secretly a huge Star Wars fan?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One instance where the effects actually make the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gorgeous film, such that it hardly matters that the story is perhaps a bit faulty. Story, as I said, scarcely matters. Whatever story there is is enough to hold the movie together and maintain minimal interest. Sleepy Hollow is a very visual film. The costumes were great, the sets of New York and Sleepy Hollow were amazingly authentic and the effects so awesome, that I scarcely paid attention to the story or even to the notion there was supposed to be one; I was too busy marveling at the spectacle of the Headless Horseman and other remarkable effects. This is one film where the effects actually make the movie (Jurassic Park was another such film as was The Lost World - marginally). There was also a surreal, quirky feeling about the film that I rather enjoyed. There's even a sequence that is reminiscent of the Disney cartoon.This film is also about legend, i.e. elevating and expanding the status of the legend of the Headless Horseman to the status of the (hackneyed) vampire and werewolf and doing a damn good job of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and Gorgeous Sleepy Hollow with a Twist of Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone was born to direct a horror/thriller film, Tim Burton would be one of the contenders, but during his career, he has never traveled down that road when you think of it. Well the director of such atmospheric movies as "Batman", "Edward Scissorhands" and "Ed Wood" has stepped into that realm with the visually stunning and violent "Sleepy Hollow". Burton has turned the old classic into a Burton classic as only his dark mind can and we as the audience benefit."Sleepy Hollow" is based on the Washington Irving's "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" about school teacher Icabod Crane's encounter with the headless horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary who terrorized the area known as Sleepy Hollow during the Revolutionary War. Since we are in Burtonland, things have a certain twist. Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a constable in 1799 Manhattan who dabbles in forensic science, investigating deaths and inventing his interesting equipment to help him along the way. Word travels to the city from a tiny farmland community up north about three mysterious deaths. Iacbod looking for a challenge and a chance to utilize his skills, packs his bags and travels to the tiny village known as Sleepy Hollow. Here the residents including the wealthy Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) and his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) tell him that these horrible deaths are the work of the headless horseman. Iacabod, a sort of precursor to the X-Files Scully, governed by logic and science, believes that the work is not supernatural, but human. And so begins his investigation as more and more murders take place.Burton has created another wonderful imagined world that just takes you away for two hours. It is a stunning film to look at, as are most of Burton's films. His 18th century Manhattan and Sleepy Hollow are a world unto themselves and Burton draws you in immediately. The action sequences with the headless horseman are astounding and truly haunting. Each scene is so beautifully staged with great suspense. Compare that with the dreadful and banal "The Bone Collector" that deals with the similar subject of a forensic expert investigating serial killings. Reading "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" as a child I always found it more humorous than terrifying, but Burton does a magnificent job of bringing out the darkness of the story which actually frightened me compared to so many trite horror films today.Burton's Icabod Crane is not your typical hero, but a flawed human being with weaknesses (he gets somewhat squeamish with blood, guts and spiders). Johnny Depp creates another memorable character in a long line of quirky signature roles that have made him one of our finest risk-taking actors. Depp fully embodies the character of Iacabod, warts and all. He brings much depth, compassion and humor to the character. It is a fully realized performance. The other performances are good, especially the very sexy Miranda Richardson. The main weak link, unfortunately is the talented Christina Ricci. It is not her fault; she is just very miscast in the role of the innocent Kristina. She does not quite pull it off and comes off too modern for this period piece and it hurts the film to a certain degree. Watching her performance, all I could think of was Winona Ryder; she would have been perfect. Regardless of this flaw it is still a movie worth seeing and "Sleepy Hollow" shows that Tim Burton is one of our most gifted, imaginative and original directors that also shows his love for movies. Casting the great Hammer horror actor Christopher Lee in a bit role shows that love as in the same way he cast the late Vincent Price in his classic "Edward Scissorhands". "Sleepy Hollow" is another gem from Burton. If you are bringing children, which there were some in the theater, the decapitation scenes are gruesome and violent. Recommended.    1/2</fullReview>

Everything about the film is quite well done, the sets, the costumes, even the performances.

		<fullReview>I suppose if you are a huge fan of Tim Burton's style (and let's face it, that's all he is... style) then this movie might satisfy. If, however, you are interested in multi-dimensional characters that you care about, and a story that's feels even remotely genuine, then skip Sleepy Hollow.Once again, Tim Burton has focused all his attention on atmosphere. I will give Tim Burton this much credit, he has the dreamy, gothic, spooky yet droll at the same time, moody atmosphere down pat. The world that he creates on screen is marvelously complete. The only problem is that it's the same world that he creates in all his films and I'm REALLY bored with it.It never ceases to amaze me that Hollywood can pour such obscene amounts of money into effects and star power, and yet when it comes to a decent script with sharp, believable dialogue they turn into Ebenezer Scrooge. The dialogue in this movie is so trite and cliche that I actually found myself laughing out loud in the theater. It is a crime to force such talented actors to speak such ridiculous words.This film has finally made me accept the truth, I just don't like Tim Burton films. SKIP IT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Halloween is obviously Burton's favorite holiday!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton delivers a truly frightening example of what the Legend of Sleepy Hollow looks like when done right. The voyage of Ichabod Crane from New York to Sleepy Hollow descends the audience into a setting which is the very definition of the word "Spooky". We are kept, just one step behind Ichabod as he delves head-first into the terrible mystery of the Headless Horseman. Burton's characteristic vision transitions between an almost comic-book atmosphere at times and an old world setting so deep one can almost smell the mud and fresh-cut hay. His scenes use this ambiance to center on the the characters and the story rather than provide the audience with pretty view. A great deal of credit must go to Art Direction and Production design. Johnny Depp plays true to Ichabod's character, allowing the shortcomings and nailing the distinctiveness that makes this rendering of Sleepy Hollow so appealing. Christina Ricci makes her complicated role aloof and seductive. A notable entrance by newcomer Marc Pickering as he plays Young Masbath - this boy did such good work I wonder if his role was expanded during filming. This is what child-actors should model! Christopher Walken and Ray Park team up to bring an evil, determined, monster to life in the form of the greatest Headless Horseman to grace the silver screen. A disappointing performance by Starship-Trooper-alum Casper Van Dien and the difficulty of following the names of characters in the film distract from a few key sequences, but they do little damage to a work that is obviously created by people VERY excited about it.This is the definitive Legend of Sleepy Hollow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie! Some people who had seen it before me told me that it was kind of stupid and even funny. So I had to check it out for myself. I saw this movie today, and I enjoyed it a lot. I didn't think it was stupid at all. The story was very interesting, and had a nice twist; I thought it was pretty unpredictable....throughout the movie, I kept wondering what was going to happen next and who was going to be responsible for what. Visually, the movie is amazing! Fantastic art direction--I loved the sets. The cinematography was outstanding. In fact, I loved the whole look of the film--its whole gothic look. I liked seeing all of the cloudy days and the spooky nights. You don't really get to see sunlight in this movie. And everyone in the movie looks pale. Although not too many bright colors were used, the costumes were spectacular. I liked the contrast between the dark costumes and the pale complexions. One notable thing I liked about this movie is how Tim Burton gave this movie a look that can be described as a cross between a gothic nightmare and an enchated forest. The look and feel of this movie reminds me of the look and feel of two other movies: "Legend" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula". In my opinion, "Sleepy Hollow" is like a cross between those two movies. As a horror movie, this movie never sells out, and it's not campy, nor does it disappoint. I wasn't disappointed by this movie (and I'm usually very picky with movies). I'm glad I went to see this movie....I'm thinking of seeing it again, and I highly recommend it....though it's not for the squeamish. By the way, it was great to see Miranda Richardson in this movie--it had been a while since I last saw her in a movie, and I think she's a very talented actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If a viewer goes into this movie looking for a good scare, he might be disappointed. Because the cartoony head-chopping isn't exactly scary. But if you go into it just expecting to have fun, you won't be disappointed at all. Aside from just being fun, Tim Burton makes this the coolest looking movie of the year by far. He's come up with some great looking landscapes. Johnny Depp is at his best. And the headless horseman is the best bad guy of the year, forget Darth Maul. You wouldn't expect there to be much investigating for Depp's Ichabod Crane to do. I mean, it's obvious some headless dude is chopping people's heads off, but the story manages to be quite an entertaining "Who done it?" I'd give something away if I elaborated, so I'll leave it at that. Burton obviously has fond feelings toward the old Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," because he throws in all kinds of little nods to the classic cartoon. He even uses frog noises that sound like "Ichabod." If you like the old cartoon at all - and who doesn't ? - you need to see this movie.</fullReview>

The lines were delivered from somewhere out in left field, and suddenly our evil villain is a comedian.And then, oy with that ending! Think of it as sort of "Last Action Hero" meets "Reanimator". I'm sorry, I like special effects just like the rest of us, but when you keep a headless person walking around on screen too long I'm going to go into giggle fits and start thinking about Reanimator and other really bad scifi. Why the Last Action Hero comparison? Stop and remember all the cliches about movie endings that movie attempted to poke fun at. They're all in this movie. All of them. I'm serious.I have no idea which parts of this movie were supposed to be funny. I didn't think the ending was supposed to be, anyway.

		<fullReview>I might reveal more than you want to know about this movie.. so beware of reading it:: Everyone seems to be commenting on the scare quality, the beautiful cinematography, and the deviation from the original story, whenever this movie is disucssed. I think there might be more to this movie than that. Think of it this way, if you were a geeky kid, like Tim Burton, you would relate to Ichabod Crane. But Crane loses in the original story to the "jock", and it is hinted that the horsemen is most likely not a real ghost. But obviously Burton enjoyed the story, so he took it, and made his own version where Crane over comes his squeamish fears and saves the day against a real ghost. If you want me to give some proof, think of the little boy watching the candle show. The Horesemen only ever killed those he was ordered to kill, or made a strong attempt to stop him(like the jock). But he goes after the little boy who was watching "moving pictures" made by a candle-powered toy. That little boy is the link to Tim Burton, and the reason he did Sleepy Hollow. He did it all for himself. Oh yes, and did anyone notice the sly joke at the audience: Depp calls the year 1799 the last year of the millenium on two ocassions, when really that applies only to the 1999 audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow rocked! I think that Christina Ricci did a wonderful job as Katrina Van Tassel. I also think that Johnny Deep made a good constible Crane, but his character was kind of a scardy cat so to speak (but I guess that it's important to stick to Washington Irving's tale as well as possible). All in all I think that Sleepy Hollow deserves at least a 9 for a rating!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christina Ricci is the real star of this film. As in all her movies, she has stolen the show. Ricci is one of the rarest beauties of our time. She can be light and dark, hot and cold all at the same time. Watch this movie and you can't help being enthralled by her.The movie as a whole was really good. Tim Burton has done it again! The movie has EXCELLENT cinematography. The only thing that I may have done differently is I would add some more cool Headless Horseman murder scenes. This could have been the absolute best slasher movie of all time with some work. The death sequences here were all very creepy and different from those done in other horror movies that have come out lately.I'd rather see this one than the Scream series any day of the week. Please Tim Burton (if you are reading this), make a sequel of two of this flick. But in the sequel give us die hard horror fans some more death scenes. This is one of the best concepts for a horror flick of all time...Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers have nothing on the Headless Horseman!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new spin on an old tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his usual dark style, Tim Burton has put a new spin on an old tale that will leave you in awe of his fantastic vision.With this work, Burton's cinematography has matured exquisitely. The setting and landscapes for Sleepy Hollow are breathtaking and surreal, contrasting dark hues of grey with the brilliance of deep crimson in its more chilling scenes.Johnny Depp's reprisal of Ichabod Crane is slight camp, reminiscent of his role as Ed Wood. It's as if Depp has studied old black and white film actors with an unusual amount of interest; his mannerisms and expressions could have been taken from any one of the old greats of the fifties.Surprising cameos from Christopher Lee and Martin Landau are wonderfully effective, but the most satisfying comes from the Headless Horseman himself, played by the sinister Christopher Walken. His portrayal of the man before the legend is brief but powerful due to creative use of make-up, complete with teeth filed down to sharp little daggers and contacts that make his already menacing gaze even more frightening.If you are expecting to be terrified out of your wits, then you will be disappointed. But there are more than a few good jumps to shake things up as well as 'tasteful' use of special effects that do not overpower the film, only add to it. The heads roll magnificently!Photographically speaking, this is Tim Burton's best film and the slight changes in the original legend are necessary to achieve his vision. Depp's Ichabod Crane is an investigator trying to find new ways of solving crime through amateur forensics complete with his own handmade surgical instruments. This makes for good comedy as well as good gore in some of the film's funnier moments.A plot twist near the end leaves Ichabod thinking he's found the truth, but more is to follow as the story climaxes and changes direction before finally coming to a close. No spoilers here, but all in all I found Sleepy Hollow to be a fun film with all the elements of a good ghost story. The escapist part of me was taken by the creative use of sets and camera work. A good piece of cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a surprisingly weak screenplay (even with Tom Stoppard's polishing), Tim Burton's latest is still a triumph through sheer visual panache. This is easily the most sensuously beautiful movie I have seen in a very long time. Certainly the Tree of the Dead is a haunting image, although the Horseman himself becomes less scary as the movie progresses simply because we see so much of him that he becomes more mundane. The "surprise" ending is tipped by an obvious bit of casting, but overall this movie is still a vibrant experience, and I can't wait to see those lush images again. The DVD should be a knockout!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stimulating movie that I've ever seen. I would compare Tim Burton to the likes of Monet or Van Gogh. Every single scene was like an individual painting. Tim Burton has a way of taking something that is fantasy or dreamlike, and conveying that picture onto film like no other. This can also be seen in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. Artistically, aspects like the contrast of the red blood on Johnny Depp's white face just blew me away. Johnny Depp did an outstanding performance also. He totally brought new life to the character of Ichabod Crane. This film definitely stands out as a film which defines artistic filmmaking and places Tim Burton in a class of his own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unbiased view from a huge Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'm being facetious. I am very strongly biased toward both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Keep that in mind as you read on...This movie is vintage Tim Burton from the stark forest to the skewed buildings in the village to the light snowfall at the end. As in most of his movies, the imagery and background are just important as the characters. If you've enjoyed Edward Scissorhands, Batman (and Batman Returns), and Ed Wood, you will almost certainly enjoy this.As expected, I thoroughly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance. His confident, yet cowardly Crane adds another notch to an already impressive belt. Other Burton mainstays include Jeffrey Jones (slightly under-used here) and Michael Gough, both on their third Burton film.A couple of other bonuses: - Including Christopher Lee was a minor stroke of genius - The Headless Horseman is one of the coolest characters I've seen on film this year - Danny Elfman, an excellent film composer in his own right, creates his finest work for Tim Burton and this film is no exception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Coppola's presentation of Brahm Stoker's Dracula has horror been delivered so ingeniously. This film reeks of Burton's dark, gothic, anti-pastel-colors style of scenery. Death looms everywhere in scenery with fog, autumn leaves, cemetaries, dead-dry trees and we are supposed to believe that a supernatural entity, the horseman, is able to roam the earth amidst a industrial-dawning society. The industrial-age elements consisting of the smoke stacks in New York, the windmill, Ichabod's satchel and his forensics, etc... The horror is delivered in majestic, triumphant grandeure and not cheezy, grab-atcha gore. The grey setting acts as a perfect contrasting canvas, or an amplifier for the bloody scenes which would never make us cringe so nearly as much if we were watching Friday the 13th part Y2K.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decapitation has never been more fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I liked about Tim Burton's update of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow, is that it's not stingy with the blood. Blood is poured all over the place, but not in a revolting sort of way, but in a way that you expect. The town is so dark and spooky, you welcome to grisly beheadings of the headless horseman.Johnny Depp, in his third Burton film, is a nice Ichabod Crane. He's such a wuss, yet he walks away with his skull intact. There's alot of Burton regulars like Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken. His girlfriend, Lisa Marie, plays a very bewitching spirit in the movie. But this is Christina Ricci's first outing in a Burton film, which is surprising since their personas are at the same dark level (she is like the new Winona Ryder in the new Tim Burton movies). Equally surprising is that she plays a sweet, innocent Katrina Van Tassel.But enough with the actors. The only time actors really mattered in a Burton film was ED WOOD.The headless horseman looks great in this movie, with or without his head. He goes right in with Burton's usual gorgeously dark background. But, also, he adds a little fairy tale flavor, which you get really into. Almost entrancing.The ending is the weak point of the film. Everything comes together too quickly, yet there's a chase scene climax that involves the horseman, and that's about when you look at your watch and realize you have to go to the bathroom.This is not Tim Burton's best movie, though the setting is marvelous, there's too many characters to keep up with and his usual cartoonish scares (like the one involving the witch) doesn't make you feel anything anymore.Maybe it's Andrew Kevin Walker's script, or at least the several revisions of it, which left the story muddled and uneven. It doesn't work for this movie, yet the decapitation scenes are loads of fun (who knew there were so many ways you could chop off a head!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as I thought it would be!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I've been waiting for this movie since the first trailer came out in July. And when I saw the banners say Tim Burton film, starring Johnny Depp, and music by Danny Elfman, I knew this would be worth waiting for. Obviously, I saw it on opening day, and was in anticipation until the Paramount sign came on. When it was all over, I thought it was great!! The acting by all the cast, especially Johnny Depp, were great. Another obvious remark, but Danny Elfman's music was superb. In &gt;fact, I bought the sound track before I saw the movie. The special effects were very realistic. The decapitations were gruesome, but awesome! And of course, the directing by Tim Burton was all I thought it'd be, and this movie will become a classic for sure. However, there is one complaint. You'll probably disagree with me, but this movie COULD HAVE BEEN PG-13. There were bloody, and gore-filled scenes, but it was almost in a kiddie kind of violence. Except for one part that was unnecssary, but it wasn't disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film except for 2 elements. Spoiler if you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography was good. The acting, by all persons, Depp, Walkin, Ricci, and Lee, was great. Costumes were good. And the background was close enough to the real story that you felt you were not watching a rewrite. However there were anachronisms galore and I felt that the movie we were set up for was not the movie we got at the end.First are the anachronisms. The way the women dressed was a little bit off. Ichabod looked more 19th century than 18th. So did the courtroom. The forensic Pathology that Ichabod practiced may have been a slight bit early, but that is debateable.Now the set up. We are given a character that is ahead of his time. He uses reason, and science to figure out crimes. Crane is presented as a Sherlock Holmes type. The first quarter of the movie is presented in a sort of "Hound of the Baskervilles" style. This is where I was expecting it to lead. Halfway through this idea falls apart and we find ourselves in a witchcraft based fantasy. That was a turn that in my opinion hurts the movie more than it helps. It would have made more sense to give Ichabod a background more like that of Van Helsing in Stoker's Dracula. Or made him the cop that blames things on the paranormal a la Fox Moulder. Then the investigative aspect of him would still be intact and the viewer would not feel that his time was wasted in needless character development. Then again, that would make the character all the more futile. And when reason confronts folklore and the arcane, then futility is the result. This would make the movie more unreasonable and thus spookier. For things without reason baffle the modern human mind.All in all it is a good film. However the characterisation methods are a bit untried but still work well to acheive the directors goal. If you can stomach a historical to fantasy switch and an age of reason to magical plot, then you will enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview> Sleepy Hollow offered very few disappointments. The Direction was slick, the mood intense, and the performances for the most part,consistently good. Johnny Depp owes the development of his career to Burton,each film he has done for the director has revealed a finely tuned performance. his comic timing as Icabod Crane is well polished. Christina Ricci fares less well as Katrina. the role is a thankless one and she never really tries to act it. Delightful support is provided by the wonderful 4 town elders played to perfection by Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars evil Senator/Emperor Palpatine),Michael Gambon,Jeffrey Jones(Amadeus's Emperor Joseph),and Michael Gough (of Hammer film fame). I would have liked to see these men have more screen time but it was worth losing more of them to Christopher Lee's great pre-credits cameo. Christopher Walken and Miranda Richardson also provide fine support as the Horseman and the haughty Lady Van Tassell respectively. This is by no means Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow, it is Tim Burton's child and shows all the traits of its brilliant parent. do not try to compare the two they are seperate stories altogether. Both are well worth the visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple film revisiting a classic story plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When one wonders just how good a film can be when you take out the excessive gore and brutality, one can see that some films are still good. Sleepy Hollow is an example where avoiding excessive special effects, and relying on simple acting can be an effective combination. The plot is from the old classic novel. This film takes on a moderate pace and is fairly sterile of the modern social pollution, although one routinely sees that every actress under the age of 40 is wearing a wonderbra and exposing her chest as if it were fashionable. I can't say that the film was too difficult to relate with, which must mean that the acting was fair or adequate. The special effects of the headless horseman galloping down the foggy countryside was excellent. There is little more to the story that has yet to be developed. It is obvious that the novel was not really written for film, but it produced a mildly entertaining result when it was re-created for this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A enthralling fantasy full of whimsy and mysticism. From the very opening titles to the end credits this film is a pure joy that so closely resembles the Disney version it was that you begin the forget that this film is live action. The sets are amazing. I read somewhere that Tim Burton had most of the back drops and sets built from the ground up. He doesn't like using SFX or matte painting. If there's an Oscar in the bag for this stint it's going to be for production design. Every actor in this film must have been prepared to behave in the mannerism of the animated Disney characters. They do this, and it's a wonder to behold. Johnny Depp is perfect in his role as the nervous constable. He was so fun to watch. Christina Ricci (the most beautiful thing I've ever seen), shines as Katarina. She's the most beautiful woman since Grace Kelly (who coincidentally died the same year Christina was born). Her face glows like an angel and her voice drifts with a soothing but subtle 17th century accent. Everyone in in this film was cast perfectly.The cinematography in this film was mind blowing. I kept thinking to myself "it's so animated". From interviews, I learned that this is what Burton wanted. It worked perfect. The decapitations (more than any movie I've ever seen) are done tastefully and sometimes humorously. The heads get lopped right off and spin in mid air. So much fun!Other than the mild "slowness" in the middle, this film is so much fun. You've got to see this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think Burton wanted to make a "Hammer Production" film, and he succeeded. Note an early scene with Hammer stalwart, Christopher Lee, sitting with hunched shoulders that suggest bat wings. The movie is good to look at and all-around well done, but the story is nothing at all like the one Washington Irving wrote. In Irving's story, Ichabod Crane was a gangly school master and singing master. Irving's story is leisurely and light in tone, a comedy. Although it mentions dismemberment and tales of the supernatural, there is no explicit gore. It is about how Brom Bones outdoes Ichabod for the hand of Katrina Van Tassel.If there are schoolmasters and schoolmistresses out there who think their students will experience anything like early American literature in seeing this movie, they are wrong. They will experience a passably involving and visually stimulating tale--but it's not Washington Irving's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the early moments, "Sleepy Hollow" grabbed my attention. I was immediately taken in by the story. The dark and somber tone set by Tim Burton in many of his previous films was just as evident in the beginning here. Several elements were working together to create an intriguing movie.The design was almost perfect. The colors that made up the background were washed out to a near black and white. Like he has done many times before, Burton gave a lifelike appearance to trees, as well as, houses. The eerie look of the forest was picture perfect. A nearly everlasting darkness was captured with excellent cinematography. The story itself was building up and the acting was strong. Johnny Depp produced a great mix of humor, intelligence, and girlish fear. It was the perfect setting for such a terrifying character as the headless horseman. Burton found a way to strike the audience with fear and managed to find time for some dark comedy in between. This was shaping up to be a classic horror film. I could tell I was going to enjoy this film all the way through.I was wrong.Everything falls apart in the second half. The story becomes too complicated, although not confusing. The idea of a "conspiracy theory" is not fitting. The movie loses its edge and the mood it sets by turning into an average crowd-pleasing blockbuster. Although it didn't bother me, the horseman chops off about 10 heads too many. I actually enjoyed that and found that rather funny. Christopher Walken is funny in this movie and I'm not making fun of him. Several chase scenes and explosions follow. It doesn't look like a Tim Burton movie after a while. I lost my initial interest and actually found myself thinking about other things while watching the final 20 minutes or so. Whatever is built up in the first half, it's destroyed in the second.The movie is worth seeing for what it creates in the early stages. The cinematography and settings of this film remain beautiful. Johnny Depp portrays Crane very effectively. However, the story falls apart and reaches a simple resolution filled with explosions. All good elements are drowned out. I just find the second half too disappointing. Overall a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I have a slight aversion to blood and gore, I had to go to this movie after seeing the previews. I would recommend it to anyone, even those with weak stomachs. (SPOILER) Most of the time it's easy enough to tell when the Horseman is coming since he has a few trademark sound effects (hoofbeats, sword-sound).Besides that, I honestly enjoyed this movie. The atmosphere is great, and if you're not too jaded it's pretty easy to get sucked into it. Johnny Depp is fabulous, his facial expressions are the highlight of the movie. And what a face! He's really a good actor, and that's coming from a person who's never really seen too much of him before. Likewise, I'm not a Tim Burton fan, but I think that he did well with this. Some of the dialogue was kind of clunky, but it added to the atmosphere. I really can't comment on too many of the other actors; they kind of faded into the background for me, and I thought most performances paled next to Mr. Depp's. I couldn't even remember most of the other character's names.Really, this movie is more funny then it is scary or suspenseful. It's a good one to see with your friends, you'll find yourself laughing a lot more. It does have some scary moments too, but nothing that anyone old enough to get in with the R rating couldn't handle.I'd like to mention that I've never seen the Disney version, or read the original. You might be better off if you see it that way, since it's a lot easier to see it as an original story, and not notice all the things that were changed. If I had known any of the original versions, my review would probably be quite different.Overall, a pretty good movie with a spectacular performance from Johnny Depp. Try and see it if you can, but don't kick yourself if you don't get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't feel that way at first, but in retrospect I really do think it's his best movie. The plot is secondary to the visuals, but it's done well. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give thoughtful, romantic performances as a detective from New York City and the beautiful villager he falls for while investigating a series of gruesome murders the town believes is being executed by a faceless spectre riding on a horse. Whilst everything he knows as a scientist falls down around him, his love for her and her faith in him remain constant. And this is not the innocent Sleepy Hollow of Washington Irving's tale-- this is a farmtown overflowing with adultery, witchcraft, and murder. And THEN, there are the visuals. The film is filled with images that are vintage Burton: Ichabod (Depp) puts on investigating glasses, and the left lens is twice the size of the right; the staggering Tree of the Dead, whose branches twist in grotesque angles and stream with blood; and the Horseman himself, who lops off heads cleanly and with precision, has a decidedly otherwordly style. Overall, this is a gorgeous film brimming over with high comedy and winning romance. The identity of the person in cahoots with the Horseman is no big surprise, but getting there is the fun in this.</fullReview>

First is Tim Burton's direction. He is able to create the perfect mood for the movie, frightening and simultaneously ridiculous. It is beautifully photographed. The ensemble actors suit the time period so well, they appear to be oil paintings instead of people. Danny Elfman's beautifully dark and complex score is a perfect match to the action at all times. However, Depp carries this movie on his charismatic shoulders. His driven yet cowardly Ichabod Crane is strangely riveting. Ricci also flashes her acting talent as well as her haunting eyes to create a vulnerable and curious character. But there are many flaws in this movie. The plot is interesting, but the dialogue is subpar and the love interest between Katrina and Ichabod has no basis. We are supposed to believe that they fall in love, "Just Because". Many major plot elements are thrown in simply to create mood, such as the story of Ichabod's mother. Some other elements are simply unnecessary gore and disturbing material. I will not even touch upon the total ignorance of Washington Irving's original short story. Let us say that it was changed enough that if Irving were alive today, they could have skipped out on the royalties. However this is an above average movie, and has many scary moments. Bottom Line, it's worth $7.50 if you just want to see a movie, but don't go out of your way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Tim Burton Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The moment I heard about this film when it began production I was thrilled. In my opinion Tim Burton is one of the most creative filmmakers ever. I wasn't sure if this was going to be like the Disney cartoon or a real horror picture. Well, horror film it is, and what a beautiful one too. Everything was impressive: the actors, the editing, the art direction, the soundetc. What impressed me the most was the cinematography work by Emmanuel Lubezki, who also did "A Little Princess". With his work and the dark, dreary art direction topped of with Danny Elfman's impressive score, you have a classic horror film. Tim Burton really showed off his usual trademark of graves, decaying buildings and misty forests. I won't give anything away but probably my favorite scenes are the nightmares that Ichabob Crane keeps having. Those were truly frightnening. Tim Burton you've done it again, and I can't wait for your next film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton shows himself once again to be a master of mood and setting. The look and feel of "Sleepy Hollow" is exactly what one comes to expect of Burton's work, with a dark and foreboding blue tint to everything, and Danny Elfman's superb music keeping the pace. Unfortunately, the good stuff ends there.It is hard to judge the acting, as they were given such abysmal dialogue that it would have been tough to come off as genuine. There are anachronisms, cliches and plain cheap humor throughout. Christina Ricci looks better than she has in a while, and Johnny Depp is... well... Johnny Depp, as always. Christopher Walken is well cast as the Horseman, but is given a foolish mouthpiece that limits his dialogue to grunts. Perhaps they didn't have to pay him as much if he didn't speak? Even Miranda Richardson, usually a superb actress, is reduced to dumping out her entire personal history in one speech so that her character doesn't appear two-dimensional.Yes, the effects were marvelous and the action scenes were truly well done, but the main problem here is the plot. It seems to me that the film originally ended up being about an hour too long, and the editing team cut out major chunks of the movie to shorten it. I was constantly saying to myself "What? How did they figure that out?" or "Gee... that comment seems to be a bit premature...". It was like there were big pieces of the story missing. Particularly when you consider the fact that some characters (Brom?) are introduced and then never seen again. We don't even care when people get killed by the horseman because we don't even know who they are yet!Overall, I'd say it was a good effort, but lost much in the execution. Work on the script, cut out some characters, give a little less gore and a little more story. The plot was hollow...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I read other peoples' reviews, it seems either people like the movie, or they hate it. I particularly liked this movie. It is a must-see for every gothic/morbid person.Many people said the story was poor, and there was little development of the characters. The story was very good. It was somewhat complicated, but not over-the-top, with both humorous and serious dialog. The story combined comedy with horror in a perfect blend to satisfy the comedian or the gothic person. The script and plot were very well-written, with a unique story, that was very much improved from the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Tim Burton is under-appreciated as a director. The sets were dream-like with a nice gothic feel. The movie, except for the dream sequences, have a black-and-white appeal with well-blended periodic additions of color during Ichabod's dreams. But it's never too dark or foggy to see what's going on, which is rare for a movie like this.This movie was, in my opinion, better than the Disney version. It is much bloodier, the special effects are fantastic. There is no gore and very little sexuality, and I think the movie deserved a PG 13 rating, definitely. R is just too high a rating, it wasn't that bad with typical R-movie characteristics. The blood and decapitation never goes over the top.The horseman scenes were dramatic and well shot, also. And the horseman isn't what you always are looking forward to seeing.I highly recommend this movie. Much better than what I expected. I roll my eyes at people who say it was horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Burton's Finest Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I see it, the more I like it."Sleepy Hollow" is one of the most visually beautiful (and bloodiest for Burton) films that I have seen this year. It's dark, moody look almost seems like a black and white film that only has a few splashes (which in some ways, "splashes" is very accurate) of color throughout. Danny Elfman has provided yet another wonderful score, and sets the tone of the film perfectly.Without a doubt, Johnny Depp's performance makes the movie. He's arrogant, eccentric, intelligent... and a bit cowardly and squeamish. He's not the typical "hero" that you find in so many films (although he does fall into the definition a few times), and his performance is both comical and memorable. Great uses of humor through the film to counteract the scary scenes.A great cast rounds out this film with plenty of cameos from Burton's past films to his own personal favorites. Initially, I wasn't sure what to think of Casper Van Dien, because every time I see him, all I think of is "Starship Troopers". Regardless, he pulled off the character of Brom well.I liked the mystery of this. A lot of reviews have criticized the story as being weak, but the mystery was large, and all of the loose ends were resolved. It's actually pretty impressive despite the complex plot twists thrown about.Tim Burton's movies always have that ring of nostalgia or high camp. The references to the Disney short were undeniable, as was the seeming "bat wings" behind Christopher Lee. Burton is so underappreciated as a director.This is an excellent "Burton fan" film, or for anyone who likes a good horror story. For Burton, it ranks up with my personal favorites such as "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Edward Scissorhands".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Tim Burton's. I really enjoyed his work in "Ed Wood" (a very underrated film) "Edward Scissorhands" and most of his others. While I liked this film, I don't think it was his best work.The same goes for Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, whom I feel to be two of the most talented actors in film today. (Note: Ricci has really become a very beautiful woman).The gore was a little thick in this movie and the strays from the original masterpiece work of Irving were too many. The volume in the theatre was also a little loud for me (but that's not Burton's fault).I did get a number of chuckles, though. If you watch this film, go into it expecting to laugh more than anything. It is a very wicked black comedy.But I'd take the animated Disney masterpiece over this one if you're interested in seeing a good retelling of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."</fullReview>

The music, mood, acting, and scenes are all excellent, with a plot that is surprising and entertaining.Johnny Depp's performance was good, and thankfully the cast of characters and other performances coupled well so that nobody shone over anybody else. The characters were well thought out. Being based on an older legend, I was fearful that I would be watching a drawn out and cliche-ridden story. Of course they altered the original tale a little, but you will find yourself delightfully surprised, laughing, screaming, and cheering throughout the screenplay.The music was incredible, and the special effects - not only on the characters - but in the scenes portrays the mood perfectly.

		<shortDescription>I didn't lose my head over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should preface my comments by saying that "Sleepy Hollow" does have a tremendous amount going for it. Tim Burton is nothing if not a master of atmospherics, and he gives his all here, creating a musty, foreboding upstate New York town that seems like a repository of age-old grudges and diabolical portents from the dawn of time. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's camera captures this world with dark, burnished elegance, and the sets and costumes suck us into this simultaneously unreal and convincing world.Johnny Depp is also entertaining as the fastidious and pragmatic Ichabod Crane, who is slowly brought around to realizations of haunted doings in Sleepy Hollow. Overall, the performances are competent, and the Headless Horseman scenes are nicely handled. The Horseman himself is a stunning image, and Ray Park (Darth Maul of "Phantom Menace" fame) fills the suit with energy and great agility. Still, "Sleepy Hollow" does disappoint in a lot of respects. Christina Ricci has little presence, and thus her romance with Crane seems perfunctory and rather pointless. Crane's haunting visions of his murdered mother would play more effectively if seen on a more realistic level. The movie has too many characters to know what to do with, and the plot is busy but not completely involving. As I mentioned, the Horseman scenes are effective, but do not seem to flow organically from the material, but are rather scattered throughout, to the point where they start to feel like money shots from a porno film: "Aah, there's the Horseman! NOW we'll see what we came for!"A mixed bag, but I would ultimately recommend the film, primarily for its visual flair and for some good, creepy atmosphere that is able to generally sustain the plot and character problems. It's not Burton's best, but it has its moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay film, but why the "R" rating?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Waiting for the film to begin and suffering through the interminable previews of coming attractions, I was joined in my row my three young men easily in their early teens (one may have also been only 11 or 12). I wondered why and how they got into this R-rated film since theaters are supposed to be checking IDs and keeping those under 17 out of R films. Based on what I had heard about the film, I made a judgement that these kids probably shouldn't see it--but I chose not to exercise my civic duty and report them to the management for their having sneaked in (as I heard them discussing a few minutes later). During and after the film, though, I questioned the wisdom of the MPAA rating on this film. I would have given it a PG-13 at most. *SPOILERS AHEAD--BUT ONLY IF YOU'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT THE FILM*The beheadings were frequent, but not particularly gory, nor was the body that was cut in half (had I not known about this scene from reading "Cinefantastique," I don't know it I would have picked up what was happening--the scene was so dark, and this was not as graphic as it could have been.) Also, the spearing scene in the church has been done before in PG movies. Maybe it's the over-sensitiveness of the times, but this is definitely a PG-13 film. In fact, the historical references and use of language might interest our youth in history. (By the way, there wasn't a profanity to be heard, that I recall, and no sexual situation beyond what is found on daytime soap operas.) [For what it's worth, I'm not some kid complaining about the rating, but a 42-year-old man with a little more faith in the ability of our youth to distinguish between fantasy horror and violence and real world violence than the people who rated this film.]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is perhaps one of Tim Burton's best films. His classic style is perfect for this dark and creepy thriller. Johnney Depp gives a fine performance as the disillusioned Ichabod Crane. Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson also give strong supporting performances. The story has been adapted finely with one or two small things which don't fit. But in the manner of the storytelling we soon forget these minor flaws. The most notorary element of this film was it's suberb cinematography, which is worth admission price alone. The often chilling and sometimes romancing camera angles give the film its edge, creating what leaves me with the impression of framable art. A true master peice, go see Sleepy Hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-made, entertaining horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a wonderfully enjoyable film, complete with top-notch acting and first-rate direction. Burton solidifies his position as one of the premiere visual filmmakers in Hollywood. Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a constable (in this version, anyway) who is sent up from New York by his frustrated superiors to solve a series of spooky murders.Depp is superb as Crane. He plays the constable not as the generic fast-thinking gun-slinging detective; instead, he paints Crane as an intelligent romantic with a slight touch of cowardice. It's fun to see such a smart, believable performance. Christina Ricci has a nice supporting turn as Katrina Van Tassel, Crane's young love interest. And then there's the always watchable Jeffrey Jones, who, in my mind, will always be known as the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Burton's use of the camera is masterful. He creates a haunting, eerie mood not seen in a horror movie since Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula in 1992. The dark tone of the cinematography combines well with Danny Elfman's score, producing a remarkably engrossing effect.Sleepy Hollow loses steam late, and its ending, although satisfactory, is not incredible. The screenplay jumps around a little too much, and one character is sort of tossed in at the end and is in need of more development. Unlike the far superior Dracula, which had several excellent supporting roles to beef up the film, Sleepy Hollow is pretty much one-dimensional. But this movie isn't supposed to be a cerebral masterpiece but a visual one, and it certainly is that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertainment ala Burton. Sinister cinematic visuals, colored with light anecdote, and occasional sophomoric animation.The movie is worthy of viewing, keynoting the word view, but do not contemplate, or expect overpowering dialogue or story development. In fact, the grand finale will likely trouble you with a lengthy recitation of events that were not (but could have been) interwoven and developed in the plot. Therefore, throughout the movie, glimpses of seemingly unrelated, unimportant scenes will be presented (with audience wondering "when will this stuff culminate"). Yet, a unique story (not Irving's original) is refreshing novelty, creating more curiosity and suspense. Criminology and forensics are tested against the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Moments of blood spurting, and dismemberment are forthcoming. Several Krafty, aka "cheesy", lines (this grammatical twist being representative of the film, not the reviewer) occasionally induce laughter. A few instances of characters with cartoonlike eye bulging and lolling tongues....during horror scenes....were reminiscent of Beetle Juice or Looney Tunes, and were out of synch with movie's flavor. In fact, more horrific than the Headless Horseman, it was hard to discern whether these effects were meant for horror or laughter. Costume, lighting, and other visual display are unarguably horror apperpo and convincingly eerie. Handsomely imaginative investigatory tools wielded by Crane are reminiscent of "Scissorhands", grotesquely large, clumsy, mechanical devices.In summation, a light-hearted "fright" movie earning early respect with handsome imagery and notable actors. Remove the sugar coating and what remains is a scantily clad, disproportionate skeleton of a story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton = Genius!Although I wouldn't call this the best film of all time, there ought to be a special Oscar award for Burton alone! Every film he directs is like a peak into his mind... and what a wonderfully warped mind it is!1. It's visually enchanting. You can't help but be drawn into the fantastic realm of the Headless Horseman. Is he real? see the movie!2. The story-line seemed somewhat disjointed at times, but the pace of action justified every innuendo. It all came together in the end. Remember folks, this is fantasy! Let loose!3. I was impressed with Christina Ricci's performance. I actually expected her over do the part; but she does quite the reverse. I sensed a constant downplaying of her character. Whether that was intended on her part, or the director's... or Depp's... I don't really care. She was convincing enough for me to conclude that she's honing her skills for better roles. Johnny Depp has a unique way of taking on odd roles. His portrayal of "Constable" Ichabod Crane seemed to be a combination of characters from Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and 21 Jump Street. I wouldn't call it an Oscar performance either, but he's certainly entertaining to watch. I think he will one day receive an Oscar for a serious performance, but this isn't it. The supporting actors are quite interesting to look at... many of them are Burton contemporaries. If you're a fan of the psychoactive monsieur Tim, you're bound to recognised many of the cast. (Martin Landau; Christopher Lee; Miranda Richardson [excellent]; Jeffrey Jones; and Christopher Walken to name a few) For all the Star Wars buffs, I should add that Ray Park (Darth Maul) is one of the stuntmen for the headless Hessian!Verdict: I would recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of gore (lopping heads), a great deal of visual fantasia, and enough artistic license to create a sense of freshness to the original tale. (Many respects to Washington Irving) I will purchase this film when it's released on VHS or DVD format!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Somewhat of a spoiler alert. But I won't give away anything vital) I have extremely mixed feelings about this movie. Since I like to end on a good note, I'll start with the bad parts: 1) Why, for God's sake, do religious people always have to be hypocrites or worse? It grates on my nerves that Christianity is always connected with hypocrisy and not with compassion. 2)Religious commentary aside, the movie is far too gory. It's not just the constant decapitation (I mean, what did you expect?) There is just way too much blood at inopportune moments. Particularly [SPOILER] a rather gruesome kiss.But there is much to like about this movie, including: 1) Johnny Depp. He is absolutely captivating with his perfect mix of Crane's bravery/cowardice. He pulls off the humor with flair, the romance with tenderness, and the action with adrenaline. 2)The scares: There are two or three moments in this movie of pure terror. In other "scary" movies, I've seen them fake you out when you think it will be scary. Here, they straightly play the mind-blowing horror. 3) I don't know much about cinemetography or directing, but whatever Tim Burton did, he did it well. The atmosphere draws you in from the start and leaves you breathless at the end. All in all, a wonderful movie with a few blemishes. Not for the weak of stomach.</fullReview>

A very dark, stylish and bloody movie. This movie is not for the weak at heart. It has a lot of blood,gore, brutal violence and heads getting very graphically chopped off. Overall a good enough movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No plot. Every fifteen minutes a character has some dialog that's plot exposition. Lots of people riding horses in the dark forest. Lots of women in period dresses that show off their chests. More horses, then more chests. Then, since there hasn't been any plot for the last fifteen minutes, some dialog with plot exposition that explains the plot that hasn't happened for the last fifteen minutes. Then more horses.The first time the headless horseman swings his sword around in a flashy way it's pretty good. The fifteenth time it's boring.Then at the end the plot, which exists only in the mind of the director and is never shared with the audience, kinda catches up with the movie, and that's when you can tell it's based on a book that must have been about something, because all the characters seem to be involved with a lot of things that weren't apparent during the first 95% of the film, but now come flooding out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, while not "by the book", is a wonderful interpretation of the characters and world created by Washington Irving.I have always enjoyed Tim Burton's movies and think that this has got to be one of the best. The story flows right along and with the exception of a couple of points, never slows down. There are some really great plot twists, and also, there are a couple of really good cameos.(the horseman especially).Tim Burton, I believe, has found a really good thing in Johnny Depp and I'm glad to see that he keeps using him in his movies. Mr. Depp always performs remarkably and this movie is no exception. There are some really great scenes with him playing the consummate inspector, and also some other really fun scenes when the inspector loses his cool.The interplay between Mr. Depp and Cristina Ricci is very nice as well. To me, the connection between their characters seems very genuine.Overall this is a wonderful movie. I've been recommending everyone I know to go see it, and I plan on seeing it again. This is yet another mastery on Mr. Burton's part and will be a definite video to own when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment this movie opens you know a master like Tim Burton has to be behind it. Dark, detailed, and it retains a kind of "I am taking myself seriously, but not by much," humor. The costumes and sets are spectacular, and it will be a travesty if at least the costumes are not recognized by the Academy.Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is very good. I've never read the story so I don't exactly know what Crane is supposed to be like, but I remember the Disney movie well and Depp seems to pull that off well 8). Most of the other performances are also above average, though I was honestly a little disappointed that Walken (the Hessian) didn't have any spoken lines (well, that is if "ARRRRRH!" doesn't count as a spoken line). He's always been a favorite of mine. But he was obviously having fun.So my vote is an 8, an above average movie, and we definitely get what we're promised: plenty of heads do roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy, gothic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Sleepy Hollow' is Tim Burton's reworking of Washington Irving's classic 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. In this version, Johnny Depp plays New York City constable Ichabod Crane at the eve of the Millenium (1799). Crane's superiors scoff at his crime solving methods and send him up-state to solve a series of decapitation murders in the quiet farming town of Sleepy Hollow. Upon arriving and meeting the townsfolk, Crane is immediately attracted to the lovely Katrina Van Tassle, the daughter of the richest, most powerful man in town, portrayed by Christina Ricci. When the town elders tell him the murderer is a ghost, the scientific minded constable can not believe it. This is a creepy, gothic film. The Headless Horseman, portrayed by Christopher Walken, is particularly menacing. The cast does a great job of conveying the doom and gloom of the haunted town. I really enjoyed the stories plot twists and turns, because you're never quite sure where this legend is taking you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what if Proyas had direct..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not scary. This movie isn't all that exciting. But it's very clever and well directed. Tim Burton is one of the master of the eerie movies (Batman 1-2, Edward Scissor Hands), but not 'the' master (my vote for Alex Proyas). This movie is entertaining, but a bit miscast (Ricci) and lacks some twists. The style takes over the substance, two thumbs up to Ray Park for the headless horseman, --and it's very over-the-top. Johnny Depp is really good. The musical score is not memorable.I Give this movie a 67% (7/10).P.S. Hope someone can make a better movie in the same genre.. nice try. The color of the blood was annoyingly fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to see this movie is being picked on so much already. Maybe some people forget you go see Tim Burton's movies to have FUN, already! This is a beautifully stylish movie, I could not get enough of seeing that hellish figure flying on the back of his demon-horse, cloak flying and sword flailing. Fantastic! The town itself was a wonderful presence, with old covered bridges and wicked looking trees. Johnny Depp was of course fabulous, he looked as if he genuinely enjoyed himself while making this movie. A shame for an actor of such range to be so underappreciated. He seems to suffer from the "Ralph Fiennes Syndrome", where actors with tremendous talent are snubbed because they are simply too good looking. (They got the face, so they must not need the award, or some odd reasoning. Perhaps it's envy...?) "Sleepy Hollow" is not scary, but then very few horror films truly are. It is more like a horror-themed ride at an amusement park, a very expensive amusement park. There are some laughs, not big ones but chuckles, and a sense of good-humor throughout. If I had to choose a weak point it would be Christina Ricci, which pains me because I loved her in the "Addams Family" movies, but here she sleepwalks through her role, many of her lines of dialogue sounding much flat, as if she were reciting them for a boring grade-school report. But it did not matter enough to me to affect my overall opinion of "Sleepy Hollow", which is that it was good fun. And Christopher Walken as the Hessian- of course!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't say that I am a Tim Burton fan (I have enjoyed the Batman films, but thought "Mars Attacks" was a waste of talent and celluloid), but have to hand it to him. No one can create mood and atmosphere as well as he. "Sleepy Hollow" is visually stunning, an amazing collection of gnarled trees, gloomy mist and frightening houses silhouetted against a surreal backdrop. It would be enormously entertaining to just look at the film without hearing a word! Unfortunately, I did hear it, and thought the story was often muddled and confusing. The acting ranged from good (Johnny Depp adds another memorable character to his repertoire) to bad (Christina Ricci). Miss Ricci is perhaps the best actress of her generation working today, but this film is a mis-step for her. Perhaps she is too modern to fit comfortably into the milieu of a 1700s village in upstate New York. She is not able to wrap her talents around the language of the period and she read her lines in a stilted, forced sort of way. However, she is a comely lass and always nice to see. The rest of the cast is uniformly good, and it is always good to have such veteran supporting players as Michael Gough and Michael Gambon on hand. They fit perfectly into the proceedings, although they don't seem to be able to make much sense of the plot either! Overall, I was enormously impressed by the look of the film (the cinematography and art direction are superb), but found the story hard to follow.</fullReview>

It lacks any kind of rational cohesiveness or congruence from one scene to the next.Now...the question you've all been waiting for: Is it scary?

		<shortDescription>The epitome of darkness which is TIM BURTON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that Tim Burton has once again hit the jackpot. With his surreal darkness and ultimate gloomy M.O. for his movies, Sleepy Hollow was destined to be told through his eyes. It's just one of those stories that are made for him, like Brandon Lee and The Crow, it was if he was born to play the title character. Seriously though, I was more that just entertained with leepy Hollow, I was captivated. Not only because of Burton finally going the whole 9 yards into the domain of R-ratings, but because of the atmosphere he creates everso elequently. The movie had NO color what so ever, it was merely shades of grey and black. Even the blondes (i.e. Christina Ricci) in the movie looked more like white. The fact that the movie had no rays of sunshine, just a coating of dark grey clouds that forever was the scenery for the movie put a smile on my face. This was my kinda movie. Johnny Depp portraying a quirky character, and all the other Tim Burton veterans as well, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, and Martin Landau (did you catch him at the start?) all feed right into the story line, playing the all-knowing-too-much town elders, with the looks on their face that just makes you quiver with interest to what they may know. This isn't much of review, but more of a praise to Tim Burton. All I'm saying is that I'm not naive, but I gave this movie a 10 just like the 121 other voters before me who I'm sure know what they are voting about, an impecable motion picture that shall remain forever one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's mainstream masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film exceeded all my expectations. Most of all, I was thoroughly amazed at the wimpy-ness of the hero and his fears. It's nice to see a protagonist who isn't a gun-slinging muscleman, but an introverted, unsure and cowardly every-man.The fight scenes are probably what really kept the movie going for me. Swords were flying and axes hacking in all directions. If it weren't for "The Phantom Menace," I would have said "Sleepy Hollow" had the best weapon use I'd ever seen.Also, I was just enthralled with the horseman and his square-shouldered menace. As a "monster," I've seen few that held my attention as well as the Headless Horseman did.As for the plot, which many legit reviewers have complained about, I had no problem with it. Rewriting Washington Irving's tale as a mystery was an excellent idea and the whodunnit kept me guessing! I also appreciated the spruced up supernatural aspects to the tale, which seemed right at place in the gloomy setting.In closing, I found this much more watchable --- in a mainstream sort of way --- than Tim Burton's more eccentric works, such as "Ed Wood," "Pee Wee's Big Adventure" and "Mars Attacks!"</fullReview>

Well written, well acted and very well done. Johnny Depp did a great job as Ichabod Crane.

		<fullReview>Of course, every die-hard Tim Burton fan saw this movie opening night, but even one who shies away from horror flicks, like myself, will enjoy this cinematically beautiful film. Critics have complained that the story deviates too much from the original Washington Irving novel (a timeless complaint), but the film has inspired me to read the book and I'll let you know which plot is more spell-binding.Johnny Depp stars in this thriller ("romance"? don't go expecting to see a love story) about the efforts of a cowardly police inspector, Ichabod Crane, to solve the mystery of the Headless Horseman (great casting: Christopher Walken) in late 18th century New York. Depp fits right in with the mannerisms, language, costumes and setting of the period. The actor is obviously comfortable with his character, giving an amusing side to an otherwise gruesome movie. Christina Ricci is also well-cast as the mysterious yet innocent Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the town's de facto head. The supporting cast is also effective, with the exception of Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, Katrina's stepmother. The actress' demeanor and poor delivery do not correspond with the period of the film.The story is well-visualized by Burton, whose cinematography is fitting. The combination of setting, foggy lighting and the absence of all color except red are put together expertly. His teamwork with Danny Elfman, who wrote the music, is once again superb. The dialogue, it seems, was especially written for Crane: Depp's character has the best lines, and the writing is in other places somewhat awkward.Sleepy Hollow is a great movie, and a must-see for all Burton, Depp, or Elfman fans. Those with weak stomachs should probably avoid this film, as it is (very realistically) gory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is one film that definitely lived up to it's hype. Unlike Star Wars. It's one of those few horror films that can make you laugh and scream at the same time. The gore was realistic looking and the cinematography was magnificent. Christoper Walken does the role of the horseman, who has worse teeth than Juvenille. And Johnny Depp plays Ichabod extremely well, causing laughs every time he faints. Christina is absolutely beautiful, and Martin Landau makes a cameo, albeit a short one.But check this out, it is pure Burton and will not disappoint.

		<fullReview>Tim Burton with the backing of Francis Ford Coppola does an excellent job of bringing this fable to life. Though it's not for everyone it is for those who appreciate Tim Burton's style and like to escape to a world of fiction and fantasy. The atmosphere is dark and gothic to set the mood for this humorous, horror filled tale of love, deceit and murder. They take the simplistic tale and add a who's doing it and who will gain the most plot to reason with the hideous beheadings.Johnny Depp is a delight as the skittish, fearful, yet brave with commitment Ichabod Crane. He proves to be at his best when he portrays fictional cartoon like characters.If your a Christina Ricci fan you won't be disappointed, if your not you may become one. She is innocently and somewhat angelicly beautiful in this film as Katrina Van Tassel. There is a real connection between Christina Ricci and Johnny Deep which works really well for Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tassel as each of their performances compliments the others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Awesome Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great movie. Most people realize it and have given it good reviews. I truly don't understand some people's opinions though. I gave it a 10. I can understand that not everybody thinks it should get a 10, but some people actually gave it a 1 or 2, etc... How someone can rate it that low completely puzzles me.Everything about this movie was great. The scenery, sound effects, and music were great. The acting was great, as was the humor, horror, and mystery. I saw it on November 2'nd and had to see it again on November 19'th. I even liked it better the second time. It certainly seemed that everybody in the theater thought it was great. There was a lot of crowd reaction. The things I personally liked the most were the twisted plot and wonderful looking set. The headless horseman's raw power was great too. It's a lot more interesting watching him ride after his victims than it is to watch a guy with a chainsaw or hook chasing someone. It was like a mysterious world that everything happened in. I loved the foggy, misty atmosphere and spooky music.The one thing that shows how great it is is that Roger Ebert gave it 3 and 1/2 stars! If you look at what he has given other horror movies, it's obvious that it has something other movies don't. He even said that he was surprised at how good it was. When you go to a theater expecting something to be bad and then rate it 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, it is extremely effective. I can't wait until it's on DVD. The user ratings on this site show that about 2/3 of the votes are 8-10 stars. There are MANY 9's and 10's. I'm glad to see that most people recognize the numerous strengths of this movie. Some people have said Ichabod's flashbacks should have been left out. I agree they either should have been more important to the plot or left out. Still, that doesn't make the rating any less than a perfect ten!</fullReview>

Critics have complained that the story deviates too much from the original Washington Irving novel (a timeless complaint), but the film has inspired me to read the book and I'll let you know which plot is more spell-binding.Johnny Depp stars in this thriller ("romance"? don't go expecting to see a love story) about the efforts of a cowardly police inspector, Ichabod Crane, to solve the mystery of the Headless Horseman (great casting: Christopher Walken) in late 18th century New York. Depp fits right in with the mannerisms, language, costumes and setting of the period. The actor is obviously comfortable with his character, giving an amusing side to an otherwise gruesome movie. Christina Ricci is also well-cast as the mysterious yet innocent Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the town's de facto head. The supporting cast is also effective, with the exception of Miranda Richardson as Lady Van Tassel, Katrina's stepmother. The actress' demeanor and poor delivery do not correspond with the period of the film.The story is well-visualized by Burton, whose cinematography is fitting. The combination of setting, foggy lighting and the absence of all color except red are put together expertly. His teamwork with Danny Elfman, who wrote the music, is once again superb. The dialogue, it seems, was especially written for Crane: Depp's character has the best lines, and the writing is in other places somewhat awkward.Sleepy Hollow is a great movie, and a must-see for all Burton, Depp, or Elfman fans. Those with weak stomachs should probably avoid this film, as it is (very realistically) gory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this is one film that definitely lived up to it's hype. Unlike Star Wars. It's one of those few horror films that can make you laugh and scream at the same time. The gore was realistic looking and the cinematography was magnificent. Christoper Walken does the role of the horseman, who has worse teeth than Juvenille. And Johnny Depp plays Ichabod extremely well, causing laughs every time he faints. Christina is absolutely beautiful, and Martin Landau makes a cameo, albeit a short one.But check this out, it is pure Burton and will not disappoint. If you like films like this, check out Deadalive.</fullReview>

The atmosphere is dark and gothic to set the mood for this humorous, horror filled tale of love, deceit and murder.

		<fullReview>As usual Tim Burton has made himself a fine, worthy movie, let me just start off with that. Visually stunning, representing just what the late 1700s looked like (if it were always dark and gloomy ;)). The acting was very good and Depp did a great job in playing between the boundries of the original Crane character in that, not really a bad guy but overall just a kindof cultured sissy-boy (that's NOT a generalisation) who is just as scared as you or I but knows he has to rise to the occasion eventually anyway. In the book, Crane was always a wimp for the most part.The only thing that bugged me was that the plot as it finally really developed in the end was a bit over-dramatic, maybe too fantastic, not to the point of making it bad, I just think it drew away from an otherwise dark, disturbing and even scarier than I'd presumed, movie would be when I first saw the trailer. I liked the movie, (8/10) and then again I didn't like it for one sole reason. If you take the movie as what it is, the movie in itself, in that, lets presume there was never the original story, then I liked it quite a lot. But me, I must admit, I'm too retentive to not be annoyed at the drastic changes between what Burton envisioned and the "real" story by Irving. Outside of the character names, location and their being a horseman, this movie and the original story are quite quite different. Not a big deal really as it doesn't make this a BAD movie, again, the movie in itself I enjoyed quite a bit, but I couldn't get over, and its just my pet peeve, the differences. Things like this always bug me so while I vent please bare with me that its just my opinion. I've never liked it when adaptations change the original story even the slightest bit, though, I can understand sometimes its done due to time, money, and dramatic effect. I still don't like it :P, but I can understand it and I TRY not to let that ruin my enjoyment of the MOVIE. I try to take them as two seperate entities. But the seemingly "needless to change" things like the Horseman's origin (how he became headless that is), things like this bug me even more making me wonder, "I know why the other stuff was changed but why THIS?". I don't know, I just don't like it when the original story is changed. But don't let that ruin the movie for you, just forget the original story, enjoy the movie, and if you can do that, you WILL enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Re-Telling of Irving's Classic Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a terrific film, depicting a daring re-telling of Washington Irving's legendary short story. This time, Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane, not a schoolteacher, but a New York City constable sent into the valley of the Hudson River to investigate the grisly murders by decapitation in the Dutch village of Sleepy Hollow. We, as Crane does, these crimes have been committed by the Headless Hessian, or Horseman, a phantasm who rides a huge black horse and beheads his victims with a large mercenary broadsword and single-edged axe.Depp gives his finest performance to date, and meshes so completely well into the fantastic, yet dark, universe of director Tim Burton's filmmaking. He has made Crane an amalgam of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes and many other famous screen detectives, with dashes of New Yankee sensibility and British squeamishness. Christian Ricci heads a spectacular supporting cast that includes the immortal Christopher Lee, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, and Michael Gough, lately the big screen's Batman's aide de camp, Alfred. Christopher Walken portrays the silent, but deadly, Hessian, still bearing his fanged cranium, while stuntman and martial artist, late as The Phantom Menace's Darth Maul, Ray Park, is physically imposing and blindingly frightening as the ghostly real Horseman, post death.Tim Burton displays his unique and vividly imaginative directorial return with Sleepy Hollow, showing how well he can put together a big budget film and make it work triumphantly. Let's hope he continues to make movies in this same energetic way for years to come.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Granted, it was not scary at all, so if you are looking for a horror movie, then DO NOT go see this one. But this movie does have Burton's creative imagery shining through every angle.There isn't anything really spectacular about the acting, or the horror aspect of the film, but the direction is just amazing. Tim Burton does it again, what can I say. With Edward Scissorhands, Batman, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and now Sleepy Hollow, he has a nice bag of films under his belt that he should be very proud of. Burton has the ability to be so creative in so many different ways that only a microscopic amount of directors can do. A perfect example is the animation in The Nightmare Before Christmas (if you haven't seen that yet, what are you waiting for!). That movie had so much imagery and imagination that it made the movie phenomenal.Anyway, go see Sleepy Hollow, and if you're not looking to be scared, you will enjoy it. My grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful rendition of an Old Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a fan or "horror" movies and seeing this movie was a relief to me because it isn't one. It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me. This is done as a brilliant film noir-esque piece.Even the gore was in context.This is a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the difference that makes the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most film adaptations are rarely true to the original material. Sleepy Hollow is not the Legend of Sleepy Hollow from Kickerbocker's Sketchbook, by Washington Irving, but it is an interesting personal adaptation by a very creative and original director, Tim Burton, and it is the differences between the film and the original story that make Sleepy Hollow, the film, interesting. I thought it was interesting that the film takes place on the eve of another millennium, 1799. The 1800's were an era of great growth in the country, and rapid change in science, economics, and industry. It's almost as if the horseman belongs to a previous age (an age of superstitions and religious persecution), and Crane is a bridge to a new age (of science and rationality). Few people ever consider the fact that science and mathematics actually have roots in magic and superstition (see Anthony Aveni, Beyond the Crystal Ball). Hollow's Crane is trying to be rational, but the source of his enthusiasm for the scientific method has its roots in his memory of the blind persecution of his mother and her white magic by intolerant religious dogmatism. There are other films that deal with the assumed conflict between science and rational thought, and mystical/magical experience. The Magician by Ingmar Bergman, for one. I am curious where Tim Burton is on the issue.A few other comments. I don't think that it is really an inconsistency that the horseman's remains are in one place, while the apparition has substance. Old time spirit mediums use to insist that materializations were made of "ectoplasm," and in Tibetan mysticism, bodiless spiritual forces can materialize as physical under certain conditions. In any case, the supernatural is irrational by nature. I actually enjoyed the film's leisurely pace. Sometime I think we are becoming too conditioned to rapid-fire action sequences by movies and 60 second commercials. Lots of people panned Christina Ricci, but I thought she did a great job in the role, and looked good in the part too. Depp as Crane seemed a touch over the top, but then, I think the role Burton created called for a certain about of over the top reacting, and Depp, an excellent actor, didn't push things too much to the extreme. Likewise, the other special effects didn't take over the film but worked with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BURTON AT HIS BEST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of the most gorgous films ever...well filmed. Using a grey for most of the film greatly sets the mood of the pic, most of it being at night. There are several flashbacks to Ichabod Crain's childhood, and those are shot in a contrasting brighter than life colors. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are magnificant, both greatly complimenting each other. the story flows very easily, and you are involved at each moment the movie runs. You are brought into the mystery of the Headless Horseman, and ultimately a quest to find out just who controls him, and to stop that person. As soon as you decide that you know who controls him, another surprise. this happens again and again. the movie never stops making you think. and you enjoy every thought. This is definately a film that i'll be seeing again and again. I encourage everybody to go see this film. you will not leave disappointed. Scary, funny, and...well it's a Burton film, so you know you are in for a treat. Burton at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's best-looking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark, stylish, disturbing. Tim Burton lives to make movies according to these adjectives. However, Sleepy Hollow seems to be his masterpiece. The legend surrounding the Headless Horseman is the perfect tale for Burton's oddball, surreal direction. As with all his films, the setting is an indispensable character. Whether it's the Gothic underworld of Gotham City or the pastel-colored, surbubia found in Edward Scissorhands; Burton creates a world that lingers in the mind of viewers long after the film is over.Longtime Burton collaborator Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci shine as Constable Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tessel, even while delivering dated, kitschy lines. However, Depp's perfomance is an ingenious blend of childishness and stoicism, of comedy and terror that shines and fits Burton's puerile nightmare perfectly. In a movie that stretches from Batman's cartoon-like violence to scenes of decapitation, animal mutilation and medieval torture, by far Burton's darkest, there is still a sense of mystical fantasy of childlike wonder which keeps even the most horrific scenes from becoming too offensive.The only negative criticism I have to offer about this movie is some of the cornball dialogue uttered by the main characters, and the contrived story that seems to fall together all too quickly at the end. It's as though Burton tries his hand at a Hercule Poirot mystery without letting the audience in on it. Thus, the conclusion seems to come and go without stopping to be understood.However, if nothing else, the profound production design is more than worth the price of admission and is guaranteed to hold you prisoner under its hypnotic spell. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most entertaining movies I've seen in awhile...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad that my friend asked me to go with her to see Sleepy Hollow. She only needed one reason to see it; Tim Burton. I was interested in seeing it myself to see how this adaptation of the old story would pan out.Neither her nor I expected to get so much entertainment value out of this movie.First of all, Johnny Depp carried the nervous, yellow-bellied portrayal of Ichabod Crane very well. My friend pointed out that it was an interesting change to Ichabod's character from the original story; back then, he was a fraidy-cat teacher, but in the movie, he's a fraidy-cat science-worshipping sleuth. It really made the story interesting; a bumbling detective looking for a common murderer who wasn't common at all. The supporting cast was also well-conceived which really brought across the small-town everyone-knows-everybody feeling of the village.The overall story was pretty decent, but I don't expect it to win any awards. The whole thing was like an overblown Scooby Doo mystery, with an almost mundane secret plot behind the Horseman's rampage. It was more of an obstruction to the whole legend if anything, forcing reason behind the ghost's thirst for bloodshed and heads. But it's the ghostly phenomena where the movie really shined.Whisps of ethereal smoke extinguishing torches. Clomping footsteps in an otherwise unoccupied covered bridge. A tree that bleeds when cut. Everything is in place to give this movie the atmosphere it needs to pull off a great "ghost story" atmosphere. And we were pleasantly shocked but not surprised when we discovered it was Ray Park (Darth Maul, "Phantom Menace") giving the headless rider its amazing weapon skill.And maybe it was our collectively twisted sense of humor, but this movie was knee-slapping hilarious at times! So did many others in the audience as well. Ichabod's mannerisms and sniveling ways were almost comic genius; the movie isn't trying to be a comedy but Ichabod turns it into one at times anyway. And it's great. The fact that my friend and I were making head puns and jokes ("he came out a'head' on that one) throughout the movie and afterward only added to our total enjoyment of the film.This isn't a b-movie horror flick. Nor is it a multiple Oscar-winning masterpiece. I don't think you will find it to be a waste of money, though. It's an above average mild horror movie that should appeal to many moviegoers' tastes. But you *have* to see it with friends!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the difference that makes the film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most film adaptations are rarely true to the original material. Sleepy Hollow is not the Legend of Sleepy Hollow from Kickerbocker's Sketchbook, by Washington Irving, but it is an interesting personal adaptation by a very creative and original director, Tim Burton, and it is the differences between the film and the original story that make Sleepy Hollow, the film, interesting. I thought it was interesting that the film takes place on the eve of another millennium, 1799. The 1800's were an era of great growth in the country, and rapid change in science, economics, and industry. It's almost as if the horseman belongs to a previous age (an age of superstitions and religious persecution), and Crane is a bridge to a new age (of science and rationality). Few people ever consider the fact that science and mathematics actually have roots in magic and superstition (see Anthony Aveni, Beyond the Crystal Ball). Hollow's Crane is trying to be rational, but the source of his enthusiasm for the scientific method has its roots in his memory of the blind persecution of his mother and her white magic by intolerant religious dogmatism. There are other films that deal with the assumed conflict between science and rational thought, and mystical/magical experience. The Magician by Ingmar Bergman, for one. I am curious where Tim Burton is on the issue.A few other comments. I don't think that it is really an inconsistency that the horseman's remains are in one place, while the apparition has substance. Old time spirit mediums use to insist that materializations were made of "ectoplasm," and in Tibetan mysticism, bodiless spiritual forces can materialize as physical under certain conditions. In any case, the supernatural is irrational by nature. I actually enjoyed the film's leisurely pace. Sometime I think we are becoming too conditioned to rapid-fire action sequences by movies and 60 second commercials. Lots of people panned Christina Ricci, but I thought she did a great job in the role, and looked good in the part too. Depp as Crane seemed a touch over the top, but then, I think the role Burton created called for a certain about of over the top reacting, and Depp, an excellent actor, didn't push things too much to the extreme. Likewise, the other special effects didn't take over the film but worked with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this knowing it was a Tim Burton film. I expected to be taken away to late 18th century America; I did not expect a great story. Even with this limited expectation, I was disappointed. No one can paint a somber caricature like Tim Burton, but it wasn't enough this time; somehow you just never really bought it. Danny Elfman bears some of the blame; the mediocre musical score somewhat undermined the desolate visuals. A better selection of music would have really helped. Whatever the case, the majority of the movie felt like it was just being shot and delivered, not given the immaculate attention to detail we expect from Burton. Some genres benefit from a more minimalist approach to cinematography; period pieces generally do not. For a movie whose calling card was to be a fantastic dioramic setting, it falls short. Forgettable screen play, hit-or-miss effects (those CGI-enhanced scenes are obviously CGI-enhanced, if you know what I mean), somewhat stilted cinematography (from Tim Burton!); it could have been a wonderful movie. Instead, it's forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Tim Burton. I really do. Tim Burton has created an utterly fascinating world of images that are beyond compare. Truly original designs of 18th century cottages and smoke walkways are prevalent throughout the entire film. Acting was inspired as well; I haven't seen Depp perform this well since Burton's own Edward Scissorhands. Christina Ricci gives a fine performance but is lacking somewhat an emotional depth. The bottom line is that the visuals are the real stars of the show. They give a sense of escapism I haven't felt in many movies. The headless horseman is shown with immense style without overly exposing his true form. A foreboding sense of horror is always a primary goal. A must see for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who better than Burton for the Horseman?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton was born to make 'Sleepy Hollow'. The Master of Creepiness takes this classic tale and presents it with the expected awesome visuals of any Burton film. The art direction and cinematography are fabulous, and it is fun to see the allusions to his older films (such as 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Batman'). However, the screenplay dialogue is atrocious, and some of the acting even worse. Depp and Ricci are fine, but some of the more villainous characters seem to have been ripped from a Power Rangers tv show. Still, the Burton Effect is there, and overall the movie works as a classic presentation of a classic tale. This year's Top Films (so far): 1) American Beauty 2) The Insider 3) Eyes Wide Shut 4) Bringing Out the Dead 5) The Matrix 6) *SLEEPY HOLLOW* 7) The Blair Witch Project 8) Tarzan 9) Fight Club 10) The Sixth Sense</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I enjoyed seeing Sleepy Hollow, and probably will buy it when it comes out for sale, I would have to say that it is Tim Burton's most disappointing film. The cinematography was excellent, the action scenes were spectacular, but the story itself seemed kind of half-assed. The main problem I had was Ichabod's dreams. They had no relavence to the rest of the movie. They seemed like they could done a lot more with them, for example: Have his mother be the witch controlling the horseman. But no, his mom was a witch and his dad killed her. That's just great. The next problem was "the villan" : Where the hell did she come from? She just popped in at the end of the movie! I mean i know that we saw her as a child, and I knew she was Katrina's stepmom, but that's it! The she just pops in and basically says "In cased you missed it, here's the plot" The plot of a movie should be hinted at throughout the film, not just thrown at the end. It's confusing and irrelevant.I'm sorry Tim Burton, but Sleepy Hollow has to be your worst movie. Next time I suggest revising your script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp and Burton set new standards for horror films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burton's creepy atmosphere and Depps' brilliant portrayal of the cowardly Crane make this film more than just a horror flick. The characters - I include the setting as one of them - create such an enthralling world that the audience can't help being drawn in. Depp's character is so original and so masterfully done that although we all know "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," we hope that he will somehow escape the fate that Ichabod Crane is to suffer as in Irving's tale. Yes, this movie has gore and we know where it is headed, but the leaf-strewn path is worth traveling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sleepy Hollow" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Heads Will Roll!!" was the tagline for the Tim Burton take on the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" which tells the tale of a lowly school teacher who must face his greatest fear and become a man. The Washington Irving classic will always be remembered as the "headless horseman" tale with flaming pumpkins and an idiot hero. In the 1999 adaptation the hero, Icabod Crane is now a bumbling New York Detective who seems to know more about forensics then his fellow man of that time. As a joke the New York police department sends him to "Sleepy Hollow" to uncover the "decapitating murderer". What Crane finds shocks and changes our hero slowly into a man. "Sleepy Hollow" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films. Ever since he captivated the world by bringing the "real" Batman to the big screen, ten years ago, he has always been flirting with making a great gothic horror film. Every film he has touched has been enchanted with gothic charisma. From "Edward Scissorhands" to "Mars Attacks" they have all been laced in his immersion of horror and fairytale. In "Sleepy Hollow" he finds his true calling as he delivers us into his gothic mystique. As he did in the first two Batman films, the camera stands back and then swoops into the great city of New York. Showing the dark and moody world he is trying to capture. As this panoramic tour continues the audience is pulled harder and harder in. This is Tim Burton at his best.The film then drops into Icabod's world where he seems to be the outsider who doesn't quite fit in. The film focuses upon the face of Johnny Depp who is quite pale and wide eyed. In two other Tim Burton films Johnny Depp has opened us to the world of Burton much like Richard Dreyfuss did in early Steven Spielberg films. Depp's portrayal of bumbling Icabod is remnant of "Edward Scissorhands" but even more human. An outsider trying to see past the town's folktale and uncover a real murder. I imagined Icabod to be sort of what happened if Sherlock Holmes stumbled in on Dracula himself. I think even a great detective like Holmes would be bumbling on a case like that.As Icabod explores the town to Sleepy Hollow we are treasured by the presence of other Tim Burton vets like Michael Gough, Jeffery Jones, Christopher Walken and Martin Landau. Icabod upon his arrival falls in love with the damsel Katrina Van Tassel played by Christina Ricci who seems to have something in common with Icabod's past. As we uncover the mysterious damsel Burton seems to let his film talk about what exactly is witchcraft and why skeptics don't understand it. This tugs at Icabod's dreams and his heart strings. Ricci's Katrina is not exactly a damsel in distress but a delightful addition to her growing repertoire of strong women roles. She has come along way from being Wednesday Addams. When the film finally hits it stride with the first encounter with the horseman we are already engulfed in the dark magic of Sleepy Hollow and the bewilderment of Icabod. Sleepy Hollow will be remembered as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces. (5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully directed and filmed, but it is slightly flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a Tim Burton fan, and having known for a couple years that Burton would be directing this film, I was excited by the trailers which started popping up in cinemas months ago. I waited for Thanksgiving (which came and went the second week of October), and then I realized that I had to wait for AMERICAN Thanksgiving. Which I was barely able to do, by the way. After all, it's been more than 3 years since Mars Attacks!, Burton's last directorial effort.Well, I must admit: Sleepy Hollow is worth the wait. From the moment the film started until the end credits rolled I was in absolute awe of the visual splendor presented in the movie. Even the gory scenes (and there are plenty) were visually stunning. I found my jaw was frequently dangling near the base of my neck, and many of the shots had me drooling.The acting, also, is top drawer. I rather liked Depp's take on Ichabod Crane. He seems, at times, almost inept as a police Constable (almost like he should have been a teacher instead). Christina Ricci plays a good girl very well, totally hiding the bad-girl image I've had of her since The Addams Family. Miranda Richardson also puts in a good turn, though she's a bit under-used.The story is excellent, though it sometimes plays like a Hammer Studios film, the effects are - for the most part - unobtrusive, and Danny Elfman's score is as stirring as anything he's ever written.As for the flaws...well, the ending seemed to me rather abrupt, although right now I can't think of an alternative. I was also able to spot a couple of continuity errors, and to spot them on the first viewing is a testament to their obviousness.8.5/10 - For the beautifully haunting images, good pacing and acting, and that unmistakable Tim Burton weirdness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw two movies this week, "Saving Private Ryan" and "Sleepy Hollow". I find it ironic that when "Saving Private Ryan" is mentioned, people who have not seen it always mention the "gore", for it reknowned for being "too bloody" when blood is used only to enhance the realism of the action and at tha appropriate moments. I think it is films like "Sleepy Hollow" that are too gory, splattering excessive amounts of blood around simply to be shocking or when the director can't think of any other way to create a jolt. I was especially disappointed to see the tired "scary" special effects in this film, the same ones that had been repeated many times in "Beetlejuice", a film that I have watched over and over and one of my favorites.The good parts about this movie were Johnny Depp's acting and Danny Elfman's score. The bits that drew laughs were Depp's whimpiness in the face of danger, but even his raised eyebrows and fainting spells were getting old about three-quarters of the way through. I think the problem is that the story is convoluted and difficult to follow. This movie would have been better if the story had been simplified, more tension had been built and if it had had fewer actual murders and less blood. Eccentric characters and humor should have been emphasized more. I am a Tim Burton fan, but I gave this one a 6 and would not recommend it to my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, by-far, Tim Burton's most violent film to-date. I was surprised to hear that he was upset by the R-rating. It hasn't been that long since he's made a film. What did he expect?The movie is good, although not great, nor VERY good for that matter. I thought it would be better. The film is loaded with so many twists and turns, I got lost in the confusion. It falls apart, somewhat. I still liked it though. It's surprising how distant the "headless horseman" was from the movie as a whole. I almost got tired of him and his continuous entrances, because he always enters the scene the same way. The film is fun to watch, and the decapitations are cool, although gory and repetitive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has weaved a nightmarish film out of the old Sleepy Hollow tale. Dead trees reaching toward a eternally grey sky. A fog that hangs around the town like a shroud, and a population that keeps their secrets. Into this macarbe atmosphere comes Ichabod Crane, dispatched from New York to find out who is behind the slayings of three towns people. Ichabod thinks the murders to be committed by a human, but he soon learns otherwise when the Horseman comes. The Headless Horseman is a nightmare vision himself. Dressed in dark clothes and riding a horse of the same color, he charges at his victims with lightning speed and with one well placed cut: off comes their heads! Burton keeps the gore to a minimum, but raises the intensity level of the film so that your heart will quicken. Of course, a Tim Burton film isn't complete without a Danny Elfman score and we get a fast, furious and ethereal score to compliment the images on screen. Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod, and Christina Ricci is the ray of light in this gloomy little town. Heads do roll in this film. Beware.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first Tim Burton film since MARS ATTACKS!, I was hoping that Mr. Burton would redeem himself for that aforementioned mess. Sadly, SLEEPY HOLLOW is not that redemption. Mr. Burton seems to be following the Hollywood Summer Blockbuster formula now: too much gore, shallow characters, flashy effects, and a cutesy happy ending. Burton needs to learn subtlety again and actually produce films that are cunning, intriguing, and LESS GORY!!!!! Burton must have used several BARRELS of fake blood to make this movie, and worst of all, he uses it for COMEDIC EFFECT!!! Folks, violence and death should not be funny; they should be horrifying and shocking. I found it ironic that the trailer for SCREAM 3 was shown before SLEEPY HOLLOW; in many ways, SLEEPY HOLLOW is just another SCREAM dressed up in 18th century trappings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is by far a visual masterpiece. Tim Burton surpasses absolutely anyone with his dark and quirky visions. Just looking at the town of Sleepy Hollow in the previews, I knew this movie would be a great treat. Johnny Depp's performance in the movie was exceptional! Ichabod Crane's character in the new version of the classic story is by far the greatest character I've seen on a movie screen in a long time. The Headless Horseman is awesome in the movie. Ray Park was amazing with the incredible stunts he did. The fight scene on the bridge, Brom Bones and Ichabod vs. The Horseman, reminded me of the fabulous fight scene at the end of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Christopher Walken was creepy as the Horseman with his head on. But most of all, the movie was outrageously exciting. The movie kept my adrenaline going the whole time. And one thing I haven't heard anyone say before, was that the story was great. I loved all the twists in the movie. Sure, it was confusing in some parts, but it all got solved at the end.Well, now I need to come to the flaws in the movie. The music by Danny Elfman, although fit for the movie, was not as memorable as all the other scores he did with Tim Burton, like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, or Beetlejuice. And the end was a little silly, when you found out who the (unfortunately) real villain of the movie was. The romance between Ichabod and Katrina was pointless, even though I wasn't as annoyed about it as some other reviewers. Some of the acting in the movie was stiff, like in The Phantom Menace.But even though it had its flaws, it still was an awesome movie. It was visually beautiful, it had a great script, it was extremely exciting and gory, and Johnny Depp was so great to watch in the movie because of his amazing acting ability. Yeah, I was a little overhyped about the movie, but no movie could get up to the quality I thought Sleepy Hollow would have. Oh well, it still was a very good film, and Tim Burton has definitely redeemed himself after the misconcepted Mars Attacks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After one of Tim Burton's greatest disappointments, "Mars Attacks", he has come back with something that can definitely be categorized as a "Tim Burton" film. But he hasn't made a film like this one before, and that's part of what makes it so good. He has made little use of humor, made it more gothic and scary, and has added what none of his previous films have had, gore. The result was an example of movie masterpiece, Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow". Now when I say it's Tim Burton's movie, it is his movie, not simply in the sense of the visual style and humor. Washington Irving's story has changed. Ichabod Crane is a cop, sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a string of murders that have been occurring. The townsfolk blame it on the legend of the headless horsemen, which is what it is. Tim Burton has also added a complex, more checkered past to the Ichabod character, in which he is tormented in flashbacks, by the death of his mother. This also is the first Tim Burton that I can remember having this much excitement. The whole thing was very exciting and it was a real trip! It was also scary in some scenes, something else Tim Burton finally showed the world he could do. His previous films were gothic, dark, comic, bizarre, or ingenious, but never scary. Beware though, don't be fooled by the ideas you have formed in your head about this film being another cute rendition of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow". This is no "Happy Halloween" folly with a cute little jack-o-lantern. This is serious, gory, scary stuff! As for the cast, Johnny Depp is perfect for the role as Ichabod, but as good looking as Christina Ricci is, her character is somewhat overlooked. Much of the rest of the cast members can be easily found in other Tim Burton films. Christopher Walken is, again, a villain, as the headless horseman before he lost his head. But the real dynamic duo is the collaborative filmmaking relationship between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. When these two work together, you know it's going to be good. I like everything Tim Burton has done, minus "Mars Attacks". Now he has added another great film to his legacy, his own vision of what he thinks the legend of "Sleepy Hollow" should be like!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a well done movie, and quite gripping. Definately the best movie from the horror genre this year. And Johnny Depp even does a convincing job acting, although his support cast, especially Ricci, was not as good.One nice touch was that, although there were many special effects they did not stick out as they normally seem to in such movies. This is probably because even the scenes that were "real" had a skewed reality. And for once the reality was consistent throughout the film, so the suspension of disbelief was not difficult.I do have two complaints, neither of which detract from the movie itself. The first is that this is not an authentic retelling of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Amoung other things Icabod Crane was supposed to be a school teacher, and a firm believer in the occult (and it actually gets worse from there)... But if you haven't read the story you won't miss it (much like if you never read Dracula before seeing Bram Stoker's Dracula). The second complaint is the use of Christopher Walken. I was hoping for some of the Walken scenes that his fans (including myself) have grown to cherish. But aside from that he makes a truly sinister Hessian.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" is visually stunning, and very creepy in a '40's horror film sort of way. Johnny Depp delivered a tour-de-force performance as Ichabod Crane, making the character his own. The story line differs quite a bit from Washington Irving's tale, but I still found it endlessly fascinating. The special effects were pretty gory, and I found the parts where you didn't know quite what to expect scarier than the visually gory decapitations. A rather long piece of plot exposition near the end was the only flaw I noticed, and even that was not too annoying, although it did make me think that a better script could have revealed this information without one character having to explain it all for you. The total cast was superb, and Christopher Walken was wonderful as the Hessian who loses his head. All in all, I would have to recommend it to anyone who enjoyed those scary late-night horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has weaved a nightmarish film out of the old Sleepy Hollow tale. Dead trees reaching toward a eternally grey sky. A fog that hangs around the town like a shroud, and a population that keeps their secrets. Into this macarbe atmosphere comes Ichabod Crane, dispatched from New York to find out who is behind the slayings of three towns people. Ichabod thinks the murders to be committed by a human, but he soon learns otherwise when the Horseman comes. The Headless Horseman is a nightmare vision himself. Dressed in dark clothes and riding a horse of the same color, he charges at his victims with lightning speed and with one well placed cut: off comes their heads! Burton keeps the gore to a minimum, but raises the intensity level of the film so that your heart will quicken. Of course, a Tim Burton film isn't complete without a Danny Elfman score and we get a fast, furious and ethereal score to compliment the images on screen. Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod, and Christina Ricci is the ray of light in this gloomy little town. Heads do roll in this film. Beware.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the first Tim Burton film since MARS ATTACKS!, I was hoping that Mr. Burton would redeem himself for that aforementioned mess. Sadly, SLEEPY HOLLOW is not that redemption. Mr. Burton seems to be following the Hollywood Summer Blockbuster formula now: too much gore, shallow characters, flashy effects, and a cutesy happy ending. Burton needs to learn subtlety again and actually produce films that are cunning, intriguing, and LESS GORY!!!!! Burton must have used several BARRELS of fake blood to make this movie, and worst of all, he uses it for COMEDIC EFFECT!!! Folks, violence and death should not be funny; they should be horrifying and shocking. I found it ironic that the trailer for SCREAM 3 was shown before SLEEPY HOLLOW; in many ways, SLEEPY HOLLOW is just another SCREAM dressed up in 18th century trappings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Headless Horseman Rides With A Vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I first saw the previews of Sleepy Hollow, I had my heart set on seeing this film. And to say the least, I was not disappointed with the end results. This film was a visual feast, and one of the most startling contemporary horror films that I have seen. Burton is a master at making film, and this one was , in my opinion, his best. Will it win an oscar or be remembered fifty years from now (like Citizen Kane), who knows? All I can say is that if you go in with that outlook, you might not enjoy it as much as I did. This film drips a gothic ambiance. Everything about it has a flavor that reminds one of the horror films of the sixties (especially the Hammer films). The landscapes transport you away to a world shrouded in mist, where even a forest in broad daylight hides dark secrets and mysterious creatures at every turn. As for the Horseman himself, a demonic dark avenger summoned from beyond the grave, he is an embodiment of evil that is more menacing than many I have seen of late, and excellently brought to life by the combined efforts of a terrifically creepy Christopher Walken (when he had a head) and stuntman extrodinaire Ray Park (of Phantom Menace fame) when he is in full action. Some of the scenes when the Horseman is using his sword and axe are breathtakingly staged. Johnny Depp as Icobad Crane was extremely good, although he seemed a bit of a coward at times. Christina Ricci gets better every time I see her in a movie. The rest of the supporting cast was excellent as well, and I could see that Mr. Burton likes to pull familiar faces around him in even the smallest of roles (like Martin Landau's brief performance). This film is a bit predictable at times, and can be a stretch of the imagination, but well worth the money I paid to see it and at the top of my DVD must-have list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this film since first seeing the teaser trailer months ago, and I was in no way disappointed. The movie pulls off a lot that many other films reach for and don't quite grasp.The characters were actually developed and 3-D for this kind of film--particularly Ichabod himself--which I didn't expect given the nature of the story. The acting is superb and FUN! Johnny Depp puts in a performance that I've read he was worried would be taken badly, going over the top as often as it does--but he nails it dead on, creating a great combination of personality strengths and flaws, seriousness and humor, for the hero. Christina Ricci does a great job as Katrina, also (I'd say more about that, but it would add spoilers). The town "fathers", so to speak, are the best little set of talented character actors you could ask for, so that even the smaller roles are acted well.I really didn't expect as much HUMOR in this film, either--and as I'm one of those who is often one of the only ones laughing at select movies, let me add that there were about 3 or 4 empty seats spaced far apart in the whole theatre, and the rest of the audience was laughing right along with me.The special effects and atmosphere were, of course, flawless, and the action sequences were exciting and well-executed (if you'll pardon the pun). Recreation of the time period and location, and the look and mood of everything was beautiful, as I expected from the artistry of Tim Burton. And how can you go wrong with Darth Maul heading up your action sequences? (Okay, don't pardon that one.) Another nice thing about the action was the fast pace of such sequences--none of this drag-the-time-out for a closeup of everything that's going on, audience-demeaning, intelligence-underestimating sort of thing. No, if you blink, if you're playing with your popcorn, if you're not paying attention, you just miss it.The same goes for the information that'll let you play detective along with Ichabod, if you want. That leads me to the last amazing thing I'm going to rant about here--the fact that this was actually a well-written, nicely-plotted detective story. Many a more mainstream movie fails at putting together a good figure it out or be surprised (or a little of both, all depending on the type of moviegoer you are) MYSTERY. My significant other has great fun in trying to figure things out ahead of time as the plot unfolds, I don't and choose not to, and we both loved it, and found it filled with unexpected and unpredictable developments.That's it, basically. I loved it, go see it if you want to see a perfectly-executed &amp; fun supernatural mystery (as long as you don't mind decapitations and blood!), and I hope that you're as entertained as I was, and as I'm going to be when I go see it again! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. From the previews, it looked like a typical horror flick. Although Sleepy Hollow did have its fair share of gore, I'd actually hesitate to categorize it as "horror", considering the movies that have been coming out under that genre lately. Sleepy Hollow was witty, its cast was great, and the atmosphere was appropriately spooky. Aside from the latter attribute, "horror" movies of late rarely have those characteristics. As other users have said, though, this movie isn't for everyone. [Possible spoiler] However, I will say that I'm a pretty skittish person. A slightly louder than normal noise will make me jump. For those of you who are afraid that Sleepy Hollow is one of those make-you-jump movies, trust me, it's not. I didn't jump once. All in all, a fun movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the trailor, which was great. I'm a big Tim Burton fan; and Johnny Depp &amp; Christina Ricci are great actors. Unfortunately I left the theater disappointed. while the movie is wonderful visually, the story really needed some work.Mr. Burton made this story into too much of a whodunnit for my taste. I was expecting more of a horror story. There are too many charaters, who are barely developed at all, so I didn't much care who the killer was or why he/she was doing it.On the plus side, the acting was first rate. Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ichabod Crane. His reaction after seeing the headless horseman is priceless. Christina Ricci makes a whole lot of nothing in her role opposite Depp. I can't even remember her character's name, it was so porely developed. But she has so much presence onscreen, and chemistry with Depp, she somehow makes it work. I hope they make another movie together.As for the character of the horseman, like the rest of the movie, the cup is half full. He starts out as an unstoppable monster, bringing death upon everyone he meets. Ray Parks does an incredible job in the fight scenes. Unfortunately, we come to learn that he is not killing randomely, but is after selected targets. It ruins the suspense when Ichabod can be around this monster without fearing for life. The movie sure is good to look at, though. I'd give it 3 stars.</fullReview>

My significant other has great fun in trying to figure things out ahead of time as the plot unfolds, I don't and choose not to, and we both loved it, and found it filled with unexpected and unpredictable developments.That's it, basically. I loved it, go see it if you want to see a perfectly-executed &amp; fun supernatural mystery (as long as you don't mind decapitations and blood!), and I hope that you're as entertained as I was, and as I'm going to be when I go see it again! :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a near masterpiece. The way it is shot, with the sun never peeking its head through the clouds, and acted, with great performances by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, is fabulous. If you have an appreciation for the artistic value of movies, and if you don't mind a little terror and gore, definitely check out this movie. Preferably with someone who won't mind if you grab onto them at some of the more terrifying scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. From the previews, it looked like a typical horror flick. Although Sleepy Hollow did have its fair share of gore, I'd actually hesitate to categorize it as "horror", considering the movies that have been coming out under that genre lately. Sleepy Hollow was witty, its cast was great, and the atmosphere was appropriately spooky. Aside from the latter attribute, "horror" movies of late rarely have those characteristics. As other users have said, though, this movie isn't for everyone. [Possible spoiler] However, I will say that I'm a pretty skittish person. A slightly louder than normal noise will make me jump. For those of you who are afraid that Sleepy Hollow is one of those make-you-jump movies, trust me, it's not. I didn't jump once. All in all, a fun movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is a beautifully directed piece that suffers greatly from entirely too much plot. Burton's other films, like "Edward Scissorhands", "Nightmare Before Christmas", "Ed Wood", etc., worked wonderfully off of very simple themes. "Sleepy Hollow" could have been Burton's masterpiece if only it had followed suit. Instead, the film is bogged down by an overly elaborate, yet painfully dull plot involving a range of characters that could have been more interestingly utilized. On top of that, the most intriguing character in the film, the Headless Horseman, is barely developed. The film might as well be about murder and deceit in a small farming village in the early 19th century, and the Horseman serves no other purpose than as a henchman for the these people. So, what's the point of him appearing in the film at all? I certainly would have much rather seen Tim Burton focus on the phantom Headless Horseman and his nemesis, the pragmatist sleuth, Ichibod Crane.However, it is hard to discount the entire movie simply for its inane plot. Of course, the acting, cinematography, and score work beautifully together, as you can always expect from the holy union of Burton, Depp, and Elfman. So, if you're a Burton fan, you should at least enjoy this movie on a few levels, but you'll most likely be thoroughly disappointed by the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous fun and great atmosphere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton has added to his excellent and stylish body of work with a captivating adaption of Washington Irving's classic story. This film is marvelous; if there is any fault with "Sleepy Hollow" it is that it requires a viewer to pay attention to the plot - which is all the better for thinking adults. Movie-goers of any age will find something to love here, although be sure to keep the kiddies far away unless you want wet beds and sleepless nights: "Sleepy Hollow" gets off to a rousing start with two decapitations within the first few minutes.Instead of a timid skinny schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane is a New York City policeman in 1799 specializing in scientific "detecting" of crimes; he is soon sent to distant upstate New York in the heart of an isolated mostly old Dutch community - Sleepy Hollow - where murders by decapitation are occurring with distressing frequency. Crane, rather officious and slightly diffident in his own way, goes to the town that rises out of the misty smokey air in a hollow reminiscent of Brigadoon in the Scottish highlands.Crane soon discerns the conspiratorial nature of the leading townsmen, and that the Headless Horseman is indeed continuing his nighttime rides in search of heads. He is the incarnation of a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier from the Revolution killed by Americans in the woods that no one dares set foot in twenty years after he and his cut off head were buried there. The very logical Crane needed to see the town magistrate killed in front of him before he'd believe in the Headless Horseman.Soon Crane is striking up a bit of a romance with the daughter of a leading (and suspicious) citizen, Katrina. But there is more here than at first seems - much more. Clues of witchcraft use keep appearing and they point to her. A mystery begins to develop with many of the pieces discernible for the truly observant. The link between the conspiracy and the Horseman eventually gets pieced together, but only partially as a final twist leads to the climactic and heart-pounding conclusion.The plot holds together and develops very well. Fascinating clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout the film; disjointed plot bits also all fuse together by the end with great effectiveness. The art design and scenery is superlative and Burton knows masterfully how to create the right mood with his cinematography. The special effects are first rate, but Burton uses them judiciously merely to enhance the plot and emotion of the moment; this is thankfully not an "effects" movie. Depp is appropriately rather dazed and sometimes befuddled as Crane, although he rises to the occasion at the end. Ricci is vulnerable when needed, and the rest of the cast is effective too. Noteworthy is Christopher Walken in a non-speaking role as the Horseman and horror vet Michael Gough as a doomed notary.The movie ends with a beautiful snowy shot on Wall Street in January of 1800, and it is so accurate the original Federal Hall is on the right and the second Trinity Church is in the distance just across Broadway. The look of old New York is splendid. "Sleepy Hollow" is wonderful in every way, including such details that make one want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>. . . it breeds new meaning for `Watch your head!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow Reviewed by Bill StollI'll admit it: I never read the original Washington Irving story. Cliffs Notes covered the topic perfectly back when I was in school. So I critiqued this work `exclusively' on its film merit . . . as I should anyway. Ever wonder where the phrase: `Spinning the truth' comes from? (it's a good political year for "that!") This film tells you with a charming childhood metaphor threaded throughout the story. It breeds new meaning for `Watch your head!' and that perky invitation `Who wants to go along?' It's a laugh fest if you listen closely.The acting is terrific. Johnny Depp `IS' Ichabod Crane, a tribute to his diverse `character acting' skill. He surpassed my expectation; and I expect a lot from the man. In tandem with the oft "head-free" Christopher Walken, they reclassified the film as "riveting" for me. Miranda Richardson delivers a brilliant Lady Van Tassel - both naughty and nice ( . . . and no more about "that" till you've seen it!) Christina Ricci is a great love interest for the eccentric Constable Crane. She's come a long way from Mermaids (where she first hit my list).Despite all the head lopping, it isn't that scary. (That from a guy in his 40s. For the 11 year olds, it might carry quite a different SQ [scare quotient]!) There are a couple of fright spots, but I had deeper chills from Ghostbusters, like the library scene, e.g. This is a well told story where I reasonably anticipated what the screen delivered, yet enjoyed every moment of the ride without drifting. For those who know me, this is a major accomplishment. Distraction could be my middle name. But not here.Director Tim Burton is now the undisputed King of Gothic. Absolutely. From his Batman to Edward Scissorhands to Ed Wood, he infuses gloom into my mood like nobody else can. It pushes me into the right frame of mind for his movies. The gothic feel here would make Batman himself envious. He holds tenaciously to the look until the problem at hand is eliminated. And then, guess what?! What a talent. If you need detail on the story, do what I should have 30 years ago. Read the book (or I'll lend you my Cliffs notes). But for a wild ride on a galloping horse, see this movie. 3 out of 4 stars. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a update of the classic story. But in this movie, Crane is a cop sent to Sleepy Hollow to solve some unsolved murders. Crane moves in with the Van Tassell while working on the case. Eventually headless bodies start appearing and the horror of the "headless horseman" come out. The story of how he lost his head is shown in a flashback.The horseman is played by Christpher Walken(Blast from the Past). The costumes are excellent as the setting.It seems that everyone in Sleepy Hollow is related to each other. Crane eventually discovers who is controlling the horseman. The cast is great as you can never tell who is friend or foe. This movie is better than the classic Disney animated short as it gaves us time to deal with life in Sleepy Hollow, it's people and it's deadly secrets!!!If you like Johnny Depp,Christina Ricci or the other cast you might like this dark take on the classic story!!Or if you like any of Tim Burtons other movies check out his take on the classic horror story!!BTW, the town of Sleepy Hollow does really exist in reality!!!Go see this movie and have a fun time!!Forget the critics who hate this movie!!At least it's better than Disney's short !!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What an experience viewing this film was! Tim Burton has done it again, and has created a marvelous, gothic modern horror classic. Sleepy Hollow is undoubtedly one of the most atmospheric horror films to be made of late. It has gobs of gory blood, splendid acting(most notably from the ever-impressive Johhny Depp), a caravan full of suspense, and the typical Burton touches of witty dialogue, creative secondary characters/casting, and some most bizarre and impressive special effects. The film is as fraught full of laughs as it is fright. And the advertisement does not lie when it says...Heads will roll...and indeed they do...again and again. My only major complaint is that veteran horror star Christopher Lee is basically an ornament in one scene and only one scene. Pity his greatness was wasted. Nonetheless....A must-see!</fullReview>

This was an amazing undertaking, and Burton pulls it off Oscar worthy. this is Burton{a personal fav of mine}'s most amazing piece of work film wise. He has turned the world of Sleepy Hollow into a dream world with the use of amazing sets and fog and everything. Washington Irving would disagree with the plot, but he will have trouble denying that Burton has created the look for Sleepy Hollow he envisioned when he wrote it. The film will win the cinematography award. Plot-wise and everything wise, this film ranks up with Burton's other masterpiece, Batman. Not many directors can have 2 masterpieces in their life time. Burton has a t least 2. No one could have handled this film and done it justice. Burton has done it with flying colors. Bravo. Give us more, Tim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this picture for a long time and it didn't disappoint at all. By far, the best Tim Burton film so far. I loved Ed Wood, and I was pleased to see Martin Landau make a cameo in the opening scene.Johnny Depp is very entertaining as Ichabod Crane, and the rest of the cast puts in good performances as well. Burton maintains his usual darkness about this movie, just as with most of his others. And it works to perfection in the setting of the small town of Sleepy Hollow surrounded by the seriously creepy forest. But make no mistake about it, the horseman carries this story, and he does not disappoint. Crane sets out to discover who is killing people in Sleepy Hollow, but he soon finds out that what the people have been telling him is true. The murderer is a demon on horseback with no head. The question then becomes why? This movie gets right to it, and then it doesn't stop until all is clear. I would like to have seen Christopher Walken get a few lines though. He is so compelling that even his smallest performances can stay with you for a long time. Even still, you will not be disappointed in this one.</fullReview>

Step it up a notch with a lot more intensity and refined camera work, throw two young perfectly cast leads, and what you have is the latest Tim Burton installment of creative and flawless art. Burton simplifies the world in a way that we aren't let down, because we aren't overloaded. Sleepy Hollow is the most beautiful approach to solid entertainment. Every day is as creepy as the night, and at times you may just want to reach out and touch the curled twigs framing the screen. Be careful not to get suckered in to thinking that this is reality, because you could end up laughing at the movie. This is a fable. It is melodramatic. It isn't the best movie of 1999 but it is refreshing for a director to create a world of his own and invite us into it. Sleepy Hollow pays respect to the films that chilled us before reality was necessity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, Burton takes adults on a journey into a magical, mystic world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow, directed by Tim Burton, is a wonderfully imaginative take on the American tale.Using saturated colors, whitened skin tones, and a lot of fog, Burton successfully transports the viewer in to the magical realm where fairy tales live and legends are born. Emulating Hammer Horror Films of past, Burton stretches our reality. As a director, he is free and bold. Always making the unexpected seem ordinary and the ordinary seem like magic. Using 1899 New York as a template and the world on the brink of scientific revolution as a moving plot force, Burton further endears the American tale... only this time we get transported into the world of Icabod and his eccentricities. The fog laden woods full of crooked, dead trees give a nightmare-ish quality to the atmosphere. Surprisingly graphic decapitations, and rolling heads are sure to get the hair to rise on your neck.The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, of SeVen Fame, is solid in structure and imaginative in dialogue. It feels like dialogue from the darkest parts of a Dicken's novel. The mixture of science and mysticism is balances masterfully. Character's motivations are strong and carefully crafted, including even the smallest of character rolls. In short, the work is as solid as Walker's past screenplays which only make us yearn for more.Performances are superb, especially Johnny Depp, who makes Icabod frail yet curious. Supporting characters are interesting and full of history and background.This holiday movie is sure to please many, and makes this film lover anxious for our next adventure with Burton. 10/10</fullReview>

Depp marvelously maintains Ichabod's nerdy but endearing personality while representing a turn-of-the-century detective instead of a schoolteacher as in Irving's original. Also, the peripheral characters added great chemistry and dynamics to the movie instead of subtracting from it. The Masbeth son was a perfect partnering sleuth to Crane's often frail portrayal of courage and fortitude.If ample amounts of blood and Freudian symbolism do not offend you, "Sleepy Hollow" definitely entertains with a remarkably creative display of balance between both the power and sometimes impotent use of reason to uncover and explain truth. And who can really resist a movie with Christopher Walken playing "the bad guy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Return To Classic Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally we are treated to a wonderful black and white fairy tale by master fairy teller, Tim Burton. Burton seems to focus his energies on two film visions: colourful, fun stories (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks!), and then he has his monochromatic fairy tales (Edward Scissorhands) or otherwise art films (Ed Wood). It's been 9 years since one of his fairy tales (Batman Returns), and it's good to see it again.All the classic Burton motifs prevail in this movie. We have the old rickety houses, the constant cloud cover, the lack of colour. We even get to see Christina Ricci wearing a black-and-white striped dress that is an obvious harkening to Beetlejuice. There are many fake sets, but unlike other directors, they add to the film, rather than detract. It's like watching a stage play, or a fairy tale, as this movie is. If the scenery was real, it would ruin the atmosphere of the movie.Sleepy Hollow has a lot of the quirky humour that marks Burton movies, but this movie also seems to be a lot more violent than his other movies. Very bloody, very graphic, very powerful.An eccentric director deserves an eccentric cast, and we have that most notably in Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Johnny Depp has always proved himself to be incredibly versatile, and he easily becomes the type of character that Tim Burton requires: odd. And Christopher Walken...well...They should market Christopher Walken masks for Halloween.I won't say anymore, except go see this movie! You will not regret it! It's adventurous, hilarious, and frightening! See it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous and dreamy spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has delivered yet another beautiful, frightening gothic masterpiece in "Sleepy Hollow." This movie surpasses the "Batman" movies in the depth of melancholy and stylish gloom it embodies. That is not to say that this is a completely dark film - far from it. But it is suffused with the aching loneliness and utter sense of alienation embodied in the character of Ichabod Crane. Johnny Depp's beauty is used to convey the absolute fragility of the character. Crane's journey from terror to resolution and finally bravery in the face of a seemingly unstoppable foe is portrayed both starkly and with a touch of sensitivity as well. I disagree with those critics who saw the portrayal of Crane's childhood trauma as a distraction. Those scenes showed exactly why Crane became the man he was, and why he approached the situation he found in Sleepy Hollow as he did. Life often takes us to places that force us to confront all of the traumas and inner demons we would prefer to leave buried. In "Sleepy Hollow's" dream-like images, we are taken through one man's harrowing attempt to face all that he fears -- death, loss, pain, the unknown and fear itself -- in order to emerge more whole than before. Depp played Crane as a "frightened schoolgirl" for a very good reason; Crane wilfully halted and repressed his emotional growth at an extremely young age and attempted to supplant that side of himself with intellectual pursuits. When events dredged up hidden memories of past horrors from his unconscious, his emotional reactions were those of a child. Christina Ricci's character serves as the perfect counterbalance to Crane, very emotionally aware, yet also strong enough to face the horrors around her. The film is a beautifully-wrought vision of a man attempting first to avoid, then to accept and defeat, the irrational side of human nature. It was pure joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well, tim burton has really done it this time. After making such visual tour de forces as "Edward scissorhands" and "batman returns", he has made the truly stunning "sleepy hollow." the movie stars johnny depp and christina ricci, and has a list of cameos a mile long that includes Christopher walken, christopher lee, and martin landau. The production design and art direction of this film are truly breathtaking. The way the trees come to life, the eeriness of the woods, the colors of they sky, it is just simply gorgeous. and the dark tone that the film establishes very early really makes this movie a treat to see in a dark theatre. The effects are top notch as well, and the blood stands apart from all blood you may have seen in other movies. This blood is so bright and stands out so much from the background. it is beautiful. this film is in the tradition of the hammer horror classics of old, and it certainly looks like one. the horseman (played by Ray Park, who incidentally also played Darth Maul) is also a great villain. the choreography of the fights is done very well, especially since the guy has no head!! the performances are also very good, especially johnny depp who brings a lot to the character of Ichabod Crane. He sometimes will remind you of a little prissy girl, but thats good in the situations of this movie. the story also keeps the movie moving quite fast, as you will keep asking yourself and others around you "who is controlling the horseman?" this movie is truly a treat and should be enjoyed by all. 9/10</fullReview>

Also, the peripheral characters added great chemistry and dynamics to the movie instead of subtracting from it. The Masbeth son was a perfect partnering sleuth to Crane's often frail portrayal of courage and fortitude.If ample amounts of blood and Freudian symbolism do not offend you, "Sleepy Hollow" definitely entertains with a remarkably creative display of balance between both the power and sometimes impotent use of reason to uncover and explain truth. And who can really resist a movie with Christopher Walken playing "the bad guy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Return To Classic Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally we are treated to a wonderful black and white fairy tale by master fairy teller, Tim Burton. Burton seems to focus his energies on two film visions: colourful, fun stories (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks!), and then he has his monochromatic fairy tales (Edward Scissorhands) or otherwise art films (Ed Wood). It's been 9 years since one of his fairy tales (Batman Returns), and it's good to see it again.All the classic Burton motifs prevail in this movie. We have the old rickety houses, the constant cloud cover, the lack of colour. We even get to see Christina Ricci wearing a black-and-white striped dress that is an obvious harkening to Beetlejuice. There are many fake sets, but unlike other directors, they add to the film, rather than detract. It's like watching a stage play, or a fairy tale, as this movie is. If the scenery was real, it would ruin the atmosphere of the movie.Sleepy Hollow has a lot of the quirky humour that marks Burton movies, but this movie also seems to be a lot more violent than his other movies. Very bloody, very graphic, very powerful.An eccentric director deserves an eccentric cast, and we have that most notably in Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken. Johnny Depp has always proved himself to be incredibly versatile, and he easily becomes the type of character that Tim Burton requires: odd. And Christopher Walken...well...They should market Christopher Walken masks for Halloween.I won't say anymore, except go see this movie! You will not regret it! It's adventurous, hilarious, and frightening! See it now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gorgeous and dreamy spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has delivered yet another beautiful, frightening gothic masterpiece in "Sleepy Hollow." This movie surpasses the "Batman" movies in the depth of melancholy and stylish gloom it embodies. That is not to say that this is a completely dark film - far from it. But it is suffused with the aching loneliness and utter sense of alienation embodied in the character of Ichabod Crane. Johnny Depp's beauty is used to convey the absolute fragility of the character. Crane's journey from terror to resolution and finally bravery in the face of a seemingly unstoppable foe is portrayed both starkly and with a touch of sensitivity as well. I disagree with those critics who saw the portrayal of Crane's childhood trauma as a distraction. Those scenes showed exactly why Crane became the man he was, and why he approached the situation he found in Sleepy Hollow as he did. Life often takes us to places that force us to confront all of the traumas and inner demons we would prefer to leave buried. In "Sleepy Hollow's" dream-like images, we are taken through one man's harrowing attempt to face all that he fears -- death, loss, pain, the unknown and fear itself -- in order to emerge more whole than before. Depp played Crane as a "frightened schoolgirl" for a very good reason; Crane wilfully halted and repressed his emotional growth at an extremely young age and attempted to supplant that side of himself with intellectual pursuits. When events dredged up hidden memories of past horrors from his unconscious, his emotional reactions were those of a child. Christina Ricci's character serves as the perfect counterbalance to Crane, very emotionally aware, yet also strong enough to face the horrors around her. The film is a beautifully-wrought vision of a man attempting first to avoid, then to accept and defeat, the irrational side of human nature. It was pure joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most beautiful film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well, tim burton has really done it this time. After making such visual tour de forces as "Edward scissorhands" and "batman returns", he has made the truly stunning "sleepy hollow." the movie stars johnny depp and christina ricci, and has a list of cameos a mile long that includes Christopher walken, christopher lee, and martin landau. The production design and art direction of this film are truly breathtaking. The way the trees come to life, the eeriness of the woods, the colors of they sky, it is just simply gorgeous. and the dark tone that the film establishes very early really makes this movie a treat to see in a dark theatre. The effects are top notch as well, and the blood stands apart from all blood you may have seen in other movies. This blood is so bright and stands out so much from the background. it is beautiful. this film is in the tradition of the hammer horror classics of old, and it certainly looks like one. the horseman (played by Ray Park, who incidentally also played Darth Maul) is also a great villain. the choreography of the fights is done very well, especially since the guy has no head!! the performances are also very good, especially johnny depp who brings a lot to the character of Ichabod Crane. He sometimes will remind you of a little prissy girl, but thats good in the situations of this movie. the story also keeps the movie moving quite fast, as you will keep asking yourself and others around you "who is controlling the horseman?" this movie is truly a treat and should be enjoyed by all. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not the best storytelling, and at times even cheesy, but you have to think a talent as smart as Burton meant it that way. What the movie lacks in story is countered well with Burton's flair with visuals. The town of Sleepy Hollow is breathtakingly realized, as well as the countless, grisly beheadings. Incidentally, stunt man Ray Park plays the year's two best villains: Darth Maul of The Phantom Menace, and, when it's not Christopher Walken, the Headless Horseman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic Splendor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Event movies are hyped and promoted regularly, and, when the film is finally released it often proves to be a big disapointment. Sleepy Hollow is not such a case.The film is going to be enjoyed greater by those who are Burton fans, like myself, but there is plenty here for even the layman to enjoy.Sleepy Hollow is aboslutely gorgeous, and should definately win an Oscar for cinematography. The setting is dark and wonderfully Gothic, with that wonderful Burton skewed view we've come to know and love. The fighting scenes are exciting and well done. The Headless Horsemen is an imposing figure, and Burton continously adds new ways for the ghost to claim his victims.Danny Elfman again provides a remarkable score that is appropriately brooding and moody. Hardly the bombastic fair of Batman or etheral complacence of Edward Scissorhands, though moments of the score do recall those.The real draw to the film is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Crane is refreshingly wimpy and not the gung-ho type so common to today's genre films. Crane is funny and touching and will instantly become an audience favorite. Christina Ricci is also good in the film, and some of the best moments are she and Depp's romantic scenes which are peppered with some wonderfully (intentionally) over the top dialogue.To paraphrase Ichabod, I believe there is a bit of witch in this film, for it has bewitched me. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW is the kind of gothic horror film that feeds the soul with it's wicked charms. Providing Burton with a plot and cast that's far more appealing than MARS ATTACKS!, HOLLOW is a grand return to form for Burton. Galloping back into the dark reaches of the night, Burton giddily weaves this harrowing tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman with the passion and inspiration that spawned such classics as his EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and BEETLEJUICE.In collaboration with director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki, Burton gives the film an almost black and white color scheme. The only color that is allowed to shine through is blood red, and oh my, does the blood flow. This is a gorgeous looking film packed with the imagery and originality that Burton excels at. HOLLOW is visual genius. Production Designer Rick Heinrichs alone should be a shoo-in come next year's Oscar nominations.Now if only the script was up to shape HOLLOW suffers greatly from a story with too many characters and not enough time to properly introduce them all. I found it hard to tell who's name belonged to whom. Halfway through the film do the seeds of plot finally begin to be planted. It's rather humorous to watch in the climax of the picture when one of the characters has to explain in great detail how the film's plot figures out. HOLLOW isn't that hard to follow, but the film uses it's downtime in between Headless Horseman scenes to spew out these large chunks of exposition that it damages the overall dramatic angle of the story.Burton's muse Johnny Depp (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD) marks his third collaboration with the director with another distinguished performance. By making his Ichabod Crane a master forensics expert with the heart of a ?fraidy cat, Depp ingratiates himself wonderfully in the role. Christina Ricci also makes a strong impression.HOLLOW is a flawed nightmare, yet this will most likely be the most technically impressive film of the year. I would recommend this film simply for that feeling of being transported to a far away land where magic ruled the country and a mythical horseman stalked the woods in search of fresh blood. -------------7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with a great score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Sleepy Hollow at a press screening last night at Paramount. In light of the trailer (which I thought was ho-hum), my impression that Burton films generally are overacted and border on cartoonish or comic book-ish, and (especially) the cheesy "heads will roll" tagline, I was expecting a pretty mediocre show. In the end, though, I thought it was good. There is a little bit of silliness (e.g., head spinning around after being cut off) and one or two too-cartoonish effects (to mention would be to spoil), but overall I think the movie stays away from such things -- which for me is a good thing. Generally, I think it was well acted too. My rave for this movie, though, is the Danny Elfman score, which is awesome. The sound effects were also very good and, as always, Burton does an incredible job of providing a dark and dreary backdrop to a story. I'm not too sure about some of the character development (or lack thereof), particularly with regard to the characters played by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson, but in the end I didn't really mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched Sleepy Hollow last night at a preview screening and I have to say that I was not disappointed! I have always been impressed with Tim Burton's work, and with this film he has lived up to expectations once again. Visually, it was typical Tim Burton, dark and mysterious with a fantasy/fairy tale feel, carried out through the spectacular sets, dark costumes and deathly make-up. Johnny Depp was brilliant as the straight-laced, cowardly Ichabod Crane, prone to fainting spells. Also to be applauded were the performances by Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, and Miranda Richardson. I also particularly enjoyed the performance by Ichabod's young sidekick, who's name, unfortunately, escapes me. :(Story wise, the film can get a little campy with some rather mechanical lines, but I was personally willing to forgive them in exchange for some of Burton's typically dark humor, causing many audience members, including myself, to both laugh and groan at the same time. One word of caution though, for those who are planning to watch this movie with children. Believe the tagline to the movie, "Heads Will Roll," because it's true. Heads are rolling everywhere in this movie, blood is splashing, and it can get rather gory. When I think Tim Burton, I think of "Nightmare before Christmas" and "Beetlejuice", filled with dark humor, but nothing that will "scar" kids. Not so with this movie. Beware the faint of heart! The beheadings (among other several other scenes) can look quite real in action and might be disturbing to young viewers, so make sure whomever you bring to watch this movie will be able to handle it.But if you don't mind the blood and gore, and you have a sense of humor and a taste for the fantastic, be sure to put this movie at the top of your list!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to see an advanced, special screening of Sleepy Hollow. I was just checking out the new trailer online the other night, but the trailer doesn't show how good the movie is. According to the announcer just before the beginning of the movie, the version we saw was a "working production" meaning that the final touches weren't added (I beg to differ after seeing it) or if the questionnaires we filled at the end sufficiently trashed the movie or any part of it, they'd change it. Judging from the audience response (cheers and applause), I don't expect much or anything to be changed.Within the first few minutes, I was stunned by the cinematography. The imagery is simply outstanding. Not only does it help set the tone and darkish foggy-like atmosphere of the movie, but it's also has great contrast and sharp, well defined images. Emmanuel Lubezki (Meet Joe Black) has outdone himself. It's right up there with the great look of movies like American Beauty, Fight Club, Three Kings and The Matrix. It's gonna be hard picking a winner come Oscar time. The music done by Danny Elfman is grand and creates an epic mood, like the movie is larger than life. The movie certainly doesn't disappoint in this respect. Do yourself a favor and not go to your local substandard theatre with 5 dollar speakers. Your cinematic experience will be lessened if you do.Washington Irving wrote the story, while the screen adaptation was by Tom Stoppard, Kevin Yagher and the script written by Se7en's Andrew Kevin Walker. The part of Ichabod Crane is one of Johnny Depp's better roles. He doesn't take himself too seriously (he's not the Sherlock Holmes kind of investigator) and is funny in some parts. Christina Ricci plays her part well enough. Of course, there's a little love story thrown in between them, for all times sake that really isn't necessary. But it's so insignificant that we can overlook it and the movie doesn't suffer because of it. The real star of the movie is the headless horseman played by Christopher Walken, without his magnetic charm and charisma. The fight sequences are like something out of Conan The Barbarian but much, much better. One scene (the bridge scene) which pays some homage to Ben Kenobi's death scene, was so good that the audience gave a round of cheers and applause. The headless horseman kinda reminded me of Darth Vader, completely fearless and unstoppable. And he's not just killing people because they hurt his feelings or because he's just so evil or because he's got a chip on his shoulder. There's a solid reason why he's murderous and it's all revealed in good time. There really isn't anything to complain about this movie. It has a tightly written script, good performances all round, great story and action scenes, particularly the end, which was remotely reminded me of a scene in The Mask Of Zorro. I'll be very surprised if this movie doesn't do well when it comes out. It's one of the best movies I've seen this year, in all respects. I'll be seeing it again when it's in wide release. --e!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A retelling of the legend that's got plenty of style, but isn't lacking in substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great stories never go out of style. They can be told to a whole new generation and still feel fresh and exciting. With the medium of film they can be brought to life on the screen, sometimes faithfully other times not so much. Most of the time when a book is adapted to film somethings are tweaked here and there, but it's not always without good reason. Take this adaptation of Washington Irving's best known tale 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' directed by visionary filmmaker Tim Burton. Sounds like a match made in Heaven doesn't it? The story isn't exactly as you'd remember it, but fortunately it's faithful enough and also different enough to satisfy. Often times liberties are taken without care and money appears to be the number one thing on the minds of those involved, but this is not the case here.Pros: Excellent performances from an amazing, eclectic cast. Has a great dark and brooding atmosphere. Cinematography that is stunning. Moves at a good steady pace. Fabulous score by master composer Danny Elfman. Nice job done on the effects. Impressive production and costume designs. Some chilling moments. Lots of good twists and turns. One of Tim Burton's best directing jobs.Cons: Christina Ricci does her best, but is sadly miscast. The big revelation is a little disappointing.Final thoughts: 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' actually hasn't been adapted to film that many times. The most well known besides this one is the short animated Disney film and like that one, this version is really quite effective in the thrills and chills department. Sometimes things just come together at the right time and Burton certainly was the perfect choice for this material. A memorable and exciting experience that also makes great Halloween viewing.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually Appealing Burton Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven out of ten stars Admittedly, I am an admirer of Tim Burton's darkest work, and "Sleepy Hollow" definitely falls into this dark category. "Sleepy Hollow" is a plethora of visually appealing Gothic effects. The costuming, make-up, set design, traditional special effects, and CGI effects all add up to a very satisfying spectacle of Burton Gothic styling. "Sleepy Hollow" was a visual candy store indeed.For those of you that aren't interested in Burton's Gothic styling, you simply are not going to appreciate this Burton film. Burton essentially carries this picture on visual effects, which is enough for me to find this film to be an enjoyable, if not a light weight horror film. I don't think anyone can completely write off a film that pairs Coppola and Burton on the production end.There were many many talented people involved in the making of this film on both the production and performance ends. Watching Christopher Lee and Christopher Walken is worth the price of admittance alone. Eflman's score is chilling, a soundtrack I wouldn't be ashamed to add to my own collection. The extensive list of talented professionals should alone signal to us that this picture is at the very least a quality mainstream Hollywood production. I personally can't ask anymore from Hollywood than a film such as this.There are however, definite shortcomings that preventing me from awarding "Sleepy Hollow" ten stars. The accents the actors used were uneven at times, some the characters even appeared to lose their accents in several cases. I just felt like the accents could have been handled better. Without taking the time to name specific actors, some of them simply suffered from marble mouth syndrome. I mean I couldn't understand what the heck was being said by specific actors. It was annoying, it's called annunciation people. The plot was conceptually strong at it's core, but just got muddled down in way too many unnecessary details, doing nothing to enhance the overall story. It's not that the plot was overly complicated, it was just riddled with ridiculous turns that forced Burton to have a few too many, "Plot Explanation Scenes". A truly intelligent film allows the audience to completely piece things together on their own; I don't think that would be possible here. The weakest part of the plot hinges desperately upon a woman exacting revenge upon her landlord for evicting her family many years ago. Whatever....The flashbacks involving Crane's childhood were quite pointless and some of the attempts at humor, I thought were miserable. The strongest aspect of this production is it's visual style and power, Walken and Lee are a joy to watch, and you can really never go completely wrong with Burton and Coppola working together. This would be a wonderful film to view as part of your yearly Halloween celebration, but I wouldn't take it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It is a place called Sleepy Hollow."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Sleepy Hollow marks the third time Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together and I have to say it's their best collaboration. Burton's take on the the Washington Irving classic is a terrific slice of American Gothic. I'm sure everyone knows the tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman, but this movie offers up a new mythos for the iconic duo. This ain't exactly your daddy's Sleepy Hollow. But don't let that stop you from seeing this exceptional film. The cast and art direction alone are worth the price of entry. Johnny Depp is of course the star and Christina Ricci is the love interest, while a combination of Christopher Walken and Ray Park are the Headed/Headless Horseman. Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, and Martin Landau are just some of fantastic character actors you will see. Along with a talented cast, the film is just visually pleasing. The picture is so monochromatic it may as well have been shot in black and white; which suits the atmosphere perfectly. I wouldn't say that Burton has ever made an out and out horror film, but this is definitely his closest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Gothic horror fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ghoulish but surprisingly unfrightening yarn, this Gothic horror is rather like a foggy western played out on the other side of the States. Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane is a rationalist determined to get to the bottom of a series of murders. His beliefs are challenged when he comes face to face with the paranormal - and, indeed, as he finds himself intoxicated by Katrina, the daughter of the creepy Balthus Van Tassell and likely progenitor of the troubles.Johnny Depp has great acting qualities although I find them oddly skewed when he shows up for work on Tim Burton's sets. It's as if he adopts ill-considered mannerisms and this rather blights this performances. Christina Ricci was in her pomp as the indie-girl of choice in the 1990s and is pleasant to watch albeit in this mainstream role. Christopher Walken loses his head as usual. 4/10</fullReview>

Burton brings his dark, comic like world to life in this little town and every shot is mastered with perfection by the Gothic architecture that resides...One of those Halloween classics you should watch....Instead of a slasher...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The engineering of any Tim Burton starts on the visual side. He is a master in creating his own specific and special vision for the stories he illustrates. And the word is quite correct, i think, he is fundamentally an illustrator. Most of the times he picks up stories, popular tales, slighted reinvented popular myths, and he embodies them in the creation of worlds the characters can inhabit. In a way, his mind works pretty much like that of a child, and i say it in the best way, there are few things better than a child's mind. This specific mind is interesting to visit, quirky, dark, sometimes weird, but worth the look.The problem is that most of the times, that specific vision, materialized on sets, and characterizations, is all there is to it. Many times he can't make that world really live and move once he magnificently designed it. In this matter, Burton's work is close to that of a designer, or an architect, who design spaces and objects, only for others to put life into them.The problem of this film is that. The world is darkly good to visit, everything is finely built, from a visual perspective, worth the visit. But the narrative dynamics function mostly like any ordinary commercial production, and that ruins partially the experience. There's no real mystery behind the story, and the interest in the headless knight is purely in his visual appearance (apparently the tale is quite known in the US, i didn't know it so i didn't expect anything in advance from it).Depp is a great actor, one of the best these days, and i think one of his greatest qualities is to know how to place himself in advance. To understand that as an actor, his first and most important decision is to know how his specific character should play along with the context of the film so that he allows things to flow around him and through him. So notice how, despite being a protagonist, his performance always gives space to the side characters, making us analyse and 'investigate' them, in the same measure that Depp's character is doing. We act with him. That's great. Christina Ricci plays this game with him, and successful looks 'just' a side character with an emotional angle until the right moment in the story comes. This is hard to do, i think. I appreciated it.My opinion: 3/5 check the acting, and visit the world Burton proposes.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is pure Tim Burton. By watching the first few minutes, you can automatically assume that he's the director. Sleepy Hollow is unique in it's own, dark way. It delivers a sense of a horror/thriller film, and a comedy. Some people don't like those two genres mixed together, but honestly for this film, it works. Johnny Depp and Ichabod Crane is the best. Johnny Depp has his role. I'll never forget him as the dark, sensitive detective, researching the case of the Headless Horseman. Christina Ricci-I've never seen her scarier or more good-looking. She gives this feel of romance and light, as well as a dark, witch-crafty feeling. In all, the film is great. Tim Burton made one of his finest films. This is probably one of his best, but might be tied with Edward Scissorhands.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lingering for more from "Sleepy Hollow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is a strong dramatic movie that is worthy of much thought, that the collective efforts of actors &amp; contributors behind the scene, have combined to produce into a quality movie.It is suspenseful, &amp; in that regard, it reminded me of a masterpiece over a decade before, that I chanced upon &amp; that seemed to be unheralded by movie critics. "Jamaica Inn" was a quality production of British suspense &amp; drama &amp; with substance &amp; thoughtful plot, resulted in a complete product that lingered! Till this one several years later! This too, is much admired. I thought enough of it to want it in my collection! The same eerie lingering possibilities. Much more popularist in style but very similar if not original, in substance.The cast of the likes of Johnny Depp &amp; Michael Gambon, are impressive in their roles, &amp; appropriate to the evolving drama. But there are unanswered questions ... like why does the 'headless horseman' fail to claim the hero when he might have claimed him without mercy, while similarly claiming another victim? If not earlier, when hooves thunder in from a distance! This is still early on! But maybe it is the intention of the production team here, to present that good &amp; evil are so delicately poised, in ongoing battle. Only the scales are shifted in favour of the good &amp; the fair &amp; the just, layered by circumstance &amp; individual contribution.But despite such flaws or perceived deficiencies, real or imagined, it is presented to the viewer as a quality piece that I felt intrigued enough to watch a second time, &amp; enjoyed this experience much more so than the first.So give way to your intrigue &amp; let its suspense overtake you with each approaching hoof beat &amp; shadow that may be threatening in the darkness from a distance. But maybe it a positive. Let its simplicity &amp; investigation engulf you with drama &amp; curiosity, that reveals much, with its child-like trance of delight, slowly unraveling.It may not leave you fully satisfied, but you will be left lingering for more from "Sleepy Hollow".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Poetic and Visual Masterpiece of Film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, again, I was 30-years-old when this came out it scared the life out of me. I know Tim Burton's work but this was darker, scarier and bloodier. Such a awesome and interesting twist on the classic Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow tale. The story is pretty much the same: Ichabod Crane travels to Sleepy Hollow to investigate supernatural beheading that lead to the headless horseman. But there is a surprise twist.What makes this movie work is Depp's convincing perception of the meek and geeky Ichabod Crane. His character is scared, funny and extremely intelligent. It was such a perfect role for Depp. The other characters, Jeffrey Jones, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien and Ian McDiarmid are all fantastic in this movie, a real work of art. But the applause should go to Christopher Walken for playing the headless Hessian. The acting was outstanding.Aside from that, the scenery and the set design was mind blowing. It brought the Gothic vision of the story into a new level of horror. The fog, the Tim Burton-like scarecrows, the offbeat windmill, the Tree of the Dead, the bridge and the houses of Sleepy Hollow were spectacular to see. It was very reminiscent of Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas.The scare factor was there and it was both the bloody scare as well as the "jump-out scare." Some of the elements of these factors were scary themselves. I can't tell you much about the scary points because that would reveal too much plot detail, but I can tell you that it is scary. Take my word.The only downside to it was a too predictable relationship. Aside from that it was an outstanding movie. A true piece of poetic film-making.</fullReview>

Still an amazing film, though. Could be the best looking Burton film - the cinematography is beautiful and the production design is without equal. Love the way the Headless Horseman was realized - simply a perfect representation - and love the inspired casting of Christopher Walken. The story could be a bit better, but the dialogue's great with just the right amount of morbid humour and the mystery element is welcome. Add in an expected solid performance from Depp, a great ensemble cast, and a terrific Elfman score, and you've got one of Burton's top three films. Also my favourite film to watch on Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Sleepy Hollow, Tim Burton has crafted a vision of Gothic gloom unsurpassed in modern films. All the elements of film-making are brilliantly united. The music is eerie and powerful, the sets are literally out of this world(what an amazing imagination this man must have), the casting is perfect. I could go on and on. I love the way Burton lets loose and dives into the gory tale with great passion and enthusiasm. Furthermore, it is wonderful to see violence being used in a honest and cynical manner. I'm referring to the scene in which the whole family is slaughtered... (similar style as Pans Labyrinth) Not that I condone violence, but used truthfully it is a very potent tool. 9 out of 10 from a huge fan!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, right off the bat. I am a tad disappointed about the re-write on the classic characters in this story. Everybody knows that Icabod Crane was a school teacher. No body mention that this was the son or nephew of another Icabod who died here. So I must assume that it's the Icabod from the original story. Anyway, with that said I do like the environment, the spooky atmosphere. But like some movies that are all atmosphere, Sleepy Hollow has lots of substance, frights, gore effects, clever lines. Despite the change in the story, it actually works, plus it's CSI: COLONIAL, that was clever. Yes, I got to admit. This is a good movie and worthy of attention. 9 STARS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Should Have Been a Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie told an excellent story. My only complaint about it was it wasn't true to the original story. It should not have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW. Even though the original story is short, I think there is enough material in it for at least an hour-and-a-half feature film. There is a lot in the original story that could be fleshed out a little more by a good screen writer without making it drag too much. This movie would make a great sequel to the original story. It would have been better if they made the original story into a movie, called it SLEEPY HOLLOW and made this one a follow-up sequel. Remember, in the original story, it is not clear what happens to Ichabod Crane. A bit of gossip is relayed that he left Sleepy Hollow and became a lawyer or something. This movie could have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW 2, THE RETURN OF ICHABOD CRANE.Just a thought. The movie taken on its own terms is very good, as long as you can get past the fact that it doesn't have much to do with the original story. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow was a fantastic film, a story that could only have been made truly enjoyable (for me at least) by Tim Burton. When I was little, the cartoon freaked me out...but I've never really been able to understand Ichabod in most interpretations. Either you pity or despise him, you think 'well it's a shame what happened...but he was stupid' or 'I'm glad he died...the money grubbing jerk!' In reality, this just made the character deeper, not to mention the fantastic costumes...gels...scenes. It has an artistic flare, obviously...being a Tim Burton film (as I've mentioned.) The characters are deeper and more understandable. This is one of the very few mysteries that took me until the end to figure out the killer. Even then I was still surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voloptuous and spooky.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the truth, I was a little confused by the plot. Yes, it's true. The story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there. I can't remember the original, but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths? It's hard to believe that it did.It probably doesn't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves. And if the constant twilight, the desaturated colors, the late Fall atmosphere, the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors don't creep you out, there's always the Headless Hessian Horseman with his flailing blades. (He twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound.) The acting is pretty good too. Johnny Depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it. Christina Ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead, enormous doll-like eyes, and diminutive splanchnocranium. The supporting players are all just fine, including Christopher Lee, with the exception of the kid who serves as Crane's sidekick. He sounds as if he's still practicing his lines.The story has a couple of false starts. Depp is first set up as a kind of visionary Sherlock Holmes type. He has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes. But none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once, for a purpose we can't define. We expect him, based on this early exposition, which leads to his exile from New York City to Sleepy Hollow, to be a scientific genius. But that's soon gotten out of the way. It isn't long before he meets the Horseman himself and realizes he's dealing with the supernatural.At that point, alas, the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichs of the slasher movie. People do stupid things that put them in danger, for instance. Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him, two guys stop running, turn around, and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up. (Huh?) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there, lurking in the mist, ready to attack at any moment, like the Headless Horseman (and I DO mean "headless"). The very first murder, in the opening few minutes, has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o' Lantern. Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood, thanks. I suppose that kids, who ought to enjoy this movie, were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained.As for the Horseman himself -- well, I don't think I like him too much. He's presented as an immortal action figure. He's always in motion, galloping a horse at full speed, striding quickly around. He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor, which is alright, but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding, implacable menace. The staging of his attacks are low-brow. There are sword fights out of any number of action movies, with two antagonists, flashing blades, twirling figures, swishing and clanking sounds -- all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten. At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies.But the figure himself is really terrifying, especially when we don't have a clear view of him. The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows. The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed, though even that is a little too heavily laid on. Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight. It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly comic rendering done with self-conscious style and a sneer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Realistic decapitations--and what a host of them there are!--generally are not the stuff of dark comedy, but Tim Burton manages a scary chuckle or two at these blood-spattered dirty doings in a Dutch farming village at the turn of the century. And what's afoot? Revenge, a little black magic, and a headless horseman serving as an assassin. The foggy rural atmosphere is amazing, the cast (with the sole exception of a too-modern Christina Ricci) is loose and amiable, but the pall of the grisly killings becomes tiresome after a time. This coupled with the bleak scenario may be prove too much for restless viewers. The screenplay isn't as solid as one may hope (why, for instance, do the residents start shutting their windows when Icabod Crane first comes into town? What are they afraid of--a resolution? And why set an escape sequence in a weathered windmill when the windmill's demise is all that's delivered?). The finale is well-done, although the wherefore and why of the legend may come as a let-down to some (it was probably a daunting task for the writer as well). The picture is certainly an eyeful, and it is a prime example of Tim Burton's intriguing mixture of self-enamored slyness, slick visuals and gleeful bloodlust. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film a few Thanksgivings back, and I thought it was an excellent piece of cinema. After recently rewatching it, my feelings are still the same. "Sleepy Hollow" revolves around the quirky Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, that is living in fear after a series of brutal slayings by a supposed supernatural figure, the Headless Horseman. An investigator and attorney, Ichabod is skeptical about the horseman. When arriving at the small colonial village, he stays with the wealthiest family in town - the Van Tassels, who have a lengthy legacy behind them. He is soon 'bewitched' by the Van Tassels daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci), and begins to have his own experiences with the headless horseman - convincing him that the horseman is no myth, and is actually the one responsible for the series of beheadings. But there is a little more to the Horseman than the townspeople know of, and it's up to him to find out.The strongest element of this film by a long shot is the beautiful imagery. The small village, the woods surrounding it, and all the scenery is breathtaking - it looks like it came straight out of a fairytale. The village is dark and foggy, and the woods are very desolate with twisted, leaf-less trees. This sets up a very strong atmosphere, and the film takes place during the Thanksgiving/fall season, so that is another addition to film's overall feel. The special effects are also great, the supernatural Headless Horseman is very creepy, and the beheadings and deaths in the film are both convincing and grim. Everything Tim Burton does is with style, and he shows it off a lot in this movie. The plot is derived from "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving, a classic American tale. Those who are familiar with the old Disney cartoon version of the "Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman" will want to beware of this film, because it is much more violent and gruesome than the tame, children's cartoon, and there are some very neat spins put on the story to make it a much more dark, evil-themed film.The performances in the film are perfect - Johnny Depp plays the squeamish Ichabod with both seriousness and comedy. In fact, the film does include a lot of comic undertones and some flat-out funny scenes involving his character, that contrast with the bloody carnage that is taking place. Christina Ricci plays Katrina very well herself, she's innocent but mysterious, and has good chemistry with the Ichabod character. Behind the two leads are Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson, playing the Van Tassels, Casper Van Dien as Brom - a macho guy who is trying to woo Katrina, and Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman, in life of course. Bottom line - "Sleepy Hollow" is an excellent film. It's both scary and darkly comic at the same time, with a very well-written story and good performances. If you're considering seeing this film, do. If not for the story itself, the imagery and scenery are reason enough. But expect something much more grim and violent than the Disney cartoon. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler note: they are slight, might not even been significant, but they are here, both spoilers for the movie and the short story.For me a Tim Burton directing plus Danny Elfman for music equals an excellent film, add on three of my favorite actors, Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, and Christiohor Walken and that just makes a mind blowing film. So naturally I do enjoy this film very much. The sets are fantastic and true to Burton form the music wonderfully eerie. There's only one problem...it doesn't follow Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" at all.These are all the BIG differences: First things first, Ichabod is a schoolteacher in the book, he is also full of himself, pompous and well lets face it, ugly. He wants to marry Katrina so that he can inherit her dad's estate and then sell it for profit.Second, Brom Bones is the headless horseman, he is jealous of Ichabod spending time with Katrina and wants to chase him out of town. He does a very nice job of it two. Ichabod never returns to the area.Third, okay this is a bit nit picky, but that big gnarly tree has to do with another legend mentioned in the story. The horseman comes out of the church graveyard.The movie is great for what it is, but unfortunately Disney did a better job of putting the real tale on film. I won't discourage anyone from watching the movie, just don't watch it to get out of reading the story. In fact I encourage everyone to read "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" by Washington Irving!</fullReview>

The gore is usually comical and the mood is just right, and the scenery is very well done. I'm no history buff, but I remember reading ghost tales when i was young, and this is precisely what I was imagining!This isn't a good story for younger children, unlike other Burton films, I believe they will find it too disturbing. Too bad, because in keeping with the traditions of European/American fokelore, this film has a quality that tends to stick with you. The actors are so adept that you would have to struggle to not be drawn into the movie.Again, another permanent addition to my movie library. Watch it if you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Story of Sleepy Hollow+Tim Burton=one of the best movies ever made! It was so creative and sometimes creepy/disturbing, its one of the best Tim Burton movies that he ever made. The acting, was pretty good. Johnny Depp is great. Christina Ricci could've done a little better but overall the acting was pretty good. The story, now that's a true highlight! In this movie, we find out the history of the infamous Headless Horseman, which is quite interesting. Now, the Cinematography in the movie was so good, that it was actually inspiring. The whole town of Sleepy Hollow is a melancholy foggy town which is said to be FULL of witches (One witch being Christina Ricci). So, overall, a must see for Tim Burton fans and/or Corpse Bride like mystery fans alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange story, well acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Washington Irving's tale of a headless horseman seems a difficult subject to adapt into a film, however it seems to have been pulled off. The story of a New York inspectors creepy encounter with unknown forces is superbly portrayed by Johnny Depp. As in many of his films, Depp is usually overlooked and only remembered for his recent Jack Sparrow performances. Here though he is at his best mixing serious horror with slightly humorous characteristics.The film deals with a rather outlandish theme, but Depp is there to see it does not go straight over the audiences head. The headless horseman is a typical symbol in Gothic horror stories, but here it is Johnny Depp that brings it to life. Of course the other actors all deserve similar praise and as a collective help make Sleepy Hollow an excellent couple of hours viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone would ask me a good movie to introduce himself on the works of Tim Burton I would suggest him either 'Edward Sciccorhands' or this, because they both have so similar atmosphere and they show Burton doing something he's good at: Gothic fairytale for adults.'Sleepy Hollow' is stylish Gothic tale of a young inspector Ichiabod Crane (who else than Johnny Depp), who is sent to a remote village of Sleepy Hollow to find a culprit, who has decapitated 4 of the god fearing towns folk. When he arrives he learns, that the villagers believe the murderer to be no else than the Hessian Horsman (Chirstopher Walken), whose headless ghost has rose from the Hell to claim the heads of all who foolishly happen on his path. Crane's modern thinking is put to test after he learns that the case is in fact so and together with a son of one the victims Masbath (Marc Pickering) and lovely Katrina (Christina Ricci) he begins the search of the one, who has summoned the horrid hell spawn.'Sleepy Hollow' is from the better side of Tim Burtons movies: it's visually stunning, the music by his court composer Danny Elfman fits in and brings out incredible atmosphere and the actors are doing their parts all around nicely. But if you want to pick something, then the take the script, as it does indeed leave some room for improvement and there are some minor plot holes, but then again this movie isn't meant to be looked so seriously from that direction, as the plot does work in the scale it is meant to work: a fantastic, grim fairytale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Dark, Eerie and Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this book was nowhere close to the original, it has the same basic characters and follows the plot of the book vaguely. Ichabod Crane travels up the Hudson River to the small town Sleepy Hollow to investigate murderous decapitations. He stays at the home of Baltus Van Tassel and while there, enjoys himself the pleasure of the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel. Tim Burton directs this one and I absolutely love it. Danny Elfman's score is amazingly brilliant, the film could actually survive without any dialogue and you would just be swept away by the beauty and eerie tones of Elfman's music. It is definitely one of his best scores ever. For movies, this one is probably the darkest Tim Burton film and the sheer colors on the screen and look of the town itself prove that it is. The mystery can get a little confusing about the Headless Horseman and having a Headless ghost as the villain does seem a little scary for some, but the horseman seems even creepier with his head on! The film is violent but enjoyable and you'll be wanting more and more with each scene. Great, great, great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton's valentine to Hammer Horror + Depp's unorthodox work = inspired revisionist take on classic ghost story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) **** Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Casper Van Dien, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Walken, Lisa Marie, Marc Pickering, Christopher Lee (cameo). Filmmaker Tim Burton successfully brings to full fruition the giddy nightmare of Washington Irving's classic "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" to the screen in his atmospherically rich adaptation blending horror and humor with a deft , dank elan. Depp (in a wonderfully comic affectation inflected performance) is Ichabod Crane, in this version a New York City constable instead of a school master circa 1799, who is banished to the fog enshrouded farming hamlet of Sleepy Hollow Upstate New York to investigate the ghoulish murders involving decapitation and the dark ghost story of a slain Hussein horseman out for bloodthirsty revenge beyond the grave! Think a prehistorical "X-File" if you will as produced by Hammer Films. Exhilaratingly paced action sequences involving some fancy fencing, spine chilling incarnation of the spawn from hell and nasty, graphic beheadings all combine in this spookily superb revival with its truly pitch perfect production design by Rick Heinrichs, Emmanuel Lubezki's black and blue-green desaturated inky eerily beautiful photography and as always Danny Elfman's pulse quickening score. Depp's chicken hearted interpretation of Crane, Ricci's ethereal beauty as his love interest and Walken's frightening presence are evident to the bewitching, hypnotic feverdream of the genius that is Burton. Trivia note: Ray Park, who was Darth Maul in "Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace", is the Headless Horseman.</fullReview>

(it IS their lives, after all...i'd run for sure) you have to be into storytelling, or else the movie will seem to move at a slower pace than expected. have fun!</fullReview>

Johnny Depps performance is great! he really hadpulled out everything to pull off the scaredy cat Icabod Crane, though its not his best performance (Edward Scissorhands is his best performance) he perfects the character more than anyone else could.This film is Burton at his most Gothic and horrific! he takes out his usual doses of fantasy and replaces it with decapitiatons etc etc! and pulls it off brilliantly!

		<shortDescription>A bizarre retelling of the story that, for my tastes, is a bit too outlandish at times - but still features a great performance by Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton is very much a "cult" director in the sense that he has a huge circle of fans - a lot of them having emerged onto the Internet over the years - and outside of these fans there are a lot of critics who despise him for some reason. I lean towards the circle but I'd never say I'm a fan of his, and "Sleepy Hollow" is a good example of why Burton still has flaws as a filmmaker. His penchant for the outlandishly dark and eccentric storytelling is visually superb - this movie LOOKS great - but the narrative is weak, and the movie is so exaggerated in places that it's hard to take seriously. I'm mainly referencing scenes such as the one inside the church when a man has a tombstone cross thrust through his heart from hundreds of feet away, and is then dragged outside across the ground of the cemetery. I mean, it's just a bit too much.Burton takes a lot of creative liberties with the story - some of which work, and others of which do not. The best aspect is Johnny Depp who turns in a brilliantly bizarre performance as Ichabod Crane, the Inspector sent to investigate recent murders only to find the place haunted by a demonic being.The twist Burton adds to this story towards the end was too much for me - I thought, like many of Burton's film endings, the finale went way over-the-top. It turns into a fairly standard cinematic action romp with the eighteenth century equivalent of a modern car race taking place on a horse buggy, and a stupid explosion inside a windmill that just screams "HOLLYWOOD!" I recommend this is you are a Burton or Depp fan - if not, you probably won't enjoy it much. The sets are wonderful and the performance by Depp is a highlight, but other than that, there's not a lot going on here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed reading this story by Washington Irving and even visited the area in New York where Washington Irving is buried and the story was created. Johnny Depp,(Ichabod Crane),"Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory",'05, played the role of the constable investigating the various crimes happening in Sleepy Hollow and brings along all his up-to-date CSI equipment, that looked like it came from a scrap metal dump. Ichabod comes face to face with his murder, who seems to disappear as soon as he appears. Christina Ricci,(Katrina),"Cursed",'05, takes a liking to Ichabod and tries to help him only for her own self interests. Christopher Lee,(Burgomaster),"Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory",'05 gives a great supporting role with his sinister facial expressions. This film has everything, Comedy, Fantasy, Horror and some romance. Enjoy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>error in chronology in 'Sleepy Hollow'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Third Christian Millennium, by which we in the west reckon time, began on January 1, 2001. There was much debate at the time that the former Millennium ended with 1999 and began with January 1 2000 - this was wrong and this erroneous thinking was reflected in the movie 'Sleepy Hollow', which was set in 1799.The character of Crane mentioned that the old century had ended when January 1 1800 began. At this moment in time the old century, the 18th, had one more year to run.Roman Centurions, as the title states, commanded 100, not 99 persons. We are not one year old until we have lived a full 365 days after our birth - until then we are just living a time span.Centuries end at the completion of the hundredth year, not the 99th and thus 1799 was not the last year of the 18th Century.Roger DESHON - 07 3 824 2981 Australia</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Tim Burton does it again. Nobody does it like Burton! He's a genius. This movie is a proof of his talent. This film is scary, exciting, beautiful and thrilling. It is well made and the make up, the clothes, and the sound and visual effects are really good. Its script mixes action, fun, thriller and horror situations, and that makes the film absolutely great. It has it moments, some of them really funny. Some of the are also very scary. "Sleepy Hollow" tells the story of an American constable called Ichabod Crane who is sent by his boss to Sleepy Hollow, an isolated village, where he must investigate a series of murders committed by a supposed headless horseman.This film is very well acted. That's because his great cast, starring Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tassel, Miranda Richardson as her stepmother Mary Van Tassel, Michael Gamobn as Katrina's father,Baltus and Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman. But the cast is not complete; it is completed by Jeffrey Jones, Lisa Marie, Casper Van Dien, Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee. This cast is absolutely great.The music in the film is very interesting and wonderful. Created by Burton's friend Danny Elfman, this soundtrack is good and dark. I want Tim Burton to keep working with the great Elfman.Tim Burton should keep making films like this one, like this type of films, because they're all really amazing and beautiful. I'll always trust in you, Burton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's most Violent/Dark movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based off of the famous American tale of Sleepy Hollow. Which is know to be the first American Fairytale. Only this is different from the story you know by heart.In this version Ichabald Crane is a New York investigator not a school teacher who uses surgery tools to solve how a person dies. He's given an assignment on the murders that occurred in the town of Sleepy Hollow.When he was there he learned from the locals that the murders are done by the Headless Horseman. Who was originally a violent Hessian who killed many American Troops during the Revolutionary Era of America. He himself eventually got killed when his own head chopped off.And it is believed that the ghost of that Hessian aka the headless Horseman comes back from the dead and kill innocent people till he finds his head.Ichabald who isn't superstitious finds it impossible for that to be true. And tries to convince them that the killings are done by a murder.But as the plot goes along, Ichabald will soon learn that these killings are more than just a ghost story. And the mystery behind it all is very unpredictable.I have to admit I did like this movie a lot. I wouldn't of been able to seen it back in 1999 cause I was still a kid back then. But I think it was well done even if it's different from the original story. It's the only R rated movie Tim Burton has done so far.it also has plenty of celebrates like Johnny Depp as Ichabald, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiamard, 2 actors from Harry Potter films, and 2 actors from Tim Burton's BatMan Returns.A must see for the die hard Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans. Just be sure you're mature enough to see an R rated movie. Cause this movie has a lot of violence in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another outstanding Burton film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really reminds me a lot of Hammer films, it's dark overtones and imaginary backgrounds, a truly well-made film. With Johnny Depp and the beautiful Christina Ricci (love her) Burton crafts a genius film that even though is not a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, it has its' own agenda with dark and macabre horror. Some very frightening moments, not for the squeamish. For those of you that find this film empty, I think you should really look in a more realistic point of view rather than judging. Christopher Walken does an acceptable role as the headless horseman, even though his lines are only "HA!" it gets amusing after a while yet I don't really find his character boring or wasted at all. Johnny Depp does another film which shows he can do anything. The beautiful and darkly mysterious Christina Ricci lands a great role in this movie, Miranda Richardson does a fine job as well as Christopher Lee who seems to be back to acting~ Many surprises along with well-done Tim Burton twists, and finally, a solid 15 rating in a Burton film. Bravo Tim Burton!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it may not be a direct book adaptation, it certainly is a brilliant one. Tim Burton was quite possibly born to bring this Gothic tale to the big screen, and of course, Johnny Depp fits into the role perfectly.i remember being about 12 when this came out and unable to see it, so i asked people who had seen it for a detailed description of what happened. All the trailers i saw and the pictures from Empire and Total Film magazines had be determined to get it as soon as possible. i even stole it from blockbuster when it came out LOL.Visually this film is stunning. The western woods are so well made, i actually feel claustrophobic looking at them. The tree and the lair of the crone add to the Gothic and even the fully built town its fascinating to look at.Acting wise Burton could not of managed to get a better cast, including Michael Gambon, who was brought to my attention because of this film as well as Miranda Richardson. Some of Burton regulars appear such as Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and of course Johnny Depp. Each character have their own weird little traits and have a hint of the old hammer horror 'hammy' acting.A huge part in creating the atmosphere comes from, in my opinion, Danny Elfmans greatest score he has every done, but Tims direction and style of film making make this film what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is director Tim Burton's take on the classic story of the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" (aka the Headless Horseman).As you would expect from a Burton film - it is Gothic, darkish with a splash of camp (no thanks to Johnny Depp's performance!).The story centres around a New York detective who is sent to investigate the beheadings of three people in the village of Sleepy Hollow. He soon uncovers a murderous, headless ghost which his scientific background can't explain.Sleepy Hollow is an exciting film - the headless horseman sequences are completely electrifying. They are instantly recognisable (I probably had nightmares as a kid remembering that headless horseman crossing the bridge) and totally engaging - as the ghost proves himself as an unstoppable force on the townspeople.That said - where the film sort of falls down is it's "head rolling" plotting. It is sometimes confusing to try and make sense at all the plot twists and developments - although things are reconciled by the last 20 minutes (it all makes sense).Overall - Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride - brimful of headless delights...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an over all excellent movie. There isn't any one word to describe this movie. First of all it's a Tim Burton film so you're to expect the unexpected from this genius. For those who don't know, Sleepy Hollow is based on a legend and book. Basically, a headless horseman has been going around Sleepy Hollow, terrorizing the residents of this isolated town. When two residents have been murdered, the 'town elders' call on Constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) to solve the mystery. Other characters include Katrina Anne Van Tassle (Christina Ricci) and a handful of power house British actors that give life to this Burton masterpiece. The overall mood of the movie is dark. Every minute is filled with suspense. It was straight-forward (absolutely no mercy) when it came to the murdering of each victim. Burton must be going for a world record and see how much blood he could throw onto Depp during the entire movie. The headless horseman was ruthless and pure evil. Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane was absolutely stunning. Although at the start he looked like the perfect hero (good-looking, calm and wise demeanor, in-charge, intelligent)his flaws come as quickly as you thought he was the perfect man for the job. He was a flawed man who tried to look strong on the outside but absolutely faints at the sight of blood and is terrified of bugs and pests on the inside. Depp definitely played this character right. Ricci was credible as the innocent (or so you'd think), naive and beautiful love interest of Ichabod Crane. Overall, this movie made me and my best friend, jump out of our skins. In my opinion the best Tim Burton film ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never heard about Tim Burton as an average or neutral director without an original point of view... never. And this film doesn't make you think that at all. Tim Burton, a very influent director of the modern times, whose curriculum includes "Batman", "Beetlejuice" and "Edward Scissorhands", dares to direct a horror film. Let's review it with a simple equation: Burton + Sleepy Hollow = Great. This film is absolutely great in all aspects. Let's write some of them: a) The dark style (a trade mark of Burton). b) The chilly music by Danny Elfman (a very good friend of Tim and an excellent composer). c) The wonderful photography of Emmanuel Lubezki (amexican like myself, one of the best director of photography). d) The excellent performances of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (Burton had already work with them one, with Depp in "Ed Wood" and "Edward..."; with Christina in "Beetlejuice").Conclusion.- Three words: excellent, excellent, excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayy different the the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this review off by saying that Tim Burton is one of the most talented and gifted directors to ever appear in Hollywood.In this retelling of the Legend of Sleep Hollow by Washingtom Ivring. In this movie Ichabod Crane is not an English teacher but a New Yrok Constable in the year 1799. The acting in this film is phenomenal Johnny Depp gives quite a performance as Ichabod. He pull off the role quite nicely and is even squeamish like in the book. Now to the violence, decapitations, as you probably know this is the story of Ichabod's disbelief of the legend of the Headless Horseman,who cuts off heads quite cleanly (which is why Ichabod is in Sleepy Hollow in the first place). Now, the decapitations while shown, are not deserving of an R-rating and I believe this film could have gotten away with a PG-13, though there are a few scenes of graphic blood. There is no language or sexual content in this film, which is another reason i believe it could have gotten away with a PG-13. I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a haunting good time</fullReview>

Thanks to Tim Burton and the great Power this movie has over me! Are there any of you who feel the same? Don't you get the chills when you see Christopher Walken with his pointy teeth and don't you feel surprised when you know who is controlling the Horseman?

It is nice to see that after conducting an autopsy and seeing his opponent in action at night, that Crane is still afraid of everyday things like spiders! Wonderfully acted, sends chills down the spine for a continual ride through the woods! Christopher Walken portrayed an excellent headless horseman.

Instead, they used the basics, but sort of made there own story.It starts out with Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who has a mission to go to Sleepy Hollow, to solve the mystery of "someone" killing people, by chopping peoples heads off. While Ichabod is there, he meets the young, and pretty, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who he starts to soon fancy. Later, he finds out that it is not just some mortal killing people, but instead the living dead of "The Headless Horseman"! One by one, important people of the small village are killed. Ichabod has to find out how to stop the Horseman soon, or more people, maybe even him, will be killed! You will have to watch and see what happens! This movie has a pretty good twist ending too (And not a bad/disappointing one either). But I warn you, this movie is very gory, because it shows the heads actually being cut off.I suggest this movie to any horror fan. I would also rate this film a 10/10. But don't take my word, witness it yourself ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Horror gets good again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years I was getting fed up with horror movies about phsycos who pop out of nowhere or so-called 'phsycologigal thrillers' where they tried to get inside your mind to unnerve you. I mean, if I'm not mistaken in the good old days horror films were about imagery getting a feeling that there might be something lurking sinisterly in the woods. But unfortunately that sort of aesthetic has been forgotten. That was until Tim Burton came along. I know many people are fed up with everyone gabbing on about him, but really the guy deserves it. You can tell this was made by a fan of genuine old-school horror flicks, whilst also taking advantage of decensored movies have become since then. The plot takes some nice twists and turns and the whole cast are superb, most note-worthy of course is Johnny Depp with his portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Most actors would play him as a strong-silent type, Depp on the other hand, thanks to his lack of vanity, plays him interestingly and almost cartoonish. But what really stuck out in this film has to be the sword-play. The horseman's unique style has him sword fighting with grace, power and and unusual style. One of my favourite movies of all time, a definite must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton does horror, and quite well too...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget the animated Disney short. Tim Burton's first (and, to date, only) real horror movie has nothing to do with the 'toon many of us so fondly remember. It's bleak, gory, bizarre, and utterly brilliant.The main difference between the two versions is the protagonist: Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is no longer a teacher, but an eccentric inspector sent to Sleepy Hollow so that he can use his "scientific methods" to solve a series of appalling murders. He is firmly convinced the killer is human and everything has a rational explanation. Soon enough, though, he will realize he's facing a criminal like no other: the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken in flashbacks) is not the usual murderer, and cannot be defeated with conventional weapons.Burton has successfully made this movie his own, thanks to the creepy sets, Danny Elfman's grandiose music, the grotesque and ambiguous characters (flawlessly portrayed by such actors as Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson), and Depp's freaky leading man. He has even added one of his most personal touches: the eerie flashback which shows Ichabod's childhood and justifies his behavior (see also Batman and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for similar sequences). Without giving away the plot, it's one of Sleepy Hollow's most shocking moments.A very smart and unusual horror flick (though, as in the case of John Carpenter's Vampires, it's more gory than scary), and a must-see for Burton fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a great horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is one of the best horror movies ever. The story (the headless horseman) is an American classic. The movie doesn't quite follow the original story but is a very good version. Johnny is great. Johnny's character (Ichabod Crane)is very different from the Washington Irving's character but Johnny plays it wonderfully, he is quite funny sometimes and you never know what is going in his mind. Miranda Richardson is fantastic as always (playing once more one of the bad characters), Michael Gambon as well. Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid are great actors but this movie does not show them at their best. Christopher Walken was great as the headless horseman, he was really scary (with those blue eyes and sharp-edged teeth who wouldn't?!). Christina Ricci was the one that disappointed me. Her character was not what I expected and she didn't seem very convincing to me. No offence. I hope it isn't taken because I think she's a good actress but this one didn't got out very well. The special effects were fantastic, the tree of the dead and the windmill scene... well you will see what I mean after watching the movie. And the last but not less important facts: Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. Those two work really well together. Tim is a great director and Danny's fantastic soundtrack complete each other.A funny thing: when I started seeing the movie for the first time I thought it was black and white.</fullReview>

(everyone likes a love story) Although it is horror...there is comedy. The comedy is well suited for this particular film. The horror is not unbearable just a little creepy and a little gruesome at times, nothing I couldn't handle. However, if you don't like blood and open necks, don't watch this movie. I also find Miranda Richardson to play a wonderful performance as well as Johnny Depp. In my opinion they stole the film. I personally loved it.

		<shortDescription>Visual But Very Gory Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" was a visual delight--though I had to frequently turn away from the gory and very frequent decapitations and other bloody detail (which the teen boys in the audience thought were "awesome") making it hard to keep eating my popcorn. I thought it odd that in a Dutch colonial town everyone spoke with a Brit accent (I guess Christina Ricci being younger was more Americanized), but I enjoyed seeing so many Masterpiece Theater grads, as it was shot on a London sound stage. Director Tim Burton switches from serious to camp and back, but the knowing script references defuse the gore, with a lot of tips-of-the-hat to "The X Files," and Johnny Depp's coward-alternating-with-hero is refreshing, borrowing a lot more from Edgar Allen Poe, the inventor of the detective novel, than Washington Irving.I think this could give young kids nightmares.(originally written 11/21/1999)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>yes indeed the movie sleepy hollow is one hundred percent based on a true story and all the names and places are all real, in fact the village where the movie was filmed is the exact village where the horseman committed all of his murders. And then placed the heads of the victims in a hollow tree. That same tree is still standing in the village in England to this day. Some people even say when you visit the village or even the tree you can still smell the rotting heads and the blood which is stained the bark of the tree. This is believed because it is said that the hollow tree is the gateway to hell where the horseman we sent to after he was beheaded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Near the end of the 18th century, a gentleman police officer comes to a Dutch colonist community, northwards the state of New York, in order to conduct investigation around a series of repulsive murders, where the residents believe are committed by a revenging headless horseman.The rational, sober young man with his vanward, for his time, methods of medical jurisprudence, although hesitant at first, doesn't take too long to understand that the legend is based on truth, while at the same time develops a special relationship with the enigmatic daughter of a local eminent resident...Tim Burton tries to adapt one of the most popular Gothic fables of American literature (written by Irving Washington in the 1800s) to his monumental filming universe. It is obvious here, that we are a few steps away from the typical Burton thorniness (the stain of diversity and the non-acceptance by an environment intolerant), not however from the peculiar tonality that lives each of the authors work ; result of his beautiful use of stylized, austere, plain rhythm in writing, melancholy, and the use of eccentric humor and picturesqueness in narration.Brilliantly incorporated are the superbly made special effects, when, and where needed in order to accelerate the effect of fiction - while the music as well as the recreation of the era are worked and given attention in every single detail. Slightly "slack" remains perhaps the content, in mainly what has to do with the characters, if at the end we come to accept that the characters are not just "ordinary" people. The actors are doing pretty well their job, and Depp confirms with his performance that he's got more than just the looks. Anyway, none of Burton's work lacks importance and special interest, something that all his (many) fans know very well.This is a film well worth watching, scary but not too much this one has Tim Burton written all over it. There is only this little something missing that makes a great film differ from a truly amazing one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever had to choose what film would be one of Tim Burton's darkest, I'd have to say "Sleepy Hollow." It's beautifully made in his style...as the way he would direct it, and it's also the goriest, but it still manages to have some appropriately silly humor along with it. The setting is perfect as a gloomy, foggy kind of town in 1799. The whole movie reminds me of "From Hell" which also has Johnny Depp in it only this isn't as freaky. They both are but you can't compare the two except for the violence and the settings because they aren't very different.Without a doubt, it is still up there as one of my favorite Tim Burton movies. I give it 9 and a half out of 10 stars for the darkness and the acting and whatever else is beautiful about this kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Darker Hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a story that has incessantly intrigued throughout its many years of existence. How could it not? The idea of a ghostly headless horseman out to decapitate others in order to restore his own, um, shortcoming is undeniably interesting. However, many feel that Irving did not explore the dark side of this subject matter nearly enough, as he primarily focused on romance. Those who think that should not be disappointed by Tim Burton's adaptation, Sleepy Hollow.The story has been altered a little. Ichabod Crane (Depp), a young big city detective (instead of a school teacher) interested in unconventional methods, is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of beheadings that the townspeople insist were committed by a mythical murderer named the Headless Horseman.Burton, a director famous for his dark Gothic films, certainly does not stray from his signature visual formula here. Sleepy Hollow is bathed in perfectly recreated Gothic sets accented by undeniably effective bleached cinematography. This film is really quite beautiful to look at, in the manner that an ominous storm on the horizon is. Burton also injects a dark, violent edge into the story that Irving did not, and this will either please or repulse. I must admit that I was delighted to see the Headless Horseman receive the gritty treatment he deserves. He is actually portrayed by two actors in the film: Ray Park for the headless sequences and the always wonderful Christopher Walken for the scenes requiring a face. While Walken's performance is competent, I was surprised to find myself more impressed with Park. He provides the Horseman with impeccable intimidating body language and somehow manages to develop the character much more effectively than Walken, even though he never shows his face. Park has also delivered impressive performances as Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace and as Toad in X-Men. I'd love to see him tackle some bigger roles.But I digress.Though the film takes a considerably darker angle than Irving's book, there is still a romantic subplot between Crane and Katrina (Ricci), a comely young woman, that is, for the most part, enjoyable, though it does provide one of the corniest exchanges ever put on celluloid: -Katrina: Do you think me wicked? -Crane: No... but perhaps there is a little bit of witch in you, Katrina. -Katrina: Why do you say that? -Crane: Because you have bewitched me.Yeah. Ugh.Another element that tones down the dark feeling a bit is that Sleepy Hollow is a horror comedy. There are some insidiously funny moments, such as Crane's frank explanation as to why a dead body should not be repositioned at a crime scene. The film occasionally ignores basic physical laws in order to deliver a gag (for instance, Crane is sprayed in the face with blood while performing an autopsy - the body's blood would obviously not be flowing), but it's all in good fun - just don't over-think it.Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane with a giddy, eccentric, nuanced, and utterly delightful glee - just further proof that he is one of the finest actors alive. Another performance that warrants mention is that of Ian McDiarmid (known to most as Senator/Supreme Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars).When I first saw the film, I gave it an A-, most likely because I was overwhelmed by how fantastic the film was visually, but upon rewatching it, I really had to demote it to a B+. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, the writing is just bad. The dialogue is really quite dreadful at times and, toward the end, the story becomes ridiculously convoluted. If a film has a basic plot as fascinating as Sleepy Hollow does, it's really not necessary to throw in a supremely confusing subplot about how the Van Whos double-crossed the Van Whats in order to exact revenge upon the Van Wheres. It just causes headaches. The film also has a pretty standard, formulaic action movie climax.But flaws aside, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, entertaining Gothic horror comedy, and fans of Burton or Depp should not be disappointed.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well chosen cast with the perfect director for this horror-fairy tale. The bits of intended humor work well and the fog bound, darkened world reminds one of classic images from our younger days. Burton, Depp and the director of photography all deserve awards for outstanding work in a genre that appeared exhausted prior to this retelling. This film is so visually rich and the characters so solidly visualized that one can easily watch this entire film with the sound off and still come away fulfilled. The little town of Sleepy Hollow with its unique and isolated inhabitants are part of a dark secret that the inspector (Johnny Depp) must flush out in his nervous/edgy manner. Mr. Depp's ability to so perfectly perform his role without stealing the show is a testament to his ability and character. This movie sets such high standards that this story will probably not be retold in by Hollywood for many a decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should start out by saying that I'm a fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci which will have an impact on my review.The first time I saw this in theaters, I was disappointed because I expected more from the talent involved; it was a movie of atmosphere over substance. Furthermore, it wasn't really a horror movie despite its gore and suspense. But, I decided to give it another chance when I wanted to just watch something entertaining and found to have come to appreciate it more and more with each viewing. On long days when I just want to stop thinking for awhile, I will put it into the DVD player and enjoy the ride from beginning to end.Nevertheless, this movie will appeal only to a select audience of people who can judge the film for what it is: a mindless suspense film with a brooding atmosphere and a good amount of charm. So on an October night, when you have come home from a long day of work, this just might be the perfect movie to sit down and escape reality.</fullReview>

But, what I did get proved to be just as good - if not better- than what I had expected. This film is really really funny! Johnny Depp is an absolute comedy genius!! When Ichabod is in bed after seeing the horseman, Johnny's acting is 100% spot on, though for him that is nothing new. Christina Ricci too, acted well in this, though her accent confused me a little. What is it meant to be? This film is good, not one of my favourites, but entertaining none-the-less.

		<shortDescription>Delicious pitch black atmosphere and a camp plot make this flick a winner!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is often compared to the classic Hammer Horror films, and for good reason. Aside from utilising a few of the studio's regular cast members, Tim Burton's film has the fun, innocent edge that most Hammer films enjoyed - while also putting much of the focus on the plot rather than the characters or any other finer details. Also like Hammer, the film has it's own distinct style; but instead of the bright colourful sets that Hammer so often used, Burton's film is dripping in pitch black atmosphere as thick as blood, and it is this that gives the film it's main claim to greatness. Many of Burton's films enjoy this same atmosphere, but he never used it as well as it's used here. The film feels like a dark, twisted fairytale throughout and although this can, at times, take away from the serious horror edge; there's enough blood and guts on offer to keep any horror fan happy. Props such as styled pumpkins and scarecrows help to keep this atmosphere going, and when combined with Burton's assured direction - the film is a stylish visual treat. Nearly every scene in the film is excellently staged, and shots that see things such as a beheaded mother state at her son through the floorboards show that the director has a real flair for horror.The plot follows the legend of the headless horseman. This legend hasn't been done on film many times. In fact, I can't think of a single other film that tackles it head on...although I'm not denying the existence of one. Anyway, we follow Ichabod Crane; a policeman sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of strange murders, apparently committed by a headless horseman. He doesn't believe it at first...but "seeing is believing", and it's not long before he's tackling the legend head on! Sleepy Hollow benefits from a plethora of great performances. Burton's frequent muse, Johnny Depp, heads the cast and he is joined by Christina Ricci, along with a whole host of great actors including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken, who is superb in the role of the headless horseman. The nineties didn't offer much in the way of great horror films; but Sleepy Hollow is near the top of the short list. For some reason, the film doesn't have as many fans as it should; but that doesn't change the fact that it's a great achievement, and one of Tim Burton's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's Visually Stunning Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon. The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes. It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness. He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid. They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel. The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction. This is a treasure of a film. Highly recommended.

The skull has fairly normal looking teeth, yet we clearly saw at the beginning of the movie that the horseman had filed his teeth to sharp points. To make things worse, when the newly attached skull has acquired an overgrowth of facial tissue, skin, hair, eyes and a tongue - lo and behold the teeth are once again filed into sharp points.</fullReview>

The whole bit about the symbol under Crane's bed, and what it really was about, was quite predictable.The movie kept me guessing/trying to figure out what the heck was going on, almost to the very end, and overall is a suspense/action/somewhat-horror-though not really all that scary- movie that is worth the time it takes to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Headless Horseman is a timeless one; everyone knows it. So how better to re-tell this story in an interesting and innovative fashion which will appeal to today's audiences than to hire quirky filmmaker Tim Burton, whose eccentric sets and expertise at mood building are a fair guarantee that the film will be interesting, if nothing else. Burton lives up to his reputation here; Sleepy Hollow may prove to be his most atmospheric film yet. The sets of the town Sleepy Hollow are marvelously strange, (and very Burton-esq for any fans) perfectly capturing the feel of this shady, timewarped town. There's also a constant feel that something isn't right, as if dark forces could strike out at any moment. (aided by Danny Elfman's triumphant score, which I enjoyed, but found too intrusive at times: when the tension should have been built slowly and sickeningly to draw the viewer in further, Elfman sometimes brings it to a crashing climax far too quickly) It helps of course, that the village residents have the grizzled look of having stepped out of a child's fairy tale book, especially Burton favorite Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDarmid and Jeffrey Jones as some of the town elders. Burton even manages to sneak in a brief role from another favorite of his, Christopher Lee, who manages to be typically imposing and commanding, standing out even though he was in only a single short scene.Of course, Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch, and he manages to make the role of Ichabod Crane his own, filled with twitchy mannerisms and girlish squeaks. Crane may not be the typical action hero, but he is delightfully personified, and just quirky enough to work. Christina Ricci also gives a strong performance as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus (Michael Gambon) and Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) unofficial leaders of the town. Katrina appears to be the only innocent and pure character, yet with some undisclosed dark secrets of her own. Ricci pulls off the character believably, though she struggles with her accent at times. However it is great to see such classy actors as Gambon and Richardson as the mysterious unofficial magistrates. Both turn out excellent and dignified performances, though both graze the line of going over the top during some of the more dramatic scenes. Even Casper Van Dien gives a satisfying performance as a highly suspicious village resident. And of course, it's great to see Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman during a flashback sequence with his head on - Walken proves that he is truly one of the greatest actors still around as he manages to make his role utterly terrifying without speaking a single word. (although to be fair, his makeup does help add to the effect, but it's easy to believe he could have been equally frightening without it) The strong performances from the cast help the film hold strong during some of the weaker sequences, and really help make the film a success. Although, another major draw will be Burton's unique and creative set design and trait for really giving the sense of immersing the audience into a complete other world. If you are willing to forgive the occasional weak plot point, Sleepy Hollow is an excellent way to spend an evening, immersing yourself into Burton's dark world and profound imagination. This truly does seem to be the movie he was born to make.-8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's your head at?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before we begin with our analysis of this movie, let's have a look at the following list:a) directed by Tim Burton (check) b) starring Johnny Depp (check) c) creepy Gothic atmosphere and great fx (double check)Okay, if a movie (about the legend of Sleepy Hollow) contains the elements I listed above, you KNOW it can't go wrong. Especially Christopher Walken's appearance as the Hessian Horseman is brilliant. To sum it up: 'Sleepy Hollow' is not overdone, it's bloody and scary but you can have a good laugh at times, which only adds to the magic of Tim Burton movies. The best movies know how to keep the fragile balance between a total slash-fest (which it totally wasn't - POSSIBLE SPOILER: every time a head gets cut off, there's hardly any blood) and subtle humour. It's not laugh-out-loud but people, this is Johnny Depp. He's a genius, it's as simple as that. The way the tension builds forced me stay in front of the screen. I did not want to miss a second of it, and I'm sure you'll agree with me when it's your time to watch 'Sleepy Hollow'. You get sucked into the action and you'll feel the unstoppable need to join Depp's character on his mission reveal the truth.A real classic and must-see-must-have. Two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderfully Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a town in the late 1800's, at the turn of the century. Ichabod Crane is sent from New York to investigate a series of murders that have happen. All the murders are connected to the myth of the headless horseman, who cuts off all the victims heads.Once Ichabod arrives at Sleepy Hollow, you know there is more happening under the surface than just headless murderer. With red herrings thrown over the place, the mystery of the headless horseman and his murders becomes quite thick and entangled.If you are very accustom to Tim Burton films than you know what to expect. Like all of Burton's films, this is just visually stunning. The seedy greys create such a bleak and miserable atmosphere to great extent, giving the town and woods a very claustrophobic feeling. Burton's direction is flawless as usual, he is a master of his craft.Johnny Depp has created a great partnership with Burton, always giving a great performance. Depp handles the flaky yet over eager Crane with great fun. Ricci is perfect as the love interest, never overacting in places of danger. Gambon, Jones, Griffiths, McDiarmid, Gough all do well as the town elders.This is one movie where i didn't solve the ending. From the great script and plotting, this gives you clues, but never spoils the surprise. Which a find a welcome surprise. Most others you can figure it out before the end. I always praise movies that make me gasp at the twist.If you love Burton, or need a movie to get into Burton films, this is a great starting point, and is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a purist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I am an English teacher, I did not find myself at all bothered by the fact that Burton took enormous liberties with Irving's short story. The atmosphere of Gothic mystery that he created was astounding and he familiarized a new generations with a classic American writer. But what I loved about this film was the production values; I saw it on the big screen and thought that every single frame could have been made into a wonderful, individual picture. Now with the pause on DVD my theory has been proved correct. This is one of the most beautifully photographed, almost heart-breakingly gorgeous productions I've ever seen. Did anyone noticed the paint peeling on the window sashes when Icabod first arrives? Such attention to detail! I just wish the film wasn't rated R. This would be so perfect to show to my critical viewing class as an example of first rate production design, but we are not allowed to show any R's. I really don't think it should be rated R; it's not really that gory and the one sex scene is tame indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were superb in Sleepy Hollow with Depp adding a discreet, crumbling yet comical spin to Constable Ichabod Crane and Ricci giving her all as the white witch Katrina Van Tassel.Tim Burton has once again proved that he and Johnny Depp work well together and has provided the audience with a delectable delight that is also comical in places.Much to Johnny Depp's disappointment (yet much to the audience's delight) Tim Burton did not run with the idea of Ichabod Crane having the gnarled facial features that the novel suggests but instead finds the beauty in the character and represents it magnificently.However, I did find the effects (especially the ) bordering on disappointing. The did not look real at all and the decapitated head of Magistrate Phillips was clearly that of a dummy and was not as realistic as I would have liked.The gore is relatively tame and I honestly cannot see how it is an effective horror movie. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what genre, everything that Burton, Elfman, and Depp do is great, but when it's all three of them together, it's even better. Sleepy Hollow is no different. This is one of the very few horror movies that I found enjoyable. I liked pretty much everything about it whether it was the acting, the story, the directing, or the music, it was all great. My favorite thing about this movie is that it doesn't go for stupid jump scares like so many movies in the genre do. Instead of doing that, Burton focused more on making a movie that his audience would enjoy which is very rare when it comes to modern horror movies. Anyone who likes horror movies should see this as well as anyone who is a fan of Tim Burton movies. All and all, this is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp shines once again as the squeamish, but intuitive police constable Ichabod Crane, sent to the tiny isolated village of Sleepy Hollow by authorities in New York, to determine the identity of a killer, of three persons all found murdered the heads cut off.But as Crane arrives he learns the chief culprit is a headless horseman, killed more than 20 years ago, a butcher renowned for cutting off and taking the heads of the victims from the supposedly haunted village. Upon arrival, Crane finds that not only is the Horseman ruthless and bloodthirsty, but in order to commit the murders the victims need to be chosen, by a living person, who will stop at nothing to prevent the exposure of a secret that threatens the life of the local landowners daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). As the pieces come together murder strikes again, forcing Crane to admit the possibility that Katrina might not be all she seems, a secret that could threaten their blossoming friendship.With an excellent supporting cast including Micheal Gambon, Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken, Sleepy Hollow is the one horror film guaranteed to stay in your mind for all the right reasons</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt that at times throughout the entire movie that Tim Burton was being his deliberate just plain gross self which does bother me. There was no need to go completely overboard just to impress the younger horror crowd but he did and there you have it. Johnny Depp was good and the rest of the cast was the same. It also does not have much to do with the original story so if you are looking for a carbon copy of the old Disney classic keep looking you won't find it here. Icabod Crane is called upon to investigate a series of deaths in Sleepy Hollow and begins to suspect that the young daughter of Van Tassel is more than involved. The headless horseman is also an obvious suspect as everyone's head keeps getting cut off. A good twist ending is mandatory and is duly delivered. I may watch this one again sometime lord knows when that will be but I won't mind when I do.</fullReview>

His investigation because of his spirit which believed in logic , action and results, leads to covering a fact about van family.The viewer is bound to suspect many people as story revolves, but each time the point of suspicion keeps on moving and makes the plot interesting enough to hold your seat until yo finally come to know the unexpected villain, and the person who was behind all those murder !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Crafted with passion."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton really is one of the most important fantasy film makers of our time. He crafts his films with a passion that is absent from most other contemporary directors. Many modern day movies are addled with special effects and little else, but Burton has shown in films such as Ed Wood and in Sleepy Hollow that he is a good old-fashioned story teller who loves his art.Sleepy Hollow (based on the story by Washington Irving) is set in New York in 1799 and tales the story of the forward thinking Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who is sneered at by his colleagues because of his advanced techniques in detecting how a person died by performing autopsies. Don't forget that back then when a doctor cut up a body in search of the truth, they were seen as sorcerers!. Crane is sent by the Burgomaster (Christopher Lee) to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of killings in which the victims have all been ritually beheaded by what the superstitious locals believe to have been committed by a headless horseman. During the course of his investigations, Crane stumbles upon sexual deviances, old rivalries and witchcraft.Sleepy Hollow is very much in the style of the earlier Hammer films not only because it features two of Hammer's veterans in the cast, Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster and Michael Gough as Notary James Hardenbrook, but the set design by Rick Heinrichs and the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki bare all the style of that studios best films. Of course the violence is more graphic here because times have moved on since Hammer were the kings of horror. However, there is echoes of the style and poetry which make them great to watch forty years on here. There have been many rumours of Hammer making a comeback and if that did ever materialise, I think Tim Burton would make the perfect substitute for Terence Fisher as he displays some of that film makers qualities. Good characterisations, atmosphere and a welcome touch of intelligence to what in other film makers hands would of been pure sensationalist material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend Lives On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of classic horror films and after watching Sleepy Hollow it became # 3 on my top ten list of scary movies director Tim Burton took Washington Irving's timeless story and created a mythical yet mysterious tale with a new twist. In the original version Ichabod Crane, was a schoolteacher and now he's a constable investigating grisly murders. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who played the role of Ichabod very well and Christina Ricci was beautiful as Katrina his love interest. The rest of the cast did a superb job making the film a smash hit.The year is 1799, Constable Ichabod Crane (Depp)of the New York City police is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of bizarre deaths. Each victim has been found with their heads cut off, he stays at the home of Baltus Van Tassel (Gambon) and there meets Katrina Van Tassel, (Ricci)a beautiful young woman with ties to the supernatural. Mr. Van Tassel along with several other town elders believe that these deaths were caused by the headless horseman (Walken) who was a Hessian mercenary seeking revenge for his death twenty years earlier when his own head was taken. Ichabod thinks that there's no such thing as a headless horseman but as the bodies continue to mount up he gets serious and discovers there's much more to the story than meets the eye. When members of the Van Tassel household get killed he suspects the lovely Katrina with whom he's in love with is responsible. But it turns out that her wicked stepmother Lady Van Tassel, (Richardson) controls the headless horseman commanding him to kill people who are to blame for her misery. It's a race against time as Ichabod, Katrina and young Masbath (Pickering) try to stop the headless horseman and bring peace back to the once quiet town.For fans of horror I recommend watching Sleepy Hollow it's a thrill</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing to me. --It gets funnier every time I watch it. When I first saw this film in 1999 I was NOT expecting comedy. I didn't know the story of Sleepy Hollow and didn't expect Ichabod Crane to be a fool. I wasn't sure I liked the movie. Watching it again tonight I have a whole new take on it. Now I think Johnny Depp's cowardly and ridiculous Ichabod Crane ("Look! A chemical reaction!!") is one of my favourite movie characters in recent memory. I laugh at almost every line he delivers in the first half of the movie.Silly, lots of fun, and beautiful sets.Tim Burton's best after Ed Wood.</fullReview>

The main character in the movie is portrayed by the cult-actor Johnny Depp ("A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Pirates of the Caribbean"), who is excellent as ever. But the other actors are also great - Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee and the rest of the cast play very well, and Christopher Walken is the ideal choice for the murderous Headless Horseman. The story is action-packed, fast paced and will entertains fans of horror-movies, even if the film itself is not scary at all.

		<fullReview>I love this movie to death, it broke me into my love of horror films. I watched at the age of 9, with my sisters and friend. It scared the bejeebers out of me, but it still fascinated me, with all its gore. Tim Burton is a fantastic director, and knows just when to put a splash of blood or a pair of dead staring eyes. I still say that the most frightening-or at least disturbing-part is when the boy is hiding beneath the floorboards and his mothers head gets snicked off. Sleepy Hollow wasn't frightening in the sense of ghoulies and ghosties, but more in the sense that there is something lurking, that you cannot escape from it, and that the headless horseman is out for YOUR blood. So, basically, this is a fantastic movie, but you may not want to show it to your kids(or squeamish friends) quite yet...oh wait, it's rated 'R', isn't it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp, not Disney (and Burton)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based very loosely on the literary legend and set in 1799 New York, Ichabod Crane goes searching for a serial murderer who beheads his victims and is said to be a Headless Horseman who himself has no head. Johnny Depp is as usual well cast for this quirky role and there is good support from less well known actors (although the Headless Horseman is played by Christopher Walken. Interestingly, he looks a little like Depp). But this Tim Burton rendition tries to be very complex in plot and character with unusual and original spins, yet ultimately fails to deliver. The brave Ichabod inexplicably has certain phobias which do not play consistently and a troubled past that we can only guess about from his surrealistic dreams. The love interest is rushed - we wonder where Depp's character gets his passion. In a Showtime post-interview he talked about how he based Ichabod Crane on several characters from the classics and horror films of old. That comes through but finally fails in integration as does Burton's convoluted story. Effects and entertainment are there, but we are hoping for something more and we don't get it.</fullReview>

Christina Ricci is extremely easy on the eyes and the time period in which the movie is set makes the movie all that much mysterious. there's a serious twist at the end that keeps the viewer captivated. the story is very complex so this the genre of the movie can be classified under mystery /horror.

		<shortDescription>Stunning Visuals, Ominous Sets, and a Stark Reality make for a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton creates a masterpiece of visual intrigue. A modern-day film-noir that pulls together every element of film-making in a manner that would make themasters like Hitchcock and Welles jealous. Every bit of this films masterwork exists in the set design, art direction, cinematography and the haunting original score by Danny Elfman. This is not to belittle the efforts of the director and the actors, but to reiterate the fact that Sleepy Hollow drives on the visuals that create the entire feel of the film. The acting is worth note. The cast includes some of today's well known british actors. The villain, crafted by Christopher Walkin, is less than well acted but understandable as the character is limited which gave him little breadth to build more interest for the Hessian outside of him being headless. Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp deliver good performances that meld nicelytogether. The rest of the cast plays nicely and offers the feel of a fully integrated village society. Beyond that, several of the characters were formulaic, which is the films biggest problem. Another 25 - 30 minutes would have added moretime for the characters to be played as deeper and with more interest. Of particular note, are the ethereal and simultaneously stark scenes which are the flashbacks of a young Ichabod Craine. These offer further hint to the visual masterwork of Tim Burton. Clearly an Auteur and a master director, Tim Burton gives us what will likely be one of his greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie Sleepy Hollow is an interesting take on the old horror story The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow. The effects and sets are great. I love that dark sky brooding look of this film. Johnny Depp is wonderful as a complex Icabod Crane. At times he's brave and precise and at other times he's easily terrified and still at other times he's down right funny. The film itself mirrors Depp's character. The movie is scary at times and then it turns funny. It always stays in good taste though. It is a delicate balancing act that works perfectly! While this movie is first a horror film, it is also a bit of a mystery film too. I found myself, like Depp's character, trying to "discover" the perpetrator of the crimes. I also found myself trying to figure out the reason for the ghastly crimes. All in all Sleepy Hollow is very good. Maybe not classic material for me but, very good. I recommend it highly!! 8 out of 10</fullReview>

As usual Burtons visual style is very dark and gothic and once again he is working with Johnny Depp. Depp is fantastic in this film, he once again proves he is a very versatile actor and provides a faultless English accent and shows off his comical timing. Christina Ricci is also good as are the rest of the cast, particularly Miranda Richardson who is superb.

Johnny Depp at his best.This is the kind of movie whose graphic violence and horror is so beautiful and at same time terrifying.The comedy elements make movie more enjoyable.The only problem is that character of Ichabod crane played by johnny depp sometimes seems artificial, because at times he gets afraid of a spider and at other time he fools around the tree of dead with an axe whose mere sight can faint a man who gets afraid of spiders.Above all a masterpiece to be cherished.

		<fullReview>I went into this movie, having already seen Planet of the Apes, thinking that it was going to be another unsucessful Tim Burton movie, but I was surprised. Sleepy Hollow is strengthened by Burton's fantastic visual imagination and Johnny Depp's wonderfully pale performance. No wonder they always say "From the imagination of Tim Burton comes a new film..." because this "horror" movie could have easily sucked. However, this is a film more darkly beautiful and strangely humorous than it is scary. Miranda Richardson is the weakest part of the movie, and she makes the last 1/3 of the movie the worst part, but with an amazingly comic, out of breath Icabod Crane by Depp, and further strengthened if not outdone by Burton's images and the great score, Sleep Hollow can be considered a surprisingly addictive and enjoyable film. Sure, this is definitely not on the same level as Batman, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, or Nightmare Before Christmas, but for what it sets out to do, it does surprisingly well. The last third of the movie is silly, granted, but it's hard to hate this movie.My grade: 7/10</fullReview>

Johnny Depp does a wonderful job playing the role of Constable Ichabod Crane who is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the strange beheadings going on in the tiny town. He doesn`t believe in ghosts or spirits and is determined to prove that the killer is indeed human. Along the way he falls in love with one of the more powerful residents, the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who is a witch. Once he fights a battle against the Headless Horseman, and finally believes, it is up to him (with the help of Katrina) to stop the murderer. The acting was incredible and the plot was good, I liked that it kept all aspects of the legend alive but was still fresh and enjoyable. A definate must see. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* SPOILERS *Based on the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, this film sees Ichabod Crane (Depp), a bumbling New York Detective, sent to the creepy village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate murders. The problem is that Ichabod is a believer in logic, sense and reason and so he doesn't know quite how to react when he finds himself pitted against a ghost who rides around at night cutting off heads (and also occasionally spearing people with fence posts). As well as the investigation Ichabod starts to take an interest in the mysterious and enchanting Katrina (Ricci). But as Crane investigates he starts to uncover conspiracies and secrets that point the finger of guilt at Katrina and her family who Crane thinks had a sinister role to play in the murders. Depp makes Crane a dimensional character, who is not only pitting himself against a murdering, headless ghost, but also is fighting his own personal battles. Crane is slightly geeky, squeamish and scared but Depp manages to make him lovable. As Depp's co-star, Ricci plays Katrina, the love interest but like many actors who work alongside Depp, her character seems a little undeveloped compared to his. Katrina is cool, calm and quiet and doesn't really grab the attention or the emotions of the audience. The supporting cast includes many fine actors, who are a little wasted in their roles as the secretive townspeople, especially those who get their heads chopped off early in the film. The film is supposed to be scary however I don't think personally that it was. I felt that this was more of a light-hearted, tongue in cheek look at the legend. The overall atmosphere was eerie, thanks to the colour, texture and the foggy feel to the visuals but the action wasn't frightening in my opinion. This film had some wonderful comedy moments. Depp pretending to ride a horse during the investigation, some hilarious glasses, a whole lot of blood squirting on peoples faces and Depp trying to defend himself by grabbing at the horseman's neck! The special effects mostly good but at some moments they were almost cartoon like, the best example being The Western Woods Crone with her eyes bulging from her head and a snake-tongue and the terrible fake Cardinal in the woods. The scariest thing in this film was a rather creepy looking scarecrow, although the Killian family murders were heading towards being scary but didn't quite hit the mark. A few other problems were that the plot seemed a little rushed and it was maybe a little hard to follow at times.Despite not being horrifically scary this is definitely a film worth watching. Depp was extremely entertaining as Crane and he brought his trademark comedy moments to the role. The overall atmosphere of the film is eerie and there are some exciting tense moments especially towards the end. Definitely a film to see if you are a Depp fan or a fan of Gothic-style, Tim Burton films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a well-made underrated horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Sleepy Hollow" was an interesting movie that caught my interest and attention from start to finish. At first, I was hesitant to watch this film because of the what critics had said about this film, but I thought to myself that everyone should judge for themselves.I thought "Scream 3" was scary but with "Sleepy Hollow" I found a movie that equaled it. "Sleepy Hollow" did a great job of grossing everyone out by showing the severed heads and even the insides of he heads.This movie turned out to be an incredible murder mystery that tested the mind as to figure out what the real plot was. Furthermore, I enjoyed how Tim Burton maneuvered the cast into not revealing too much of the true plot until just the right time.My favorite scenes in this movie came when the headless horsemen came out of the dead man's tree. However, every scene in "Sleepy Hollow" was excellent and my favorite because it kept my interest as well as wanting to know what would happen next.Depp knew just what to say and when to say it. I was truly blown away by his performance.If I ever saw a movie that was underrated, it would be "Sleepy Hollow." I recommend this movie because it has thrills, chills, action and dramatic scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's darkest gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While some who are just getting to know Tim Burton through his beautiful sentimental epic Big Fish will be shocked, this will always be a core favorite for true fans of everything Burtonesque. In what I consider to be his darkest film ever, Burton delves deep into his lifelong obsession with everything gothic. In short, Sleepy Hollow is a salute to the Vincent Price and Hammer Horror films Burton viewed growing up (Good ol' Chris Lee gets a nod in his brief roll as the burgomaster). It is Burton's assertion that he can indeed make something on par with these classics. Sleepy Hollow for the most part lacks the humor of Burton's earlier ventures. Atmospherically, however, it is the pinnacle of what he always strives for with his work. The town itself has a brooding maniacal presence to it, steeped in shadow, that serves as constant reminder throughout the whole film that all is not right. The gore is delicious, with a tree full of decapitated heads and blood splashed artfully in the snow. Christopher Walken is terrifying as the human form of the horseman,Christian Ricci has never looked more beautiful, giving the likes of Barbara Steele and Ingrid Pitt a run for their money, and Johnny Depp, well he does his extraordinary Johnny Depp thing. This is great stuff. I give it a nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in about a year last week, and it made me realize what a great movie it really is. To truly appreciate Sleepy Hollow you need to watch it a few times and absorb the beauty surrounding it.First off, Tim Burton did an amazing job casting this movie. Of course everyone always loves everything Johnny Depp does, but his performance in this is one of the best of his career. Christina Ricci is a perfect choice, she has that ethereal beauty and the dark yet angelic aura. And having Christopher Walken as the horseman is awesome, because he is one of those actors who can be a real badass when he wants to. I also liked Jeffry Jones as the scandalous priest, for he always plays characters who are a little shady. And it was cool to see Casper Van Dien finally in a good movie! I liked him in Starship Troopers as Rico and he is perfect in this as the all braun no brains badass. Basically all th supporting cast enhance this movie and make it that much better.The storyline is fairly complex but not overly hard to follow. By the end you know what's going on, but you can still pick up on little things if you watch it a few times giving it some replay value in that respect. The dialogue is good but there are a couple odd lines and a few one liners that are kind of cheesy" i.e. "watch your head" or "your just in time to have you head cut off" etc. But for the most part, all the one liners are delivered well and are humorous.Overall the dialogue is pretty strong and witty.Where the film really shines is in the visuals. My god, this movie just looks so damn cool! Everything has an dark, gothic surrealism to it. There is a fall setting with fog surrounding the landscape at all times, and it is always dark and spooky. All the characters have pale white skin and everything in the scenery looks purposely fake, which is what makes it so cool. It's just so beautiful to look at and it really adds to the fantasy aspect of the tale that has elements of halloween, witchcraft, legends and lore interwoven throughout. It's almost as if your watching a play. This movie is the most visually satistfying movie I have ever seen. Its just art, plain and simple.:::some spoilers coming up::: This movie is also very badassed. There are some great death scenes amongst other background images you may notice. First of all, the scene where Cas Van Dien is cut in 2, man that was stylish. Second, when the Horseman stakes the guy through the chest, and drags his body so his head is just off the holy ground so he can lop it off, that was just genious. And the bloody kiss at the end was disturbingly hilarious. There were also little things that added to the nostalgia of the film such as the little boys spook candle that lit the room, or the flames that burst into a face when the horseman came, or the pumpkin headed scarecrow. :::end spoilers:::A lot of my friends hate this movie, and I always give them hell for it. Just don't expect it to be a horror film. It's more of a gothic fantasy tale with some black comedy. It's a visual extravaganza with the enhancement of great acting/casting, a good storyline, and amazing imagery, not to be missed. I give it 9.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is one of the favourite Johnny Depp films. He plays the sweet, yet kinda geeky character ichabod crane. In the story his character is supposed to be ugly and not very nice looking, but, Johnny Depp being an extremely gorgeous, changed this all though he tried his hardest! He is of course an amazing actor and he proves that dramatically in this performance, being the inspector on the case of the brutel head decaportations, not believing in ghosts or any sort of spirit, scared of spiders and has a tendency to faint a lot, i think he pulls it off well! The other characters include: Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffith and many many more! I really recommend this film to somebody with a strong stomach and has good taste!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>--A few possible spoilers--I saw this film on C4 last night.I was expecting a "hide behind a cushion" scary, horror film, but was pleasantly surprised to find Sleepy Hollow was completely watchable, without being boring, and still having a few great look away moments.Yet again Depp gives a stunning performance this time as Constable Ichabod Crane, brought to Sleepy Hollow to find a logical explanation for several murders which locals believe were committed by a headless horseman, determined not to believe the horseman rumours he sets about trying to solve the mystery.The mysterious, ghost-like, misty atmosphere give the perfect setting for this story. Combine this with some fairytale elements and a few funny moments (my favourite of which has to be either Ichabod's regular fainting or the expression on his face when he's hiding on his bed after realizing the horseman is real), makes this a very entertaining film.This would be a great film to watch if your looking for something that is not too serious or scary, which still contains an element of fun. Perfect for a Halloween night with friends.Watch this film if you like films which are a bit scary but still contain an element of fun. But be warned it does contain quiet a few gory moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton loves film-making and, thankfully, he and the production crew for Sleepy Hollow have created here a perfect blend of art and action that anyone can tolerate and enjoy. I pretty much forgot that Tim created 'Mars Attacks!' before this.An outspoken constable, smooth on theory but weak in practice, gets sent from New York up the Hudson Highlands to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate a series of murders.What's great about the movie, aside from the hauntingly beautiful town that was built, are the near-perfect casting of characters that inhabit and drive Sleepy Hollow. If you want a perfect example of a good Burton movie, this is it. We've all seen the familiar pursuit scenes before and there is a certain disturbing scene, that Tim Burton could not help but say, "One of my favorite scenes, don't ask me why." Otherwise, an entertaining feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie! I have always been a Tim Burton fan, and he doesn't disappoint. And, as is Burton's style, you see pieces of his other films in this one as well. There is a scarecrow that looks an awful lot like Jack Skellington, and bats appear throughout the film.This is the second movie that I have thought Depp cute in (the other being 'Edward Scissorhands'). And although I am NOT a Depp fan in ANY way, he gives a wonderful performance as Ichabod Crane. And unlike the reviewers, I thought Christina Ricci did a fine job as Katrina Van Tassel. From the moment this movie began I was swept away to Sleepy Hollow. I did not want it to end. This is the perfect film for Halloween. Make sure you see 'Sleepy Hollow.' Or the Hessian will come for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, yeah, the lights. Everybody should watch this movie, at the very least to have a look at the atmosphere and at the gothic, phantasmagorical and yet oddly bright light set around. Useless to say, it's a Tim Burton film, therefore this fact should not be too surprising, but still...(well, he's lucky, the progress of technique helps him out, that's quite clear). I love Burton's style. Maybe his way of telling stories is not very orthodox, in fact the plot of "Sleepy Hollow" is not always clear, but the magic is there anyway. Also, it is funny that he is classified as a horror film maker, when in fact it would be quite difficult to get creeps from any of his films. Everything in this tale is unbelievable, from the begining to its very end, and I mean it: nothing fits at all, it dances between a comedy and an umbalanced terror film and the music is too romantic to thrill anyone. But that's one of the nice points: why should it fit anyway? It is alright like that. Burton's jokes are funny, and, which is even better, are intellingent, shinny and beautiful. To look at the images is like going through a Friedrich's painture. It also has something of the old, forsaken beauty of Murnau. The actors look great in this big confusing weirdness. Well, not as if Depp and Ricci were bad actors! but they really do their job here; specially Ricci with her strange and slightly malicious innocent look is able to confuse the viewer until the end...which I'm not gonna tell you, basically because it is quite obvious. And you'll find Christopher Lee and Lise Marie around...you just have to seek for them. Jewels within jewels. Oh, and another note...why is the blood so red? This I never understood. It annoyed me a bit: it definetly didn't fit with the general setting. But, nobody is perfect I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie in my opinion was one of the best of 1999. I loved the whole idea of Tim Burton tweaking the story a little bit to make it his own. Johnny Depp is a delight as Ichabod Crane, he never seems to disappoint. If you are a lover for Pirates of the Caribbean Johnny Depp, then you will love his quirkyness in this movie. The movie is about the basic Sleepy Hollow story, except for a few Tim Burton twists, which make the film better. Had Burton followed the usual Sleepy Hollow formula, I don't believe that the film would have been as enjoyable as it is. He's one of the great storytellers of our time, and this film is another testament to that. The supporting cast is perfect, Christina Ricci is great as Catrina. And i won't ruin the suprise for others, but they couldn't have picked a better actor to play the Hessian himself. This movie is sure to be a favorite for movie lovers. It's just really fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think no one can ever inside the mind of Tim Burton but one thing is clear though : he brought us some of the greatest fantasymovies ever...from Batman to The night before Christmas till this thriller. We are in the 19th Century in a time in where Sherlock Holmes were arising but were still seen as the enfants terribles. Johnny Depp aka Ichabold Crane is sent to some godforgotten town at where he has to do the research for some mysterious murders committed by the headless horseman... No need to spoil the fun as the plot isn't important (it's even pointless) but the gothic atmosphere that is created by Burton is one that is rarely found... Sometimes breathtaking and once again a great Depp.</fullReview>

This movie does get really violent, but hey, it's Tim Burton. I say this is the best Tim Burton movie I have ever seen (Big Fish is a close second), some parts are a bit weird, but thats only a few scenes.

Each time I watch, I see something new and entertaining. Though bloody in content, I have been fascinated by the story, the characters and the cinematography. I loved the performance of all actors, each character being unique and no matter the size of the part a great addition to the story. Costuming, terrific period pieces that lent great highlight to the story. The backdrop for the story and the music both amazing, lending all that was necessary to make the story suspenseful. Fight scenes were many, varied and exciting and special effects were exactly that, special effects. I recommend this movie highly, with one last comment, it is gory and there is one sexual scene that is very sexual. No nudity but sexual. An amazing piece of movie making, I give it a 10 as I have watched it enough to determine it deserves that rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has done it once again with one of the most spectacular, stunning, and praised horror movies of all time. He is the master of storytelling and one of the best directors of our time. His movies are amazing and visually stunning. Edward Scissorhands was great and Beetlejuice was genius. Once again Johnny Depp and Tim Burton join forces. Not since Ed Wood have they been together. Depp plays a mysterious constable who has to go the old village of Sleepy Hollow to uncover the murders in the small town. The victims were all found with their head severed by the neck but their heads were not their when the victims were found. There he meets the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel of the high class Tassel family who are linked to the murders someway. The story takes off with the first decapitation involving an important member of an important family. The music by the way is composed by academy acclaimed composer Danny Elfman who has worked with Burton on such films as The Nightmare Before Christmas and Big Fish. The movie is acted well, has a spectacular story and one of the best endings of a horror film I have ever seen. Full praises to Tim Burton for accomplishing such a great feet. We owe ya one! 9.5/10!! Superb</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a wonderfully set film - you can feel what living in those ages must have been like. But two major flaws severely harm the movie. First, Sleepy Hollow starts as a "detective story". You wonder who killed the victims, how and why. And while your mind imagines possible answers, the filmmakers retreat to the world of fantasy - no evil plan, clever tricks or any of that. It's like if in JFK, Oliver Stone would have made Superman be the killer. Second, from time to time comical situations pop up. This totally ruins the atmosphere. You have Johnny Depp wandering around this dark place with a very serious facial expression, and the next thing you know, he is either standing on a chair for his fear of a spider or ridiculously splattering himself with blood. Therefore, I'd rather recommend to you watching From Hell - or Police Academy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Once again, Tim Burton has managed to create another visual masterpiece. Somehow, compared to his other movies (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and the new one, Big Fish), we aren't surprised. Tim Burton is an amazing artist, and when he has talented actors to play the characters, everything just seems to explode into a million beautiful pieces.Johnny Depp has amazing talent. He seems to breathe life into every character he plays. I watched Sleepy Hollow over and over again, looking for any traces of Captain Jack-ism's. But I couldn't find any. The sweet, almost meek demeanor of Edward Scissorhands does not exsist in this movie, and the rough exterior of Gilbert Grape seems to fall away. Ichabod is new and totally different. Thank you, Johnny.If you are reading the story by Washington Irving in hopes that you will know what the movie is about before you watch it, listen very closely: put. down. your. book. Just walk away from it, because Tim Burton has morphed it into something new. (And better, but that's just my opinion.)The ending: Like you can't already guess. It results in a spy-movie like speech by the evil witch and she sings like a bird. It's traditional, andslightly anti-climatic.Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie. Do yourself a favor and see it. I won't tell you who the Headless Horseman is (I think you can guess. No cheating by going to read the cast up at the top!!!), but it's fitting. Johnny and Tim have pulled off another one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in the very late 1790's, an investigator from New York City named " Ichabod Crane" ( Johnny Depp) heads to a quiet town called Sleepy Hollow to investigate strange murders conducted by a mysterious evil spirit named " The Headless Horseman", he also falls for the lovely rich girl " Katrina Van Tassle" ( Christina Ricci) and must stop the evil horseman.Tim Burton's greatest movie in my opinion next to Batman, it's a highly entertaining, bloody and stunning re-creation of the famed Irvin Washington story. Johnny Depp does a wonderful performance as Crane with Casper Van Dien, Jeffery Jones, Michael Gambon and Christopher Lee making wonderful appearences.This is one of my all time favorites, it's a scary sometimes unique horror fantasy movie with a great chilling score, good gore, great Acting and is a triumph for the director.Also recommended: " City of the Living Dead" ( a.k.a. The Gates of Hell), " Suspiria", " Adventures of Icahbod and Mr. Toad" ( Disney movie), " The New York Ripper", " An American Werewolf in London", " Phenomena ( a.k.a.

		<fullReview>----Probably Spoilers----This movie was really good up until about the last half hour. Christina Ricci doesn't really get to do a lot in her role, and she has some pretty terrible lines, but she still does all right. One thing that bothered me was the fact that it's set in a Dutch farming community, but everyone has a decidedly British accent. Johnny Depp is wonderful as usual, the most of the movie is pretty good, atmosphere and characters combing to make it good, although it's definitely heavy on atmosphere and looks. The last part is just god-awful. I don't know who wrote it, but Tim Burton should hunt that person down and cut off their fingers so they can't write anymore. Lady Van Tassle goes from evil to the woman with the world's worst one-liners, and the chase scenes make it feel like a cheap gothic action movie. Do yourself a favor and skip the last half hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>what can i say about this film? only that they took a perfectly good story and turned it into the most gross-out film that if people saw unedited, they'd be vomiting in a sec when edited for the violent scenes and the gore, then it's the most beautiful film that any pg rated holiday film audience 13 and up would see what else can i say, i usually don't like horror films that have a lot of gore [elm street , Friday the 13th, scream, i know what you did last summer,and the list goes on with a lot of gory films I DON'T LIKE] some of these films have gore and filth that even the audience member under 17 won't stand to look at because gory scenes are despicable they are too damned gruesome to look at Because the Youngest audience member will be dumb enough to try to look at the r rated gory scenes which are inappropiate for Younger audienceThis is the only spooky film that I'll watch , since it is a period piece,before i watched sleepy hollow the first time, i knew that the horseman I knew he was going to act nuts so Ichabod in the movie was having this chase for the headless horsemanI'm a fan of such movies as batman and batman returns but this telling of sleepy hollow has too much gore and not enough plot so i say a side thumb for gore and a thumb up for performanceand i enjoy watching it edited, i don't watch it unedited</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange, comical, creepy and delightful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ever reliable Tim Burton and Johnny Depp reunite for "Sleepy Hollow", a comical update of the Washington Irving story filmed in the style of the '70s Hammer horror films. It even has Hammer horror legend Christopher Lee in a cameo. I would never have thought Johnny Depp could possible upstage his strange performance as Edward Wood, Jr. in "Ed Wood" but he outdoes himself here as Ichabod Crane, man of science, and absolute sissy. I have no idea what inspiration he used for this performance but the way he delivers his lines is a hoot. Christina Ricci - what can I say? She plays her part very well and I found myself falling in love with her, although I don't think she pulls off the blonde look very well, it no way does it take away from her performance. Rounding out the cast are the usual Burton players and dependable genre character actors. Casper Van Diem acquits himself very nicely and getting Ray "Darth Maul" Park to play the Headless Horseman was a stroke of genius. I give this film 3.8 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!From the fantastic stylings of the ever-amazing Tim Burton, we are given 'Sleepy Hollow', the delightfully horrific spin-off of the classic novel by Washington Irving.Is it much like the book?Well, there IS a headless guy riding a horse. And a fellow named Ichabod Crane. And it does take place in a town called Sleepy Hollow. I think the similarity ends there.Is the movie still worth watching then?ABSOLUTELY!Though certainly not for the faint of heart, Burton does a fantastic job of enchanting us and horrifying us at the same time with some stellar performances by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, not to mention the fabulous all star cast including the Burton regulars... (i.e. Jeffrey Jones and Micheal Gough.) The visual aspects of the movie are spectacularly haunting, given Burton's choice of color, lighting, and scenery. And let's not forget the fantastic soundtrack by Danny Elfman. (I consider it to be one of his very best compositions, actually.) The film is, unquestionably, very gory... but Depp carries a very twisted sense of humor with him that keeps things surprisingly funny. Only Burton could bring wit and hilarity to decapitation. :)Get's the clowns_n_cookies 10 out of 10 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning masterpiece to an American classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most influential films of all time to me is Tim Burton's stylish, stunning masterpiece "Sleepy Hollow", a truly deserving film to an American classic tale. Tim Burton uses such amazing touches of dark lore and gothic to create a film so wrapped up in storyline and ideas, it will bring you back for a seconed time...and a third time, maybe, even a forth time (For me it made me buy the video and then later the DVD as well). I was so influenced by the film that I took a vacation to the real Sleepy Hollow, New York during the autumn season. But anyway back to the film. This film, based upon the old Washington Irving tale is done up to a 21st century realism, complete with a stylish story so puzzling yet so astonishing, I still cannot completely understand (Don't get me wrong, the films plot has many surfaces, you'll understand the first layer naturally but look closer a few more times and more will be revealed, *that's a true technique to a classic). Having worked with Tim Burton before with "Ed Wood", Johnny Depp is reunited again with Burton to play the role of Icabod Crane, not a simple school-teacher like in the ol' folk tale, but now a New York City investegator sent to the county of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate the mysterious murders of a supposed "Headless Horsemen" (The horsemen without his head was played by Ray Park (Known by millions as Darth Maul of Star Wars: Episode I). Christina Ricci plays the mysterious Katrina Van Tassel, who plays mixed emotions with magic and love to Icabod's head. The supporting cast goes on and on, and I will say that Burton is a master at casting people. I see no one at all as talented as Depp to play Icabod. Christina? Well...she could possibly replaced, but she knows what she's doing since she has a background for dark films ("Casper" and "The Adams' Family" are both in relation to horror even though their family related films). I tried to sum it as best as I could, but basiclly, I wrote this review in 2003, and to this day have not seen a film that matches it in style (The closet film to match it is 2001's "From Hell" starring...Johnny Depp!). So, simple reviews: Burton's best, Depp's best, Ricii's Better, A True American Classic, An Essential for any film fan. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a big favor and run (Don't walk) to your local video store to see it!Fun facts: -Ray Park plays the horsemen, but people know him better as Darth Maul (SW:Ep. 1) -The film was shot oddly, not in Sleepy Hollow, but in England. -The town was built from the ground up. -The Western Woods was completely built on a sound stage. -Martin Landau (Who played Bela Lugosi in "Ed Wood") makes a brief biref appearence then sadly dies (Try and guess how). -Not that it matters but Depp played a similar character to Icabod in 2001's "From Hell" which was about the Jack the Ripper story in which he played the investegator of the crimes (His character was like Icabod in 100 years from Sleepy Hollow (Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799, From Hell is like 1910's, or maybe 1890's...I forget) and also heavily into drugs. *It's like the twisted evil side of Icabod)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nearly two centuries after Washington Irvin's prose first gave American readers goosebumps, Tim Burton has succeeded in giving a new generation the willies on cool autumn nights.Burton and writers Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker take Irvin's classic American short story and flesh it out-much like a buried Hessian reanimated from the grave. True, they mainly use Irvin's story as an inspiration, not a blueprint; yet the end product is a film that provides a rich evening of entertainment and chills for today's audiences. Surely Mr. Irvin would have wanted it that way.Instead of a gluttonous, cowardly school teacher, intent on marrying Katrina Van Tassel for her wealth, Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a combination Quincy and Columbo, a late 18th century rationalist and reformer. He is a New York City constable, where his pleas for modern police and judiciary methods keep him in hot water. It is this that leads him to be sent to Sleepy Hallow, a quiet upstate hamlet where all heck has recently broken loose. If this modern scientific malarkey really works, the local brugomaster (horror great Christopher Lee) tells him, make it work in Sleepy Hallow!Intent on solving the heinous beheading of three Sleepy Hallow residents, Crane heads for the eerily foggy village and is immediately kissed (during a parlor game) by a blindfolded Katrina (Christina Ricci). He quickly gets on the locals' bad side by tartly scoffing at their claims that a headless Hessian soldier from the American Revolution has risen from the dead and is responsible for the deaths. His faith in reason and science will put sorely put to the test.SPOILERSIrvin's story, of course, used the Headless Horseman only as a tease. Anyone-even children-reading between the lines realized that bully Brom `Bones' Van Brunt dressed as the Horseman and attacked poor Icabod with a Jack-O-Lantern, scaring him away from Katrina and the Hallow forever. The 1999 tale, however, is no harmless fable of a greedy and incompetent schoolmaster. Here the Headless Horseman proves to be a real entity, raised from the dead by a local who dug up its skull and summons it by witchcraft to do his/her bidding.Burton weaves a wonderfully eerie Gothic tale of horror and suspense as Icabod sees his rationalistic beliefs shattered and overcomes a near nervous breakdown to vow to fight the demon. The cinematography and music are outstanding, as are the backdrops of the Sleepy Hallow and NYC buildings. A real 1799 feel is created by the intricate attention to detail. Even the gnarled trees and stumps in the haunted Western Woods are spooky. No wonder the original Icabod was spooked whenever he had to ride from lodging to lodging at night!Depp turns in his usual first-rate performance as the likeable but eccentric Crane. Facing painful, repressed childhood memories as he comes to grips with the supernatural realm, he shows outstanding depth. Ricci is wonderful as Katrina, lovely, steadfast and a tad mysterious. The supporting cast, including Marc Pickering as Young Masbeth and Miranda Richardson as Lady Mary Van Tassel, is marvelous. Christopher Walken, meanwhile, is quite memorable as the Hessian when he had his head. (In fact he is almost a more frightening figure than his headless corpse is!)A few delicious bits of humorous dialogue are slipped in. (Three would-be Horseman victims are warned to `Watch your heads' as they duck through a doorway to hide from the demon in a windmill. `Is he dead?' Young Masbeth asks after the windmill in which the Horseman had charged has exploded into a ball of fire. `That's the problem,' Icabod calmly replies. `He was dead to begin with!') Still, this is no horror spoof. It is a genuine chill-provider, with witchcraft, secret pacts, murder and betrayal around every bend. Other than Crane's occasionally anachronistic behavior (Entering an apparent witch's lair and announcing that he makes no judgments about her lifestyle is a bit of a stretch!), Burton and his writers succeed in capturing a 1799 feel to the movie.Overall, this is one of the most fulfilling, spinetingly horror flicks I have seen in recent years. Burton and the writers, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubeski, music composer Danny Elfman, and the rest of the cast and crew deserve a solid `A' for this effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not a fan of Tim Burton movies, but watched this anyway. Perhaps I missed the point but maybe this should've been called 'Scooby Doo and The Headless Horseman'! Whoever thinks this is a horror is clearly missing something and has not seen any bona fide horror movies such as The Exorcist, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Night of the Living Dead or Psycho. I thought the film was stupid, but decent performances from Christina Ricci, Richard Griffiths and Christopher Lee give it some credence. If you like Tim Burton, watch this movie, if not - give it a miss and watch a proper horror film or an episode of 'Scooby Doo'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like "SLOPPY Hollow"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All dressed up with no place to go. Sure, Tim Burton's "Sleepy Hollow" is absolutely gorgeous to look at, but the script is cluttered and perfunctory and there is no suspense at all. A great disappointment. This version takes a practically foolproof story and tells it badly. It astonishes me the way viewers will so frequently be duped by movies that look "cool" but have no substance, no vitality, no reason for being. The plot is by no means "complex" as some other comments have asserted, it's just badly confused. There is no sense of mystery, no sense of awe of the supernatural that made Washington Irving's source material so timeless. There is none of that here. Instead, we yawn as a series of poorly drawn, interchangeable characters get their heads lopped off by the leaden, mechanical horseman - a villain about as scary (as depicted here) as Prince Charles riding around playing polo at night. Then, once you see him without his horse, lumbering around in pursuit of victims on foot, you really have to scratch your head. How can Burton not know that the Horseman has to always be kept somewhere in the shadows and on horseback to function as a legendary ghoul and the stuff of nightmares? You put him right out in the open and he's as common and scary as a tax collector going door to door.The cast is mostly uncertain. That is the thing that stands out the most in bad movies: the uncertain, purposeless look on actors' faces as they struggle to find their characters' motivation; something, anything to grab onto. Christina Ricci does a lot of that here. She simply looks like someone who isn't quite sure. The child actor Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, Ichabod's young protege, fares even worse. Burton was obviously looking for someone (who looks quite a bit like he himself must have looked as a child, incidentally) with an unschooled quality, but one always gets the uneasy feeling when the boy's on screen that he's just as likely to wander over to some piece of film equipment and inquire "What's this do?"Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones? Stands around in the shadows during his brief time on screen waiting for scraps of boring exposition to be thrown his way. Caspar Van Dien? Completely wasted as Bram Van Brunt, who should be Ichabod's romantic rival for Ricci's affections and dark antagonist, but cluelessly marginalized here. Miranda Richardson, one of the most highly regarded actresses of her generation? Amazingly, she gives a terrible performance, with contemporary sounding line readings that are totally out of sync with the time period (1800).Then there's Johnny Depp as Ichabod. At least he is trying to have some fun with the part and doesn't sleepwalk through it the way he did so maladroitly in "The Astronaut's Wife". The prissy mannerisms, the always slightly ruffled air - there is a texture to his performance that at times fits nicely with the film's fetishistically textured visuals. This helps for a while, but he is ultimately hobbled by the weak, unimaginative dialogue he is too often given to speak and a character so diluted and distorted from Irving's original that his Ichabod appears to the audience as irreconcilable fragments, not a whole.I had wondered last year why this movie, which had such an enormous opening week, dribbled to a final U.S. take of only around $100 million. Now I see why. Bad word of mouth. In film after film after film these days, with their bombastic soundtracks, schizophrenic editing and overheated direction; I form the same image in my head as I'm watching them self-destruct in front of me: that of an incompetent clown flubbing his juggling routine badly but smiling out upon his audience just the same with all too eager eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointing adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hadn't heard much about this movie before seeing it so I was hoping it would be a period murder mystery. I was disappointed when the first overtly supernatural content surfaced. After that it became just another monster movie.The music during some parts of the movie was very annoying -- I kept thinking someone had turned up a stereo in another room of my house.I found the Ninja-style twirling of the weapons silly. The costume warn by the horseman, who was supposedly a Hessian mercenary, bore no resemblence to any uniform worn by Hessians, mounted or not, during the American Revolution.Depp's character seemed to vacilate from inept and bumbling one moment to bold and capable the next. There was no character development, he just fluctuated between Indiana Jones and Inspector Clouseau.The plot was confusing, too. There were too many characters and way to much needless bloodshed.</fullReview>

Not only did the music not set the mood right for each scene, but it seamed like the music was not even written for the movie. It just did not match what was happening on screen.I also expected this to be a spooky, maybe even scary movie and was vastly disappointed that not once was I put on the edge of my seat. This was mainly due to the music not setting up the mood, but also certain parts of the movie felt like the story was being rushed along.The final problem I felt was that Burton let the audience know what was going on to early. About the last quarter of the movie was boring since I knew exactly what was going to happen. I could not wait for the movie to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an awful film. I really don't see why others like it. The script, this so-called wonderful plot, failed completely! The evil witch practically had to TELL the whole story to the viewer so that he would grasp it! And what Depp had to speak out! "Interesting... very interesting..." he mumbles. It's just one of the many examples of the insane simplicity that disgusted me. Yes, simplicity. Depp's character has been sketched very rudely without any kind of "nuance", and so is that of the other actors. The childish arachnaphobia scene is a living proof of this. And the mistakes. I searched for sharp teeth in the Horseman's skull, but couldn't find them; a few seconds later, revived, the teeth were sharp as knives! Come on... The atmosphere had something Wizard-of-Oz-ish and also the same fake darkness in lighting and settings as Tim Burtons' "Nightmare before Christmas".Just Terrible. Worst film in months. This makes me almost desperate to see "the Straight Story" a second time.</fullReview>

Christina Ricci's character seems so false and irritating I kept wishing she would loose her head in her opening scene! Saying this, the story is very good and Christopher Walken plays the most amazing character, although he is seen all too briefly for my liking - not much work for a lot of money no doubt. Miranda Richardson is by far the best talent in the film, unless Walken had more screen time. The story runs well but it seems to have missed what it was aiming for and doesn't know if it's trying to be a comedy or a gothic horror, and in this case the two just don't seem to mix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dissapointment as a seasoned Tim Burton fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all those who have seen or are to see this film: I would like to say that I found this film to be a dissapointment in terms of other Tim Burton films that I delighted in with a sometimes dark humour. I found it to be choppy, the characters unbelievable and lacking depth, and also the style and production excedingly unoriginal. It seemed to me, at many times during the film, to be no different from many of the other special effects laden products from the movie factories of Hollywood. There were indeed moments of that Tim Burton sparkle, that was lended so perfectly in gems such as Beatlejuice or Edward ScissorHands. In Sleepy Hallow, I also found a definite lack of atmosphere that in Burtons other films was so integral and special. It was not the alternative reality of some time-caught present, with emblems of the glory days of post world war II America, for example. Nor was it a detail laden representation of some imagined time. The reality that he presents is far more story-tale like, yet, in a way that lacks the feeling of a true altenrate reality, lacks the feeling of trully being in the reality of the tale. Nor did Danny Elfmans accompanying music have the elevating and moving quality as in other Burton films, nor was it as memorable. So, it is with all this in mind that I warn those who are to see it to do so without expcetations of films past. And to those who have seen it, to go to the local video store and re-watch some of the Burton classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would watch this film again, but when I finally got to see it the first time, I was severely disappoints. The film is extremely sumptuous to look at and Burton's 1799 New York is remarkable, as are the torture chambers and the whole town of Sleepy Hollow. The acting, too, is uniformly fine. I would not expect Depp and Ricci to be speaking in accents, but the become almost unrecognizably absorbed into their characters, as do the character actors in support. Unfortunately, the way the plot spun from the pen of B-movie maestro Kevin Yagher, in which in ends up, in its last third or so, a lame revenge plot with by the numbers mistaken attribution, discovery, and resolution, that I thought were so trite that I really didn't care. Perhaps a more Brechtian acting style would have helped make it through this part, better, but the Delsartian performance of the culprit late in the film makes it silly. Adherence to Irving was thrown out the window as a given as soon as it was announced, but what sounded like improvements turned out to be Hollywoodization, with little sense of parody, other than quoting _On the Town_. In the story, Katrina married Brom van Brunt, who is here hacked in half by the Headless Horseman, though it is Brom who throws the pumpkin at Ichabod, something only hinted at on the last page of the story. It would have been nice to see more action from Ray Park's Headless Horseman when he's attacking, but we don't seem to get all that much, while by the end he's acting like a lame pastiche of Burton's own _Batman_ in a lame pastiche of James Whale's _Frankenstein_. Burton did that better when he was tongue-in-cheek in _Frankenweenie_.Unfortunately, this film resonated with me as all gloss and no substance, mainly due to the ending, because that really isn't the case, early on, even though it still could have used more depth. It seemed saturated with references to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead films as well, which would be okay if it actually did something with that. Burton also made strange choices as to when and when not to show a graphic decapitation, so that whenever one isn't shown, it seems anticlimactic. The torture chambers and maltreatment of witches seems to be more of introducing a plot point than trying to say anything. In short, were the ending less trite, this film would be a thoroughly entertaining, if relatively empty film (even _Batman_ was deeper than this). As such, it was a disappointment in several ways. This is Burton's most beautiful, but least meaningful, film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not very legendary adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great fan of Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks, so I looked forward to seeing what dark, creepy bent Tim Burton could put on this American literary classic. Well, dark and creepy it certainly is, but absorbing and powerful it unfortunately is not. This film promises a lot from the beginning, but it sadly fails to convert all the elements into a cohesive whole. The plot is tangled and clumsy and hardly does justice to the elegant legend of Ichabod Crane and his headless Nemesis. In the end it is scarcely of interest who inherits what and who is trying to bop off whom. The characters, apart from the very ?interesting' Ichabod Crane, played with just the right amount of self-parody by Johnny Depp, are dull and sloppily drawn and the film needs a good juicy villain to spice things up a bit and balance the ensemble. Depp is an inspired piece of casting and really makes this film almost worth seeing, although he limits his facial expressions to the fingers of one hand. This is however five more than those managed by Christina Ricci, who struggles both with her character and the period setting throughout and really looks totally out of place. The other characters are unremarkable. I am sure Tim Burton could have pulled something special off here, but he has a poor script to work with, and somewhere in this production he realizes it and loses faith. Even the themes of science vs magic, city versus country, reason over emotion, are introduced but never developed properly and the whole thing just peters out about halfway through. The film felt long even though it was well under two hours.The photography and the production design save it from total disaster, though. Both these are terrific, and the effects are gruesome but appropriate. Such a pity that the story and characters do not live up to the setting. As they say, fifty percent script, thirty percent casting, and then there's the rest. Well, the rest isn't enough here.Could have been, but isn't . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just recently seen the film here I have to comment.I went to the movie expecting a typical dark, gothic Tim Burton film....which admitedly it is in places...but what I didn't expect is to find myself (&amp; not just myself I might add) laughing, in probably the wrong places. Why? Simply. Johnny Depp is very very funny... where did he get THAT accent? Didn't realise he had such good comic timing! As for Ms. Ricci she was so so... not her best - see Opposite of Sex.Don't get me wrong.. I jumped out of my seat on a few occassions but came out of the movie wondering "was this meant to be funny?".. Well, I still don't know but I found it funny!

		<fullReview>I don't know much about the original legend but I hope that it's scarier than this movie. The film is gruesome - but that doesn't make it scary (in the same way that Sixth Sense is scary). The plot is the problem. There isn't much of a story to this film. Just a man on a horse riding around decapitating (lots of) people. I was disappointed by Christine Ricci's performance (I think she's great) since she-read-her-lines-like-she-was-under-rehearsed-and-it-was-all-she-could-manage-to-remember-them-let-alone-put-any-feeling-into-them.But the movie looks great. And it sure is gruesome! It's tongue-in-cheek and quite funny in parts - which can be confusing since you can be left wondering if the film is a horror movie or comedy - it's not a great example of either genre. But it's OK. A good date movie. Instantly forgetable eye candy. I gave it 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie was visually really good. That's about it, though. It was pretty bad, which is unfortunate because I like Tim Burton a whole lot. So, what was it that made this so bad? First, I was expecting some campy humor that's usually in Burton's films. There really wasn't any unless Johnny Depp fainting after every decapitation is funny. Also, it had this story that kept getting more complicated and more stupid the longer it went along. It was supposed to be about the head (no pun intended) of some family getting rich off somebody's will or something. I don't know, I just wanted to see the horesman some more after a while. The plot just lost me. But the biggest flaw perhaps, was that we the audience don't ever care about any of these characters. There was no emotion like that we've seen in the better Burton films. So let me sum up, cold and unfeeling, very violent, not funny, and a confusing story. We do get to see some purely Burton creations though like Johnny Depp's cool forensic toys and torture chamber flashback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: Spoiler follows.Why was Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in this story? Obviously, he is the antagonist in Washington Irving's story, but what plot function did this character serve in this film? He says maybe a total of five words before he is unnecessarily killed off. He does not even serve as a red herring, because no one could believe that he is the supernatural murderer.My guess (though I am not totally sure) is that Tim Burton liked the image of the headless horseman hurling the jack-o- lantern at Ichabod Crane. That was a nice dream sequence, but it was completely unnecessary to this film.However, since the film seemed not to know what it wanted to be, an alternate explanation is that this started out much closer to Irving's story, but got transformed along the way.</fullReview>

This is an ultra-violent telling of the tale about a headless horseman who rides through the countryside, chopping people's heads off at will. You get involved with the mystery that Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp)tries to unravel. At times you will be on the edge of your seat. Squirming is allowed and plenty of chances to do so. And once in a while you fight off a snicker or two. Tim Burton does his job so well. Special effects seemed real. This is probably not for small children.

He figured it all out but getting there was a stretch. You wonder how he could be a NY Constable. Christina was beautiful, well spoken and fit her part. Christopher Walken was as always a first class wildman. Most scenes I don't think he was really swinging the weapons but some looked like a real swordsman was and others seemed like graphic effects.

However, Irving's atmospheric classic was updated into a serial killer movie which is very 90s-like: loud, over-the-top and weak on characterization and plot. At first, it looks gorgeous but as the story gets increasingly thin and predictable, the movie's gorgeous look can't save it.

		<fullReview>OK, the film LOOKS fantastic. The scenes are almost always in darkness, there's plenty of fog and some breathtaking shots of the Headless Horseman going after his victims. Other than that, the movie is hopeless. The plot is, to put it mildly, confusing; the cast is surprisingly bad (even Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci!); and the film gets very unpleasant after a while (we are almost constantly seeing somebody's head lopped off). SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The plot is the main problem--none of the characters are clearly defined, Depp is real annoying, every single female character is a witch and it's very hard to follow (looks like there were huge chunks of dialogue edited out). They do pull it all together at the end, but there are still many unexplained characters and motivations (the witch in the cave for example). EVERYONE is bad--I never thought I'd say that about Depp and Ricci, but it's true. Also the scenes of people's heads getting lopped off gets very boring after the 8th time. Visually it's incredible though, and some of the scenes are really creepy. So if you're into visuals, you'll probably like the movie. If you want plot, character or depth--stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film has many positive points including of course the amazing production design, cinematography, and Mr. Depp's fine performance; it is marred by Tim Burton's lack of storytelling ability and serious script problems. Although I am a fan of Mr. Burton's film style, I cannot stress enough how constantly disappointed I am with his inability to create compelling and moving films. As he excels at the visual arts, Burton lacks the talent to create films that move you in the slightest way. Sleepy Hollow, as well as many of his other films, does not leave the viewer with a feeling of anything throughout its proceeding as well as after the film is over. Literally, it is washed from your palette as soon as you leave the theater. Completely forgettable. The film does not amply supply scares, excitement, humor, romance, drama, surprises, any emotion. A good film does not need all of the previous characteristics but it should provide at least one in good supply or a clever balancing of many. Sleepy Hollow is not boring but never is it actually interesting. The Disney cartoon made many years ago was more compelling. Mr. Burton is no doubt a very talented visionary but he does not move his viewers. I like movies that compel me to watch them a second time, Sleepy Hollow makes me sad that I even watched it once. 5 out of 10. PS- Ms. Ricci's acting severely lacked something to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen Sleepy Hollow and I think it is not only one of the best (and most imaginative) films of 1999, but definately Tim Burton's milestone film. All of his past films have done alot in filmaking, but this new version of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" had me speechless with it's dazzling acting, effects, art direction and action (not to mention an unbilled appearence by Christopher Walken.The story has Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp in a very deep acting role, as a constable from New York sent up to the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow. Where a ghostly figure named The Headless Horseman rides in the night be-heading people on his steed without mercy in his pursuit. It gets better after that with a mystery unfolding in a manner only suited for Burton.Despite some story changes from the original Sleepy Hollow story by Irving (and a usual ending as such in these type of movies) it never stopped to amaze me with its good ensemble cast, dazzling set designs, and visual effects. This deserves to be at the top of the scary films league (though as a horror film, it only makes it prudent with its head severing). A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow starts in the year 1799 in the small community of Sleepy Hollow itself where fear is in the air, Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau, uncredited) feels it &amp; he has every right too as he &amp; his son Dirk (Robert Sella) become the latest victims of a local legend the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) who likes to chop people's heads off... Cut to New York City where Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) has been given the task of travelling to Sleepy Hollow &amp; discovering the identity of the killer, determined to prove that the killer is flesh &amp; blood &amp; not a ghost Crane sets about his task. Once there he is invited to stay with Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) who fills him in, the community is steeped in superstition &amp; fear as the locals are convinced that the Headless Horseman has come back from the grave to claim victims. As heads continue to roll Ichabod investigates the case which leads him to a sinister plot involving greed, mistrust, murder, dark secrets &amp; revenge...This American German co-production was directed by Tim Burton &amp; is quite simply one of my favourite horror films from the past few years. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker is based on the novel 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' by Washington Irving, which I have not read so I cannot compare them, is fantastic. Everything about it works brilliantly, I love the mystery elements that develop, the character's are great especially Ichabod, there's plenty of horror &amp; a bit of romance, it moves along like a rocket, there's some good action scenes &amp; I just found it a pleasure to watch. Everything is balanced really well, it's obviously a fantasy film but things never get too silly. Put quite simply Sleepy Hollow is a most excellent dark Gothic fairytale horror film, it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. I really can't think of anything negative to say, I liked that much.Director Burton does a brilliant job as one would expect, the attention to detail is flawless, the period costumes, sets, background details &amp; locations all combine to create a fabulous atmosphere. Sleepy Hollow feels like the kind of film Hammer would have made if they had the money. The special effects are top-notch, from the Headless Horseman himself to the various gory decapitations of which there is a plentiful supply &amp; they must be some of the best, most realistic &amp; gory decapitations ever put on screen, good work. There is plenty of visual flair &amp; style plus there are lots of references to other films including a really cool homage to the original Frankenstein (1931).With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Sleep Hollow looks it, it's brilliantly made from the special effects to the action scenes to the overall production values. It was mostly shot in England using a strong British cast who all put in a decent shift. There's Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Iain McDairmid, Michael Gough &amp; Christopher Lee. I thought Depp was great &amp; endearing as Ichabod.Sleepy Hollow, in my opinion, is a brilliant film &amp; to be honest I can't quite put my finger on any one specific reason. I guess that everything works so well, the mystery, the horror, the immaculate period production design, the way it's shot, the character's &amp; the cast who bring them to life, the gore, the action &amp; even Danny Elfman's overblown score isn't as annoying as it usually is. This is an absolute must see so what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

I mean it's not a story where I can say this is one of those I will keep in my collection cause here you see and that's it. It's definitely not a must see but if you like horror visual effects this is for you. There were many bloody and violent scenes with rolling heads. I have to admit that the setting place was wonderfully built and created so the needed mysterious atmosphere. The special effects were real good especially the horse scenes with the rider and the soundtrack from Danny Elfmann was as usual great. The running time of the movie is just okay. I think this legend is more interesting to read in the book than to be translated in a creepy horror show. That's perhaps why there was no place for suspense and thrilling moments and this should be for me the most important elements for a big successful ride. For these reasons it deserves not more than 4/10. Too overrated on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems strange that I would be a Tim Burton fan, I think, because I've seen little of the movies which influenced him as a kid(the old-style horror and science-fiction movies) and am more of a fan of narrative fiction than he is(I can't remember if I've included this story or not, but here goes; I read an interview where Daniel Waters, one of the writers on BATMAN RETURNS, talked about how he looked forward to writing Burton's first coherent narrative, only to be turned around by Burton being the equivalent of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling Luke, "Use the force!"). But I think he's funny, visually inventive, and has surprising depth. I think he was the wrong person to do the BATMAN movies, but I've enjoyed all of his other movies, especially EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, which, by coincidence, both happen to be the movies starring Johnny Depp. So it follows I was eagerly looking forward to SLEEPY HOLLOW, their latest collaboration.For about 2/3 of the way, this was good. The look, as usual, was stunning, and he does a good job of creating tension, menace, and atmosphere. The five character actors playing the town's leading citizens(including Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones, who appeared in BEETLEJUICE and ED WOOD) add to that menace. The sound of the sword alone was scary. Christina Ricci doesn't get a lot to do, but she does look lovely, and looks appropriate to the period and the town. As for Depp, this is a parody of sorts from him; he's applying the Ichabod Crane of the original story and playing him as if he really were a police constable(If he had played it straight, the movie would have felt wrong from the beginning). This is most apparent in the scene where he's using gadgets to explain what is already obvious to the rest of the town.The problem, however, comes when it's time to wrap things up. One of the screenwriters here is Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote SEVEN. That was a serial killer movie with a difference, which didn't follow a traditional formula, but was disturbing and original. Here, however, we get the feeling that he felt, despite Burton's attachment and the story's horror roots, this was in essence a serial killer movie, and gave it a conventional ending. In retrospect, without giving anything away, the ending is logical, but it hangs on a couple of details which are barely on-screen, and is handled so flatly that the movie bogs down, just when it's supposed to excite us most. Also, some of the characters involved are so sketchy, the explanations about them feel last-minute to cover up weak parts of the story. If someone had found a less literal-minded ending, I think that would have worked better. As it is, it's a good film, but it's Burton's first non-BATMAN film I've had problems with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a long time Tim Burton fanatic, so my expectations for his latest release, "Sleepy Hollow", may have been a little high. Overall it was a great movie. Cinematically, "Sleepy Hollow" contains everything one might expect from a Burton film: gothic landscapes, brilliant uses of color, and eerie characters. Johnny Depp (as usual) was amazing as Ichabod Crane and an incredible supporting cast helped to add to the overall effect of the film. Also, the CGI horseman and tree were not terribly overused or bad looking.The film's serious flaw was the introduction of a villainous witch towards the end, who, to make the story short, gave a classic James Bond villain type monologue (a "You are going to die anyway, so now I will spill the beans" type thing). From this point on (thankfully only the last 15 minutes or so). the film spiraled downward. The second flaw was the lack of background knowledge of the characters throughout the movie. Sure, Mr. Depp summarized generations worth of family history in a few minutes, however it was hard to follow.All in all, Burton fans and regular movie goers alike will most likely enjoy "Sleepy Hollow". While a good movie, those into the films of Mr. Burton will see that "Sleepy Hollow" does not rank near the top as one of his better films.</fullReview>

What makes me angry about this movie is how a great setting (the spooky forests of main?) and story are being used for a cheap horror flick. It is the same as if a criminal story about a murder in a locked room is solved by having a murderer that uses deathrays through the wall. The movie always takes the easy way. It seems as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas how to solve their problems and just went for the ghost that can do whatever it pleases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, expensive twaddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre relies on atmosphere and a certain amount of shock. Sadly, many directors rely on gore to get their popcorn guzzling audience to sit through their work. Tim Burton is an interesting director but he relies also on visual excess to cover up that his films often lack a plot. Sleepy Hollow is as its title suggests - a yawn. Granted, the production design is spectacular, a delight to the eye, there is cleavage to delight the soul and lots of British thespians to delight the brain, but there is little else. I was not chilled or thrilled by this pretentious, expensive twaddle. Loosely based on the Washington Irving story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the film is badly miscast with Johnny Depp in the role of Ichabod Crane (one wonders what Jeff Goldblum - closer to Irving's idea of Crane - would have done with the role). Depp puts on some sort of accent while everone around him is touring the British Isles with theirs and Miranda Richardson has an inexplicably American twang which disappears from time to time. Christina Ricci is wasted - she does not even get good frocks, only a billowing cape, the frocks are left to Miranda Richardson who gets several costume changes, some mad-woman histrionics and a bit of rumpy in the forest (why - don't ask). Burton and his plotters play around with the original story and add some modern bits because hip, hop and happening audiences like their costume dramas with current references so they do not get lost. An uncredited Martin Landau gets his noggin lopped off at the start and then it's on, for young and old - axes fly, heads roll, Miranda glares, push up bras strain, Danny Elfman's score goes over the top, the British thesps think of the money they're making, swallow their pride and the whole thing ends with a blatant rip-off from "The Moonspinners" and "Terminator". This movie goes on and on and on - I can tell you there are few words you can make from the letters in the Exit sign. I cannot spoil the plot for you because there isn't one and the revelation about the Van Tassells cheating the Van Dammes because of the Van Halens by stealing from the Van Goghs is so convoluted and uninteresting that I concentrated on the cleavage. Incidentally, there is some sub-plot about Ichabod Crane's mum floating in a forest (dream sequence) which is a hoot - primarily because the actor playing Depp as a child is the weirdest looking kid (think Uncle Fester's love child with Monica Lewinsky) and an obscure symbol involving a red cardinal (bird). My bottom went numb watching this and the entire cast and crew should be spanked for their crimes against intelligence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I hated this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really tried to like this one.I went in with no expectations. I ignored Johnny Depp's incredibly bad accent, his profoundly trite and exaggerated mannerisms and his hammy one liners. I dismissed the disjointed plotline and superficial characterization.About half an hour into this movie I heard the dulcet tones of someone snoring in one of the rows behind me. I thought to myself, how rude! At that point I was still under the impression that this movie had some hidden substance it was about to unleash on the audience.Tim, you're a bad bad lad. How could you rob me of my $7? I'm very sure Tim Burton fans will like this, but this movie will seriously make me reconsider ever paying to see a Tim Burton work again.The only thing which saved the movie a little maybe was Christopher Walken as the deranged face and Ray Park (Darth Maul) as the deranged stunt body of the villain. Even then Burton managed to film the action sequences with such little originality and such a heavy hand on the 'dark is cooool maaan!' lever on his camera that the action was forgettable at best.So what do we have? Forgettable action padding miserable plot, all wrapped up in misty 'dark is coool maan' shades.Horrible.</fullReview>

One person I saw the movie with said he hoped it would be snowing when we left the theater so he wouldn't feel guilty about wasting our time.There was no plot. At the end of the movie they tried to create a plot by using a series of flashbacks as one of the characters explains the movie.

		<fullReview>Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman gets a few new twists in a screen adaptation directed by Tim Burton. In this version, Ichabod (Johnny Depp) is a New York City detective whose unorthodox techniques and penchant for gadgets make him unpopular with is colleagues. He is sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders, in which a number of people have been found dead in the woods, with their heads cut off. Local legend has it that a Hessian ghost rides through the woods on horseback, lopping off the heads of the unsuspecting and unbelieving. Ichabod refuses to believe in this legend, convinced that there must be a logical explanation for the murders. In time, Ichabod becomes smitten with a local lass, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who is the sweetheart of the burly Brom Bones (Casper Van Dien), and he becomes determined to capture the murderer to prove his bravery and win her heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hm, could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie has some fun parts and nice idea's but overall I don like it. Now question is why? I had feeling that scenes are not connected, as if they had been cut off (part where man is siting in tower and watching on the field, you hear shot and next scene he is running in the forest), acting is a bit shallow, and overall idea was badly executed. It would be better if we had more time to get to know characters that were beheaded. Now i know this is horror movie but its always better if character who dies has some background. Atmosphere is a bit stretched, like there always has to be fog in unrealistic forest, I actually don't know how to describe feeling that i got form outdoor scenes in movie. What do I like. CGI is really good especially near the end of the movie when raider puts skull back on his neck. I must say i was impressed by that scene. Fun part was when Crane was hit in the head with pumpkin. And these are all memorable scenes for me.It is not on my list of must watch movies but if you are looking for something to "kill" some time then feel free to watch Sleepy Hollow, but don't watch with too much expectations, like me, you will probably get disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fans of Tim Burton can do a lot worse than watch this film.Johnny Depp puts on one of his amusingly patented, cowardly heroic performances, as Ichabod Crane, the skinny pale weirdo detective from NYC, solving the headless horsemen case. As isolated dreary Sleepy Hollow, the town that surrounds him, is as strange &amp; secretive as Ichabod &amp; the Headless Horseman himself.Good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion. Christopher Walken puts in one of his patented weirdo performances as the Headless Horseman! Short, sweet, &amp; vicious! God love him! The script is fine for the chewing. The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen. A rich tapestry of dark hues &amp; shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.A great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night. "Sleepy Hollow" will charm you, thrill you, &amp; make you laugh! Heads up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-viewing all the Burton films i originally hated is working so far!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow Re-viewing makes a lot of difference!! 2/4 stars I used to despise a lot of Tim Burton's movies thinking they were just not my cup of tea in fact i actually found a lot of them quite boring. That however was my views a few years ago and after re-watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which also has Johnny Depp and Tim Burton once again teaming up, it got me thinking that maybe i should give Burton's films another run in the park as most of them i only viewed once anyways. Well the first one that i saw and hated was the movie here in question that being Sleepy Hollow. I knew the general storyline from of coarse having seen it before but also from the timeless Halloween story of Ichobod Crane and The Headless Horseman.Needless to say this was a ' 2 times a charm' sort of scenario cause i was actually was quite surprised how quickly i got into this film. For those of you who haven't seen it or know nothing of the time old tale in storybooks, Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) a very timid (yet always acting braver then thou sort) is sent to the eerie little town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders that have a certain serial killer feel to them as the killer's tag seems to be lopping off of their heads and taking them with him as unusual trophies. Crane is soon to learn that a majority of Hollow's townspeople generally believe the be-headings are result of the famed Headless Horseman. Crane doesn't believe any of this of coarse that until he has a run in with the famed killer himself.Glad i re watched this as i am now in love with Burton for not only his directing style but also for the fact that his backdrops and sets for the different scenes are so realistic and gloomy (From what i hear a lot of Burton's own Gothic rituals are the reason this is so) He is definitely a master of his craft bringing a lot of age old stories to life through visuals and CGI. I have also noticed he seems to like working with actors that he has used in a lot of his other works as well. A stellar cast included in this one such as Christina Ricci (Who i find personally very underrated) who plays Katrina Van Tassell, Michael Gambon (Baltus Van Tassell) and last but not least(in a non speaking role) the always great Christopher Walken (as the fabled Hessian Horseman) Walken's performance is the best in this film as they have his teeth filed down(not really of course) to emit razor sharp fangs add some eerie contacts in his eye also incorporating his own wild styled hair and the end product is quite a belieavble Horseman (the scenes when his head is on of coarse)An enjoyable film that just certified that i should be reviewing a lot more of the Burton films i originally had a distaste for!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it just after a my work day and getting into dark woods like this made me sleep. It was all the more hard to resist as Depp isn't a first class actor at my eyes: he acts rather like C3PO: stiff, not much expressive or warmful. Then, the crime story is a bit hard to follow, all the more than the names are too much alike. In addition, the original angle told at the beginning (science and reason vs lore and magic) isn't really used after.At least, it's a Burton's movie so you can find very good things as well: the sets and production are wonderful if you like new england, mist and Gothic. Danny's score is a good one. By then, you could still find Lisa Marie in fantasy clips, not really useful to the story but cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We need to use our brains"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout the course of the 1990s Tim Burton established himself as a cinematic brand. The audience expects certain things from a Burton movie ? hallowe'en-horror stories, meek and sensitive heroes, dark and twisted imagery, and of course Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow contains all theses things, and was one of his most prestigious productions to date. As such, its box office success was a foregone conclusion. It's real value as a movie however is by no means guaranteed.Burton's pictures have sometimes been described as fairy tales for adults. This is all very well in itself, but does Sleepy Hollow really need to talk down to its audience so? The frequent gore and sex suggests it's not aimed at kids, but it's given the simplistic overlay of a children's film, only without the charm. One of the weakest aspects is the series of flashbacks to Ichabod's childhood, which are simultaneously boringly clichd and too wildly hysterical to be taken seriously (not to mention the slightly disturbing fact that Lisa Marie's cleavage is continually hovering over the young Ichabod's head). With inventions like this Burton and his writers are presumably paying homage to the B-horrors of the 1960s, but really they just seem like a trashy and charmless copy of something that was endearing despite its trashiness. The dialogue meanwhile ranges from trite and insipid to frankly ignorant (1800 was not a new millennium!) Of course in movies like this atmosphere is often more important than plotting, but in Sleepy Hollow the atmosphere is laid on so thickly ? and with so little imagination ? that it becomes virtually meaningless. For the opening shots of a letter being sealed, the imagery could hardly be more obvious if Burton himself had popped up on screen and said "Red wax? looks a bit like blood, doesn't it, eh?" The special effects are too cartoonish to be properly horrific, but not enough to be comical. When we see the horseman's flesh re-growing, he dips off the screen, presumably so the shot can be changed to allow for some stupid waggly tongue special effect ? as if that makes any sense whatsoever.Burton was such a reputable figure by this point that he always secured big names for his casts, and if nothing else Sleepy Hollow contains some really wonderful players. Michael Gambon brings some gravity to his role, and I'm always glad to see Miranda Richardson, even if it's only that she still shows occasional flashes of "Queenie" from Blackadder II. But it's also a shame that so many of these excellent players don't get to show their full potential, mostly through the weakness of the screenplay or a simple lack of screen time. It seems a particular waste to have Christopher Walken in a part where he doesn't get to speak, or even really change his facial expression. But just as the supporting players are disappointingly underused, the leads are disappointing full stop. Johnny Depp was clearly trying to go for something a bit different with his fussy, slightly effeminate Ichabod Crane, but he makes for a rather dull and uninspiring hero. Meanwhile Christina Ricci's acting is only marginally better than that of the dead tree.I can't deny that Sleepy Hollow at least looks good. The beautifully stylised cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki sometimes evokes the graininess of early cinema, at other times fills the frame with shadows while still keeping everything in clear definition. But nice as it looks, this is nothing more than high-class gloss for this dry twig of a movie. Sleepy Hollow features everything one would expect from a Burton picture, and all the lavishness that goes with a director of such renown, and yet it contains very little else of substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad to see there are at least a few kindred spirits out there who were also disappointed by this movie, but far fewer than anticipated. After watching I honestly expected to come to the IMDb page and see a rather low rating and a page full of reviews wondering just what in the sam hill Burton was thinking.To be fair, I grew up loving The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, especially the impeccable Rabbit Ears version narrated by Glenn Close. Still, while I certainly knew this was going to take liberties with the story, I had no idea just how many, and how drastic they'd be. And please don't tell me I should have expected this because Burton's been doing it for years. I've seen plenty of Burton movies before, not all of them are dark slightly humorous Gothic macabre slashers. For every Sweeney Todd (which obviously is similar to this, but so is it's source material), there's a Big Fish.I knew the Horseman was actually going to be a killer, that wasn't a surprise. But the first shock came when we go to New York City. Ichabod Crane is a Renaissance inspired constable? Are you kidding me? The guy's supposed to be a timid bean-pole of a traveling school teacher. Whatever, roll with the punches I told myself.Cut to Sleepy Hollow. Hmm, I notice there isn't any sunlight for the third scene in a row, I have a feeling it's going to be like this for the rest of the movie (suspicion later confirmed). Are we really going to pretend it's always cloudy just to set the mood? I hate it when people use techniques like that; if you can't create an oppressive gloomy atmosphere without washing the color and light out of everything don't bother. For a particular scene? Sure, but I know you can do it without easy tricks like that Burton. And of course in the very last happy 15 second scene in NYC the sun is shining bright; "how symbolic!" I cried with the utmost sarcasm.Next we were introduced to the Horseman himself via flashback. I'll not beat around the bush, I hated this depiction of the horseman. A superhuman Christopher Walken with the hair of a 17 year old snowboarder and freaking fangs? He looked like a strung out Troll Doll going through withdrawal. I won't deny I chuckled, Walken always amuses me and I figured this would be the only time we saw him since there is no actual ghost. I assumed Burton was just having a little fun with a one-off exaggerated flashback. I was mistaken.When it turned into murder mystery mode, I did begin to enjoy it again for a time. Once it became clear there were actually supernatural forces at work though, that the killer wasn't one of the townsfolk (not directly anyway), I'd just about had enough. The entire original story is about how people get freaked about by old wives tales when they're combined with spooky atmospheres, even though it's all fake, but now not only is the horseman actually killing people, he's actually a ghost too? As Cris Carter would say, "C'mon man!" None of this is to mention the dreadfully unnecessary and rather hokey special effects. In addition to all of the mind numbingly gratuitous beheadings (and seriously what was the point? We get it, you're not afraid to show some gore. It gets boring after the seventh time) there's also the completely random scene with a witch wigging out while acting as a medium. Did Sam Raimi stop by the set for a day? And while we're on the witches, whose bright idea was it to make Katrina an amateur sorcerer? So random. And the reason for the minister betraying his friend's trust is that he sacrifices his beliefs for lust with a witch? Where did you buy your book of clichs Tim?Oh well, I've certainly seen worse movies, but what a let down. I was very excited to finally see this, an esteemed director adapting one of my favorite childhood stories in a big screen treatment. He turned it from a delightful spooky little yarn about post-colonial America into a ridiculous over the top fantasy film about a serial killer chock full of cheesy effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tricky thing, updating these old, well-known stories for a modern audience. Stray too far from the source material, and you lose a lot of the spirit of the original work. Don't change things enough, and...well, you probably won't make very much money. Which brings us to Sleepy Hollow. A very well-known, American story. How does it fare?Well, it gets Burton-ized. Tim Burton leaves his fingerprints more heavily on some movies than others, and Sleepy Hollow is one of those movies. It only resembles the original story in name, location, and villain, and the rest is heavily influenced by...whatever the rest of Burton's work is influenced by. If you like that idea, then you'll like this movie. If you're tired of his visual style and cinematic signature, then Sleepy Hollow won't change your mind. I didn't feel like the tone really fit what Sleepy Hollow "should be", but that's just the result of a preference on my part, not necessarily a flaw. I can appreciate what Burton did in updating the tale of Ichobod Crane and the Headless Horsemen, but it didn't connect with me as well as I hoped. I was expecting more of a horror movie, and Sleepy Hollow isn't frightening in the least. Still, it's not bad. &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I like Tim Burton, and I am fond of the timeless story, I was eager to see what this 1999 film was like. I also grew up on the Disney classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman creeped me out so badly when I was little I thought I would never see the day when I would see that topped. Now after seeing this I think I just have. The Headless Horseman is terrifying here, Christopher Walken does a phenomenal job playing him. I do agree that the story does drag on occasions, but plenty makes up for that minor fault. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is amazing, like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, the sets and cinematography are dark and Gothic, and the special effects are wonderful. Also Tim Burton I think was the perfect choice for director, he is oddball and eccentric and that directorial style is perfect for this film allowing him to give a clever, unique and atmospheric take on the story. The music score by none other than maestro Danny Elfman is dark, suspenseful and haunting, like it should be. The story is a true timeless tale of horror, and really well structured here, as is the nuanced script. The performances are excellent once again, with Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as the maverick yet intuitive Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci fine in a poignant sort of way as the lovely Katerina. Solidly supporting them all the way are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths. And of course the film is full of cruel shocks and thrills, the murder scenes are shocking and violent but not in the sense that you have to look away. Overall, very unique and beautiful take on the tale. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a period horror film released in 1999 and marks the third collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. After making Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, the teaming of Burton and Depp has become one that works wonders. Loosely based on Washington Irwing's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the film takes the story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman one step further.The first thing about Sleepy Hollow is it's elaborate, haunting and eerie set design. Tim Burton is best known for giving an eerie turn on everything he makes (Recall : Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Yet another Depp/Burton film). Sleepy Hollow already had elements of horror in it, Burton's task was to make it worth remembering. The use of fairytale music is prevalent in this film. Indeed a lot of its background score comprises the music from a music box or a doll house. The setting is silent, yet it screams. The town of Sleepy Hollow is always covered in fog. The woods are silent apart from the occasional brush of leaves underfoot. However, the excessive use of blood, like in his later Sweeney Todd is required to make the film what it is for the crisis comes from someone who does not have a head and who excels in chopping off others'. The horrific image of the witch, the sight of dead eyes through the floorboard, a sarcophagus spilling out its contents; these are what make Sleepy Hollow a work of art. The tree of the dead, with blood dripping from its roots uncovering what is hidden within its trunk will make one squirm in the seat. The cinematography is worthy of praise.Acting in the film is top notch. Everyone convincingly plays scared, and even tries to be a hero. None more so than Johnny Depp. One can understand his situation when he hides behind his blanket in bed and says,'It was a horseman, a dead one. Headless!' The flashbacks of Ichabod Crane are done marvelously. The echoes and imagery in those particular sequences are outstanding. Sleepy Hollow is probably the finest piece of cinema Tim Burton has made to date.9/10. Watch it alone, at night. The Horseman cometh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp saves a sleepy and hollow fantasy flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite a creepy atmosphere and a likable and amusing performance by Johnny Depp as the squeamish Constable Crane, Sleepy Hollow isn't as enjoyable as it has the potential to be due to too much conspiracy and not enough of anything else.Ichabod Crane believes in using scientific methods to uphold truth and justice and is sent to the isolated farming community of Sleepy Hollow to detect the murderer who has been beheading victims. This will put his methods to the test. A test he presumably fails, as he is faced with the truth that the supernatural exists, and the stories that the villagers tell of a ghostly headless horseman coming to kill them is proved true. A shame, because a scientific solution to the inbred community's superstition looked like it would have been an interesting plot. And while Depp's constantly scared performance is entertaining, it doesn't make much sense for a man who is a policeman interested in cutting open bodies. And for a man so intent on fact and reason, he very quickly changes his tune when he sees the headless horseman and is suddenly an expert on ghosts and magic.Everyone, even those not part of the conspiracy at the centre of the plot, acts suspiciously and guilty at all times, and the conspiracy, filled with too many red herrings and half uttered statements, is very hard to follow. Also, the villain is unfortunately easily guessed from the billing order. As for the headless horseman, he is strangely treated sympathetically, despite having been a mass-murdering loon in life, and a brutal assassin in death who kills at least one, possibly more, victims without orders.Christina Ricci gives the worst performance of the film as the bland love interest Katrina, trundling out her lines as if she has no idea what they mean. It comes across as if Ricci, a normally vibrant actor, is deliberately sabotaging her role as revenge for being cast as such a dull character.Sleepy Hollow is funny, exciting and scary when it's good, but too many dull characters, an irritating sleepiness to important events and a needlessly convoluted plot get in the way. For a film based on a short story in which the headless horseman didn't even exist, the writers have gone far too over the top to come up with a replacement narrative. This would be one to miss if it wasn't for Johnny Depp giving a career-best performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark, repugnant, gory film.....probably Burton's worst effort, in my humble opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a coroner for New York City in the late 1700's. He is constantly chiding the other coroners that scientific means should determine the cause of a person's death, not what first impressions may dictate. Consequently, the others send me him to Sleepy Hollow, New York, a Dutch-heritage town in upstate New York, where three people have been decapitated. The most ghastly facts are that their heads have not been found and that a "headless horseman" is the one responsible for their murders. Ichabod scoffs at that idea, for he believes there must be a reasonable explanation for the murders. Of course, he is determined to bring the murderer to justice. But, once he gets to the town, he sees the horseman himself, in the act, and he is horrified. Now, four people are dead and. more importantly, how can this supernatural killer be stopped? Ichabod meets a bevy of folks to hatch some ideas, among them a beautiful, wealthy young lady named Katrina (Christina Ricci). Katrina tries to provide Ichabod with clues, even as others in town work to help him find the answers, too, for everyone lives in fear that he or she will become the next victim. Will Ichabod be able to end the killings? Now, first let me state that I believe Burton to be a great film director, as evidenced in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Mars Attacks, among others. However, Hollow is dark and repugnant and, I believe, his worst film. It has an abundance of bloody scenes that are not scary, just repelling, and it has little comic relief, save for the fact that Depp faints from time to time, when things go badly. Yes, the art direction is quite good and so is the cast, including Depp, Ricci (looking very lovely), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Walken, Jeffery Jones, Lisa Marie and other talented players. Yet, even they can not rise above the film's dark themes and gory scenes, all of which leave the viewer feeling tremendously cheated out of a good tale. I do not feel it does justice to the original story and it certainly will not please any movie viewers looking for a rousing spine-tingler. The best advice I can give is, if you like the cast and/or Burton, go ahead and see what you think of the results. As for me, I am dreadfully sorry I watched the film, as its excesses are most depressing indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another successful collaboration of Depp and Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is set in 1799, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a policeman in New York City who is different from his colleagues, he is far ahead of them in using science to solve crimes and not just using inhumane methods that the police in this time favour. His superiors send him to an isolated farming community called Sleepy Hollow where a series of gruesome murders have happened, victims have been found without their heads. The town council members tell Crane that a headless Hessian horseman is responsible for the crimes but Crane doesn't believe them and thinks it is a person alive who has killed the town's people but his beliefs are soon tested when he witnesses the headless horseman killing the Magistrate (Richard Griffiths). Crane carries on and finds a conspiracy that has been going on with the town council members who are now being killed and Crane must find the horseman's head to stop the killings.Tim Burton immediately sets the mood of the film by making it very dark and Gothic which he always seems to be very good at doing. Danny Elfman helps Burton's direction with his music which just adds to the tension in the film.One of the things I like about Johnny Depp's character Ichabod crane is that he is not your stereotypical hero, he is completely different from any other hero you have seen on film before. He is not macho, he is squeamish, he faints and is very eccentric compared to everyone else but it is only Depp that can make you watch a character like that and not be turned off by his feeble qualities. We see flashbacks of his traumatic childhood where his father was this fearsome man of God and his mother was a free spirit who was murdered by his father because he saw his wife as an evil witch.The film keeps you guessing till the end. There is the secret that connects all the town council members and the victims of the horseman, the audience find that out in the middle of the film but it is also who is it killing the town's people? Is it an evil spirit or someone who is using the headless horseman to get their revenge on these people? There is misdirection about who it is, Burton puts a red herring in that it is Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) till we find out at the end, it is Katrina's stepmother (Miranda Richardson)who wanted revenge on the Van Garrets and Van Tassels who threw her family out and the people who stand in the way of her getting what she wants.What is good about the end is Depp at the beginning of the film starts off as a loner but at the end of the film he has a family, Katrina and Young Masbeth (Marc Pickering) who share two things with one another, they have no living family left and have witnessed the events of Sleepy Hollow and who can never tell anyone else as they won't be believed especially in that time so can rely on one another as they have bonded over the horrors they saw in Sleepy Hollow.Another interesting part of the film is that Crane uses science techniques that are unheard of in that era the film is set but it shows him as someone who has a modern approach to solving crimes, very much the way they are solved today. I have never seen this before in a period film and I think it was a good touch to show how brutal life was before the science techniques came into force and how people were bullied into signing confessions using brute force and torture back in the past.The cast are amazing. Christopher Walken scares the bejesus out of me in his make up and looks so menacing as the headless horseman.The special effects blew my mind, especially in scenes where it looks like a character has actually been decapitated and the scene where the horseman gets his head back and you see all the veins, tissue and skin building on the skull till the transformation is complete and you are looking at Christopher Walken, back from the dead. The writing by Kevin Yagher/Andrew Kevin Walker just makes this Ichabod more better and interesting than the other films which have featured the Crane character. I would also like to mention the Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and Film Editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron who just helped to make the film first rate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Optical significance of science, witch craft, sound, and color.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an analytical version of an old wives tale. Generally what you can not see hence understand quickly brings fear or hesitation of the unknown. Where even a story of a witch, or a headless horseman can make even the most logical person cringe in the middle of the night in a dark forest.This story appeals to me because there is a princess of Sleepy Hollow. This princess is interested in charms and spells to help people while she is signified as a natural witch with the use of visual drawings with pink chalk, which is the most basic form of witchcraft. The story uses scientific theory to help explain phenomena that is either rare or very odd within society. Thus the villain of the film upon the climax makes for an interesting subject.Movie props in the film which emphasize optics include the over-sized magnifying glasses, contrasting colors of white and red during suspense (suspense bringing senses to a more heightened awareness through the perceptual vision), the two sided cardinal and cage,the use of the pentagram and other witch craft items. These use of cinema is in contrast to the real less defined phenomena of phantom senses when shared by twins as the villain of the film admits her guilt. I am also interested in how the Doppler effect and experimentation at the site the confession within the windmill plays its role with crude static electric generators.Frankly, I am suspicious of Christopher Walken in this film and how the casting was selected and his friendship with Robert Deniro because he stared in Johnny Angelheart as Satan. These guys are probably casted and picked on purpose because like in Americas Most Wanted they need to be watched. How they got involved in the film industry like Sinatra in the music industry. That's scary stuff. Home grown character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton's greatest is the last one before the downfall!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard great things about Sleepy Hollow for years, but felt i was too young to watch it, but over the past few years i really got into classic Burton, Mars Attacks! Batman and Beetlejuice being the finest of them. A chance to watch another film of Tim Burton pairing up with Johnny Depp, probably the greatest, most underrated actor of all time still, stood ahead of me when it was to be shown on TV, and as a fan, i knew a Gothic horror film with lots of decapitations made by the greatest duo in Hollywood ever was impossible to miss.Set in England, the story follows a police constable going to a secluded English village to explore the mysterious beheadings said to be done by a fabled Headless horseman. This is all the story that it needs, though there are a lot of flashbacks, but what you need to know is that this is an extremely violent, camp, Gothic and funny. With hilarious decapitations, random horse chases and even a guy getting chopped in half and another one getting impaled and dragged through a window before being beheaded. A great cast, both English and American, makes this silly little Gothic romp one of the greatest films of our time, if your a fan of black humour, and if you like Tim Burton i guess you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As we all know, Tim Burton is a master Director and if you have seen some of his earlier works, like Edward scissorhands or Nightmare before Christmas, your familiar with his kind of Gothic style. It's wonderful. The way he does the telling of the story, the way he puts his own style in his movies is always excellent.I mean, everything, absolutely everything, is perfect in this movie. The lights, the effects, the amazing music by Danny Elfman and, of course, the actors.Johnny Depp does a great job as constable Ichabod Crane, the man who faints 6 times in this movie. The town's elder people is also geniously played, and Christina Ricci shows some acting talent. But, there is one actor who's not that good, especially not compared to Depp, Ricci and the others, and that is Miranda Richardson. I don't think that she's any good in this movie. But even though it's one of my absolute favorite movies. Even though it can be a little tricky to to remember who's who the first time you see the movie, see it. over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i was not a Tim Burton fan before i watched "Sleepy Hollow" but i became one immediately after. I have seen his Batman and liked it, but I don't think its better than SleepyHollow in any way. The eerieness, the suspense, the narration are in no way inferior to any of Burton's previous movies ( not to mention Danny Elfman's haunting score). I would say SH is the best of TimBurton's lot and one of my favourites.The best thing about the movie is, you never suspect that the horseman is a ghost until you are more than halfway through the movie. All appearances of the horseman are excellently choreographed.I especially liked the scene where the watch guard(Masebeth Sr.) is killed. The ending was not perfect but it was good. People who liked Batman better or disagreeing with me in any way please quote your reasons.P.S.I watched this movie twice on the same day and five times till date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gossamer darkling Gothic masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Burton/Depp combination has really paid off with a truly chilling top notch production.This is by far Depp's best work (until the 2003 release of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, that is), and I have had to completely re-evaluate my opinion of his talent.This, the latest remake of the old classic, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," briefly entitled "Sleepy Hollow" is a true masterpiece of Gothic horror. Burton showed us what sinister darkling treasures resided within himself with his initial production of "Batman," and his liberal use of Gothic architecture throughout the city of Gotham. I LOVED that single installment of the Batman franchise strictly because Burton knew what to DO with the Dark Knight. Well, he knew what to do with Sleepy Hollow, as well. The performances by all involved were wonderful, the sets and designs were awesomely constructed and executed; and the direction, camera angles, shots, film quality, and even dialog were absolute perfection.Overall, this is a marvelous endeavor which I have enjoyed watching over and over.Additionally, Johnny Depp "adopted" Goldeneye, the one-eyed Andalusian horse who played Gunpowder, Ichabod Crane's steed, thereby saving him from the glue factory. Just thought I'd mention that. It raised my estimation of the man's character a bit, upon reading that here at IMDb.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aren't there movie doctors out there? Is that what an editor is supposed to do. But maybe guys like Burton are so revered that the studios can't do even the slightest fine tuning on their projects. This film just needed another set of eyes and it might have been great. But what starts out as a marvelous premise gets quickly lost in a not so scary storyline that has to resort to heavy duty gore to keep you from becoming Rip Van Winkle. Depp is great as always, as the meek but courageous police inspector Ichabod Crane who is sent upstate to investigate a series of bizarre murders. I really don't have a problem with mutating the classic tale in this case, as I said, it really looked promising. Burton serves up a wonderful feast for the eyes as far as set recreation, and mood photography. He goes for the dark look, if you can believe it. Almost every exterior shot is done in shadowy steel blues, grays and snow. So much for the Halloween angle. It doesnt snow aroud here until Thanksgiving. But again its not the typical Burton Hades cinematography, but the really dopey story which if it must be original, has to be better. I think a guy with Burtons vision would have been best off just making a Legend of Sleepy Hollow, and putting his signature stamp on it visually. His signature stamp storyline is more often than not, pretty forgetable and hardly an improvement on a literary legends work. Keep it simple Tim and people might stop laughing at you. Look for Christopher Walken as the maniacal Headless Horseman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tim Burton on His Game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love that Tim Burton. In "Sleepy Hollow", he has taken the Washington Irving novella and rewritten it for the screen. Irving fans find this a sacrilege, but the story is not nearly as important as the storytelling. This is a Burton film remember, and the sets, lighting, costumes, and props all create an incredible visual, almost palpable environment. A Hudson Valley town circa 1800 via Gothic Mittel Europa. The visual atmosphere is cinematic perfection. This alone is worth the price or a ticket or rental. And the acting; Depp and Burton work very well together and this is no exception. Depp's Ichobod Crane, now a forensics detective instead of a schoolteacher, is just the right mixture of satire, false bravado, and fear. Christina Ricci is sexy and mysterious as his love interest/adversary. And an unbilled Christopher Walken, as the Headless Horseman, takes his role to the top, but not over. I won't go into the plotting, except to say that outside of the title, locale, and the Headless Horseman, little is recognizable from the original story. But who cares? "Sleepy Hollow" is Burton at this best, and is well worth a visit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp get together, magical things happen. Depp proves, once again that he is the best actor of his generation and maybe one of the best ever.. his versatility is perfectly exposed in this movie, as he gives life to Ichabod Crane.. a character that fills the screen with his light, well reflected in a disturbed young man that manages to gatter an incredible amount of natural charm, using only his naiveness.. As for Tim Burton, he can take you to another world, literally.. the amount of darkness that this man can apply to a picture is, by itself beautifull.. he has a unique way to make everybody look misteryous, especially Depp. The two seem born to work together, just hope they do, much more in the future. Sleepy Hollow is a perfect tale, made for those who feel dark, but still innocent...dark angels..like Ichabod Crane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton's output has been a bit hit and miss, but he is always stylish and interesting, and 'Sleepy Hollow' is certainly both. While I was a bit disappointed with it on my first viewing (cinema, original release), re-watching it a couple of years later I enjoyed it much more, and could ignore its flaws, and just have fun. I must say it also looks MUCH better after his 'Planet Of The Apes' debacle!This is one sumptuous looking movie which oozes atmosphere. Burton has gone on record as being a major fan of Mario Bava, and this movie homages him on more than a few occasions. Johnny Depp gives a mannered, campy performance that doesn't (for the most part) irritate too much, Christina Ricci looks lovely and mysterious, and the two are supported by a smashing cast of first rate actors, including Michael Gambon ('The Cook The Thief His Wife &amp; Her Lover'), Miranda Richardson ('The Crying Game'), Michael Gough (the Batman series), and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones ('Ravenous'), plus cameos from horror legend Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, and a well cast, wordless Christopher Walken.A very enjoyable romp with wit, chills, and more gore than you would expect.

		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of thous films that you think "What the hell?" before you watch it, and after you see it "Cool!"SpoilersThe film version has almost nothing to do with the original version, and while Irving's short-story is an American horor classic I couldn't understand what the hell was going on through most of it. The story centers around Constable Ichabod Crane (Johny Depp) as he goes to the small farming vilage of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of decapitations. At first he refuses to belief what the community heads (notice my word usage) say that the victoms were kiled by a phantom horse man with no head. After an incounter with the goul he is more than happy to belive it. Crane has also developed a relationship with the HEAD farmer's daughter, Katrina Van Tassle (Christina Ricci). During an incounter with the horseman Carne makes a discovery that it is controlled by someone else. After a series of suspects Ichobod discovers Katrina's step-mother Lady Van Tassle (Miranda Richardson) is the one who is using the horseman to get back at thouse who hurt her before in life. Eventually they send the horseman to hell along with Lady Van Tassle and they all live happily ever after.Most of the acting, aside from Depp's, is pretty crummy, but, since this is a Burton-flick, the visual styles are increadible. Danny Elfman's score can be over-the-top at times, but not unbarible.I give SLEEPY HOLLOW 8/10SLEEPY HOLLOW is rated R for alot of very gory head slicing and a scene of brief, wierd sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie to watch along with the Halloween movies around Halloween time. The scenery in the movie is cloudy and gloomy; dead trees, leaves on the ground, no sounds of nature. The best part is when the horseman went in and out of the Tree Of Dead. I just had to watch that in slow motion(I suggest you do the same). The only thing i didn't like is how you didn't really get to know the names of the characters because they didn't say their names that much and they got hacked to death. I also love when Icabod first comes into the house and Christina Ricci is blindfolded dancing around singing "The Picatine Witch, The Picatine Witch, Whose got a kiss for the Picatine Witch." I could watch this movie over and over on gloomy days. I gave this movie 10 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

When murders begin in the small, isolated town of Sleepy Hollow during the late 1790s, eccentric and squeamish constable Depp is sent to investigate. His investigation is further complicated when he develops affections for town local Ricci who, along with assorted others, believe that the crimes have been perpetrated by the mysterious Headless Horseman. A perfect vehicle for director Burton which is made apparent in his numerous decapitations and trademark for dark, lavish set design, but the film also boasts rich performances and a good sense of humor. Very entertaining, if a bit too complicated for its own good. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of the best horror pictures that I have ever seen. It is very good that this movie won the Academy Award for art direction. Everything really looks like how it would have looked back in the 18th century. I thought that sky looked really cool. It was all gloomy and gray and kinda foreshadowed what would happen. Creepy stuff. Johnny Depp plays young Constable Ichabod Crane, an unbelieving skeptic who believes that for every murder, there is someone of flesh and blood behind it. But, this time, he may be wrong. People are being decapitated in the small woodsy town of Sleepy Hollow that the townspeople believe to be the handiwork of a legendary Headless Horseman. Now, Johnny Depp gave us one of the best performances of his career here. This was a great movie that wouldn't have been the same without him. I really like his wimpy accent that he puts on. It really sounds authentic. Christina Ricci is also great as Katrina Van Tassel, a young girl with secrets to hide. The Horseman really looked cool. In the flashback scenes, we have Christopher Walken playing the horseman in an uncredited role. And the only words that he ever really says are "Ungh" and "shhh". There is also some really graphic violence. Beheadings galore. If you are one with a weak stomach, then maybe you should hold off on this one just a little while longer. But if you don't have a weak stomach and still haven't seen this movie- SEE IT NOW! And after you are done with this film and still want something more, then check out FROM HELL. That movie is a little similar and is also played by Johnny Depp. I also liked Casper Van Dien in this movie. He is a great actor that we don't see enough of. The opening sequence is cool, where we see a Pumpkin-headed scarecrow looking in on an unsuspecting man. SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of the best movies of its genre ever. If you haven't yet seen it, go see it now. You won't ne disappointed......5/5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could this have been played more tongue-in-cheek? It's taken me a long time to get around to finally viewing this, and it was well worth the wait. Starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, Sleepy Hollow is about a town haunted by a headless horseman who is on a rampage, killing, by decapitation, various members of the village's community. Ultimately, it's not particularly deep, and serves as little more than a gothically gorey whodunnit, but it's the panache it's carried out with which excels this above the norm. Depp plays it for laughs wherever he gets the opportunity, positively thriving on the b-movie concept and hamming it up where possible. He really is outstanding in this. Ricci plays a more serious role, and while she performs more than adequately, she still looks very young. She's supposed to be in a role befitting a young woman, where she appears to be a teenager. But suspending your disbelief helps in these cases. The movie is thoroughly entertaining, at times very funny, and occasionally gorey, but never off-puttingly so.Great stuff.</fullReview>

The acting is beautiful, especially Christina and Johnny's. There were some I did not care for- mainly Caspar (wooden) Van Dien- but they get killed off quite satisfactorily. And while it would have been nice to see Johnny and Christina's characters enjoy each other, the prim and proper attitude is much in keeping with the tone of the film and proves that one can still have a good movie with chaste main characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just wanna to say I thought "The tree of the dead"is the most coolest of the movie.I loved all the Gothic aspects of the film it has the best of Tim Burton it is like "Nightmare before Christmas".The story works as an ancient ghost tale like the one we heard from childhood.It's so great and creepy the moment the headless horseman appears in that eerie forest.I also find shocking the scene where he kills that young family.The best sequence of the movie is of course when the horseman disappears mysteriously by getting inside that creepy tree.I'm so in love of Johnny Depp(I enjoyed all his films except the awful "the astronauts wife")He shows in Sleepy Hollow that he can be a great comedian and once again he proves he looks handsome in period costumes!.Notice Chris Walken ugly teeth...he is the most beautiful "dead man" I'd ever seen(I'm joking!!!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gorgeous Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>^*^Minor Spoilers^*^ I adored this movie. Directed by Tim Burton, this film draws you in and holds you until the credits go up. The setting is beautiful and intricate in very detail, right now to the last severed head. The cast works together nicely, especially the town elders. Johnny Depp's scaredy-cat hero wannabe interpretation of Ichabod Crane is both effective and amusing to watch (he faints at least three times in the movie), and Christina Ricci was perfect to portray the mysterious Katrina Van Tassel. I also think a good deal of credit should go to Marc Pickering who played Young Masbeth. I enjoyed his performance of the young but considerably braver servant of Crane, who volunteers to help Crane after his father was murdered by the Headless Horseman. Danny Elfman delivers yet another beautiful score that is intense and hauntingly eerie, especially during the flashbacks to Ichabod's mother (Lisa Marie). Overall I give this movie a 9/10...a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good combination of horror and suspense, but pretty graphic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young constable with a very scientific attitude is sent to Sleepy Hollow, a small village, to stop a series of beheadings there. The townspeople are quite sure that the killer is the ghost of a brute which was killed some decades ago.The story is really nice, an exiting mixture of "who's done it" and a spook story and I enjoyed it very much. The acting is above average, Johnny Depp version of a young, scientific constable fighting for a fair justice, based on facts instead of torture is convincing. The villagers look as you would expect them - few handsome people, most look really awful - and the village don't look like Hollywood at all.The special effects are really great - the headless horseman is really convincing. But they are a little to graphic, too much blood and shocker scenes. The movie surely does not need so much gore.If you are not afraid of seeing dead bodies and blood, look this movie. The story and the cast is worth it, even if it is graphic. If your stomach is too weak you will miss an interesting movie with action, horror, love and suspense.</fullReview>

The cinematography of Sleepy Hollow, captivates the audience, and portrays just the right mood for this horror, thriller, comedy. Kudos to Johnny's over the top performance of the forensics scientist Ichabod even though the acting may falter in some scenes (esp. the fainting). An all-star cast from both Europe and America, very talented. This seems like Tim Burton's ode to the classic Black Sunday by Mario Bava on terms of mood and setting. Some jumpy scenes and an awesome headless horseman makes this movie a winner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the tradition of Hollywood, a remake of a classic is something to be respected and admired. And Sleepy Hollow has no lack of this. Tim Burton has put together a stunning cast of great talents to recreate the forbidding evil of Sleepy Hollow. Johnny Depp is a great actor, who can individualize every one of his characters with such distinction, it is magnificent. Christina Ricci is once again venturing into the horror genre, now with more experience behind her to back up her terrific performance. The supporting cast was familiar and powerful, especially Christopher Walken, and I definitely recommend this to fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately, there has been no good horror movies. All the so called horror movies have had basicly no story, and bad teenage caracters who really suck at acting. OK, watching one or two of them might be ok but after a while they are all the same. So as I walked around the video store I looked at movie after movie but there was nothing that really appealed to me. But then on the top shelf there was Sleepy Hollow, it looked different from all the other horror movies so i hired it. That Day I sat doun to watch it and it keept me intrigued the whole movie. Even though it probley wasnt the most realistic movie, I didnt laugh or comment onece that there was somthing stupid or unrealistic about this movie. Thats because the movie was so wel l made that it made you belive that there could be a headless horseman for that houre and a half when you watch this movieWell any way the movie starts of when Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy hollow to investigate three murders that have occurred over the last fortnight all three victoms were decapitated. When he gets there more people get decapitated and the people in the toun belive it is the headless horseman. But Constable Ichabod Crane dose not belive them untill he sees the horseman with his own eyes. Now with the help of Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) and Young Masbath (Marc Pickering) he must find out who controls the headless horseman and in what significant order the horsman is killing in!You may ask me why I think this is the best horror movie ever, well because it has a great story line, its got great actors and its the most intriguing horror movie I have seen. Overall I'll give it 10/10!</fullReview>

The acting is excellent by Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp (who I must say, looks sooo hot in this movie), both are fit for their parts perfectly. This is the kind of movie you want to rent while having a sleepover, or on holloween. The ending may surprise you, and some parts may be just plain gross (cough, cough, the church, cough, cough), but you will never be bored watching. There is always a surprise around the corner you might not expect. Things pop out at you in this movie, and that is great to have. Tim Burton has showed his best work yet! Its an excellent film, and my favorite movie of all time, with some of my favorite actors. SEE IT TODAY!My rating for this movie: 10/10!! Its great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every frame of Tim Burton's successful 1999 film version of SLEEPY HOLLOW is a keeper. Bathed in dark, dank colors, it is one of the closest attempts an American film has come to showing an alternate twisted world, ala THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.What's also a treat here is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Icabod Crane. He's an introverted crime solver, a quirky loner with his own little crazy nick-naks for solving a murder. The rest of the cast is a great too. Okay, Christina Ricci looks too much like a goth chick stuck in 1799, the year the film takes place, but, so what. Lisa Marie (then Mrs, Burton) Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough (Whom I hope wasn't as sickly in real life as the character he depicted) Christopher Lee, Martin Landau (in an unbilled cameo) Miranda Richardson and Casper Van Dien bring it all together.</fullReview>

I literally dropped my mouth. The dialogue was superb and the mood was perfect. It wasn't a movie to cause you to have an unsettling stomach, rather it saved you from that. The way the heads were cauterized wouldn't upset you to see, believe me. I could actually eat my snacks and still keep my eyes glued to the screen. And shooting it in blue film, how ingenious! It gave the look something that made it very unique from other films. I can't sum up how amazing it was in 1,000 words. So take my word for it, if you love all genres, it's right there in a movie with great acting and delightful filming! Please see Sleepy Hollow, if you haven't already!</fullReview>

Here is the story thanks to Chris Makrozahopoulos.Inspector Ichabod Crane of the New York police arrives in the small village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to solve a mystery of murders. With all the victims found with their head missing, everybody in Sleepy Hollow is talking about the ghost of the "headless horseman" who is out in the woods, seeking revenge for his murder, many years ago. Crane, believing only in logic refuses to believe the public's theory about the horseman and begins his investigations, only to find his faith shattered when he himself encounters the headless horseman. A magical tale of sense against myth.Just buy the DVD and pause the film on some Christina Ricci's breast scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun and Visually Fantastic Homage to Hammer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written around the time of the film's release in Philadelphia, PA, my senior year of high school.About two weeks before Tim Burton's latest film, Sleepy Hollow, was released, my friend, Dan (SJP '99), informed me that he had four free passes to a sneak preview and asked if I'd like to go. Having greatly anticipated this film since I had heard rumors of it almost a year before I had no trouble deciding whether or not I wanted to go. So one Thursday night, a week before its actual release, I sat in the theater and enjoyed the cinematic feast that was set before my eyes.Sleepy Hollow is very loosely based on the Washington Irving short story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Instead of being a meek and somewhat dim school teacher, Ichabod Crane is now a wimpy constable from New York City, sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of beheadings. The story itself is more complex, offering us insight into the history of the infamous Headless Horseman, introducing new characters, and incorporating a mystery involving scandal and witchcraft. Despite it being so far fetched from the original masterwork, however, I still managed to enjoy the story for what it was rather than focusing on the changes made.As one would expect from a Tim Burton film, the visuals are astoundingly rich with fantastic detail and from the "painted" backdrops to the windmill scene nearing the end of the film, one can clearly see how he tried to model his film after the famous Hammer horror films of the 60s and 70s. Hammer Studios, a company based in Great Britain, was known for making horror films rich in artistic detail and mostly excellent performances (such as The Horror of Dracula and The Vampire Lovers). They were not, however, acknowledged for finely wrought plots, satisfying character development, and brilliant scripts. Burton succeeds in paying homage to Hammer in these aspects as well, though not, surprisingly, to negative effect.Upon seeing previews for Sleepy Hollow, one would reasonably assumed that it is a very serious horror film, but in actuality it is almost completely tongue-in cheek and has a wonderfully dark sense of humor. Adding to this somewhat campy effect is the apparent glee Burton took in beheading the film's characters. As the tagline goes, heads certainly do roll and there is plenty of excessive gore to show it. It is all in good fun, though, as the blood is sometimes so ridiculously unnecessary that it can hardly be taken seriously (which was certainly the director's intended effect). It seemed that the dialogue was, at times, purposefully over-dramatic, and probably with the same reasoning in mind.The performances fit right in with the rest of the film, which is not to say that they were bad. Johnny Depp, as the uptight, "man of reason" version of Ichabod, gives another excellent performance, as do the rest of the case (including Burton veterans Jeffrey Jones, as the town minister, and Christopher Walken, as, in a brilliant bit of casting, the Headless Horseman). Christina Ricci, in her role as love interest, Katrina Van Tassel, seems to stand out as part of Burton's cinematic nod to the Hammer Horror company. In those films, they would often employ beautiful, blonde women to act as the female leads. The only problem with them was that they were usually Swedish or, in one case, Polish, and had to learn a British accent for the film they were in, thus explaining their less than flawless British voices. Hopefully, this is a good explanation for why Ms. Ricci's accent got progressively better throughout the course of the film. On an extra note, the great Hammer staple, Christopher Lee, appears in a cameo as the judge that sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow.Overall, the only two disappointments in the film were the score and the lack of character development. The score itself was fine and suited the film well, but having heard what Danny Elfman is capable of (just listen to his scores for Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands), it seemed very generic. Every once and a while you do hear some bizarre moments of tense strings suited perfectly to the film's off-beat tone, but they are few and far between. In terms of character development, Ichabod is the focus of the film from beginning to end, and since action is such a key element to the film, there is little time for anyone else to make an impression.Tim Burton's latest work is certainly a masterpiece in terms of visuals and entertainment value, and its dream-like tone, filled with the brilliant Gothic imagery we have all come to expect does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true horror film that has real scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow" was an interesting movie that caught my interest and attention and kept it from start to finish. At first, I was hesitant to watch this film because of what the critics had said about this film, but I thought to myself everyone should judge for themselves. I thought "Scream 3" was scary but I found a movie that equalled it. "Sleepy Hollow" does a great job of grossing everyone out by showing the severed heads and even the insides of the heads. This movie turned out to be an incredible murder mystery that tested the mind as to figure out what the real plot was. I enjoyed how Tim Burton maneuvered the cast into not revealing too much of the true plot until just the right time. My favorite scenes in this movie came when the headless horsemen came out of the dead man's tree. However, every scene in "Sleepy Hollow" was excellent and my favorite because it kept my interest as well as wanting to know what would happen next. Smiles lit up my face while I was watching Depp' performance in "Sleepy Hollow" because it validated his ability and skill as an actor. This marks his best performance since his portrayal of Donnie Brasco "Donnie Brasco." Depp knew just what to say and when to say it. I was truly blown away by his performance. If I ever saw a movie that was underrated, it would be "Sleepy Hollow." I recommend this movie because it has thrills, chills, action and dramatic scenes that will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is without a doubt Tim Burtons best film. He sure as hell ruined the Batman movies but we could almost forgive him for this little gem. Luckily this time Burton 'heads' out with the great old story of the Headless Horse man, a better than average script and, what I believe to be the winning factor, a fantastic cast. Johnny Depp was perfect for the role of Constable Craine and Ms Ricci was above par in her role as the sordid love interest. But forget them. What made this movie great was the fantastic supporting cast. Everywhere I looked I saw the familiar faces of some of my most loved actors:- Jeffrey Jones (Ravenous),Michael Gough (Alfred from Batman), Christopher Lee (Dracula},Miranda Richardson (Blackadder), Christopher Walken (Waynes World 2)and the great Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine from the Star Wars series). It was the characters of these 'supporting actors' who made this film as good as it was (especially Walken and McDiarmid). All in all it was a great film with a great story and a great cast I'd give it 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen several Tim Burton films, but this one is by far my favorite. It's a good old ghost story with ample doses of comedy and thrills -- and a wonderful performance by Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow to prove that the supernatural goings on have a basis in scientific fact. Depp is marvelous, as he is in all of the films he's done with Burton. The two of them bring out the best in each other and create cinema magic. The sets are eerie and atmospheric, filled with fog and mists that build tension and a feel for the late 18th century countryside. I really can't say enough about the set direction. I tip my hat to whoever did it. Christina Ricci provides more than adequate love interest and she looks lovely in her costumes. Christopher Walken looks like he had a marvelous time with his fake teeth, snarling at everyone like a maniac. All in all, the move is deliciously over-the-top, straight from the Puritanical rants of hellfire and brimstone, witchcraft and boogeymen that would drag good Christians down to their doom. A must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most mysteriously beautiful horror films ever put to the silver screen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) Rating: 10/10The classic tale of Sleepy Hollow is brought blazingly alive in the competitive film year of 1999 and it has a lot to qualify for to be one of the year's best movies. Well, this movie has all these qualifications and more too! It is truly one of the modern greats and one of the year's best films. The film has awesome mystery, horror, comedy, romance and fantasy balled into a great and amazingly intelligent script by Andrew Kevin Walker. In fact, this is one of the most well written and clever horror films of all time. Some critics have dissed this movie's script but I really thought it was fabulous. To act out this wonderful script they cast Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, and they couldn't have made a better choice. Depp is in almost every scene, and he steals every one with his wit, great accent and great enthusiasm for the film. Christina Ricci is also very beautiful and mysterious, although a little out of her depth. I enjoyed Miranda Richardson's performance, and she has a surprising waiting in the end. The cinematography for the film is lush and stunning, the art and sets are fantastically Sleepy Hollow-ish, and the visuals are truly breathtaking. So much effort went into this film, and a lot of people brought the unforgettable story alive. But most of the credit must go to the visionary and endlessly plausible director Tim Burton, who, with his great ideas, vision, abilities and past credibility's, has the right stuff to make this movie the perfect horror-fantasy. This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching, and one of the creepiest too. Sometimes I can still hear the headless horseman's stallion thundering along the forest, in search for heads to decapitate. I love this flick, and it kicks major butt, so if you're a Tim Burton fan, a person who enjoys the tale of Sleepy Hollow, a horror movie fan or just a movie fan in general, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed by this pitch-perfect masterpiece that is Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow!</fullReview>

The visuals are great, Johnny Depp is great, and some scenes are damn near brilliant. Especially the opening scenes and the big finale are tour de forces of directing and photography. I will have a hard time forgetting some of those beautiful images. The screenplay is probably its weakest link. The plot is kind of routine, familiar stuff. The dialogue is often silly and the romance is way underdeveloped. But fortunately the good things in the film largely outweigh the bad and make it a memorable viewing experience.

This movie, in fact, reminds me strongly of another Halloween feature by Burton: "The Nightmare Before Christmas". The main difference here is that, while in "Nightmare" there are no villains or heroes, just characters in search of their identity, Sleepy Hollow has a villain, a quirky hero, and lots of action. But they both have something in common: they are sweet, lovable films. There is something about Burton, indeed.Another thing worthy of mention: the cinematography is masterfully executed. How could they capture such a range of hues with such a dim light is beyond me. A great movie. A classic for all coming Halloweens (back to back with "Nightmare", if possible).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very fine film with wonderful visuals and acting. Its nice to see a period horror film with this level of budget and attention to detail. But since viewing it for the second time on DVD, Im a little less impressed. Though it is a homage to Hammer-style movies, Burton doesnt quite manage to convey the suspense and true dread of many of those movies. He is very close but I sense something missing. Perhaps it is a bit too calculated. Elfmans score is generally fine, but used in too many scenes. I find it to be a bit monotonously orchestrated, the sound is always big, lacking contrast. Its as if both Elfman and Burton could employ the "less is more"-approach. The first scene with the headless horseman could for instance have been dropped, saving his appearance for later. But these quibbles aside, it is a entertaining movie with top actors in fine form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ichabod Crane-so very much the anti-hero. He pulls his girlfriend in front of him for protection. He holds a child in front of him as a shield. He passes out four or five times in the film. This is the guy that is to solve the murders of Sleepy Hollow. I love it! I love it! I love it! Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a few problems with this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>although the film has basically a good story and some great visuals, its narrative style can be quite confusing at times. At the end, I was confused about more than a few things. The story isn't told in a very clear way. Ichabod's weird dreams distracted me from the story. I also didn't like the way the Horseman was turned into a sort of henchman. Who really cares about who is "controlling" him? This wasn't supposed to be a detective story, I think. I don't mind a bit of plot in my horror films, but here is an exceptional case where we don't care who the killer, and it doesn't really matter either. And what's with the mistreatment of animals and children? What was the point of the lady cutting off the bat's head and pouring its blood in a boiler? Or the cutting of the crow's leg by Katrina? There are several things about this movie I will never understand (I've watched it about five times). How come so much damn blood comes out of the dead widow's body, for instance? And what was the point of the evil eye business? And why does everyone always say "pardon my intrusion" (it's said about four times in the film). Why did the Horseman's axe "melt" in front of the church? Almost everything that happens in this movie is weird. Much of it probably doesn't even make sense. This is one of the most infuriating movies I've ever seen. But the blame isn't on the director, who does the best possible job of bringing the incohesive script to the screen. It is obviously to be placed on the screenwriter and the editor, who seem unable to create and understandable narrative. Still, with all these flaws, there is also much to admire in the film. Johnny Depp is a pleasure to watch, and young Marc Pickering makes an impressive debut as the poor young Masbath. It is also a very imaginative film, with director Tim Burton continuing to show his talent and originality, but next time he should pick a better script. However, I am eager to see his remake of Planet of the Apes, due out this summer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Auteur, Tim Burton, delivers a film which is probably one of his finest. This is so Burton, Sleepy Hollow was made for Burton, from sets to gloomy colour to dark humour, this is TIM! Burton's work is backed up by the great artists in England who made Sleepy Hollow fantastic. I really believed this world could exist, that my friends is verisimilitude!The story is confusing, but I think it makes the film better because you have to watch it again to get it all. The acting is superb, Depp is awesome, his mannerisms are perfect, truely an underrated actor. Ricci has a wonderful Disney type quality to her and the British actors prove yet again that they are the best!The direction is excellent, the shot composition is perfect, making full use of the lense. The photography is stunning, it perfectly captures the mood, man, it's PERFECT!!!The production design is awe-inspiring, you couldn't it was location or set footage, all seamless.Elfman's score is terrific.The film did leave me unsatisfied at times, I wish the horror element was stronger.Overall, classic Burton at his best!</fullReview>

Tim Burton was the perfect choice to direct this film and as a result it is a film that is not only creepy in all the right ways but visually spectacular. The Art Direction was very worthy of the academy award awarded. Johnny Depp uses his quirkiness well in reinventing Icabod Crane helping to give this story not only an edge but also a freshness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Horror but a Gothic Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps you have to be a Burton fan to like this stuff. The scenery, the characters, the humor; it is all Burton. I loved this one. The atmosphere that it is breathing, the lack of color, the darkness and the surrounding. It all contributes to the big picture. A dark mysterious tale of an insecure policeman and the tale of a legendary ghost: The Headless Horseman.Johnny Depp plays his part superbly. He is Ichabod Crane, the sometimes clumsy scientific N.Y. policeman. I even thought Ricci was terrific. By holding back her emotions and even act a little "cold" you could understand why Crane in the end has his doubts about her. But the greatest pleasure I took out of the part of the Horseman himself. Christopher Walken (the man who once said:'There is no such thing as a small role, only small actors') proofs that with just a few movie-minutes you can steel an entire picture. He is one scary horseman!I read that some people didn't like the combination of humor, horror and what more. I think it makes it a better picture. Other people felt this wasn't a good horror movie. Well they are right because it is not. I like to think of it as a gothic fairy tale. If you want to compare it to horror, I think it will remind people to the seventies hammer horror. This, for example, also was a studio film.Well I didn't read the story of the legend of Sleepy Hollow, but I can imagine that, for his own convenience, Burton did not stick to the original. And for this picture it may have been better so. I mean if Tim Burton has an idea about something you should let him go his own way and something beautiful will come out of it, just like this one.The Art Direction on this picture was great and therefore deserved the Oscar (Although I still think that during the last couple of years the Academy Award is the less serious film-award of them all). This was the third Burton/Depp movie, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands were the other two, but I wouldn't mind if they made a fourth, fifth or even sixth movie together. If the outcome would be as great as this one (or the other two)it would certainly be a reason to visit the cinema again. Therefore this one got the highest score from me. A solid 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary, darkly funny, and over-all beautiful film masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This move is my favorite. Director Tim Burton captures us once again in a thrilling masterpice of sight, sound, and atmosphere. It has wrongly been named a simple run-of-the-mill horror film. It posseses the elements of many ganeras, not just horror, but romance, suspence, fantasy, mystery, and even action! The film was macabre and funny simultaniously at times, giving it a dark humor (what Tim Burton film does'nt?). Sure Cristina Ricci could have done with a bit more feeling, and at certain times Jhonny Depp should have been a little more convincing, but give them the credit. It was not easy doing this horror film for them. I have read the original story-board, and I found it astounding how many things so alike! I MAY give away some things, so if you are planning to see the movie for the first time, I suggest you stop reading. I have seen the Disney cartoon nemerous times, and i was always intreaged by the feeling of the headless horseman. People just don't forget the headless horseman there is a certain feeling about him that just cant be placed. His very form seems to symbolise power. The sound of his black horse's hove pounding the ground makes hearts beat faster in fear of excitement, I just don't know even though I have seen the movie many times.The acting in the film was astounding! I especially feel sorry for cristopher Waklen who as it turns out, is terrified of horses! My love for this movie is all too great to put into words. My only sugestcion for you is to sit back, try to enjoy and hold on to your head! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Burton does it again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Burton is a master at creating films that ooze style and manage to envelope you in a completely different world. He doesn't fail to please with Sleepy Hollow...However, there are a couple of things that bothered me with the film. Firstly, there is a lot to take in with Sleepy Hollow and I think it's a case of sensory overload, which does detract somewhat from the experience. The plot is quite complex and both times I have watched it, I haven't been able to follow it, let alone try to piece it all together. Subconsciously I found myself paying more attention to the pretty pictures and score and not really taking in all the plot's twists and turns. It's too difficult to do it all at the same time, especially with such a detailed and rich movie. Secondly the "comedy" aspect didn't go down too well with me. What was the movie trying to be? Moody, serious, surreal, scary AND funny? Ichabod's 'quirkiness' was fine, I just found certain parts that were put in for giggles, not giggle-worthy and more out of place.Don't let that put you off the film though. Sleepy Hollow is quite good viewing, guaranteed to draw you into it's world and have you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is very funny, as well as convincing, Christina Ricci is stunning, and played her part very well, and Christopher Walken was creepy, but in a sense funny, because all he said was "HAH!" The town was very bleak and dark, and the beheadings were done just tasteful enough to where you got a peak but not a long stare, unlike many driller-killer movies. The special effects were nothing short of magnificent, and the web of lies, deceit, and murder make the film all the more better. 10/10</fullReview>

The set is exquisite. Depp is lovable and hilarious as an intelligent, goofy, somewhat arrogant Ichabod. Altogether, everything comes together to make a great action/horror/comedy flick.Viewers should be advised, however, that the plot is actually quite thick. You have to really watch for details to keep up with the mystery plot. This can be difficult to do with so many other distractions in the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a crime/mystery story lover, than this is the movie for you. The movie tagline `Heads will roll' may seem a little excessive and may suggest a movie full of gore. Truth is that this movie is essentially a ?detective story' where everyone is a suspect, and the gore part come as a complement, it is just the style of the killer, who kills his victims the way he was killed, fast and painless. Constable Ichabod Crane, from a NYC in the late 18th century, is given the mission of investigating a group of homicides said to be committed by an headless horseman. These crimes are taking place at the small town of Sleepy Hollow. As soon as Ichabod Crane arrives at Sleepy Hollow, he is told the story of the headless horseman, and how did he lost his head. For those who haven't seen the movie, the mystery may seem to be the real identity of the horseman, but it isn't, the mystery relies on who controls the horseman by keeping his head (as the horseman's identity is revealed in the beginning). As crimes happen, we discover that the horseman doesn't kill by random, he kills those that the very person who keeps his head demands him. Says detective's prime rule ?everyone is a suspect, and consequently the guilty is the less evident' Sleepy Hollow, fulfils this rule completely, furthermore, all those details seen throughout the film, have a certain explanation that is revealed at the end. Tim Burton once more share with us his most comprising view of the script and he makes us feel that we are really there and we are part of the story. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en) writes a beautiful horror/romance fairy tale with Christina Ricci as its princess and Johnny Depp as her knight. Movies like this one, with this crew are to come!I rate it ------- 8/ 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gothic Horror From Tim Burton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale of Ichabod Crane comes to life as never before, in this richly textured and detailed offering of the timeless legend, `Sleepy Hollow,' directed by Tim Burton. In this dark and vividly imaginative, definitive version, Johnny Depp plays Crane, a New York City Police Constable at the end of the Eighteenth Century, who is dispatched northward by his superiors to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate the grisly murders of three of it's citizens. Crane has been chosen, not because he is considered a man of vision for employing the latest scientific techniques in his investigations, but rather because his methods are looked upon askance by his colleagues, and they welcome the chance to be rid of him. He is, they feel, something of an embarrassment to their community, and therefore better relegated to a small, out-of-the-way township of diminutive significance, whereupon his arrival he learns that the murders all share a common thread: In each case, the head has been severed from the body, and carried off. And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation. Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life. He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the ?30's and ?40's, such as `Frankenstein,' `Dracula,' `The Wolf Man,' and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting-edge special F/X. All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights. It must be noted that none of this is presented in a fashion anywhere near to what could be considered a `gore-fest' by any stretch of the imagination; Burton maintains the gothic aspects of the story, visually and dramatically, and renders it all with a touch of real class. Never does he sink to casting about for a gross visual, or attempt to manipulate a situation for the sake of some cheap thrills. It's a matter of integrity-- artistic and otherwise-- and Burton has it; it also demonstrates that he has a respect for his audience, for which he is to be commended, as he works in an industry in which that attitude of consideration does not necessarily prevail. Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original `Frankenstein,' or Basil Rathbone in `Son Of Frankenstein,' which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film. It signals that rare rapport between actor and director wherein a concurrent vision is realized, for all of these attributes of the classical actor that Depp brings to the character are exactly what Burton needed from his star to make the film work so well; the aspect it lends to the final product evinces the same difference as that between a fiddle and a Stradivarius. In a similar vein, in a supporting role, Michael Gambon gives a performance as Baltus Van Tassel that is akin to that of Depp's in adding to the overall ambience of the film, as does Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Samuel Philipse. The leading ladies also answer Burton's exacting call, especially Christina Ricci as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson, who casts a spell as Lady Van Tassel. Rounding out the supporting cast are Lisa Marie (Lady Crane), Casper Van Dien (Brom Van Brunt), Jeffrey Jones (Reverend Steenwyck), Ian McDiarmid (Dr. Lancaster), Michael Gough (Notary Hardenbrook), Mark Pickering (Young Masbath) and, especially menacing in a pivotal role, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman. As he did before with such films as `Edward Scissorhands' and `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' Tim Burton, with `Sleepy Hollow,' has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique. It's a quality film that deserves a special place in every DVD or video collection. Truly one to be appreciated and savored. I rate this one 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget American Beauty - Sleepy Hollow is the best film of 1999. It simply stands out more than any of the other films we saw in 1999. The acting is simply superb (Johnny Depp is great), the direction from Tim Burton is of high quality and very well done, the costumes, set decoration and visual effects are stunning, scary but overall beautiful.The best thing about Sleepy Hollow is that is a film like no other. Sure, we have seen a lot of Sleepy Hollow versions, but instead of a big joke, this one stands out. The film is absolutely terrifying, yet hilarious and action packed in a simply beautiful way.Sleepy Hollow is #2 on my Top 150 films of all time. My rating: Easily 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More ear to tradition might have made it a masterpiece, but wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a serious classical musician, I am an elitist. As a lover of old films and literature, not, but far from today's mainstream. That's why my opinion of this movie is different than most. Everbody talked about (and awarded) the art direction, visuals, style etc. But even though I was as mesmerized as anyone with how the film looked, how it looked wasn't what caused me to truly love this film, which I do.The reason is that looks aren't everything. That is, the director succeded excellently with the extremely stylish/satirical film, Edward Scissorshands; but when I heard Burton was making Sleepy Hallow I thought, Hmmmmm... here's going to be a challenge. For this is a classic 19th century horror tale, therefore traditional methods of approach and application are necessary to accomplish respect for the story and attitudes of the period. In fact, the real satire here is reading the opinions of idiots who went to see Scissorshands II and were disappointed, as if a director should stay true to a narrow form in order to please the narrowminded of his fans.This would be true if the director wasn't capable of broadening. But in Burton's case, he has proven himself quite capable of leaving the cult behind and achieving greater horizons. It's a matter of shedding one's stylistic trappings and allowing the rest of the crew, in this case the writers &amp; actors, to shine. This was done and well to the director's credit.But, there were moments when it was questionable if this was going to be achieved. That's why I frown when repeatedly hearing of the perfect fog effects, set designs etc. We have to pay respect to the director's special talent, but in this film we should also pay respect to how the director has evolved. In Burton's case here, it is a losing of contemporary jadedness/cynicism and a converse gaining of respect for traditional drama, literature and humane optimism.We may wonder why the story was never before made in to a film? (perhaps it was, but never released) It certainly was worthy of the kind of treatment Yagher and Walker gave it here. On the other side of the muse, however, was a musical soundtrack that lacked the depth of earlier 20th century film compositions. Though Elfman is an extremely talented orchestral composer, one wishes for music more keenly related to Rachmaninoff's deeply subtle chromaticism, from which much of film music is derived. Indeed, the lack of a more deeply Hitchcockian psychological noir/drama is what keeps this film from reaching higher levels of dramatic quality.The result is a combination of all the beautiful visuals of modern cinematography with a somewhat overly fast moving old English/New England styled horror/mystery story. That said, the question remains: Do we get the wonderful romantic/optimistic/intelligent characters so necessary to this old genre? Yes, we do! But most importantly, do we get the "feeling" that the detective is an intelligent hero such as Sherlock Holmes? Yes, again! Wonderfully cast, Depp draws us to his intelligence, human imperfections, rebellious/romantic verve, all the emotions that made the period such a wonderfully important time and place to be a scientific liberal, as in H.G. Wells, Thomas Huxley, Shaw etc. These names are from a later time, but that makes it even more exciting: In this story, Ichabod Crane is one of the first! For this was the dawn of the Romantic age, that spawned the great 19th century novel, the detective mystery, and of course Darwin. All of this is about to become the world while the superstition still haunted the age. It seems it was Crane's (Depp's) charge to lead in stamping out the old ignorance while bringing in the new intelligence. Meanwhile, it appears to have been Burton's job to constantly remind us that satanic evil persists; and all the while you're thinking, yes, those stick-like, black &amp; white horror drawings of the period (the "Dear Dead Days" stuff) is what I love most about Burton's visual personality.All of the great, intricate plotting of a classic mystery was utilized well and Crane/Depp became the kind of Sherlock Holmes detective hero that makes you want to see a sequel. I love the period, the detective mystery, the classic literature - but most of all I loved the scene when Crane says to Young Nesbath upon entering New York City (circa 1800) "You'll get your bearings soon enough. All you need to remember is that the Bronx is up, the Battery is down, and home is THIS WAY." That's the kind of hospitable homecoming we all need after a fortnight of head butchering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking film by a creative director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton has quite the reputation for being one of the quirkiest directors in Hollywood. His previous efforts include the bizarre "Beetlejuice", the melancholic drama "Edward Scissorhands", and the visually striking animation of "The Nightmare Before Christmas". One thing that every one of his films has in common is their sense of originality in one way or another, whether it be the storyline, the performances, or the visual aspect of the film. While most of it may not be very original, "Sleepy Hollow" still manages to execute a striking picture, yet still containing Tim Burton's quirky pace and direction.It is 1799 and, and as the film states, the world is at the dawn of a new millennium (apparently the screenwriters got themselves confused with the mass hysteria of reality at the time of the film's release and incorporated it into the film). A hamlet in upstate New York known as Sleepy Hollow has become notorious and controversial for some bizarre goings-on about town. According to recent reports, there have been several bloody murders attributed to a serial killer known as the "Headless Horseman". This killer has become infamous for his method of beheading his victims to kill them.Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a police officer in New York who does not believe in the big city's method of solving crimes: if a man is found in the water, he drowned. If he has a hole in his body, he was shot. Crane believes in sense and reason, and that there is a logical explanation for everything that occurs in society. He wishes that the New York City police department would allow him to do autopsies upon victims of crimes in the city. He appeals his ideals to a judge, who reassigns Constable Crane to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murders occurring there.Once in Sleepy Hollow, Crane is asked to stay at the house of Baltus van Tassel (Michael Gambon), the patriarch of the van Tassel family and highest member of society in Sleepy Hollow. Crane makes eyes at his beautiful daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) as soon as he enters the house, Katrina returning the favor. Crane recollects what his superiors have told him about the crimes in the sordid little hamlet and then finds out that he had not been told the whole story. van Tassel informs him of the murders and the true story of them, the fact that they are attributed to the Headless Horseman, and Crane remains in reality, refusing to believe that a supernatural force could commit such crimes.Crane, now having been in Sleepy Hollow a while longer, is called into question about his beliefs in sense and reason when he sees a beheading with his own eyes. While talking to the town's local magistrate, the horseman rides into Sleepy Hollow, sword in hand, and lobs off the man's head. Crane now doubts any belief in reality and starts to further examine these crimes. A large factor in his investigation is the fact that the horseman did not go after him when he beheaded the magistrate. He notices that the horseman is not exactly a random killer who beheads every person he sees, but that there is more to him, and that he may be motivated in some way or another.As Crane continues his investigation of the beheadings, he finds himself more unwelcome in the town and sees that the citizens think he has uncovered too much. van Tassel and other high members of society in the town don't want him there much longer and plot to have him run out of the town, never having solved the mystery. Crane refuses these attempts to be rid of the town and thrown off the case and continues his investigation as fast as he can before the horseman rides into town and beheads another victim. Through Crane's investigation of this strange town, sparks will fly, fires will rage and heads will roll."Sleepy Hollow" was a throughly enjoyable film. While not for the weak at heart (or the weak-stomach for that matter), the film is an extremely well-plotted, performed, and spectacularly-visual film. Tim Burton's passion for the supernatural is ever-present in this film as he explores the other side of reality and the supernatural for that matter. The film is brilliantly designed and photographed, and seems to have an old-fashioned black-and-white feel about it, only a few colors emerging out of the film's dark theme and atmosphere. Johnny Depp is entertaining to watch in the lead role as a weak-hearted police officer who questions his own beliefs as he is drawn into a place that is both mentally and emotionally challenging. All in all, this film was spectacular and refuses to let its audience down when it comes to entertaining it. I give this film 3 1/2 stars on a five star scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visually Well-Done Film, With Minor Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is a visually well-produced film, with an interesting plot, and good-enough acting that leaves us with memorable characters.Burton's visuals are, as usual, very good. Visuals of snow reminded me of the snow in Edward Scissorhands, and the warped landscape reminded me very much of the sets in Beetlejuice. His attention to detail, while not perfect (the "millennium" did not arrive in 1800, as Crane expects) was still impressive. The wig hairstyles looked authentic to the time - especially the one on Ferris Bueller's principal's head! - and the Dutch architecture in Sleepy Hollow is appropriate for a Dutch-settled state. The costumes looked elaborate and well-done.However, the strongly anti-religious tone was a turn off, and inaccurate, since the Puritan manner and doctrine of the town's religious leaders reflect a 1699 view of life, rather than that of 1799. Given how religion is handled, though, the open practice of witchcraft by nearly all of the town's womenfolk is simply not believable, and reeks of P.C..Otherwise, the plot, though certainly not what Washington Irving wrote, was exciting and a clever interpretation. The dialogue in the beginning scenes of his dealings with the legal system in NYC was poorly written and overly preachy, but did set up Ichabod's visit to Sleepy Hollow.Depp's acting was very stilted, but that's just what the character requires, and his formal manner was right for the time period of the film. He even brings some humor to the character that I really enjoyed.The film was not very gory, but did shock me a couple of times, which was good, for this type of film! I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Burton's style of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where have I seen the windmill before? Frankenstein or Frankenweenie(Burton's first film). His dark dark sets and lighting are such a good fit for this plot, also Batman I and a couple of others...Frankenweenie was in B/W and this one could have been also.  Other than the creativily severed heads this could be a PG 13 film; little mayhem, excellent writing, finest actors, fine score. Coherence and taste from start to finish. An enormously satisfying movie and a 9/10 easily. Both this and 6th Sense just wiped out American Beauty as best picture and I think the Academy lost a great deal of political credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thoroughly modern story about what happens when there's not enough science and reason in the universe to explain the inexplicable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine if X-Files was set in 1799. Instead of Agents Mulder and Scully tracking down paranormal beings, they'd be going after ghostly apparitions, all the while relying on the best that forensic science had to offer at that time.And one day they'd likely encounter a psychotic mercenary, known as the Hessian Horseman, back from the dead to sever and collect the heads of the prominent citizens of a small village in upstate New York.By that time they'd be looking back on their battles with Cancerman with the kind of fondness usually reserved for puppy dogs and first kisses.Well, the match isn't perfect, but Sleepy Hollow, the latest offering from the esteemed actor-director duo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) owes as much to the popular television series as it does to Washington Irving's classic American tale about the legendary Headless Horseman.Although set 200 years ago, Sleepy Hollow is a thoroughly modern story about what happens when there's not enough science and reason in the universe to explain the inexplicable, the net effect being enough anxiety to last well into the new millennium.In a risky but rewarding change from the original version, the central character, Ichabod Crane is no longer a schoolteacher but a constable from New York City sent to a small mostly Dutch community two-days north in the Hudson Islands.Crane, played by Depp, is a modern man both in his approaches and in his sensibilities; when he's not solving murder mysteries, he advocates for more humane treatment of prisoners and the use of detective-work, not torture to crack cases.Upon his arrival, the squeamish but driven Crane puts his scientific ways to work as he sets out to prove that the Headless Horseman is no demon from hell. `The assassin is a man of flesh and blood, and I will discover him,' Crane decrees.Instead, Crane learns that the Headless Horseman is something other than human, although most certainly terrifying. Moreover, being the complicated man that he is, Crane must also confront the disturbing memories of a childhood he'd sooner forget, but ones that also gave him a near-Newtonian devotion to empiricism which the apparition has put in serious doubt.But most important, the more Crane peels away the layers of intrigue that permeate Sleepy Hollow, the less he can trust anyone. Even his newly-found heart-throb, Katrina Van Tassel, played by Christina Ricci, a well-connected local girl with a penchant for witchcraft, finds herself at the top of the suspect list.Sleepy Hollow is more than a simple horror story meant to make kids look under their beds for ghouls. (Any relation to the old Disney cartoon carted out every Halloween is in name only). It's thick with plots and subplots, and enough twists and turns to rival the knarled Tree of the Dead.As well as riveting, Sleepy Hollow is also finely crafted. Burton's talent for setting the mood through the scene has not diminished, as every frame looks like a 16th-century oil painting, only more dark and threatening than romantic and pastoral.Both beautiful and scary, complex and entertaining, Sleepy Hollow is one of the best movies to have come out this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tim Burton has made two horror movies: first this and then in 2007, he made Sweeney Todd. Sweeney Todd was unbelievably great. This however, was not. The film opens with the first of three murders that occur in the small community of Sleepy Hollow. The victims are found decapitated, their heads missing. These strange happenings attract scientific detective Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, to solve the mystery. The townspeople are certain that the murderer is the ghost of the Headless Horseman, who lived in Sleepy Hollow years ago. Ichabod Crane is insistent on proving that this is not a supernatural figure, but after a few more murders, even he begins to believe it as well. First of all, this movie is in no way scary. I enjoy being scared and if I intend to see a horror movie, then I would hope and expect to be scared. This did not do it for me. After the first few murders, I lost interest. The movie mainly consisted of the Headless Horseman running around, and chopping people heads off. Oh, and don't forget, yelling "Aah!" It was a bit hard to take seriously. Also, Johnny Depp was quite mild and disappointing in the lead. He has had far better roles in other films. Despite the talented people involved, this movie was a major disappointment and a dud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Sleepy Hollow' is a film based on the Halloween story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman. The film uses brilliant cinematography that captures the essence of evil and grips the imagination with ghostly characters and a rural 1800s village setting.The film combines a murder mystery with supernatural events from beyond the grave and a romance story in the middle of the supernatural happenings. The performances are done well, and this film has everything if you are looking for a little bit of historical fiction with a light-hearted supernatural tale. This film also succeeds in containing a little bit for everyone: romance and action/adventure.The main problem with the film is that it moves a little bit slowly in some places. It's not a bad film, but it did not stand out as a great film. Average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly Brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleepy Hollow is the beginning of Tim Burton's downfall. As others have said the movie is way way too brutal. How many times do we have to see people's heads get chopped off? It would have been much improved with less head rolling and a little more suspense. The acting is a times non-existent instead of being terrified the townspeople (Ricci and the boy in the graveyard scene react as if they've just seen a squirrel crossing a field.) Depp is funny but lightweight and the movie is very very set bound and looks and feels artificial which may have been the point but it would have been far creepier if shot on actual fog bound locations. Instead of being scary the gore just becomes tedious and in the end I found myself fast forwarding to the resolution. Burton followed this with Mars Attacks also terrible and Planet of the Apes which is perhaps the worst remake of all time. He's rebounded somewhat with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but still has a long way to go to win back the respect I had for him early in his career Bettle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Ed Wood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows "The Tale of Sleepy Hollow". Well, here Tim Burton has tweaked it a little. In this case, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a New York City constable in 1799 who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some bizarre decapitations. In the process, he not only gets interested in Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), but he also discovers a small-scale conspiracy relating to a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary War.As usual, Tim Burton puts an interesting spin on everything. Maybe some parts are a bit overdone, mainly Johnny Depp's overacting, but the whole movie will definitely have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myths and fairytales is a seemly Hammer-horror world!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Small Spoilers) The abominable headless horseman and his horse are terrorizing a small village north of New York, near the end of the 18th century. Johnny Depp is a modern constable and his innovating techniques aren't welcome in New York. Therefore, he's sent over to the town to investigate the murders. The town is in fear and ? even though Ichabod Crane tries to remain realistic ? he soon faces finds out the legend it real. Yet, the cause of this reign of terror still is human hatred and diabolism and Crane slowly unwraps the intrigues and secrets the little town is filled with. The famous Horseman-legend is ideal material for gothic filmmaker Tim Burton. The screenplay that was offered him here gives him the perfect opportunity to drown the audience in a macabre surrounding, complete with fairy-tales elements such as witches who live in the woods and tree that start to bleed when cut. The portrayal of the ghoulish town reminds you of the typical Hammer Studio's way of working. A factor that isn't coincidental, since Burton himself is a big fan of these chilling gothic horror films. Burton's ingenious talent, along with the big budget results in truly magnificent scenery. The town looks ghoulish and the sequences in the dark woods are pretty haunting. Some nice special effects as well, even though the CGI is exaggerated at times. The story becomes extra compelling thanks to the good acting performances. We already knew that Johnny Depp did some of his best work while directed by Tim Burton (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands) and the role of nervous, itchy constable suits him perfectly. Christina Ricci plays his female opposite?with blond hair for this occasion. She's a truly stunning beauty and a multi-talented actress, for sure. Ricci sounds amazingly sexy when she's saying lines like `Do you think me wicked?' Really good and worth mentioning as well are the guest appearances by Martin Landau (who portrayed an impressive Bela Lugosi in Burton's Ed Wood) and Hammer horror legend (Christopher Lee). Perhaps the best actor choice is Christopher Walken in his role of the Headless Horseman?He doesn't say one word during the entire film, but his satanic charisma was never reflected better. Sleepy Hollow is great entertainment and one of the most professional horror movies of the nineties. Check it out in case you haven't yet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual detective story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I expected was an horror movie, what I got was a mystery movie. It was a pleasant surprise!"Sleepy Hollow" is stylish, dark and it has a typical atmosphere, in other words it's a typical Tim Burton movie. But having seen almost every Tim Burton movie I have to come to the conclusion that this one isn't his best movie. But does that mean it's a bad movie? Not at all!The cast is impressive and full with stars like: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Walken and many, many others. but thank God the cast isn't a celebrity overkill (such as in "A Bridge too Far" is the case.). Especially Depp as in every Tim Burton movie is brilliant! Let's hope this wasn't their last movie together.Two other things that stood out were the production design (very beautiful and typical Tim Burton sets!) and the musical score by Danny Elfman. Another thing that deserves to be mentioned are the costumes.Although the movie can be qualified as an horror film the movie never really gets scary and I don't think it was intended to be. The movie is too fun and entertaining to be.The movie has some nice dialogue especially for Ichabod Crane the Johnny Depp character. However there are some missed opportunities in the script and the conspiracy theories and when everything comes together at the ending might be a bit too much for a movie like "Sleepy Hollow" that should be light to watch. Also I wouldn't have minded the movie to be a few minutes longer.Nevertheless the are some wonderful moments and lot's of things that make this movie worth watching such as all the headless horseman scene's for which Ray Park did most of the fight scene's.All in all I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Why people are fascinated by this type of filmaking is beyond me. Yes the special effects are good, this is what Hollywood does best-pour all the money into the effects and leave no money or time for a decent script.The lines were read with no passion whatsoever, espiecially by Ms. Ricci, ugh! Great acting by Johnny Depp you say? Give me a break, maybe just a notch above the Ricci performance, a very small notch. The best performance here is by Christopher Walken, and his role is none speaking! Place this film in the same heap of forgettable Hollywood action features that are all noise and effects, with nothing to remember but the two hours you wasted watching it.</fullReview>

He looks around, nervous and confused, and makes a hasty exit. He couldn't have been allowed to kill small children in a slasher like that. (In higher art, it could be debatable.)But "Sleepy Hollow" was no higher art. It was a slasher with pretensions. It stole the title and main characters' names from THE great American classic, forever besmirching such names, and no doubt causing Mr. Irving to spin.And yet this cut-em-up did not have even the common courtesy, as Jason did, to turn away when presented with a small child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your going to see a scary movie don't see this. The whole crowd laughed through it, and I don't think it was because the movie was funny but how bad it was. When you have a demon that has eyes and a tongue that pops out in computer animation like when Jim Carrey wore the mask you know you've wasted six dollars. Well at least I did. The idea seemed fascinating Tim Burton directing a movie based on the short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. Then Christina Ricci was cast. I was definitely seeing this. However I was very disappointed. The Headless Horseman was not mysterious ( which I think he needed to be ). And he was controlled by someone so it becomes a who-done-it Scream like film. But there's so many twists I could n't understand a lot of things and even the people who liked it couldn't. Another problem with the movie is that there's so many characters and no development of any of them you don't feel bad when they lose their head or even care if they're being attacked. Which makes the movie lack suspense. The ending felt rushed. And Christina Ricci's character wasn't even needed ( yeah she was great with the little she had to work with ). Christina Ricci's onscreen stepmom's dialogue made me roll my eyes. And gore doesn't bother me but it's NOT funny. Especially when you keep using it. And Christopher Walken's costume and barking dialogue .... HAHAHA can we say cheesy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally view Tim Burton movies as getting high marks on art direction and visuals--but low marks on story, character and theme. That is my view of Sleepy Hollow.It doesnt retain much from Washington Irving's story. In fact the treatment of the Headless Horseman at times borders on the ludicrous(even for such material as this). At one point Brom Bones duels rather competantly with the Horseman--and at another time Crane winds up on the back of the demon horse--and is able to get it to gallop on command. Hey--this is supposed to be a ghost not a reanimated corpse! I give Disney credit for instilling their 1949 cartoon horseman with a supernatural grace. (one nice touch though--seeing Crane atop his plough horse Gunpowder--and passing through the covered bridge--there is a very clear homage to the Disney cartoon if you pay attention).It was also nice to see Christopher Lee again--although i wouldnt consider this film to be in the same league with Hammer films--those flicks had characters and stories!Oh yeah--and one really pathetic mistake early on. Crane says something like: "The millenium is only a few months away..." and the story is set in 1799.I think this movie might have been "ghost"-written--certainly someone involved didnt have their head on straight--or maybe not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is over-the-top cheese, and Depp plays an amusing sort of cowardly constable. Following Demi Moore's "Scarlet Letter" school of text adaptation, this has zero to do with the Washington Irving story, but there you go. The movie's value is mostly visual.My previous low-water mark for commentary on a DVD is either Jodie Foster's obsession with talking only about what is real and what is fake in every shot of Contact, or of course the chronically stupid "funny" commentary on Blood Simple, but this is right down there with them. It took me exactly six and half minutes to run out of patience with Tim Burtons inane, self-evident remarks. Between long stretches of silence he exhausts one adjective (amazing... Michael Gough is amazing, the cast is amazing, big Spanish horses are amazing...). Hey Tim, feel free to make some notes and watch it once before you you record your comments. But if he could do that, he'd be able to realize that nine out of ten of his movies have crappy scripts; Tim is quite inarticulate.I doubt anyone can top the immortal 4-word summary of this by LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis "Sleepy and hollow indeed."

		<fullReview>I recognize that I'm definitely in the minority here, but I thought this movie was terrible. It's pretty rare that I shut a movie off, but I didn't think that this one was worth my time.To me, the movie's pace seemed to be at cross purposes with its subject. There seemed to be more frolicking than terror. It just rapidly leaped from sequence to sequence, maintaining a very light-hearted feel the entire time. There was far too much romping for me to feel any suspense, and the only horror that the story was capable of producing came from its God-awful quality.***SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS*** Let's see here...there's an investigator whose new methods are contrary to his superiors. He's a person that has lots of fun little gadgets of his own design. His mother died because she was wrongly accused. Is there anything even remotely resembling originality here? Not even Depp could rescue this cardboard character. And I will grant that there was an original treatment of the actual legend by going with crime investigation, but this was also terrible. The investigation seemed to move forward by very, very thin strands of logic that struck me as ridiculous. Finally, this movie has a love story even worse than the one in Pearl Harbor. Depp and Ricci meet, and by the third scene together they are in love for no apparent reason.I'm not particularly familiar with Tim Burton, but between this and the disgusting remake of Planet of the Apes, I don't think I want to. The story is ludicrous, the characters shallow pieces of trash, and the mood right out of a Ren and Stimpy cartoon. I have nothing against Ren and Stimpy, but that's because they weren't trying to be scary.This one was too busy trying to be hip to be any good. 2/10</fullReview>

Basically just a fancy, dressed up slasher movie this ghastly film is disturbing in a way that surprised me. I have not read Washington Irving's story, but I can't imagine that it was meant to be just a brainless gore fest with one head after another gruesomely chopped off. I thought the acting was mediocre and Depp's performance was quite odd. Yes, the visual style was appealing, which is why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1. Watch this one if you're up for a disgusting mess that is only marginally funny at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost cartoons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I should begin by saying that I am NOT a fan of Tim Burton. I went to the movie hoping to see Johnny Depp in a role more along the lines of Edward Scissorhands. I was thoroughly disappointed. His character was cartoon like (though this was not his fault).Except for the really beautiful images, there was nothing about this movie. Those were really stunning and helped created the mood... unfortunately the mood was entirely spoiled by the horror scenes, which were ludicrous.As I have said before and I repeat, everything else is just cartoons. The directing, the acting, everything. I suppose I should have expected this... serves me well not to go see another Tim Burton movie. Anyway, if you like his style, you will probably enjoy it...(Spoilers...)In one of the scenes at the end of the movie, which I suppose was meant to be the most frightening one, where the Rider gets his head back, I could not refrain from laughing!! I didn't laugh as much at a supposedly serious movie since Predator...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, actually, it isn't all Tim Burton's fault. The script was dreadful. For starters, it abandons the actual Sleepy Hollow myth - and we're not talking about a few artistic liberties here; it's a completely different, and somewhat inferior, story. The script is weak, confused, and can't even follow its own internal logic (I can't give you an obvious example, unfortunately - it's a spoiler), and one character (let's not say who) comes down with an unfortunate case of James Bond Villain Syndrome. If you see it - although I suggest you don't - you'll see what I mean.Tim Burton seems to have been so in love with the image of the gloomy forest and galloping horseman that he forgot about the rest of the movie. Get a decent script next time, Tim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not horror, just horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations for Sleepy Hollow because of Tim Burton's previous work and the intriguing trailer, which promised a very macabre, eerie take on the Washington Irving tale. The story supplies plenty of raw material for a director interested in examining fear, jealousy, superstition and the dark side of human nature. Instead, what I saw was just another effects-driven big-budget waste of time. Way too much emphasis was placed on creating the spooky atmosphere - how many shots of fog, storm clouds and bare trees do we need to see? OK, Tim, we get it - Sleepy Hollow is a gloomy place. Now would someone please light a lantern and get on with the story? The village is so damp and dreary I'm surprised everyone didn't die of pneumonia before the Headless Horseman ever showed up.The screenplay seems to exist solely for the purpose of creating opportunities to spend more special effects dollars, but even the goriest scenes are not frightening. There's no mystery here. We know that before long Mr. Headless will show up again and lop the head off some character. His scenes reminded me of the knight in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."The dialogue is stilted and phony. And wasn't it odd that Miranda Richardson adopted a convincing American accent while other cast members, especially Johnny Depp, put on awful Brit accents? Depp was just plain bad. His Ichabod Crane is a campy, foppish twit. He looks silly pursing his lips with all the color drained from his face.The screenwriters have tried to turn this into some sort of murder mystery, but the plot is so needlessly complicated that we don't know or care why people are being whacked. The tale would have been better served by writers who know how to craft a tight, suspenseful story. A big disappointment.</fullReview>

First, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie. The story itself is full of clech and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen. And as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it, and I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horrible disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think many of the positive reviews of this movie were written by people who've just been desperate for some good head-chopping scenes. To be fair, this movie has a lot of them, and they're done well. But the movie itself is *bad*. The long-winded exposition scenes are an embarrassment, and people have already commented on the plot flaws, the lack of chemistry between Depp and Ricci, and the incredible mangling of the original Irving story. But wait, there's more!Christopher Walken looks and acts comical as the horseman. His recurring line is "rahhr!" Far from being scary, he looks like a clown, and I kept expecting him to launch into a story about a gold watch. (Oh, and how could anyone fail to notice the headless horseman visibly looking around for his horse when he comes out of the windmill?)Crane is a confused character - one minute the bold constable questioning everyone, the next minute shaking violently with fear when they tell him the ghost story. In one scene he pushes a boy in front of him into a cave, and in the next he insists on going first. This isn't a complex character; it's a badly-written one.The script is awful. "You must have some witch in you." "Why?" "Because you have bewitched me." Argh! But the scene that really pushed it over the edge into B-movie territory came at the end. I'll refrain from Ebert-style spoilers (that man should be restrained!), but why did Crane and Katrina choose -that particular moment-, you know which one I'm talking about, to start hugging and kissing at the climax of the movie? That moment was about as romantic as a prison rape, and their reaction was *completely* inappropriate. Much of the audience burst out laughing, which I'm sure wasn't Burton's intent.Go in with your expectations set for "bad", and you might be able to stomach it.</fullReview>

What a disappointment! This movie falls down in nearly all departments, especially the screenplay. First of all, what is the point of making Ichabod Crane into a detective? Exactly where is the mystery?!! Hello! All the beheadings are just too much; come on... And what's with the witch character? It's as if, 'Mr. Crane! Mr. Crane! I happen to know that a witch lives in that cave over yonder... She has no purpose in the story other than to let the SFX crew indulge in some CGI bug-eyed antics.' Really...

		<shortDescription>Visually enrapturing adaptation heavily marred by lack of intelligence and tension in the script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beetle Juice, Batman, Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Planet of the Apes, Big Fish, Sweeney Todd and now Sleepy Hollow. That is the extent of my experience with Tim Burton. I don't often need to take the role of lemming upon me, but I'm left without choice."Sleepy Hollow" once again merely is a mask of visual creativity, unmasked however there's little pleasing about this, and every other, Burton film. The script flaunts a shocking lack of intelligence. The film's half and half divided between dark comedy and mystery, the first an instinctive like or dislike, the second an objective fail. Especially the final twist falls flat, the clich scenes where the villain points out the exit of the plot's labyrinth in an overly long expose hardly possesses any punch due to the insufficiently explored characters (betrayal isn't much of a heart breaker when there's no real trust established to begin with), and the web of clues' only goal appears to be confusing the audience(did Burton really expect us to remember all the names of a dozen characters who've hardly registered on screen due to lack of screen time and unmemorable dialog). Burton's rendition of 'Ichabod Crane' is not so much "some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield" (see Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story) as another self-aware, colorful for the sake of being colorful, character, though it's not hard to imagine him filled with hay(why do so many mystery films insist on selecting the dullest, most devoid of personality character as the mirror through which we view the story, rendering it less quirky?).Elfman's score complements the pert visual style, the film's strongest suit beyond a shadow of a doubt. Opting for an almost b&amp;w look (same as Sweeney Todd), he succeeds at injecting the blood shedding scenes with more vivacity. It's the strongest argument for why I feel Sleepy Hollow leans a lot closer towards a comic book film than a Gothic horror story adaptation.Although I can't put my heart into recommending this film, checking out the scenes involving Christopher Walken's headless horseman may just be enough argumentation to give this movie one look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I liked the picture as a horror film - but I think I would have enjoyed it more had they just used a headless horseman, and called the film something else. This has NOTHING to do with the original story - just the names and the title remain. With the creative talents involved with this picture, why did they have to ruin the original story? Not enough blood I guess. If one has never read the original book, I'm sure they would love this film (it is visually stunning); but for someone like myself who loves the book, this picture was a great let down. The new rule in Hollywood for adapting great works of literature? Change the story, film it dark, add lots of mud, and oh yes, don't forget the blood. What a shame. Where is Vincent Minnelli when you need him? In this version, heads are spinning off bodies; and I would bet Mr. Irving is spinning in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Tim Burton's films, but this film for me is almost unwatchable. The decapitations are very graphic. This movie looks more like a cheap slasher movie than a high-budget horror/fantasy film. Some of the gory scenes are even meant to be comical, which I did not find one bit funny.The look of the film is very cool. It has a very nightmarish look. I think Christopher Walken is miscast as the Hessian Horseman. The part does not require any acting, and he has no lines. He does look very scary with the pointed teeth and wind-blown hair. I am also getting pretty tired of Johnny Depp portraying bumbling simpletons, even thought his character is suppose to be a skilled detective. There are no other roles that are memorable.I knew the basic story of the headless horseman before seeing this movie, but I thought this was a poor adaptation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was struggling to find something to rent on the DVD part of Netflix and after some horrible suggestions (No, Netflix, I do not want to see "Meet The Dweedles"!), I suddenly remembered this movie and that I had wanted to give it a try. I guess there was a reason I forgot all about it...So Sleepy Hollow is just...I dunno---I want to say bad, but it's not completely bad---it's a movie where special tastes are required. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it doesn't quite know what it's supposed to be. In my opinion; in my viewing, it would alternate from thriller to comedy to just plain weird. Even the characters don't know what their supposed to be sometimes. In some scenes, Depp is afraid of a spider but then has no problem fighting a ghost! In some scenes, he is afraid of the ghost but no longer fears insects! Also, Christina Ricci's character seemed to be going in and out of a English accent. I guess she forgot she was in a movie or something...Another setback this movie has is the acting. There are some of the best actors in the world (not you Ricci!) in this picture and yet, somehow they all manage to give the worst performances they could manage! Especially, at the end, when the villain is revealed and gives their "Why I Am Evil" speech! I'm sorry but that actress just stunk out that scene. It was so bad that it took me out of the moment and made me laugh. If you're intending a movie to be scary or intense, then that performance should not be the one you went with! Another cringing actor was the child who played Depp's sidekick. Very wooden. Sorry kid...The story is alright; nothing like the original short story but that is to be expected. My problem with the story/characters is that every thing seems fast paced, not explained or magically solved. Depp and Ricci fall in love in about ten seconds. Literally. He enters the house for the FIRST time. She, blind folded, kisses him. They're in love now, for no apparent reason. Another example of the weird writing is how Depp's character seems to know everything without any real knowledge. His character is supposed to be intelligent and fact based. He doesn't believe in magic or ghosts or what have you---BUT THEN HE SEEMS TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE SUPERNATURAL THING IN THE MOVIE! He says something like, "That's the Tree of Death---it leads to Hell!". HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT? I wonder if Burton proof reads or anything...The effects, make up and visuals are pretty enjoyable. Albeit, a bit cheesy. Especially the blood. It looks like red pudding. The houses, forests, backgrounds and all that look great, but lack color. The effects are good for their time; but some murders look more silly than terrifying. Lastly, Christopher Walken as the Headless Ghost is a mixed bag. He is a great actor---one of my favorites---but his costume or makeup was really silly. Vampire-like teeth and blue eyes. REALLY? THAT'S THE BEST YOU COULD DO? There's one part, where, after his horse is shot, he is supposed to be sad, looking at his horse, but with his stupid vampire teeth, wacky contacts and no actual dialogue, it was hard to convey his emotions. Actually, he looked silly and it made me laugh again because Walken is just (I mean this in a good way) weird looking already, so it's hard to take a sentimental moment with him (dressed like a monster, no less) seriously...In conclusion, I really wanted to enjoy this movie as I like Tim Burton's overall style (I just really dislike him as a person but I respect his talent) and this story is exactly Burton's taste but with the horrible acting, plot holes, character plot holes and the movie not knowing what it wanted to be, I couldn't get that much into it. It's worth rental or watch; or a good Halloween movie but only serious Burton fans will want to own this dud!1-Worst. Movie.

Any stroke of axe or Heath Robinson devicespurts blood precisely into the wielder's face; yet the level of gore(blood spurting from each nailhole of a victim of the iron Maiden) ismarginally too great to support the only kind interpretation of thisfilm, that it is supposed to be funny. Lines of development sopoorly handled that characters must stop and catch the audienceup with the plot, as in some detective farce.And what a romp it might have been: rarely can so many greatactors - for the supporting cast is potentially superb - have stoodaround with so little to do. Not including Mr Depp, kept very busy,who equates acting with swallowing to express fear, etc etc,unfunny and untrained in pastiche, inadequate to attempting thethemes that first informed this abandoned script.Kudos to the headless horseman, for twirling his axe in the onlyact of real gusto in a long evening.

		<fullReview>Director Tim Burton has created some scary, creepy, weird and wonderful films, and this is another success. Burton favourite Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a Constable assigned to investigate murders taking place in an unknown town called Sleepy Hollow. On the day of arrival at the Hollow he meets and falls in love with Katrina Van Tassell (Christina Ricci), daughter of Baltus Van Tassell (Sir Michael Gambon). It is Mr. Van Tassell who tells Ichabod that the murders are done by a Headless Hessian Horseman (Christopher Walken). Ichabod does not believe that there is a horseman like this, until he actually sees him. He is now on the hunt for this horseman and trying to find reasons for these murders, besides wanting his head back! Also starring Miranda Richardson as the nasty Lady Van Tassel, Jeffrey Jones as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Lee as Burgomaster, Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Philipse, Michael Gough as Notary Hardenbrook and Lisa Marie (Burton's fiance at the time) as Ichabod's Mother (in his dreams). It is a good mystery with some good horror moments, particularly decapitations. It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects. Christopher Walken was number 34, Sir Christopher Lee number 31, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Lee was also number 13 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Depp was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Miranda Richardson was number 15 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses.

		<shortDescription>Great special effects and action--dumb script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, after seeing this film I would have to say that this is about the worst Tim Burton directed film I have ever seen--mostly because the script is hopeless. The problem seems to be that although a fortune was spent making the town of Sleepy Hollow for the film as well as doing some incredible stunts, no one seemed to have bothered making sure the script was up to snuff. The bottom line is that cool decapitation scenes are not enough to carry this movie and it seems as if the film is designed for undiscriminating audiences.So what's so bad about the script? Well, it didn't bother me that practically none of the film was based on the original story--after all, that was a short story and it would have made a relatively dull 15 minute movie. No, instead the problem was that the story just seemed to revolve around just action and special effects. So much of the dialog seemed pointless and sloppy. In particular, late in the film, Miranda Richardson goes on a long-winded exposition in order to explain the film--like she was reading from a script in order to explain what had happened to the audience. In addition, there were so many needless story elements--particularly those about Ichabod's childhood that seemed so needlessly antagonistic towards Christianity as well as a strong bent in favor of "white witchcraft". Throw in a silly and pointless meeting with a witch with no eyeballs, 18 decapitations, tons of gratuitous blood and you're left with a film that bears much more resemblance to THE GRUDGE or Friday THE 13TH than THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW! If you like dumb big budget films or will watch anything that teams Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, try any of their other pairings--such as the excellent films CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE or SWEENEY TODD.</fullReview>
