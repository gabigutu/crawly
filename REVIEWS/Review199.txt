		<shortDescription>Disney's funniest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm shocked to see this movie with a rating below 7. As a big Disney fan, I'll go out on a limb and say this is one Disney's top 5. There isn't a Disney movie out there with wit as sharp as this one's with much of it probably lost on the audience guessing by the rating given to this movie. "Meg" definitely emerges as my all-time favorite female Disney role. Breaking from tradition, her character is not all that lady-like in her biting wit and sarcasm, but it works, serving to make the movie funny and her character lovable despite working with questionable motives. The set-up and plot is typical for the movie but the script, animation, and music are most original AND good. IF I had to register a complaint, I would say that it's perpetual humor kept the movie from being emotionally wrenching. However, this movie remains one of the most entertaining I've seen. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this film is wonderful. It is sheer entertainment for kids and hilarious for adults.I first watched this movie age 7, and i loved it...now i watch it again age 14 and I'm howling with laughter. The 'You wanna buy a sundial?' sequence renders me unable to breathe for laughter, whilst when i was younger it got not so much as a giggle.As with all Disney films, the jokes are for the 'big kids' and the entertainment value is for the little ones.This film has been criticized for not staying true to Greek Mythology. My response is, it doesn't matter. This a witty, sarcastic and enjoyable film. Accuracies play no purpose.The characters are wonderful, particularly Phil and Hades. Also, Megara provides a feisty, totally non 'princessy' female character, which is wonderful!Overall - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I know I have heaped praise on several other Disney films...Hercules stands out as my favourite among them all. After this movie the Disney features once again seemed to slip downhill. However I can watch this movie again and again, it has a spectacular Greek chorus, gospel type score, which will ring in your head for days (and you will like it!). The characters are all likeable, even the villain and it is absolutely hilarious!I have never understood the panning this film got from Disney fans, as I have never comprehended what there is to dislike. The animation is beautifully done, although it is done in the style of Greek art, which may not be to everyone's taste (very similar situation to Sleeping Beauty which was disliked by some because it was animated in the style of a medieval tapestry), but it works wonderfully for the film.Take a chance and watch it...and when you're done watching it for the sixteenth time, go out and buy the soundtrack!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hercules" is a cracking Disney film and for once it's not just for the kids. The animation is more like the "old-school" Disney, before the cute, big-eye syndrome and the characters are hugely entertaining. It has sly humour and in-jokes, but what sets it apart are the songs; soul, RNB, jazz and not a drippy sugar-song in sight. Quality entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST Disney movie I have ever seen!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my gosh I can't believe that people are complaining about this movie. It is amazing with great art, jazzy music and awesome characters. I am 14 and first saw this movie at 5. I liked the movie then and absolutely love it now.I love the songs and even though it is not true to mythology, so what?? It's a movie so get over it!! Shesh!! This movie has got heaps of bad reviews but has anybody looked at the good ones?? The characters in this movie are great. Hercules is great and Phil adds some laughs. The villains in this story add soo much humor. Hades, Pain and Panic add soo many laughs and James Woods is perfect for Hades who is one of the best villains yet!! Megara (or Meg) has to be the best heroine from all the Disney movies. For one she is not looking for love, is independent (she can tie her own sandals and everything) and can stand up to her boss. She doesn't let anyone push her around. I think that Susan Egan did Meg's voice perfectly.Honestly I just want to say that this movie is great for both adults and children and the songs are unforgettable.If you haven't seen go to the video shop and rent it! You wont be sorry!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey mythology lovers, get a grip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many Disney movies, animated and not, and this one has more action than most, has no cute animals and is more humorous (ala Aladdin) than a typical Disney movie--Pixar films not included. This one also has a male lead (no princesses). If you are looking for typical Disney fare, then you may not appreciate this one. We enjoyed it thoroughly--from 4 to 40 years of age, male and female.As for all the criticism regarding the liberties Disney took with Greek mythology, get a grip. I love Greek mythology too but hey, IT'S FICTION! It's not historical fact. Even the ancient tales themselves are not consistent, containing contradictions. There were many authors. But the characters are interesting, and Disney used some of them to create a good story for kids about an outcast looking for his place in life. It also explores what makes a hero a true hero (perhaps the more useful lesson of the movie). Yes, it's a shame they took so many liberties with this picture but it still encourages interest in Greek myth. Don't believe me? The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were not historically accurate either but they got kids interested in the Old Masters!8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Olympian achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly my favorite Disney movie ever. With a razor-sharp wit, perfect comic timing and a fresh plot that transcends most other Disney fairy tales, this one's definitely a keeper.You'll be enchanted right from the first number, in which the five Muses (from Greek mythology) set the stage of ancient Greece in a powerhouse gospel number which gives a whole new meaning to a Greek chorus. Recalling the three ladies in Little Shop of Horrors or Motown groups like the Supremes, the Muses appear randomly throughout the movie to narrate the story of Hercules with jazzy musical numbers that you'll be humming for days. The songs (by Alan Menken) are certainly a twist from the classic Disney musical, but there's enough variety to create a great, well-rounded musical. The writing is the wittiest in any Disney movie ever, with constant in-jokes and hilarious references to Greek mythology to reward the amateur scholar. The lyrics, too, are witty and full of tricky rhyme schemes that must have been a doozy to write but play out perfectly on screen. (You'll be flat-out awed by how many things rhyme with the phrase "gospel truth".) Another of the highlights is the heroine, Megara or Meg. She's in no way a typical Disney princess. She's sassy, sexy, cynical and dangerous - and more winning by far than any warbling Cinderella or whiny little mermaid. The villain, Hades, is also a fun, witty character, although plenty dangerous in his own right.Of course liberties have been taken with Greek mythology. The dysfunctional Olympian family has been cleaned up (No more Zeus having affairs or Hera trying to kill people) and the story has little in it of the original Greek legend. Instead, it's really an archetype, a modern retelling of all the Greek legends at once. Appearances are made by the Muses, the Hydra, satyrs, the Fates, Pegasus, the Titans, Narcissus, and of course all of the Olympian gods. Scholars may take offense, but since legends evolve and are to be taken with a grain of salt anyway, I didn't have a problem with it.Yes, it's cheesy, just like other Disneys. But when nobody else is around, there's no resisting the corn. The third act is absolutely heart-wrenching, and even if it's over-the-top, it never truly goes over the top, and the constant bombarding of wit keeps things from getting too touchy-feely. Besides, tied together with a golden Disney score, who couldn't resist a dose of adventure, heartache, redeeming love, and most of all, heroism? Just let yourself be carried away to ancient Greece and you'll forget the movie's problems in a Pelyponnesian minute. As the Muses would say, that's the gospel truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually like villains, even in Disney movies, because they're too scary, but I loved James Woods as Hades. He was so funny. I loved the way he called Megara "my little nutmeg." I also loved the way they depicted Thebes like New York and they called it "the big olive." I loved Meg's cynical and sarcastic attitude. Hercules himself was rather bland. I loved the song "Go the Distance." Paul Wylie skated to it and showed how powerful the song is. I really enjoyed this movie and I don't care if it departs from Greek mythology. It was really about our time anyway. I'd watch it again in a Pelopenisian minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing to do with Heracles (Hercules)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen. If this had ANYTHING to do with Hercules, I would be fine with it. This is just some strong guy with an evil blue guy after him. FIRST OF ALL: In REAL Greek Mythology, Hades wasn't evil. At all. In fact, he was actually considered to be the honest and protective god of Ancient Greece. This made him into their version of the devil, which he doesn't represent at all. Second: Hera is the villain. Sorry if you missed preschool, elementary school, middle school (if you have that where you live), and High School. And college. And never talked to anyone. But Hera was actually who was after Heracles (the actual spelling of Hercules, they messed that up too.), because he was born with a woman Zeus cheated on her with. In this, she is a loving mother who is afraid for her son. And third: Heracles is not a love story. At all. In fact, he's married already in mythology, but kills her. Yeah, sorry made up lady from the movie, but you never existed anywhere else, and your closest counterpart was killed viciously. Hades never dies, Heracles doesn't have a Pegasus, and Heracles eventually marries a goddess of youth, Hebe, and I think that in the movie it *SPOILERS NOW* ended with him staying on Earth with his girlfriend, but I'm just remembering that. *SPOILERS END* This is the only movie from Disney's prime time that I cannot stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No James Woods = No Good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Disney were trying to keep their successful streak going then Hercules is a truly bizarre choice in trying to prolong that. On the surface a film based on Greek mythology could be very effective and if anybody could do an interesting take on it then it was probably Disney. However, the choices made in telling the story and shaping it are just so strange that I'm not sure what they were thinking. This very much feels like they were just throwing things at the wall and seeing what happened to stick. Almost everything clashes, from the animation to the music to comedy. This is one messy film and I don't think its good points are enough to redeem it.In a similar vein to Superman, Hercules is born to the Greek God Zeus on Mount Olympus and he happens to fall to Earth when a plan by Hades to dispose of him goes wrong. Hercules later discovers who he really is and sets out to earn his place back by being a hero, all while Hades tries to find out his weakness to complete a prophecy. This story has two big issues, the fact that we've seen this all before and that it is incredibly predictable. From the very beginning you know how the plot will develop, the motions that Hercules will go through and how it will all be resolved in the end. They try to add some different touches here and there, yet none of them really work and you're left with a tried plot line.The characters are pretty much cardboard cut-outs. Hercules (Tate Donovan) is the classic naive idiot who has a heart of gold and never gives up. Sadly he comes across as annoying instead of charming and he simply isn't interesting, he's a hero that you can't really get behind. His trainer Phil is the typical grumpy teacher, never satisfied and willing to give his student a hard time. Danny DeVito is a good fit, but he isn't given anything of note to do. Megara (Susan Egan) is enjoyably feisty and seems independent at first, but that is traded in so she becomes a damsel and the attempt to give her a solid backstory feels rushed. Hades' two servants Pain and Panic are much more irritating than they are funny too.The only thing that really works here is Hades with most of that coming from James Woods and his excellent delivery style. He talks like a salesman or a lawyer would, with very fluid snappy and frequently funny dialogue. He's enjoyably different from most Disney villains, mostly because he is a lot more charismatic and fast- talking. Not to mention he has a great design. On a similar point the rest of the animation, designed by Gerald Scarfe, is not that good. It all looks a little too soft and simplistic, with a lot of bright and rather in your face colours. I will say that some of the monster designs are quite creative, but I think they could have been even more imaginative. The action scenes weren't as good as they should have been either. There are a few moments of tension that are effective, but the fights are usually dull and not very engaging.I didn't enjoy the music at all. The main type of music used was Gospel and to me it didn't fit the film whatsoever. Seeing these images with a backdrop of Gospel was just so jarring, not to mention that the songs themselves were not very catchy. The Oscar-nominated 'Go the Distance' by Michael Bolton was weak too, the lyrics were rather clichéd and again it just didn't have a good tune. The comedy really didn't work. I found the 'muses' who interrupt from time to time to be annoying and all they did was slow the story down. I didn't care for the characters so the situational comedy wasn't that funny, there were very few humorous lines and the pop culture references felt like they were forced in. Once again Hades is the only one who is consistently amusing.For me Hercules is something of a failure. It feels like they were trying to capture the tone of Aladdin, but missed the fact that that film had engaging characters and much better jokes. Almost everything about Hercules doesn't work as it should or badly clashes. Hercules himself is just such a dull lead, the support he gets is equally as dull and the story has been seen so many times that it's become too familiar. Disney are usually great with music and animation, but both are weak here. I'd have to say that James Woods' Hades is probably the only shining light and does provide the best moments. Hercules is just a confused and boring effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You, James Woods!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another Clements/Musker movie, and...I don't like this. When I first saw this last year, I felt completely underwhelmed. This isn't one of those films I scratch my head at, trying to figure out why people like it; but for me, this is a stupid film.ANIMATION: This is the first Disney film I do not have an appreciation for the animation. The design is way too weird. It doesn't look like a Walt Disney Animation Studios film, it looks like a Disney TV show. The only design I enjoy if Hades. He looks awesome. The shot of him glowing when he shakes Hercules' hand is amazing - I want that framed! Everything else is either bland or awkward and weird.SONGS/MUSIC: Movie...what did you do to Menken? These songs are terrible! Being that I grew up on the style of music of the songs and I love it, you'd think I'd enjoy these songs. But no, I don't! These songs are some of the most bland and forgettable songs I've ever heard! I watched the beginning of this film twice within 30 minutes, and I totally forgot the "Gospel Truth" number! Do you know how bland a song has to be for you to, not only forget it after you saw it once, but to forget it after it repeats itself twice in the first 10 minutes of the film?!? The only song I remember from this film is "Zero to Hero," and that's only because of the "Hercules" preview I would see on the Disney videocassettes we watched growing up! These are bad songs!ROMANCE: I don't care about the romance. I don't remember the romance. It doesn't draw me at all.CHARACTERS: Again, most of these characters are just bland and forgettable. I'm not drawn to them, I don't care about them, and they're annoying. Give this movie some credit, though, it has the most annoying characters ever known to Disney: Pain and Panic. GOOD GRIEF, I can't stand them!! Their actions, their characters, their VOICES?!?! MAN!!! The only good character in this film is Hades, voiced by James Woods! He is very entertaining! I was hoping he'd win in the movie. His character, his mannerism, and his character are all wonderful! I just found out James Woods ad-libbed a lot in the recording session. He brought the only good moment in this movie! Thank you, James Woods!STORY: Again, it's bland and forgettable. I don't remember that much. Nothing really matters to me. I'm sorry, but nothing here grabs me in the least. It's boring, it's stupid, and I don't learn that much about Greek mythology. Give "Pocahontas" some credit, at least we learned a little about American history. The only thing I learn about Greek myth here is the names of the gods. I don't learn anything else.CONCLUSION: Aside from James Woods as Hades, this movie left me nothing but frustration. This is one of my least favorite Disney movies. Again, if you like it, there's nothing wrong with that. It's cool. Me, however, I would definitely give this film a pass. Check it out and judge for yourselves. BOOYIKA!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A watered down Aladdin set in ancient Greece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, it's not accurate to the original Greek myth of Heracles, but that isn't what keeps this film from being much good.Hercules (1997) is a part of the second half of the oft-praised Disney Renaissance, a second golden age which ran from the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989 roughly until the release of Tarzan in 1999. Fans usually split this period into two parts: we have the Big Four from 1989 to 1994 (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King), called such because they not only innovated and revitalized Disney animation after the roughly two decade dark age following Walt Disney's death in 1966, but they were also major hits at the box office. The second half starts with the artistic misfire that was Pocahontas, a visually stunning but soulless film obviously made with the Academy Awards in mind. It was at this point that the "renaissance formula" began to become more obvious and stale. Yes, a few of the films were good (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan), but most were bland and safe wastes of time.Hercules is as safe as these films got. I think only Fantasia 2000 (1999) was more of a disappointment in taking chances. The main character, his "I Want" song, and the supporting characters are all dull. The color scheme is wretched, just a potpourri of clashing neon colors competing for your attention. The whole movie feels like a less entertaining version of Aladdin (1992) honestly. The only redeeming elements are the hilarious villain Hades and the love interest Meg's song, "I Won't Say I'm in Love."I'm glad others find merit in it, but for me, it's only a mildly pleasant mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the lesser Disney movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course, it was only a matter of time before Disney decided to take one of the Greek or Roman myths, tone down the seriousness, create a happier ending, and turn it into an animated feature for children. "Hercules", a Disney retelling of the myth of Heracles, is a film that has a good heart and probably good intentions. If it was meant to inspire children to learn more about mythology, it worked. I marginally enjoyed "Hercules" as a child. The key word is marginally, and now as an older audience member, I still marginally enjoy it, but I do see it as flawed and a little bit of a bore at times.If you want something completely faithful to the myth, definitely stray away. I wasn't planning on seeing something entirely faithful, still "Hercules" did not fully interest me. I did like the voice acting talents and I did very much enjoy how Danny DeVito did the voice of the half-human half-goat hero-trainer. But one thing I did not like was how the other characters were put on screen. And that's another problem I have with this film. I was not all for the animation style. I felt it was too vibrant, too shoddy, and I just didn't think it was eye candy. I felt Zeus looked a little preposterous among some others. And I know that many, including the Academy Awards, will disagree with me on the next point. But I did not like the main song "Go the Distance" that Hercules sings like three times in a row within twenty minutes. I'm sorry, but I just did not like it. I knew it was going to be there, but I was hoping for something better than what I got.Don't get me wrong. I did not HATE the film. There were some moments that were quite fun. Such as Hercules's legendary battle with the multi-headed Hydra. Although I felt the serpent needed better-looking heads, the scene were pretty exciting and cool to watch.Bottom line, "Hercules" will appeal to most audience viewers who like Disney movies. Again, I did marginally enjoy it, but I have seen much better films come out of Disney. I would recommend "The Jungle Book" or "The Rescuers Down Under" and for children, I would say "Hercules" is worth looking at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is funny and really good but it isn't true Greek Mythology! Firstly the main character's name is HERACLES not HERCULES! Secondly he was a DEMIGOD not a GOD! And HERA wanted tho kill him instead of HADES! And the woman that Heracles liked was called DEIANIRA not MEGANA or MEG! And CHIRON trained him not PHIL!So you get the point. If you want to know about Greek mythology read a series of books called PERCY JACKSON or HEROES OF OLYMPUS.All in all this movie is funny and cute. It does have some real Greek Mythology in it though, but very little. The story teaches you that the strength of your heart is more important than strength itself.Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>adventure scores: romance fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general I liked Hercules, and don't mind repeat viewings. As with all Disney fare, the animation is terrific. This film worked better for me than the pointless Pocahantas, Tarzan, or utterly forgettable Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a shade below Mulan. One thing it doesn't have is a memorable score, but the tunes are catchy enough. There's nothing as good as 'colors of the wind' from Pocahantas, though.The approach is fresh and interesting - recasting the story of Hercules as if he was a modern day sports hero with his own 'Air-Herc' sandals and 'Herculade' soft-drink. The Greek Chorus, a Dreamgirl-style lineup who move the plot along, was a wonderful touch. Tate Donovan is effective, earnest and yet naive as Hercules. James Wood's Hades is one of the best performances in any Disney film since Robin Williams as the genie in Aladdin and Robby Benson as the Beast in Beauty &amp; The Beast. He adds to every scene and is a terrific villain. Kudos also to the animators of Pegasus - without being annoying he manages to be expressive, funny, and a terrific sidekick. They must have had a lot of fun doing him.The film does have quite a few failings, however. The primary one is the romance between Megara and Herc. It never felt real - there was no chemistry there. I know it sounds strange for a cartoon, but she seemed to worldly, sarcastic and disinterested, they seemed to have nothing in common, and there was no moment when you could see their attraction unfolding. She isn't DRAWN that attractively either - a little shrewish and peckish. Without buying the romance, it felt like all of the moments involving that romance were simply plot points to move the film along. And since the romance is central to the motivations of the characters and the movement of the plot, this is a major failing. One scene emphasizes this: Hercules runs off to spend the day with Megara, and instead of seeing their romance blossom, we get the old trick of the writer-who-doesn't-know-how-to-create-chemistry: a quick flash to a scene later in the evening when they talk about what a great time they had together. Hey guys, Show Me Don't Tell Me.A second beef is Danny DeVito's Philoctetes. It's not that the character is bad or badly done, it's just that the animators made the character LOOK like Danny DeVito. I don't need clues like those - I can already hear his unmistakeable voice. Animation lets you do anything - it's a major failing in imagination when you make the character look like the actor who voices him. Then they did it again for Paul Shaffer's Hermes.The film doesn't follow the mythology of Hercules at all. If you're a Greek or remember the tales, you will either be confused or annoyed. Astute scholars of the myths will recognize that they have basically taken elements from almost all of the best known Greek myths and woven them around a concocted plot involving Hades freeing the Titans so he can rule on Olympus. Even Hercules' own origins are rewritten for the film. In the original, he was the child of Alcmene, a Greek woman, and Zeus, who had lain with Alcmene. Here he is the son of Zeus and Hera, stolen and turned mortal by Hades' magic potion. If Hades has this potion, and hates Zeus so much, then why doesn't he trick Zeus into drinking the damn thing, and leave the baby alone.As expected with any Hollywood film about the Greek myths, a flying horse named Pegasus is involved. In the original, Hercules never dealt with Pegasus. Pegasus was the steed of Bellerophon. As mentioned above, I'm glad Pegasus is in this one. But if you want a more loyal version, the Kevin Sorbo series with Hera as the enemy is more on the mark (but not completely).I give it a seven out of ten. It gets tens for Woods, Pegasus, the training montages with Phil and Herc, and the fights with monsters. It gets a 3 for the romance. Add another point for the animation and divide by two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of Greek mythology, so even though I really liked this movie, I couldn't stop knit-picking all the little details that Disney screwed up. Here's just a short list:1) Hercules wasn't Hera's son. In fact, she hated him!2) Amphitryon, Hercules's foster dad, wasn't alive. Zeus came to Alcmene in the form of her dead husband's spirit.3) Hercules wasn't a god. He was the son of a god (Zeus) and a mortal (Alcmene), making him a demigod. However, he did gain access to Mt. Olympus following his death. 4) The titans were not the monsters depicted in the movie. They were the Gods before the Greek Gods came on the scene, though it was after Zeus came along that they lost most of their power and got smaller jobs.5) Hades was never `sentenced' to be the God of the Underworld; he asked for the job. Zeus even tried to persuade him not to do it.6) Hercules never rode Pegasus; that's a totally different legend.OK, I'll admit that I'm anal-retentive about the facts, but honestly, I really did like the movie. James Woods was hilarious as Hades (I couldn't stop laughing, he obviously had a lot of fun doing his lines), and Megara has got to be my favorite Disney heroine ever. This is definitely a movie for all ages; as long as you can get the Greek mythology fans to shut up for five seconds, you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

And in Disney's Hercules, the house of mouse makes great use of the famous characters and setting of Greek mythology. There's some hip, gospel songs and plenty of successful humor. So much works in this movie, but it's all sadly counter-balanced by everything that doesn't work.Hercules is born to the god and goddess, Zeus and Hera respectively. And while there is joy at his arrival, Hades wishes to do away with the baby, as his fortune reveals Hercules as a potential threat. Hades sends his two dim-witted minions, Pain and Panic to turn Hercules mortal, and then kill him. Unfortunately for Hades, Pain and Panic slip up when Hercules transformation from god to mortal gets stopped part way through, causing Hercules to retain his supernatural strength, but remain mortal. Hercules longs to be reunited with his parents and the other gods, though he cannot until he becomes a hero, which will then allow him to be turned back into a god.The set up for this story is extremely rushed, and feels almost tacked on. It's like Disney didn't want to spend much time developing the opening, and were more interested in cutting to the action. As a result, there isn't much at the beginning that's of interest, with the exception of one excellent gospel-style song, but I'll get to that later.The characters are mostly uninteresting. Hercules and the romantic interest, Megara (known as Meg) are almost completely personality-less, while Philoctetes (known as Phil), Hercules' trainer, is just a big grump. Only the villain, Hades, is at all interesting, even if he's basically just a hipper version of Jafar or Scar.Focusing less on story, Hercules relies on humor to get by. And while most of the humor is successful and funny, there aren't many big laughs here. Disney's next attempt at a hip comedy (The Emperor's New Groove) is a much more successful and enjoyable film.There's some curious character oversights, and some muddled messages here and there. There are dull stretches, and the action at the end is a bit excessive. Flaws are not hard to find.The songs are of ranging success. The majority of the songs are jazzy gospel tunes, complete with a group of African-American women singing the lyrics. Not only are these songs an innovative and refreshing concept, but the songs are fun and energetic too. It's hard to suppress a smile during these delightful numbers. And yet, there are two songs that don't fit into the gospel theme. They are entitled "Go the Distance" and "Our Last Hope." Both are relatively terrible and instantly forgettable. "Go the Distance" exists only to explain Hercules' desire to go home. This is the kind of song that could've been written in 5 minutes over lunch. "Our Last Hope" has a terrible rhythm and bland lyrics and is ultimately, a mess.It surprises me that a song was not provided for the villain, Hades. Just about every Disney films has had a song for the villain, so why did Hades have to miss out? His slick and sly personality would've been perfect for a nice jazzy beat.The voice cast is a mixed bag. Tate Donovan provides a bland voice for Hercules, and Danny DeVito does the same for Phil. Susan Egan's voice for Meg is much more unique. It's a shame there wasn't an interesting character to go with it. James Wood is wonderful as Hades, providing a perfectly sly and confident voice for the villain.The animation is detailed enough, but the animation style is a bit of a problem. The flat, geometric look just makes the animation appear cheap and lazy. CGI is occasionally integrated into the animation, and it looks great.Alan Menken's score is superb, if a little shy of his work in other Disney films of the time. Grand melodies and exciting action music make this score a success, even though it sounds a bit familiar to Menken's score for Aladdin.Sometimes funny, but riddled with flaws, Hercules is a disappointing Disney feature. As much as I wanted to like Hercules, there's just so much that doesn't work here. I felt uninterested in the characters and the story, and for most of the film, I was just waiting for the next toe-tapping gospel tune. The 90's was a great time for Disney, but Hercules may not be the best example of such success.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I'll admit that the music is not half bad. But as for the people who say that it's not important that it be true to the mythology, that's not what us myth-lovers are complaining about. At least for me. I don't know about the rest of them. I am complaining that with this movie Disney took a great story and Christianized it. They corrupted it, they took all of the decency out of it. This movie is to the myth what saccharine is to sugar. And I say that not only because artificial sweetener will never be better than the real thing, but because this movie is in fact nauseatingly saccharine in its "adaptation". Just a few ways in which this movie was Christianized and had all of the punch taken out of the real story: for one, Hera is NOT Hercules' mother, she is the one trying to kill him. But of course, in a Disney movie we have to have the happy family, right? And since we need a new villain, hm, let's see...why not just pin it on the lord of the underworld? Who, I might add, has no demonic connotations in Greek myth and whose only appearance in the Hercules story is when Hercules is tasked to bring Cerberus from Hades and back to the king alive. In the end of the real story, Hercules is driven mad by Hera and kills his wife, "Meg", and his entire family. This kind of interpretation makes me sick because it's just another example of society thinking that children can't handle anything remotely serious. But, to end on an up note, the music was catchy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know Disney movies are well known for straying far away from the original plots of the stories they portray but this really takes the cake. I love Greek myths, I've read all the ones I could get my hands on and my favorite God happens to be Hades. That's why when I went back to watch this movie again I was appalled the way they portrayed him. Hades is not evil, he is not trying to take over his brother's throne. He rules the underworld. He is the lord of the dead but again that doesn't make him evil.This movie strayed so far from the original myth it's a travesty. I would advise against seeing it if you have any interests in Greek Myths at all. Hades is currently being shown to the public as a comic fool instead of the powerful quiet God he really was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This animation is a big mockery of great Greek mythology. Even when I was about 10 years old, seems I knew about Greek mythology A LOT more than creators of this film. Almost every fact they give us is fake. Like - Musas were nine, not five, none of them was fat, Hercules died BEFORE Achilles, his mother was HUMAN woman, not god, so he born Human, not God and etc and etc without ending. They could have spent at least a weak reading Greek mythology before creating this rubbish. At least if they had added True ending of this myth - when Megera killed Hercules with poison - it would have been at least little bit more interesting, but now... I believe it was possible to create story, which one was not far away from myth and would be as interesting as this one had to be. I don't likes stories, which tells lie, and pretends they are telling truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ancient Greeks and Romans were twisting the Hercules legend out of shape long before Disney got hold of it. So I'll skip the usual complaints about Hercules being Hera's son, there being a demon named `Panic' and so on. I can understand people objecting on these grounds; I think such objections are often justified, but misguided in this particular case; but there are arguments on both sides I would need to present if I were to discuss the case here - and so I won't. Let me just stipulate that fiddling around with classical mythology does not, in this case, matter. If you disagree - well, you disagree.Alan Menken's music is hugely disappointing. So is Musker and Clement's handling of it - they once showed a great flair for staging songs, but here they seem, for the most part, uncertain as to how to work the material in. (A notable exception is `One Last Hope'.) On the plus side, animation has never been better. Disney hasn't had a villain so well animated since 1967, possibly 1961. (Look up the relevant villains, if you want.) Computer-rendering the hydra was I think a mistake, as computer rendering usually is, but that was a good scene, so I'll waive the objection. -Oh, yes: I should also put in a word for the general look imparted by Gerald Scarfe.The story, really, was a strong one. I have to say `really' because it's easy to come away with the impression that it was not, because of one tiny element: the big battle at the end. Hercules defeated the bad guys with ludicrous ease in a weak and perfunctory scene - it lasts just seconds. This is a serious problem in the work of Musker and Clements. If you look at `The Little Mermaid', `Aladdin' and `Hercules' you'll note that they all have a ridiculously large-scale set piece at the end which tends to prompt the reaction, `Yeah, yeah.' They'll HAVE to do something about this. For the story, was, as I say - look at it objectively and ignore the concluding battle - strong. And AFTER the battle, when Hercules ... Let's just say I found this smaller drama to be much more exciting, and certainly more creative.So it wasn't quite what it could have been. Nonetheless I predict that `Hercules' will wear its years lightly; already, it is looking stronger, more muscular, and more likely to be immortal, than `Aladdin' ever did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules is hands down, the worst of the Disney animated films, and I have seen most of them. There is too much bad here for me to recommend it to anyone.The songs weren't very good. Hercules' main song sounds like "Eye of the Tiger" or worse, a South Park parody, which I am sure wasn't their intent, but it was laughable. The Muses' gospel song clashed with the whole Greek myth idea and I have no idea why someone thought that was a good idea. The animation itself seemed flat as compared to other features. Even the plot line wasn't that interesting, full of pop culture references until you burst, characters that weren't very intriguing and really the only suspense came from seeing how badly Disney could mangle Greek myth. I suppose kids are more sophisticated these days and need more adult acting cynical characters and modern culture references in order to keep their ADD in line, but I would like movies with good characters, good animation and a plot. I know it is a Disney film and it is for kids. But I remember at that age, I was reading the real Greek myths. Watching this could mess kids up when they read actual mythology. For example, Hera and Zeus were not a loving couple and Hera tried to kill Heracles with snakes not Hades. The reason? Because Hercules was born to a mortal woman and Zeus. Now, I know Disney thinks they are sly for changing Megera's name to Megara, so they could make her anything they wanted, but it comes off as confusing to anyone who knows myth. Hercules killed Megera later on in the story, but I suppose Disney can't have anything bad happen in their stories, even their fairy tales aren't so Grimm. Even giving them that, they could have done better than this. Even making something completely their own would be better than this. Why do a take on the Greek myths at all? Why not just do something modern?And the difference between features like Hercules and older ones like Snow White and Cinderella, is that the older movies have charm and you can see all the work and talent that went into them. The modern Disney fare, other than Beauty and the Beast, is produced a lot faster and the product looks rushed, without much soul. Like another reviewer, I didn't find myself excited by any of the songs in this one and I like a lot of the Disney soundtracks. It's just a dud on too many level to make it watchable except by very small children who don't know better and Disney fanatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lackluster Disney movie that tells the story of Hercules. The whole thing lacks creativity, calculatedly following the Disney formula to the letter. We have stupid comic relief sidekicks, cheesy songs, a clichéd story, and lots of dumb in-jokes and references. It's moderately well-made for what it is but 'what it is' is the problem. I thought the voice work was fine and the animation not bad (but nothing terribly impressive). The songs are really lame, including the insufferably corny "Go the Distance." Of the films that came out during Disney's Renaissance period, this is one of the worst. Not a terrible watch when viewed in a bubble but, if you've seen even a few Disney animated films before, this will seem very tired and unoriginal. The worst part of it all is that, despite all the action and comedy, it's incredibly dull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat flawed and superfluous, but still has that Disney spark of magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's Hercules is an odd mix of elements. It takes Ancient Greek mythology, completely twists it around while still retaining enough to keep it recognizable, adds painfully bright pastel colour palette, throws in some CGI and simpering sidekicks, and crowns it all off with a soundtrack that takes all of its inspiration from American gospel music. Interesting choices, if nothing else.Now, some of that I'm completely okay with. I don't really care that there are only five muses, instead of nine like there are in the original mythology. I don't think nine would have been too much, seeing that they're usually the ones singing and gospel music is well-equipped to large crowds singing it, but it's okay. Though it is a bit strange that they dropped Euterpe, the muse of song and music (and elegiac poetry), from the lineup. The use of CGI is also a bit jarring nowadays, because it hasn't aged that well, but I can see that they wanted to experiment with a new technology. Disney has always done that, though usually with better results. What is a bit harder for me to understand is the fact that they made Hades the villain instead of Hera, who was Hercules's main nemesis in the original myths, seeing as she was jealous that her husband Zeus had slept with a mortal woman, siring Hercules in the process. Or Heracles, as he should be called, because this is the Greek version of the myth. Then again, Disney is all about family values, so it's not that surprising. And James Woods does brilliant as the voice actor of Hades.What really keeps me from liking this film more is the main hero, unfortunately. Hercules just isn't all that interesting of a guy, especially when compared to the ones that came just before him. Simba, Belle, Aladdin, Quasimodo, all of these deep, tragic main characters. And yeah, Hercules has his problems, but he still comes across as that perfect high school jock. You know, the nice one, who could have starred in any breakfast cereal commercial he wanted, was the homecoming king, went on to have a successful career in sports, founded a perfect family and died at the age of one hundred, surrounded by grandkids. You have nothing against the guy, but you're also not really all that interested in the details of his life.Then again, Megara is great, Hades is excellent, Zeus is enjoyably over the top and boisterous, Phil and Pegasus are alright and the rest of the cast do their jobs. The animation is also very nice, though personally I'm not a fan of the colour palette, but that's a pet peeve of mine and not a fault of the film in any way. And while the songs and the music style are not outright classics like so many other Disney soundtracks of the 90s, there are some decent songs in the mix. Though couldn't you have given Hades a villain song? It would have been glorious.Ultimately Hercules is one of the weaker Renaissance films, but still lands somewhere in the middle as far as the overall quality of Disney films is to be considered. It has its flaws, but is still an enjoyable experience for kids and adults alike. Give it a try if you haven't already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has some plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animated movie Hercules, overall is a good movie for children. But if you actually pay attention you'll notice a couple major plot holes. The first one is when hades wants to kill baby Hercules. This part is when the baby Hercules turns mortal. Hades has Pain and Panic(his minions) make Hercules drink a potion that turns him mortal so they can kill him. If you don't already know this, Hades is the God of death, so he would know if Pain and Panic killed Hercules right? In this case no. Yes, it is a kids movie but if they didn't include the part of killing Hercules and made it so pain and panic only had to make him mortal. If Hercules was mortal, he wouldn't be able to foil Hades' plan. Also, why would hades trust Pain and Panic when he could do it himself and know that the deed was done. From the first time Pain and Panic come into the story, you can tell that they can't do anything right. Which includes making a baby drink a potion and then kill it.Another plot hole is the fact that hades could've had the fates kill Hercules. He obviously can charm them enough to learn why he can do to take over the world. Hades could've just had the fates kill Hercules. Hercules was a good children's movie but if you are watching it and have to review it for an assignment you'll notice more things wrong with the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules was made in 1997 and Disney kinda lost its marbles a bit with this one and I'm gonna start off with the negative side first just to get it out of the way.......THE SONGS. I swear I do like I Can Go The Distance and I Won't Say I'm In Love,but the rest of the songs were just dreadful and the man who's responsible for this is ALAN MENKEN the same man that brought us Pocahontas,Beauty &amp; The Beast,Enchanted and Tangled(which had a better score BTW). Its kinda confusing because the ending credits song was sung by Micheal Bolton(yeah that husky male singer who sings When A Man Loves A Woman)I mean what is the score suppose to represent Gospel Church Music or Pop music,cause I'm confused.Well alright enough about me bashing the songs what's the movie about well the movie is about a Greek God named Hercules(voiced first by Josh Keaton and later by Tate Donovan)who was sent to Earth by Hades and his sidekicks who are body shifters(they can literally turn themselves into humans or animals)cause Hades wants to rule the kingdom and his got a grudge against Hercules dad(voiced by Rip Thorn). Of course when Hercules grows up and becomes a hero(like Superman or Rocky)he meets a sly sarcastic woman named Meg(voiced by Broadway Singer and Actress Susan Egan)who's also very flirty,but is she for real or is she hiding something from Hercules.Bottom line I did enjoy Hercules for its animation and the charcthers were great(if I had to be honest I found Meg to be my favourite cause she was mysterious and sarcastic yet nice at the same time).One scene did have me laughing and it was when Meg said this I'm a damsel i'm in distress,I can handle this,have a nice day, that was funny.Overall is Hercules the best Disney movie ever NO its not its pretty above average,but do I like it yeah sure its a good flick,despite the fact the songs to its credit are good but some of them are just all over the place.So its a 6 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been one of Disney's best, but ends up problematic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a person who really enjoys Disney films, despite my age. (I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic.First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as "The Muses". They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. "Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades!" I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic.I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here.This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas. I mainly say that in the "Zero to Hero" song. You see all those flashing lights and lighting changes, and you see some modern-like products placed like "Herculade" and "Air-Herc". If I'm watching something that took place a very long time ago, I don't wanna see something similar to Gatorade. Sure, Aladdin had that too in the "Friend Like Me" song, but it makes sense because he has a magic genie. Here, it doesn't.But the reason I think it's decent is because, like I said, it does have a great story to tell. It's just told very weirdly. I also like the comedy in it. The scene where Pain and Panic are getting a lot of Hercules merchandise is really funny.Overall, this could've been a movie good enough to be considered one of Disney's best. It just had too many problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney-animated take on the Greek demigod Hercules and his mythical adventures begins with a spirited gospel number (!) and rarely lets up from there. Amusing, beautifully-designed package with bright musical interludes is certain to engage kids and grown-ups. Terrific voice-over work from Tate Donovan, Danny De Vito, Charlton Heston, and James Woods (perfect as Hercules' nemesis Hades, Lord of the Underworld) is a big plus, however the climactic events of the story are frenetic and routine, leading to a dispiriting conclusion. Still, fairly smart and enjoyable, with a freewheeling pace and a good sense of humor. Lots of fun! **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far form being one of my favorites Disney movies (and one of the best ones at all), I believe it's a nice movie, where humor, serious moments and Disney's main themes (friendship, love, loyalty,) are mixed up well, even if it has nothing to do with the original myth (but this doesn't ruin the film at all). However, the real reason I like this movie is Hades, a perfect villain in my own opinion: evil but also very funny, especially when he argues with Pain and Panic, his two followers. As for the soundtrack (which is really an important part of Disney productions), I have to say that it's not the best one I know: if you take other movies, such as "Aladdin" or "The Lion King" you will find better songs. However, it's not so bad: some songs are very nice!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, there are a lot of things I like about this movie. The animation, in general, is very nice to look at, and Charlton Heston's narration is very satisfying. And it is one of the funnier Disney movies with a witty and funny script. More pluses are a genius turn from Danny DeVito as the hilarious Phil, and a wonderfully sleazy James Woods as the hot-headed villain Hades( a great villain, might I add?)Rip Torn also has fun as Zeus, especially when his statue came to life. The incidental music is lovely as well. However, there are a few negatives. Hercules himself, both child and adult, is a little bland, but Meg manages to establish herself as one of the best female Disney characters. Also, there isn't much of a story. The prove-you're- a-hero formula was a little unoriginal for me. The biggest minus was the rather dull songs by Alan Menken. The songs, especially "Zero to Hero" were a real disappointment, as Menken had so much better work before this, namely Beauty and the Beast. However, Michael Bolton's rendition of Go the Distance(the only song I had no problem with)was a joy to behold, as was "I won't say I'm in love". It wasn't a good idea turning gospel, should've stayed with the classical. However, despite the flaws, I did enjoy Hercules, which is a 7/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Disney animated piece(save for that one segment of Fantasia... and yeah, they are pretty darn similar, in some ways) to be inspired by mythology, not fairy tale. As usual, liberties are taken, and history buffs may want to abstain from intake of liquids during their viewing, so as to prevent spit-takes. It is a fun film, however. Woods clearly has fun with the part, as confirmed by the Trivia page, and any moment his character is on-screen is enjoyable(which is not to say that the rest isn't). DeVito more or less plays himself, but his self ain't bad. Torn is marvelous. Goldthwait is not bad at all. The plot is good, as is the moral to the film. The pacing is great. The visual style is fitting, characters reminiscing the depictions from the time. The animation is well-done, and both it, and the design, hold plenty of energy and creativity. The 3D elements are nicely done, and the use of color is effective. Dialog is well-done. Characters are, as well. Music choices are... interesting, in some cases. There are some well-integrated references here and there, herein, for us fans of mythology(the Greek of it, mind you). Comedy leans towards the positive(what exactly *is* with all the Jewish stuff, though? Not that I mind, mind you). The DVD has some good special features, including two videos(in addition to a short making of), one consisting of artwork, the other of clips, as the actual myths, in reasonable detail, are explained. I recommend this to any fan of mythology and/or the Disney feature-length musicals. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Genre: Based on Greek myths, animation, relationships.Actors: Famous ones are Danny DeVito (Phil) and James Woods (Hades).Main characters: Hercules, Zeus, Meg and Hades.What happens: Hercules is the son of the ALL POWERFUL Greek God Zeus. The day Hercules is born, he is captured and made mortal (only three of the characters know how this happens). Someone makes Hercules mortal and then he is adopted by mortal humans. This is only the beginning?Message: That you are a hero if you love as well as fight.My thoughts: I like this film. I think it has more of a potential of being liked to a 8-11 aged audience, as I liked it more than I do now at that age. I still like it because it is very fun, the animation is different, a little weird, but quite good! I also still like the characters, especially Meg and Phil and Hades is funny and I like funny baddies in Disney films. Of course I like all the good Greek Gods, they are somehow potentially likable. I used to like Pain and Panic (Hades's servants) a lot when I was younger, but I'm starting to like them less now because I'm growing up and they are growing a little too silly for my liking. Also this film has a good share of slapstick AND wit in it for my entertainment. I also really like the songs, especially "Go The Distance" and "I Won't Say I'm In Love" or whatever it's called. My favourite character is Phil because I like his personality and he also looks kind of cute when he's excited and happy when to most people he's supposed to be quite UGLY (but I don't agree with that). So I like this film! Recommended to: Mainly people who are aged 8-11, people who like animated Disney films and for people who like "fun" films. Enjoy! :-)7 and a half out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something I noticed, after thinking about this movie again, now that I am no longer a little kid. I know this is a kid's movie, but it really bugs me when Disney presents wrong facts. And I feel this one has a big one. It presents Hercules as the son of Zeus and Hera (a god turned mortal), when in reality he was born half-god, as the son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmene (though after Hercules's 12 tasks he did become a god... but that is another story, and has nothing to do with this comment). Also did you notice that Megaera (Meg) is actually the name of the one of the 3 Furies? I am not sure she really took on the role of the Furies, other than working with Hades, but it's just something I noticed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland and narrow animated Disney flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read that this movie doesn't stand true to the Greek Mythology, which doesn't really matter for me cause I have no interest in Greek Mythology much. I thought this movie was passable when I first saw it as a kid, nothing worth re-watching but just alright. However watching it now, it just seemed too simple and bland with almost no real substance. It didn't even appear like much effort was put into it, but to just make another animated Disney movie. Watching this was like watching another 3 episode of a animated TV show on Saturday. Everything is just so darn narrow and predictable that it really does take away from the experience. Not only that, even the hero is super bland and the supporting character adds more flavor to this movie. Overall this is a forgettable flick that is maybe worth a watch only if you are a kid.4.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my least favorite Disney movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Disney's 35th full-length animated film, a story about Hercules, son of Zeus, who was turned into a half-god, half-mortal by the evil Hades, who plans to overthrow Zeus. Hercules must become a hero if he is to return to Mt. Olympus and, along the way, his friend Pegasus and his personal trainer, Phil the satyr, try to help him.Like most Disney movies, the animation is vibrant. However, the overall story and plot wasn't entertaining and the movie's pace dragged. There is no suspense built-up and I thought the film was trying to be just one, huge laugh-fest, but resulted in overzealous characters with poor slapstick comedy and jokes.I know this is a cartoon movie but, in earlier Disney films, especially ones given Walt's personal touch, the filmmakers at least gave the movies realistic and believable treatment. "Hercules" doesn't attempt to do that, as evident with parts such as Hercules uttering, "Look, I'm an action figure!" It's a movie set with a Greek mythology theme, so, I wished it was treated at least a little more seriously. To top if off, the music was unremarkable; songs had no substance.Overall, if you're looking for a Disney movie to watch with the kids or to just pass the time, watch for ones prior to Aladdin, especially those made before 1980.Grade D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gods and Monsters: HERCULES is one of Disney's funniest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: The typical masterpiece Disney is capable of. Pure magic! The gods must be funny in this hilarious animated smash from the ever-talented animation artists at Disney. HERCULES, which was released after the studio dared to venture into darker territory with THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, returns to the kind of light, fun-loving musical adventure. Despite being a magnificent instant classic of its own, THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME proved to be too dark for the usual Disney routine. If that case so, HERCULES is a good throwback to the days of ALADDIN and THE LITTLE MERMAID. It may just be their funniest yet.The movie is a twist on the tales of Greek Mythology, namely the story of the title character (voiced by Tate Donovan), who happens to be the son of the great god Zeus (voiced by Rip Torn) who is robbed of his godly powers and turned mortal... sort of by the evil Lord Hades (voiced with maniacal glee by James Woods). Unfortunate for the hot-headed, comical Lord of the Underworld, Hercules maintained his god-like strength, making him look like a freak in the eyes of everyone else. So young "Herc" set on a voyage to find his true identity and reclaim his destiny as a god on Mount Olympus. Aiding as his mentor is a tough-mouthed satyr named Phil (voiced by Danny DeVito) and his magical bird-brained Pegasus, while also tempted by a lovely maiden named Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), short for Megara, who may just have a weakness for his "Wonder Boy"'s charms.The magic of Disney's timeless animation is still stirring and imaginative, but the voice cast have never been more appropriate. James Woods was born to play the villain Hades. He basically steals the scenes he's in, if not the whole movie. He may be the bad guy, but you'll like hims so much, he's good! Other than Woods is Danny DeVito, who imbues his familiar voice and personality to his character Phil and comes up with a character that even adults will love. Then there are the lovely singing muses, who tells the series of events through winning musical numbers (reminiscent to the Greek Chorus from LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS). The songs by the way are written none other than brilliant lyricist Alan Menken (ALADDIN), here whipping yet another magnificent strain of brilliant songs. Mythology fans, film fans and musical fans rejoice! Here's the gods to deliver all your requests. Gather the family together! Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has it's moments, but basically nothing more than a Flintstones rip-off.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was a kid, and quite liked it. Actually, I still do like it a bit, but not as much as before, because I now know the meaning of most of the supposedly meaningless jokes throughout the film. Basically, this is just a Flintstones rip-off.Want to know why I believe that? Because of the nature of the film, the characters and the setting. Of course, it was meant to be funny, and I did find a couple of the jokes funny, but it just went too far. First of all, the film did not take place in Ancient Greece. It was just USA modelled after it. Second, the characters were too American to be considered Greek people. Third, the excessive American jokes, such as "Jerkules"; "Somebody call IX I I" (9-1-1); calling a baby God a "Sunspot"; seeing Narcissus (who wasn't even a God) kissing his own reflection in a mirror; Hades "working himself to death", in Zeus's words; calling Zeus "Boltboy" or "Mr. Lightning Bolts"......YUCK!! Too American for my taste, especially with the Gods being like laid-back American snobs (except for Hera, who I thought was the only convincing character in the movie).Practically, this was either a Flintstones rip-off or a remake of "Hercules in New York". Personally, "Hercules in New York" was a better title for this movie.It had it's moments, but too unreal (too Americanised). 5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hercules" is one more triumph from directors Clements and Musker. Perfectly reproducing ancient Greece's time and culture, they produce an uninterested animation and fill it with gags without being ridiculous. But they had another advantage, which was the team that they worked with. The mix with gospel music was great, and Alan Menken songs were even greater, giving you a smile in your face and all the gospel power, combined with David Zippel happy lyrics. Voice workers were just perfect for their roles, giving the film a special life. DeVitto is a natural Phil, Susan Egan is a sexy Meg, James Woods is a delicious Hades. Animators really made a great work, not beautiful as "Beauty and the Beast" but rich in movements and valuing the essential body lines. The story adaptation is another thing that they did very well. The muses are the best narrators and probably the best Disney characters ever. You don't need to care about those stupid commenters that complain about errors and disagreements with the original legend, because this film is just a new version of the legend, an even better version of the legend. The only complain I agree with is that the joker spirit of Clements and Musker is something that has to be careful. Sometimes in this movie there are moments of tension that are almost (i said almost) broken because of unnecessary jokes or interventions. But it does not destroy the movie's spirit. It's great stuff, for children and adults, and Disney's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last Disney's great movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that no one wants to admit that this is a good movie because of it's unseriousness, and because of the fact that Hercules here is depicted more as a super-hero rather then a classic mythical hero.Don't listen to those who curse the movie because it doesn't stick to original myths. Does anyone really want to see Zeus as he is depicted in myths - as a horny geezer who f***ed everyone BUT Hera? Who really cares about the accuracy? The movie is fun, hilarious, and has a nice love story. Megara (or Meg if you want) is a great character. Nice change after all those fair princesses like Jasmin and Pocahontas (don't get me wrong, I like them). Hades is also a great villain (thanks to James Woods), and I also liked his two stooges ("Thirsty?" -best scene).The movie's downfall was the music. I expected more from Menken. None of the songs are memorable like ''A Whole New World'' or ''Colors of The Wind''. While the songs sung by the Muses sound nice thanks to the singing voices and the song ''Go the distance'' has a catchy tune, the words are a crying shame. Lyrics in ''Go the distance'' are so shallow, obvious and soulless, and repetitive. It makes the song boring after certain time of listening. The only song I liked was Meg's "I won't say I'm in love".And to wrap it up - one of Disney's different projects, but fun nonetheless. It's got nice story, good humor all the way, and a teensy weensy bit of a tearful ending. So there's something for everyone.Oh, yeah! And watch it at least three times, to see it's full quality.</fullReview>

Bland animation, bad music (the Muses need to shut up - oh yeah, and that song "I Won't Say" - oh God I think I need a vomit bag!), and, aside from James Woods, ho-hum voice acting. Funny parts here and there (mostly with Woods) but aside from the self-referential merchandising jabs, nothing to write home about. And the plot, with absolutely no parallel in Greek mythology, is rather bland. But, hell, it's all worth it to see James Woods as Hades.... oh yeah, and the ending. *sniff* I haven't felt this choked up since I got a hunk of MUSAKA caught in my throat, huh? huh?...

		<fullReview>Sometimes modern Disney and I don't get along. They're too musical, too hokey, and more often than not have cookie cutter formulas. Despite all this, many modern Disney movies are still quite good and have strong stories. Hercules is something different. While the characters are no more worse than usual, the story is Disney's most shallow and unsatisfying yet. It is occasionally funny, and it tries to be a comedy like Aladdin. Aladdin, however, was inspired, had a refreshing story, and was a technical marvel. Hercules just comes off as being no more than an extended Saturday morning cartoon. If all you want is comedy, by all means watch this and laugh your head off. But if you want comedy with a little something extra, there are other Disney movies out there that are better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very interesting, but with script failures.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Hercules, a bastard son of the Greek god Zeus, whom immortality is stolen and, therefore, is given to humans to be created, becoming a hero thanks to his impressive strength. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who also ensure the writing of the script, the film has excellent designs, a good cast of voice actors and musical pieces by Alan Menken.Despite all the efforts in merchandising, this movie is not the best that Disney has presented. First, the script is nothing more than an adaptation, too free and imaginative, of a classic legend, much publicized in mythology. The film does not tell the whole tale, preferring to create a new story with some of the elements found in myth, ignoring everything that does not fit the intention of making a film for children. One of the most interesting and comical characters is Phil, a chubby faun who becomes coach and friend of Hercules. At times, he steals the attention of the Greek hero. The way the film puts the nine Muses (as Soul singers and narrators of the story) does not convinced nor pleased. More interesting was Meg, a character who exemplifies the way the ancient Greeks regarded the woman, a beautiful thing, but bad and that could be dangerous.In any case, this film is still good, deserve to be seen and appreciated for what it is</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aren't you a damsel in distress?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hercules visibly diverges from the darkness of its Greek mythology source material for a brighter, more hopeful tale. It posits that a hero is not just someone who does heroic deeds but can also place himself in front of others and sacrifice his own well-being for those who need it more. Pretty simply, sappy Hollywood stuff. But it works marvellously. Disney do not ever hold back on the camp, which is perhaps why it is able to be digested and enjoyed so easily. The gods of the Olympus are all clearly drawn, multicoloured caricatures - not withholding the power couple themselves, Zeus with his hulking, bulging muscles and the stick-thin, bright pink Hera. The sarcastic yet sultry Megara is animated in a way that is not subtle about each exaggerated swing of her hips, and it is enough to make Herc and other young boys' jaws drop. The scene-stealer is James Woods' Hades, who could have been brooding and muttering darkly from the shadows, but bursts into fits of rage and quips like a comedian gone mad. Too many adaptations have made Hades into a dark, humourless character, a baddie played straight. Woods brings attitude, and a fiery temper matched only by his quick wit. The same subversion is applied to the opening narration. Of course Disney would never let this be a mopey, grim story with dark undercurrents and pessimistic endeavours. The regularly employ the bait and stitch, drawing on the audience's knowledge of these tales and then pulling the rug from right under us. The best and funniest example of this happens at the climatic sacrifice on Hercules' part; he dives into Styx, wading through dead souls and withering away right before our eyes. Quiet a shock from the ever-grinning, bouncing action figure that has dominated much of the film. This is intercut with the Fates inching closer and closer to his life-line, the music ominously building...until they actually try to cut it and it just won't snap and they descend into mayhem in forcing the issue. A less inspired example would be the glowing Hercules abruptly caving in Hades' face without the slightest acknowledgement of the slapstick manner of the moment. Of course, nostalgia plays his part. I find myself noticing things that I had not previously. The film could have used another half hour; stretch out his young, fish-out-of-water existence, or the training montage that leads him to become an over-excited action figure. The CGI Hydra is an unavoidable element, and clashes so horribly with the rest of the clean-cut animation (though they have merged some of Herc's sword swings well). And there is one thing that most kids would not notice. The animation of the facial expressions is at times quite bizarre; it is like when you pause a video and inexplicably create a funny, morphed face, only these don't need pausing to pop up. It does not take too much away because the film's zaniness never slows down enough to be sensible. And the songs are still great. Go the Distance is intimate enough for Hercules, but targets a universal feeling that we all know too well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules is just another Disney movie where generally the positives edge out the negatives. While plenty of moments seemed dull to me, the music was killer (as is expected from almost anything composed by the formidable team of Disney and Alan Menken), plenty of the characters are likable or sufferable, the humor is good, the action is present and stimulating, and it offers new insight to little children about Heracles himself. It is one that I re-watched before considering the challenge of watching all animated Disney movies (which got into theaters), and both times, I enjoyed the concept and execution of the story. I would most definitely say that this film is around 7.2, because there are a few dull moments and strange references that would more fit 1997 Greece than Ancient Greece (including a Scar pelt and two men who resemble John Musker and Ron Clements, who directed this film). See it if you covet the trio of Musker, Clements and Menken, because they can make some excellent stuff (including The Little Mermaid, from what I've heard, and Aladdin).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Familiar Greek Hero Gets a Hilarious 90's Twist from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hercules is a 1997 animated feature film and the 35th full-length animated feature in the Walt Disney Animation Studios Canon. The film stars James Woods, Charlton Heston, Danny Devito, Tate Donovan, Rip Torn, Matt Frewer, and Bobcat Goldthwait. Loosely adapted from the Grecian legend Heracles, son of Zeus and Alcmene and great-grandson/half-brother of Perseus, this incarnation of the Greek hero is given a hip, modern-day, 90s Disney vibe to it! The plot of the film starts on Mount Olympus, where all of the legendary Greek gods live. Hercules (voiced by Joshua Keaton/Tate Donovan), the son of Zeus and Herra, is born possessing god-like strength as a young toddler. In fact, he is so strong that when Hades (voiced by James Woods from "Any Given Sunday"), lord of the Underworld visits Olympus bearing a gift, he gets his finger crushed by Hercules. This infuriates Hades so much that he, along with his hilarious and loyal henchmen Pain and Panic (voiced by stand-up comic Bobcat Goldthwait and Matt Frewer from "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"), devise a plan to kill the immortal Hercules by turning him into a mortal human being after Hades gets insight from three bizarre and grotesque characters known as the Fates who can reveal the past, present, and future that Hercules could prove to be a threat to Hades taking over Mount Olympus in the future. While they were successful in turning him mortal, they didn't kill him as Hades wanted so as he was planning his uprising, Hercules lived his life on earth after being rescued and taken in by two humans, where he would grow up. After various circumstances caused Hercules to realize that he was different than everyone he was around, he, along with his trusty friend and sidekick since birth Pegasus, seek out Zeus, who then tells him to find Phil (voiced by Danny Devito from "Batman Returns"), the trainer of a lot of "would-be" heroes so he can prove himself to be a true hero and rejoin Zeus on Olympus. Once he does this, he then goes out to prove to Zeus and everyone else that he has what it takes to become a true hero. Along the way, he meets the snarky, sarcastic, and free-spirited Meg (voiced by Susan Egan), who goes on to become Hercules' eventual love interest and will later cause our hero to have to make a critical decision and prove that a "true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength, but by the strength of his heart." From the opening narration by the legendary Charlton Heston to the rapid fire comedy delivered by James Woods' portrayal of Hades to the gospel-like numbers written by Academy-Award Winning Composer Alan Menken ("Beauty and the Beast", "Aladdin") and David Zippel and sung by the Muses, this movie is a worthy addition to the Disney Renaissance and a more light-hearted themed departure from the dark and grim themes seen in The Hunchback of Notre Dame the previous year. I honestly don't see why this movie gets so much flack for being the weakest film of the Disney Renaissance when personally I think that Pocahontas was the weakest film of the Disney Renaissance because of the lack of a strong story and strong antagonist (which are two things that Hercules has). The characters are great (my favorite is Hades) and the animation, story, and music done in a way that can only be done in the grand tradition and innovation of Walt Disney. If you haven't seen this movie and you're looking for a good movie to watch for family movie night, go to your local movie store or Netflix and watch it! You won't be disappointed! This was released during Disney's most profitable era to date and I still pop this in the VCR every once in a while! My rating: Two thumbs way, way up!!! 10/10!!!</fullReview>

Hercules a baby boy who is thrown out of Mount Olympus and ends up being raised by mortal human beings. His father is the Greek god Zeus so Hercules is also a good. He has super strength and needs to learn how to control this special power. This part really teaches people to me. It really teaches people that they need control and guidance and to learn how to be patient. Because if you do then good things will happen. Later on in this movie he meets a girls named Meg. He rescues this girl from a monster or so he thinks. Later on in the movie it is revealed that Meg sold her soul and now works for the Greek god of the underworld "Hades." The now man named Hercules starts to become a hero and thinks he earns his title but later learns from his father that just by killing beasts and becoming famous this doesn't prove you are a hero. So like all Disney movie he ends up defeating Hades and get Med. it ends up in a happy ending.</fullReview>

I will admit I thought this was how the story of Hercules occurred before reading the original myth. But even after that disappointment, it still is another Disney classic in the right places. The animation is solid, especially with the Titans, through a brilliant combination of CG and traditional animation. James Woods as Hades is also another huge highlight for me, making him one of my all time favorite villains in the Disney catalog. The music is also pretty solid too, best song done by Danny DeVito.

		<fullReview>Hercules (1997): Dir: Ron Clements, John Musker / Voices: Tate Donovan, Danny De Vito, James Woods, Rip Torn, Susan Egan: Weak animation by Disney based on the Greek myth with Zeus ridding the earth of all disasters and his son Hercules is born. He is kidnapped and forced to drink a potion prepared by Hades that would rid Hercules of his strength. The catch being that he must drink every last drop, which obviously doesn't happen. He is raised on earth and brought into knowledge of who he is. When he finally meets Zeus he is informed that in order to become a true hero he must be trained. Crucial opening background is never followed up and falters to the end. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements who made the superior The Little Mermaid. Tate Donovan is humorous voicing Hercules who turns out to be the one rounded character in the film. Other characters are well introduced but then they follow predictable formula. Danny De Vito as the voice of Phil the trainer is pretty straight forward. James Woods as Hades is another predictable prop that is all surface no interior. Rip Torn voices the thunderous Zeus who also seems to flake off as the film drones on. Susan Egan plays an annoying damsel type character who amounts to nothing. Theme toys with superheroes strength but unfortunately that power never went into writing the film. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining entry into the late Renaissance of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hercules seems to be a forgotten movie within Disney's second Renaissance with Mulan, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, and Beauty and the Beast easily overshadowing it. However, Hercules is a good film in my opinion delivering on action and laughs despite not being as great as those previously mentioned films.Good: I really like the animation here as they take the route of Greek style artwork for the landscapes and characters. The film does a good job presenting Greek mythology with the trademark modernizing they are known to do. The voice work is great with plenty of talent behind it like Rip Torn, James Woods as Hades (highlight), and Danny DeVito as Phil. I also liked the character of Meg with her swagger. There are some solid action sequences and it flows at a good pace.Bad: I say the thing that lowers the film is the music. While I enjoy the gospel inspired songs surrounding the movie, the songs overall are not memorable. Rarely do any of them have any real spark to them and they fade in the background. I also found Hercules to be rather bland which is the point in a way because he's a guy with no flaws. That doesn't change the fact that he wasn't that interesting.Overall, while it follows a predictable hero's journey plot line and the songs never rise beyond average, the artwork and energy of the film makes it well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hercules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some time the animated Disney films didn't really hit me with much inspiration, by that I mean none of their outings grabbed my attention, the ideas just didn't excite me. Then along came this adventure based around the magic of Greek mythology and I was hooked. An animated Disney version of Harryhausen's mythic visions? count me in. So off I went on the day of release back in 1997, Swiss Cottage Odeon, North London (for some reason I remember, probably because this Odeon was unusually HUGE!).A simple tale of Hercules life from birth up to his teenage years. The loss of his immortality and God status at the hands of Hades, his young life as a mortal and how he manages to become a God again with the help of various friends in typical wide eyed Disney manner.The two things that attracted me to this kiddie flick were 1. the Greek mythology as already said, and 2. the visuals on display. Disney seem to go through different styles over time and this films style is really nice in its stark angled way. It comes across like a Geddy Tartakovsky project, reminiscent of his 'Star Wars: Clone Wars' series but with less CGI and generally a bit softer in tone. The colour palette is really vibrant too, so rich and alive, its really beautiful to watch going from the warm pastel golds, yellows and beige of Mount Olympus and Thebes to dark shades of blues, purples and black of the underworld. Loved the underworld!, wanted more time down there.Apart from the animation the characters are a big part of any film like this and would it be any surprise if I told you the bad guy was the best?. Yep its true, once again the villain shines through and in this case James Woods makes Hades a very likable guy. Not only does he look really cool with a brilliant design and a virtually monochromatic colour scheme, he also has a really awesome flaming blue hairdo which is such a sweet touch. It is of course the deadpan sarcastic fiery verbal from Woods that he's famous for and he doesn't disappoint here...minus the profanity of course. The only other character that stood out for me was Philoctetes perfectly voiced by De Vito, casting genius. In general the Gods all looked quite good visually but I was unsure about that heavenly glow they all had, I see what they were going for but it kinda looked tacky. The Titans were a tad cliché looking (dunno what I expected) and didn't blow me away, also a shame they used full CGI for the Hydra which looked awful. Not sure why Hercules was drawn the way he was because he looked a bit pug ugly to me, anyone notice how big his ears were?!. Also I didn't really like the little imp minions of Hades, typical stereotypical Disney sidekicks purely in there for silly laughs, oh wait its a kids flick isn't it...dang!.Talking about the Hydra, not sure how that worked, Hercules was cutting off its heads one after another yet it kept on coming back for more. In the end some falling rocks killed it? even though it had its heads cut off multiple times?. On the same note, Hercules is suppose to have retained his super strength BUT he's mortal (watch the film), yet in the film he's still comes across as immortal even after that was drained from him.All in all I did enjoy this Greek outing as I expected I would. Yeah sure its not perfect by any means, the animation is a wee bit dated now naturally but I can't complain about that really. The CGI moments were obvious and terrible...down to age again. I didn't like the soppy songs throughout, yeah I know its Disney but they really felt unnecessary and jammed in...plus they sucked!. I really think these lovey-dovey songs are no longer required for these type of films, its a very old fashioned concept which to be honest I'm glad is fading out...call me uncultured I guess. But I did quite like the little montage showing Hercules victories and his merchandise taking off, Air-Herc hehe nice touch.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney's try at Weightlifting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now looking back I believe this is the Disney movie I had watched the most when I was younger. And to be honest I still really like it. It takes an angle to the character which is new but also the same. He is treated like a superhero which is where superhero origins tend to get inspiration from. But it got down one of the parts of superhero's often ignored, that heroes are no longer just heroes but they are icons. With taking the superhero angle to Hercules it goes with it great. Next up is the animation. It's a very different style for Disney and it works and looks great sometimes, but then other times it doesn't fit the story at all. Like when he fights the CG Hydra, alone the hydra doesn't look that great or fits in, but all the different angles and creative turns it makes looks quite good. The comedy still works good but in say 10 years it will probably wear off. And finally the songs. This is where the movie works and doesn't work. I think the songs sung by the characters are alright nothing great in the end though. But the whole gospel song style that the goddesses sing to tell the story, well I enjoy the type of music but it does not belong in a story about Hercules, and leads all in all a disappointing soundtrack. Now I've read some other opinions on this movie and they were all pretty negative. And I must say I think for me this movie is a guilty pleasure and the my nostalgia blocks out most of the problems. But looking at this movie with a clean slate, I must say Disney could have done a better job in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was afraid. As you would all know, Greek mythology has been twisted and turned by loads of people. So much, in fact, their original origins are unknown, because so many "remakes" were made. Worse, this was a Disney production. Disney surely has some great films, but others are cringe-worthy. So what would it be? I watched the film as a class study of Greek mythology, and I'm proud to say the source material hasn't been tampered with THAT much..First things first: great animation. For a 1997 film, the landscapes were beautiful to see, and this is a person who's seen all the CGI-made films nowadays. My favorite design was the hydra, who seemed 3D-like. They did a great job visualizing the characters and their designs, almost making us forget the fact they were, in fact, animated. Second things second: the music. At first glance, you would never know this is an adventure slash musical film. I really enjoyed the gospel singers and the songs snipped in from Hercules and Meg. They were nice to hear, and the gospel singers enhanced the stories by adding a new form of narration. Third things third: the plot. This is where the film falls apart, for me, because the writers obviously try to lean towards their initial audience. They stripped away some of the Greek mythology by trying to make it a family film, but they end up stripping too much away. There was some clever jokes packed in, especially dozens of pop- culture references, but none of them made up for the fact that they took too much away. Bad things stop there. Hercules was a very fun film that doesn't take too much away from becoming a fraud. It packs in clever references to Greek mythology, packs in lush animation, and packs in a key item in animations: heart. I recommend for anybody wanting to see a film that can still be enjoyable albeit forgetting some of it's source material.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love rating movies, because I get to express my opinion on how realistic the plot was, the actors were, what emotions I felt, if anything seemed out of place or rushed, etc.However, when it comes to Disney films, it's a bit harder. It's still possible to rate, but I have to accept the world of Disney. But then you get movies like this, which are based on myths and legends, that are more difficult to rate because the plots are based on more fictional ideas and thus realism doesn't exist as much.This was a good movie. How true it is to history and legend, I don't know. But it was entertaining. Basically it's showing what a true hero is by the things they do off "camera" and not when they are being watched.Thus, I rate this movie 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney has done it again, although it's not like Lion King or Aladdin. It is a good film I always thought this would go cliché but it didn't do what I expected. The reason I give this a 7 even though it's not bad, I don't like to throw around with high grades too much, since I can't rate it a 7.5 I just picked 7 because 8 would be too high. Anyways back to the movie I liked most of the movies, the goofy characters were fun, and meg turned out to be different than I previously thought. I did like them trying to integrate 3d to the movie when Hercules was fighting the hydra, it kinda sucked but you don't judge a movie by it's special effects.Anyways summarizing a good family film will get your laughs standard 90s Disney quality I recommend to families with young children, heck maybe the parents will enjoy it.</fullReview>

While Tate Donovan is bland as the lead Danny DeVito and James Woods more than make up for it.The songs are good and the plot is simple enough to be enjoyed by both adults and children alike.Overall Hercules is a strong addition to the Disney legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another movie I went in with moderate expectations; expecting every day entertainment, but nothing more than that.I was wrong. So wrong.When I saw Hercules , I was taken aback by the animation style. It was so much different than the styles I was used to in Pocahontas, Lion King and Hunchback of Notre Dame. Subsequently, my family and I didn't give Hercules a go on our yearly Disney movie viewings.Today I decided to watch Hercules, and I was pleasantly surprised. The animation style really worked for this movie and I ended up really enjoying the Mowtown-esquire nature of the songs. Pay attention to the lion's skin that Herc is wearing while posting for a painting on a vase -- that's Lion King's Scar! All the characters were truly endearing, even Hades who was one of the most entertaining villains I have seen brought out by Disney. In many ways he reminds me of another favourite villain from the studio; Darkwing Duck's Steelbeak with his suave personality that can errupt into anger.Hands down, another personal favourite that I would recommend anyone to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hercules - quirkyles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I shall confess that I was disappointed when I saw "Hercules" first time, maybe because of the expectations, especially when it was made from the creators of "Aladdin". Disney had shown progression with their previous films (of the 90's) and "Hercules" felt rather as a throwback, a really lame one. I didn't find the film magic and engaging enough and it had some darker visual moments, while the emotional moments were too sentimental. So, "Hercules" was on my blacklist for a long time.After nine months I got the movie from my aunt and seeing it again I were ashamed on my self for don't liking this movie. So, in other words, you must see "Hercules" several times before it can really be enjoyed."Hercules" is one of Disney's more quirky movies and there's a huge probability that kids won't understand the irony and the parody that's going on. Although the film is funny, it's like it's tries too hard to be hilarious all the time, so it feels rather importunate at times.Which is something to make "Hercules" unstable as an whole. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this film several years later, but it's not on my top list. It has some great moments, but the film itself wants to go many directions; being funny, emotional, exciting, etc. But comparing to previous Disney films, this mix doesn't goes well as a whole on this film. The unstableness also transmits some of the characters: Meg is an untypical Disney heroine and quite sarcastic, but at least she goes true a struggle that is identifiable and grows as a character. The same with our hero Hercules, but I didn't really connect with him emotionally. I liked him better when he was younger, though.You can easy tell that's the directors John Musker and Ron Clements put their hands of the script, cause it has the same structure than their previous scripts ("Little Mermaid", "Aladdin"). It's not necessarily a bad thing, but you know what to expect, right?OK, enough nonsense. It seems like I still hate this movie, which I don't. My favorite characters are Zeus (who looks like King Triton in "The Little Mermaid"), Hades, the Muses, Hermes, Phil and Pegasus. I used to think that Pain and Panic were annoying, but not anymore.Liked mentioned before, the film is funny. The animation is most of the time good looking (even it's look kinda quirky too because of the Greek influence and Gerald Scarfe style). I liked the songs performed by the Muses (the lyrics are funny) and "Go The Distance", which I actually hated at the beginning, but now I find it a decent song. Alan Menken's score is more quirkier and unstable than his usual score, but when he hits you with the score, he hits you really deep and wonderfully.Despite it's quirkiness, there's a lot to enjoy with "Hercules"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Entertainment, but not by Disney's standards.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hercules" was a return by the Disney directing team of Ron Clements and John Musker (of "Aladdin" and "The Little Mermaid" fame) to the animated feature after two very sombre entries in the Disney canon, "Pocahontas" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", and they pretty much continued from where they left off with the aforementioned "Aladdin". Both of these films share common traits; both are extremely loose adaptations of established legend; they have an obvious contemporary feel, peppered with pop references (not saturated like Dreamwork's, or for that matter, many resent animated movies); both have an aspiring male protagonist and finally, both films have at least one immaculate, albeit hilarious voice acting performance. Plus the animation is given a stylish and very caricaturist form to it.Similarities aside then, "Hercules" was the first venture for Disney into Greek myth, providing a retelling of the story about the titular hero of how he was born a God, stolen and turned mortal by Hades Lord of the Underworld (to get him out of the way for a hostile take over of Mount Olympus which Herc is destined to intervene with) and the hero, after been told by daddy Zeus that, to get back, he must prove himself a true hero on Earth.A far cry from what was established in the myths to a lot of you in the know on these things, although Disney's always had a gift for making this work despite. And as it turned out accuracy wasn't a problem here either (to some). The story's pretty standard, like "Aladdin", and the main protagonist, while a little more layered than the former with subtexts of discrimination for his clumsiness and strength, is still on the boring side. Once again though, it's the supporting roles, the animation and the music that steal the show. Alan Menken once again saddled up for the score and together with David Zippel produced the songs, which take on a Greek chorus delivered by the quintet of Muses in a Gospel choir style. This makes for a few rousing tunes and a good intro, plus it ties in with the whole soulful, hero story they got going down. The Oscar nominee this time was an aspiring hero ballad of hopes and dreams, typically sappy stuff and does the job. The score itself melds all these tunes together here and there, plus goes other places too, but overall is not up to the stellar work of the past. Still fun though.Animation is once again of the top draw sort. Gerald Scarfe was the artistic adviser on this one, a political cartoonist of the UK and he brings a unique style to the Disney art. It's still very colourful, using a lot of luminescent colours, but the characters are all very sharp edged and heavily caricatured to resemble Greek art. There's also a fantastic sense of scale at times in the settings, especially in the city of Thebes with its towering Marbelesque architecture and an abundance of other beautiful Greek art. It's a nice move and another example of Disney's ever curious endeavours in cultural variety at the time. CGI is used widely for one particularly great action sequence, plus for some intriguing morphing techniques utilised in Olympus.Voice acting is of uniform good quality here with all actors acquitting themselves well with their role, especially Danny De Vito as Herc's trainer satyr Phil and Susan Egan as a very curvaceous and very tough Damsel named Megara (friends call her Meg). But the aforementioned show stealer is James Woods' Hades, who comes across as the slimiest, most charismatic movie producer slash real estate salesman type you've ever seen, motoring his mouth all over the script with ad libs aplenty. Doesn't topple William's Genie for pure comic madness, but he makes it his own character and revels in it to our fortune.This movie is as much a comedy as "Aladdin" was, meaning that it's lighting fast with a sharp edge on the cultural references and on the Greek myths themselves. Most of the comedy comes courtesy of Hades and Phil, who get great lines, but also comes from some serious hits taken at Disney's own patented merchandising routine, used here for Herc's sake. It's well implemented and makes for good satire at times. But other than comedy, the film does the romantic angle too, plus the main moral of knowing what it really takes to be a true hero. Once again, like the former movie, it's the weaker element. Actually for most of the midsection of the film (the most entertaining part) the romance is quite touching, but eventually it gets rushed and doesn't feel as genuine. The main message isn't hammered into us and is a good one, but still isn't anything to swoon over. While comedy's a strong suite for both "Hercules" and "Aladdin", the latter had itself backed with a slightly more magical feel to it's dramatic subtext, leaving "Hercules" a little shallow.One final point before i clean up. While the movie is a mere shadow of the myth in terms of story, it has an abundance of homages to Greek myth, including Hercules himself. I counted references to about 7 of Hercules' 12 labours (one been very prominent), plus a twist of a similar situation Hercules had with a River Guardian Centaur and his girl. Actually, the more you know about Greek myth, the more you'll find and it actually turns out to be quite a nice touch, even though none of it coheres in the order originally wrote."Hercules" is fine entertainment for all ages, as in the good Disney tradition. But this time, away from that tradition, it lacks a little something that Disney seemed to have mastered before and almost reacquainted itself with a few times more afterwards before sinking below the depths. Just as well, this is better animated entertainment you'll get than most non-Disney, non-Pixar and non-anime companies produce regularly.</fullReview>

But I understand why they did what they did since it was a Disney movie, they had to make it kid friendly. One thing was there were nine muses. Also Hercules was not Zues's child with Hera, he went outside his marriage to have Hercules with a mortal women, Alcemene. Also, Hera hated Hercules because of her husbands infidelity. The Hydra was not killed the way in the movie, and it only grew two heads every time a head was cut off. The tasks that Hercules went on were not because he wanted to become a God, but because he was trying to make up for accidentally killing his wife Megera and his children. These are only a few things that were wrong with the movie. But if you did not know the true story of Hercules then the movie was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Disney's best, but still a wonderful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it's not as good as "The Lion King" or "Beauty and the Beast," I'd say "Hercules" is still an excellent film, probably the last great Disney film that didn't involve Pixar. I'm just sorry I didn't see it while it was in theaters. There's so much to love about this movie, I don't know where to begin. OK, first, the story. The writers did a great job with Hercules. Most of the past movies about Hercules made him a macho, invincible brute, but Disney's "Hercules" actually injects some soul into the character, and makes him a very deep, rather insecure, unlikely hero. The story of his quest to become a true hero is really moving and well- done. Next, I'll certainly need to discuss the equally great supporting characters. Danny DeVito is funny and likable as the grumpy Phil. Megara, played excellently by Susan Egan, is a very good female lead. She could have easily been just a flaky love interest for Hercules, but instead, they made her a strong, independent character. However, the character who really steals the show has to be Hades. He is one of the best Disney villains I've ever seen. He is unmistakeably evil, yet rather calm about it (Other than the few occasions when he loses his temper), and also very funny. The character design for him was quite well- done (Though my mom said he reminded her too much of Ursula from "The Little Mermaid"), and James Woods is incredible at doing his voice, going from calm to menacing to completely enraged effortlessly. Next, I must talk about the songs. I loved all of the songs in it. The Muses add a sweet, Gospel feel to their songs, and my favorite song, "Go the Distance," is really beautiful. It should have won an Oscar. My favorite scene in the film would probably be when Hercules fights the Hydra. The computer animation for the Hydra works very well, it looks great. The fight itself is really exciting, too. Please, go see "Hercules." You won't be sorry that you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's very little you can do to influence Disney artists. Or Disney fans. They're always going to harp on horrid failures that they praise as innovations (Hunchback, Pocohontas, Mulan). And they will never admit that the light-hearted, comedic Hercules was the big step in Disney's revolution concerning style and storyboarding in the past twenty years.Big deal; it's true.Herc was the first time Disney decided to run on fast, colorful frenzy and coy shots at the material instead of cutesy sidekicks alone for comedy. A direct predecessor to Emporor's New Groove? You better believe it.With a "grecian" style and a gospel swing, this film comes on strong with guns blazing and hardly stops for air. A little strong is the Oscar-winning song, "Go the Distance," but I guess Micheal Bolton was flavor of the week then. What can't be ignored is how repeatedly watchable this film is, and that's important with kiddie fare, since parents must endure multiple viewings.This film does butcher its subject matter in a way nothing short of savage, it's true. No myth remains intact as the storyboard scrambles to include every monster ancient Greece had to offer, and it's sad to see Medusa, the minotaur and other greats fly by without so much as a by-line.Still in all, the mainstay of the film is the wry humor, and some very fun wordplay. If you want the myths straight, never go to Hollywood; even Harryhausen (otherwise known as The Man) cut-and-pasted mythology to suit his films.If there are spots where Herc lacks polish it's probably because the artists were rushing to finish it and work on Mulan, which is unthinkable when you see the products. Still that's the word I get directly from a former member of Disney. I met him in 2001, when he was working for dreamworks on "Ice Age." He explained that Disney artists were awed by the "deep, original ideas in Mulan," and considered Herc "just another cartoon." Well, what can you say? He was all excited about "Ice Age" too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite the flaws...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hercules is a great movie, and I would recommend it to anyone. It has some groundbreaking animation (for its time), absolutely lovable characters, hilarious tie-ins with other movies, and great hidden meanings and wisecracks.First of all, I would like to say that Pegasus is a rare character, one of the best ever designed by Disney. He is such a unique, funny, and playful character that one almost wishes he is real. He truly brings the movie to life, for without him it would have been pretty dull.The animation I mentioned was the lighting effects. This, I believe, was one of Disney's first true accomplishments in lighting effects, especially with the characters. They can have normal, somewhat bright faces of a mortal, the shining aura of light that represents a god, and the pale skin of death.The characters are what one will remember after seeing this movie. It is too hard to dislike the villain ("I must have gotten some brimstone in my ear"), his cronies Pain and Panic perform great comic antics ("Yeah, get the goods, sister!"), Pegasus has a mind of his own, Meg is sarcastically funny, and Phil is a little overbearing and too serious at times. The whole group makes the movie.The tie-ins I mentioned are very small things. Like, for instance, Phil has an uncanny resemblance of Aladdin's Genie. Look at his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. And when Hercules is posing for the vase painter, guess whose skin he's wearing. It's a lion, with a Scar above the eye... (He'd make a very handsome throw rug)If you watch closely, you can see some really funny stuff happening to the characters while they're talking or doing other things. For instance, Meg and Hercules are falling in love and Meg steps back, only to be poked in the back by a statue of Cupid. There are lots of these things that happen in the movie... just little, nearly hidden jokes that are hilarious if you find them.The action is great, and the plot is well thought out. There are some flaws with this movie, however, and some big mistakes. I think the Muses are the biggest mistake. Not only are the songs on this movie low for even Disney standards (besides "I Can Go The Distance"), one will wish the Muses were shot before they could continue singing because their songs are the ABSOLUTE WORST! And there are some goofs, such as Hercules puts his hands into the river of death one minute, then the next he has to dive down fifteen feet to reach it. Just little things like that. They don't really hurt the movie.This is a great movie. If one overlooks the flaws, it is one of Disney's best, nearly getting as high as maybe The Emperor's New Groove or Aladdin. Watch it if you get the chance.</fullReview>

Are they bad? No. The movie's very enjoyable. In fact, the best Hercules movie I've seen this far.Singing? Yes, some few songs are in there. Now, don't roll with your eyes! They're really good and are used to tell the story in a clever way, not to add some meaningless minutes. Whoever had the idea to make gospel singers out of the muses... well done. That's just brilliant.Disney has done nothing wrong with this movie, still.. something is just not working. I don't know what it is. But it's just a good movie, not great. If you like animated features and haven't seen it yet, go and see it. You won't regret. Just, don't see it with young kids.... they might get nightmares, because the movie has a kinda dark theme. Ugly monsters, violence and Hades looks just horrifying.My rating: 7.5 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXTREMELY inaccurate, but a fine piece of artwork from Scarfe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about the making of this movie while vacationing in Scotland and when I found out that Gerald Scarfe, one of my favourite modern artists, was the production designer, I literally flipped. Ever since seeing "The Wall" several years ago, I was convinced that Scarfe needed his own animated movie to design or make.Years later, it's a Disney film and I was irate, maybe even a bit confused. I was so afraid that it was going to be a waste of his talent. Thank the gods I was wrong.One thing I've been seeing over and over again in the reviews, other than the poor retelling of the Heracles myth which I agree with, are people either loving or hating the design. Olympus is too bright and colourful, Hades is too dark and scary, or what have you. I will admit that the combination of Scarfe and Disney to be a most unusual one, but it does work on many levels. When Walt was still alive, he experimented with different styles of animation, and apart from the music and the inaccuracy of the storyline, I believe he would have been impressed with this piece of work. One thing I adore about the design is that Scarfe's style is not downplayed. For those familiar with "The Wall", they already know how disturbing his work can be. I even saw bits of "The Wall" incorporated into "Hercules", from Hades eating worms, a constant theme in "The Wall" album, to shadowplay of the hydra approaching Herc that reminded me of Pink being confronted by his wife who becomes a monster. Although I'm Wiccan, the comical look of the gods and goddesses didn't strike me as insulting in the least, as one reviewer suggested. If you forget the story and music (verse, oy) to look at this film as a piece of moving art, you'll do yourself great justice.And to the parents upset about Scarfe's dark and scary design, here's a thought for you: at least they didn't decide on Ralph Steadman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took a little while to get going, but once it did, this film is on a par with any of the recent Disney animated greats. The animation, although not nearly on the level of most recent efforts, did grow on me after some time, and did seem to fit the movie fairly well. The humour was certainly hit-and-miss, but the story was generally fine and the ending was particularly enjoyable. So even with a relatively lackluster beginning, this film eventually did display the terrific animated storytelling that Disney does so very well, and so I can heartily endorse this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird and highly mixed Disney film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In light of the two recent Hercules films, I have decided to revisit this little Klein bottle of confusion. I have always been baffled by this film, and I feel the need to talk about it here.For a start, the animation (a microcosm for the entire film) is highly mixed, and confusing. The art direction was headed by Gerald Scarfe.... why was he chosen? He is known for his surrealist, political satirical work. Greek legend and Disney animation do not come to mind when he is mentioned. As such, the art design of the film (whilst creative and unique) feels very confused, baring little resemblance to the iconic imagery of ancient Greece. The only real exception to this is in the landscapes, and the underworld, these both look very pretty and, in the case of the underworld, interestingly surreal. Overall, whilst colourful and distinct, the animation seems out of place and it mostly falls flat.The voice cast is mostly forgettable and range between average to slightly sub-par . The only real exceptions are James Woods and Danny DeVito, both of whom are highly entertaining and get the best lines. They also voice the most interesting characters, Hades and Phil, in a similar sea of mediocrity. Hades, whilst hardly a standout classic, is a strong villain, both in terms of design and humour. Phil is a likable mentor, who actually has a more entertaining ac than the hero (a bad sign). These glimmers of hope a few in the dim void of the other characters, I truly cannot stress how little impact the other "characters" leave.The music......is probably the most forgettable in Disney's history. The plot is weird and jumbled, the pacing is broken. It sometimes skips large pieces (for example the majority of Herc's training) and is often rather slow (the intro is shockingly lengthy). This adds to the choppiness of the whole film.Overall, it's surprising that the illustrious studio made something this....amateurish. It isn't bad per-se, as the good elements are entertaining enough, however I wouldn't really recommend it either. It's a mixed bag.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect example of superhero storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea has been buzzing around in my head for quite a while, and I have finally realized- This movie is still, and probably always will be the greatest Superman movie since Superman (1978). The basic story of an unlikely child raised by honest people. He learns he has extraordinary capabilities and starts a quest to discover himself and where he belongs in the world. He is noble and arrogant to a degree but learns to develop his abilities because he truly wants to help people in need. This simple story is so compelling and fantastic that I couldn't understand why we can't find it in modern films. There is so much more to offer your imagination than mindless non-stop violence. So instead of distorting your children's intelligence by showing them The Man of Steel. Show them Hercules, and I guarantee they will get so much more out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't Be, or Look, That Fresh !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think that 1997 was a very good year in terms of movies. Terrible comedies (Bean, Fathers' Day, Mousehunt..), terrible action (Batman &amp; Robin, The Fifth Element, The Postman). At the time Disney was drowned in remakes of old movies or TV shows (Flubber, Mr. Magoo, George of the Jungle..). And according to most of them; they weren't less terrible ! So, why not resorting to the Greek legends to remake something ?! Which generates, forever and ever, the critical question : It isn't What to remake, it's How ?! Transforming the storytellers into female black blues singers was the smartest idea here. They became more lively, modern, and sexy. The gods' mentor (Philoctetes) is presented like a Kong-Fu master, with a touch of vulgarity, especially when it's played by (Danny DeVito). Few details were mixed with contemporary matters; like the publicity stuff and the fame craze. However, you won't find more interesting ideas that could have recreated (Hercules) into something that fresh and catchy.Some points just drew my attention. Points related to the origin of all the legends and fairy tales. I think whether they all come from one basis, or that the human imagination is limited in certain molds that are consequently limited by the human experience (so whatever the differences are, it's one human after all). For instance : The ones who kidnapped the lead as a baby didn't kill him as they were ordered, instead, they left him in the woods; it's the European tale, collected by the brothers Grimm, (Snow white). The lead is lost from his parents, found by a family which doesn't have kids; it's the story of the profit (Moses) all over again. Then the lead discovers later that he isn't the guy who was raised as; it's similar to an event in the Arabic folk epic (El Seera El Hillalyia) in which the lead (Abo Zead) discovers that he isn't (Barakat); the guy who was raised as. (Hercules)'s power has been stripped from him by a seduction of one girl; (Samson) and (Delilah)'s story. It's known that every hero has his point of weakness; from (Achilles)' tendon to (Superman)'s feebleness towards Kryptonite. The name of the evil god (Hades) means ? by its exact pronunciation ? "accident" in Arabic. And the 3 augurs reminded me of the 3 witches in Shakespeare's (Macbeth), or it's the other way around !Sure many serious theories had been written about the resemblance's points, or the unified sources. Yet what I wanted to say ? in a way ? is that this movie couldn't give me the feel of original. I was, during most of the time, in the "I saw all of that before" zone. Add to that many flaws in that script like lousy evil minions that look pale; being repeated from endless other movies (so close to Rasputin's minion in Anastasia; another cartoon movie from the same year), the totally unconvincing event of fettering all the Olympus's gods as if it's a bank robbery, or a breaking into some unguarded rich people's party, forgetting that they all have superpowers, rather the superpowers !, and finally a climax that manipulates foolishly the main character's fact; it's lame since we know pretty well that (Hercules) will win no matter what, based on his immortal power.The movie hasn't many good songs, comic enough ? or at all ? dialog, or thrilling action sequences. Consequently, it couldn't score high as a comedy, musical or action. And overall I don't remember one visually dazzling scene; not much of a direction too I must say. The end's song by (Ricky Martin) ? who was having his moment back then ? was inspiring, so its separate video. The design of (Hades)'s form fascinated me, with always fiery head, and ultra-nervous movement. But indubitably (James Woods) was the one who owned the scenery, by his so vividly loose, sometimes explosive, vocal performance as (Hades). As I read, his inventive dealing with the written material, based on his speedy way of speaking, made the writers re-modify the character to something else what they had in mind. Here's the spirit of creativity that this movie somewhat missed.It's a Disney's fun. Not shabby, and not great either. You can easily sense that it wasn't intended to be a big production. It seems to be coming from Disney Classic Cartoon : the B-movies branch. And it did manage to be a B-movie among Disney's A-list classics. I believe with more creative points, the story, any story, can be fresh, or at the largely familiar least, look fresh. The thing is this one lost being fresh as a script, direction, and hence as a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, not a good adaption of the original myths.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then again what did you expect from Disney? At the end of the day what happened in the original myths this was based on would not be appropriate for young children and naturally enough Disney would have to tone it down because there was no way they could include Hercules being conceived out of Zeus raping a mortal woman named Alcmene. When you watch it don't expect it to be a faithful adaption of the Hercules Myths as it's not directly based on them and has major changes such as Hades being a Villain as well as Pegasus meeting Hercules (whereas he didn't in the original Myths). At the end of the day this was made to appeal to Children too and let's not forget while The Black Cauldron was good it would barely appeal to any Children at all because of it's dark story and if this film had followed every last detail in the original Myths; it would only cause a large amount of controversy because Disney Films are expected to be suitable for young viewers as well as older viewers. Like most Disney films such as the lion king which is based on Hamlet; this is not by any means an original story but nevertheless it turned out great and does have a solid story that's suitable for older and younger viewers; give it a chance and if you can't tolerate it not being faithful to the original Myths do not watch it because it won't appeal to you. The music score in this film is great and it doesn't get much more epic than Hercules regaining his Godhood; the music at that point gave me chills; personally I don't really care for Disney Songs but the songs in this did prove to be quite enjoyable especially Go The Distance; another job well done by Disney.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step down from previous Disney animated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst thing you can do when watching Disney's "Hercules" is to compare it to its predecessors. Not because it's impossible (it's not), but because it makes "Hercules" look a lot worse than it probably deserves.When it comes to adapting material for children's movies (especially the animated ones), Disney has always been known to change some of the darker aspects of the original story to make it more kid-friendly. Never has it been more apparent than in this film, though considering the source material, it's understandable...to a point. But Disney reworked the whole story, making only passing mentions at the original myth (similar to the fairy tale references to fairy tales in the "Shrek" movies).Hades (James Woods) is pretty peeved at Zeus (Rip Torn) that he was assigned to govern the underworld. But according to a prophecy, he will have a chance to take over Mount Olympus and rule the world. However, the prophecy also says that there is one person who stands in his way, Zeus' newborn son, Hercules (Josh Keaton/Roger Bart as Young Hercules). So Hades sends his two monster henchmen, Pain (Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Matt Frewer) to off the kid. The plan almost works, and Hercules ends up living as a mortal, though his god-like strength makes him an outcast. Then Zeus tells him that the only way to become a god again is to become a true hero. So with the help of Phil (Danny DeVito), a hero-trainer, Hercules (played by Tate Donovan as an adult), sets out to become one. Meanwhile, Hades has his own agenda in motion.The problem with Hercules isn't the story, but that it's lazy film-making. It seems as though the filmmakers just wanted to make the quickest movie they could. The drama doesn't work very well, the characters are half-developed, and the energy level is low. There are only a few songs in the film (none of which is especially memorable), unlike in previous Disney features. The animation seems to be inspired by Greek art, but it's not as crisp or beautiful as in other films (and sometimes the merging of hand-drawn and computer animation is inadequately done).Most surprising is the lack of effective humor. Much of the jokes fall flat, and what works is merely amusing. The scenery-chewing sarcasm of Woods' Hades and DeVito's Phil are worth a few grins, but they're not laugh-out-loud hilarious.The other voice talents are uninspired. Tate Donovan is flat as Hercules, and he fails to provide the emotional anchor that the film desperately needs. Susan Egan is a good voice-over actress, and her later work in Miyazaki's "Spirited Away" proves it. But her talents are not adequately used here, and it makes her less effective (though she still manages to inject some sass into Meg). Rip Torn does what he can with Zeus, but his dialogue is so weak that there isn't much he can do."Hercules" is better than "Pocahontas," but it's still a far cry from the other Disney features.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best "classical" Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years before the computer days, Disney sang the swan's song with Hercules. Although loosely based on Greek mythology (in which Hercules is Zeus' illegitimate son with a human, which obviously had to be surgically removed), and while the story of Hercules 12 Tasks is far from respected, the Disney studios managed to deliver a funny and entertaining adaptation of the myth.Most importantly, songs and musical bits are really good, especially the opening sequence with Charlton Heston's voice and the muses, the duet Meg / the muses and guess what "Zero to Hero" sung by... the muses.What I also liked very much are the second level humour (spot the spice girls if you can), such as "Air-cules" ads and references to Greek myths in general.This double-level reading makes it a nice and entertaining cartoon for kids and grown-ups. Even more enjoyable now these paper and celluloid days are over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been looking at the comments that aren't for this movie (Mind you, there aren't many) and found the main reason why people didn't go for it. It seems the people that disliked this movie are the people who are too uptight about Greek mythology and how this film was wrong in that base. They wrote how this was wrong or how this Greek never did this, never did that, but seriously people....THIS IS A MOVIE!!! Movies aren't real! None the less do they have to make sense! Not to mention this is a children's movie! I also read a comment by a parent on how their little girl cried during this movie or something? Well, do you think it's because of the movie or it's just her? Millions of kids saw this and didn't cry, there's just something wrong with THAT kid. Anyways, this movie is one of the best Disney films out there. It's one of my personal favorites of all time and is a true Disney classic. I guarantee you, your child has a very little chance of actually crying during this movie and wanting to turn it off. The songs are good, the plot of wonderful, it's a great ending, and the bad guy kicks much butt. Seriously, out of all the Disney bad guys Hades takes the cake. That is all. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not Disney's greatest movie, by any sort of way. That's (In my opinion) "The Lion King". Nor is the most entertaining, or most musical. But I'd put it in the Top 10 of any of their movies.This film, from the look of most postings about it, seems to polarize viewers. It's a "love it', or "hate it" film, it seems.For me, I like it. I'm not an expert in Greek mythology, so the flaws that I've read in other postings does not bother me. The talents involved are top notch. James Woods as "Hades" is outstanding. Tate Donovan as "Hercules" is great. Add Danny Devito as "Phil", Susan Egan as "Meg" and Rip Torn,and Hal Holbrook, too! I sat thru the movie the first time and was SURE that "Meg" was voiced by Bebe Neuwirth was the voice talent! It does the usual Disney-fication of events in the movie. Poking fun at (then-topical)phrases, and items. Such modern sayings as "Get a grip", "Well DUH", and "Read my lips!" turn up. They parody their own Disney Store chain with "The Hercules Store". And even toss in a reference to an old bad guy, "Scar" from "The Lion King".Grab the DVD, if you can find it, and enjoy it in wide screen format.</fullReview>

The music, fun. But the film stands as an example of Disney's decline in animation quality. It is one of the first crossings of animation and computer animations from Disney the latter standing so far out in superiority from the already bad artwork that it makes the rest of the imagery look out of place. Disney films since have only refined on this ludicrous art of crossing breath-taking imagery with almost lampoonish artwork.It is clear that the artist's intent was to produce a film which attempted to reproduce and modernize the ancient Greecian style seen on "vahzes" (GRIN), frescoes, etc., This would have worked had they not chose to cross this with a pseudo-realistic computer generated hydra which almost looks like something from a sci-fi flick. Briefly we witness, "Hercules Meets The Hydra From Mars."Furthermore, if you're of a Paganistic path you might be offended by the interpretations of the Olympians which look completely ridiculous and exaggerated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Technically, and given the financial constraints of modern animation, this is a good movie. Of course the Disney people fiddled with the story line and the character names, but name me the last Disney film that stayed "true" to its origins.Production values were up to Disney standards (which means a lot), and the story is guaranteed not to offend anyone's sense of PC. You can feel safe tossing this into the VCR and plunking the kids in front of it for a hour or so. They'll enjoy it, even if they miss a lot of the "adult"-level humor.My biggest gripe is with the topical references. Sure, we get the humor of "Air Herc" sandals and the other merchandising tie-ins ("Herculade" and the action figures) NOW, but what happens ten years down the line? I mean, Michael Jordan is already retired; will there even BE "Air Jordans" then? The same goes for the cynical "Hades" character. This kind of humor is trendy and hip NOW, but I'm afraid it just hasn't got the legs to "go the distance".And that's the problem with films that depend on references to current events, stars, situations, or product placement. They come off looking like a polyester leisure suit -- great in its day, but ridiculous if not downright incomprehensible after the fad has passed. As proof, check out the "Rocky and Bullwinkle" video tapes. Unless you were there in the 60s, a lot of the inside jokes (like the "Kirwood Derby") are missed. And how about the "PanAm" logo on the spacecraft in "2001"?My rating? Two stars out of five, for now; and probably dropping to 1-and-a-half within five years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The familiar package, with added interest for students of mythology, with which Disney plays fast and loose (though no more so than Ovid in first-century Rome, whose 'Metamorphoses' did some pretty outrageous things to Greek legend).Though standard issue Disney in the main, and often seeming pretty weary, there's some food for thought. Leaving aside the tidying-up of Olympus's somewhat irregular sexual politics, Disney also adds an implicit but insistent christianisation of the pagan story in the closing stages. Hercules is re-read as Orpheus crossed with Christ, proving his divinity by sacrificing himself for his Eurydice [or rather his Megaera; the Greek names were mostly chosen to provide English diminutives, hence Philoctetes ('Phil') instead of Chiron, trainer of heroes. Philoctetes is the maimed hero in Sophocles's play of that name.] There's something of the same in Aladdin, incidentally: the leitmotif of biting into apples is always associated there with knowledge, recognition and of course sex - it's straight out of Genesis.Disney being Disney, the sacrifice here is of the sort that doesn't in fact entail any sacrifice, so the Christianity is skin deep. Herc doesn't really give up his life, Meg doesn't give up her unblemished complexion or neatly arranged costume despite being squished by a whopping great column, and not becoming an Olympian god frankly doesn't seem much of a sacrifice at all, given that the place is a dull, self-congratulatory cocktail party. But Disney has always asserted the right of successful cultural imperialists to appropriate other people's cultures - rather like them ancient Romans again. They often do it pretty well.Cinematically there's not a lot of inventiveness on show on the large scale, though there's the usual teeming ingenuity in the details. Also present and correct are well-staged songs with poor lyrics and forgettable tunes (Alan Menken writes excellent orchestral scores but he's rarely a big tune writer, he's a motivic composer like Sondheim - and Howard Ashman was irreplaceable). Most of the principal characters are drawn entirely from an increasingly depleted looking stock.An honourable exception is James Woods's interesting Hades, a wheeler-dealer demon with a barely controlled undercurrent of rage. The portrayal of death and the underworld is pretty dark by Disney standards, so that the film (like the studio) seems torn between increasingly edgy material in some scenes, and increasingly gooey, bog-standard sentimental moralising in others - as though each is somehow meant to compensate for the other. It's oddly unstable for such a commercialised package.</fullReview>

And are there really that many Greek God purists out there?Hercules is a fun kid movie, with enough sly humor, in-jokes and adult-ish plot developments to keep the parents interested. James Woods is the standout here, in the comedic role of his career. Tate Donovan is kinda bland (like most Disney male heroes). I wasn't that impressed by Danny DeVito doing...well, Danny DeVito. Everyone else is competent or a bit better.There are a few plot holes: why does Zeus have trouble defeating the Titans the second time around - how'd he do it originally? Doesn't Hades _ever_ check up on his (obviously incompetent) henchmen? Hades seems rather...Satan-like, what with the soul-trading and deals and stuff.I thoroughly enjoyed the musical score is enjoyable throughout, though. The Muses struck me as a bit over the top (and why do they keep talking about the 'gospel' truth? - that's a Biblical reference.). I'd rather have heard the characters sing (and shouldn't Hades have got a number?), then hear the (literal) Greek Chorus chipping in from time to time.Generally, though, it's an enjoyable flick, somewhat of a return to form for Disney after Pocahontas and Hunchback.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Completely unmemorable animated film from the Disney studios, one of the several audiences had to make do with until Pixar came along and revitalized the art form.It's not as dull as the previous year's "Hunchback of Notre Dame," but it sure as hell ain't no "Beauty and the Beast." Since there seems to be some rule on file that every single Disney movie ever made must have one of its songs nominated for an Oscar, the Academy nominated Michael Bolton's ballad "Go the Distance," but it's the title song, with the line "Who put the 'glad' back in gladiator?" that I remember most.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that more people dislike this than those who do like it. Although HERCULES cannot stand against the previous Disney smash hits I see nothing wrong with it at all.The animation is still as good as the recent Disney hits and I think you'll find that the songs are memorable. A lot of thought went into all the gods, all the centaurs and all the mortals. It's full of heart-stopping action and adventure though I wouldn't recommend it for children aged 9 and under due to moderate gory violence, death images, peril and mild language. Certificate U seems wrong - either a PG or a 12+ would've been better. Hercules, a handsome, super-strong young man, learns that he was once a god and he dreams of having his life as a god restored. Though first he must fight off baddies such as big, tough centaurs, the dangerous Hydra (despite my 17 and three quarter years, he still absolutely petrifies me), the titans who were imprisoned for years, this movie's villain Hades and his henchmen Pain and Panic and even the girl he loves Meg, a devious young lady who has been forced for a long time to work for Hades, Hercules's enemy and, with this woman, it looks as if Herc's VERY hot-tempered trainer Phil has got a rival. Herc doesn't have to love just Him alone! He can love Meg if he wants to (even though he'll regret it) so as well as fighting off those villains he's caught in the centre of rivalry. Yet, after all this, when his dream of being a god again comes true, he makes a quick decision to stay on earth as a Mortal! WHAT?! After all he went through down on earth! What "on earth" (get it?) was the point of completing all that work, winning all those battles?! What was the point of him worrying about returning to Mount Olympus? Is he completely out of his BOX?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Hercules is my favourite movie of all time! I love it soooooooo much that it is going to be my parte' theme! So if you have any info or pictures or anything like that plz email it 2 me! Now more about the movie! I loved the music especially the song that Meg sings with the muses. The way that adventure, drama, music, animation and comedy can be compiled into an amazing hour and a half movie is spectacular! If you are thinking about getting any video out of the video store you've got your movie. The voices suit the characters very well and the actors that do the voices put 100% of their expression into it. The actors doing the voices are very well known and experienced. The animation is very cartoony but realistic as well with each character drawn the best it could possibly be drawn. The script is another amazing part of the movie! Even though the story-line was not created by Disney themselves the script had many emotional and humorous parts to it. In conclusion I would just like to say that this is one of the finest films that Disney has ever done and that the way that everything fitted in together made the movie a much more delightful experience than most of the other movies I have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time? Hated it. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Lame, lame, LAME. And the music -- good lord, what on EARTH was Disney thinking?!?Second time: Ah, what the heck, I've seen every other recent Disney flick ten times and my friend insists that it's pretty good. Whatever...uhhh, wait. No, actually, this is better than I remember. Heh. Okay, maybe I was being too harsh the first time.Third time: This time *I* was the one who asked to watch it. I just wanted to see it one more time...James Woods as the AWESOME Hades (one half evil, one half lounge-lizard schmooze), the adorable Muses (!), that foxily cynical Meg, the unbelieveably stupid-cute Pegasus...all right. I admit it. By the third time, I loved it. And the songs finally stuck in my head. It could be because they so resemble the soundtrack to Menken's original success "Little Shop Of Horrors," but that's a GOOD thing. In other words, if you hated it the first time (like I did), give Disney's "Hercules" another chance now that you're not expecting so much of it.Though I'm STILL not forgiving them for the way they mangled mythology. Hera the loving mother indeed. ;) .-=K=-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Disney's Hercules is one of the best Disney movies of all times. It really is one of the most diverse films Disney has produced in terms of Genre. It has comedy, drama, action, Fantasy...you name it, it has it. Yet is was, and remains to be one of the most under rated Disney movies ever released. The characters are fabulous. The Heroine of the story, Megara, is the first Disney Princess with a past. Hercules, the Hero, is always striving for good, no matter what the cost, and Hades is HILARIOUS, while still being evil to the core. Not to mention all of the smaller characters. They totally balance out the film to perfection. I will never understand why this movie is so unpopular in the world of Disney, because in my opinion, it should be one of the most hailed of it's films. It's truly unique, and should be treasured as the Masterpiece it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules is an excellent movie. This movie has some great and memorable characters. The music is also great and fun to listen to. The story line is fast-paced and exciting, with a great moral lesson behind it. This movie is also very "quotable." I grew up watching this movie and loved it. But now that I am older I see that this movie has more to offer than just good songs and funny characters. Hercules gives a simple, yet informative version of a Greek classic. It provides information about Greek culture and Gods/Goddesses. Because of this movie, I was able to recognize the Greek Gods/Goddesses in school. I think that this movie is great for all ages and everyone can benefit from watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Adult Disney Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a Disney fan my whole life and I like many of the cartoon movies that have been made. This movie, however, is one of my favorites. It is a cartoon for adults. The jokes in it, my 3 year old doesn't get yet ("Somebody call IXII!" or Hercules saying that "I'm an action figure!" in an obvious attempt to make fun of the Disney Store), but he loves the action and the songs. It's nice that there's a Disney movie that entertains us both. Hades and Meg make the film though. Without those characters and the incredible depth given to them by the voice talents of James Woods and Susan Egan, the film would be too fluffy. Wouldn't it be cool to have Cinderella be as sarcastic as Meg? The sad part about it is that she will never be included in the Disney marketing scheme. Seems to me young girls could use a sassy, sarcastic, strong-willed role model. The only part about the movie I never understood is doing gospel singers for a mythological theme. The two seem to clash, but who wants to over-analyze a Disney flick? Megs song stands out anyways as one of the best "love songs" of Disney movies, so I'm fine with the conflict.</fullReview>

The action is one of them.What makes "Hecules" a 'not so great' Disney movie is the story. I don't know, the way it's told makes it flat and too simple. Also the movie lacks some great and fun characters. Only Hades is cool and a memorable villain, also because of course of James Woods, who excellently voiced him. Also the love story disappoints.The movie is filled with some nicely done action sequences which I truly loved. It makes "Hercules" a cool and enjoyable movie to watch.Don't expect an animated masterpiece but expect an enjoyable movie instead.

		<fullReview>Phil is one of my favourite Disney characters and Danny is one of my favourite actors. He is a true friend to Hercules and deserves to have his dream come true. His irascibility conceals a kind heart but most of the time Herc deserves to be yelled at. Herc was cute as a baby and likeable as a teenager but dumb and arrogant after he got muscular. What's worse he fell in love with a really obnoxious woman. Phil and Peg treated her like she deserved until the unsatisfactory ending. (Apart from Phil's dream.) I hated Hades too and the rest of the gods. Hades got irritating lines and the other gods were made out to be good when in greek mythology they're vengeful and promiscuous. But enough has been said in previous comments. The only songs I liked were Go the Distance and One Last Hope. The Muses grated a little. Pain and Panic were the usual dumb henchmen. (Why don't villains employ anyone capable?) I liked Panic best. It's Hades who's annoying. And as for that woman! So as far as I'm concerned the true hero is Phil. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellant But Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Mythology Movies, even cartoon versions, and Disney has made some very wonderful movies, but this movie gets one thing wrong after another. Hercules's mother was Alcmene, not Hera, and his main antagonist for his whole life was Hera not Hades. There were also seven Muses, not five. Philoctetes was the son of his best friend, Poeas, one of the Argonauts whose boat the Argo is shown in peices thirty years too early. Phil, the goat man, though, may be a substitute for Chiron the centaur, but he mentions Odysseus and Achilles (not born yet) and Perseus, Hercules' great grandfather. Theseus, though, is a contemporary. Hercules never rode Pegasus (neither did Perseus fot that matter). There is a scene with a Gorgon, the only creature Hercules never killed.The likenesses of Hermes and Ares are rather insulting, but several of the others are rather splendid and augmented by various voices if but colored rather egregiously (only the Hindu gods had a significantly colored pantheon). Meg was the daughter of King Creon of Thebes, not a lackey of Hades, but she is a part of Hercules' history as his first wife. She was probably placed in the script to avoid parallels with the Legendary Journeys TV series.Depicted as if Teri Hatcher would play her in a live action version, she is one of the truly wonderful characters in the film behind Zeus, Hades and Hercules. Pain and Panic are unnecessary if not inserted for the comic relief and two extra Happy Meal toys. Despite the bloopers and anachronisms, the movie is great entertainment for child and adult and should get any kid interested in mythology as an interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining for a free thinker, but the creators made me sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I really really cannot help but bring up the reminder if respect for beliefs and cultures and religions of others. This Disney's Hercules movie is a total disrespect for the ancient religion. Sure, ancient, but religion and belief nonetheless and let us not forget that there are still some who follow and believe in it. They made Zeus, King of the Gods, act like a total fool and a clown and Hermes, the God of Messengers, act like a total dumb DJ who can't shut up. And they disrespect the other Greek heroes by giving all their credits to Hercules alone. Sure, to the kids and atheists, it is an entertaining movie worth watching again and laugh about. But the fact that the creators made the Greek Gods a laughing stock with this movie is simply disgusting and I really hope they're reading this. Why was The Prince of Egypt not distorted and taken so seriously? Why was that godly tree not dancing about making stupid noises trying to be funny? Why was Moses not falling on his head or get totally whacked by the enemy? And sticks which turn into snakes which can swallow two snakes its size whole at the same time and dividing an entire sea and turning a river into blood can be taken seriously but a child who becomes a God can't? Utterly despicable. And worst, they cast one of the Gods as the villain! Hades, though he is the God of the Underworld, is not evil. And the Underworld is not bad, depends on which part you go to: misty Asphodel, hellish Tartarus, or heavenly peaceful Elysium. Not only do these people distort the legend of a son of a God, they also disgrace the Gods themselves! If you are a strong believer in the Greek religion as I am, seriously, don't watch this movie unless you want to be put off by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately Confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney's Hercules is a curious movie that seeks to entertain but instead managed to provoke a lot of questions. I watched the movie on Netflix one night with my 6 and 12 year old sons, and got a reaction that was pretty typical for them with Disney movies--my 6 year old was scared of the violence and had to leave, and my 12 year old thought it was moderately entertaining. I was intrigued because the movie has gotten a lot of bad press for butchering the myths, but I got to wondering whether this had any effect on how you would judge the movie. Based on a lot of the online reviews I read, the answer seemed to be "no", but enough people were offended that it got me thinking. What is the real effect of this infidelity on how we should judge the movie?In the end, I concluded that the lack of faithfulness to the myths is a serious problem, but not for the reasons that everyone is raising. Most of the objectors are doing so out of a love of the myths--they appreciate the original stories, and believe Disney has no right to mess with them. On the other hand, I think the problem is more subtle. The fact is that Disney movies generally follow a formula, are targeted at a specific age, and perform a sort of cultural work that is very consistent. Specifically, they are made for late elementary or middle-schoolers (note that my 6-year-old was afraid) and they basically are designed to instruct the age in certain moral lessons that are necessary for a child's development. The lessons are generally the power of love, friendship, self-sacrifice, hard work, etc.Now, the problem with Disney's Hercules is not that it does not do this effectively; in fact, it has the usual menu of good animation, good songs, morally aligned characters, etc. The problem is that the original myth is actually rather potent in our culture, and a kids' movie based on Hercules is simply disconcerting. The original Hercules is a character that murdered his family (wife and kids!) and performed labors to atone for his sins. His family was dysfunctional and his step-mom hated him and tried to do him in. He came into existence because his dad, the king of the Gods, was philandering. We know these facts too well--that fact makes this movie just too weird to really conceive of.And yet, here it is, with Hercules transformed into Superman or Beaver Cleaver or whatever. If you are the type who can successfully ignore all of this context, you might be able to watch this movie and enjoy the Gospel-Motown soundtrack. Maybe you can enjoy it like you might take in an episode of the Twilight Zone. I think, however, this was not the producers' intention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may not be the mightiest Disney flick, but "Hercules" has its strong moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since 1989 when they released "The Little Mermaid", the Walt Disney Company had been on a roll with producing high quality animated features again. From such landmark animated features such as "Beauty and the Beast" to heavily underrated animated films like "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", Disney had practically returned to top form. And while Disney's 1997 full-length animated feature "Hercules" may not bare comparison to the best Disney animated films that came out during that time, it's still an entertaining enough picture in its own unique way. The film starts with the Greek god Zeus (Rip Torn) and his wife Hera celebrating the birth of their son Hercules with the other gods of Olympus, including his evil brother Hades (James Woods). Hades wants to take over Mount Olympus and believes that Hercules will stand in his way. So, he sends his minions Pain and Panic to kidnap baby Hercules and make him drink a potion that will turn him mortal. However, young Hercules still obtains his strength from Mount Olympus and is adopted by farmers. As he grows up, he has trouble fitting in with other people due to his strength and wants to find out where he came from. He is able to learn about his real past from Zeus' statue in the Temple of Zeus and also learns that he can reclaim his place on Mount Olympus if he can become a "true hero". Hercules is then sent to find a satyr by the name of Phil (Danny DeVito) who has been known to train some of the finest heroes Greece has ever seen, but has retired due to one letdown too many. But Hercules convinces him otherwise and Phil trains Hercules into a possible hero. When Hercules is older and ready, he and Phil decide to head for the dangerous city of Thebes so that Hercules can perform "heroic deeds" to get the attention of the Gods. On the way, Hercules meets a damsel-in-distress named Meg whom Hercules eventually starts to fall in love with even though he doesn't know that she's secretly Hades' minion. As Hercules starts to become a celebrity of sorts for all the "heroic deeds" he does for the citizens of Thebes, he eventually begins to realize what it means to be a true hero. I found it funny how the reason why Hercules was a misfit when he was a teenager was because he was too physically strong. Something you don't see everyday, right? I liked the scene when teenage Hercules accidentally destroys an entire temple (where Greek citizens hang out and apparently "shop" at) all for the innocent sake of catching a Frisbee. That scene in a way shows a potential downside to being too strong on a physical level. Now, I'm not saying that exercising isn't important. I'm saying that excessive exercising might not be. Another aspect about "Hercules" that I liked was the message it was getting across. That message being that a true hero is someone who doesn't simply defeat many of the opponents they come across. A true hero is someone who does something brave that no normal person in their right mind would have the courage to do. True heroes are people who will do the right thing when no one else is capable of doing it. While Hercules did stand up to enormous creatures that no one else would stand up to, at first it was technically more for showing off his strength rather than doing something beneficial for humanity. The most interesting character in "Hercules" is the villain Hades. Yes, I realize how clichéd picking the villain as the best character of a movie can be, but I can't help it. The villains are usually more fascinating characters than most heroes, and the villain in "Hercules" is no exception. I thought that the animation design of Hades was really cool and the way the color of his flame/hair reflected his emotions (red symbolizing his anger, blue symbolizing that he's calm). But of course, James Woods' voice-over delivery is truly what makes this character complete. I admire how Hades doesn't talk like your normal Disney villain would talk, but instead talks similar to a businessman. The story to "Hercules" isn't really original or unpredictable save for a few little touches. Just like most other Disney films, you can easily guess how everything will turn out in the end without any problems. I personally could have done without a few side characters particularly some of the sidekicks, like Pain and Panic, which were only created for the sole purpose of killing some screen time. Although I didn't mind the style of the animation or the music in this film, it won't be for everybody. I can understand why some people don't care for the music. I'll admit that black gospel music mixed with Greek mythology is a weird mix to say the least. At least I found two good songs that I liked out of it. Some people say that the animation style is also strange, but I wasn't too bothered by it either since I thought the style was unique. "Hercules" is a light and fluffy entry from the Disney canon. If all you need is simply an entertaining enough film to show to your kids, then "Hercules" should do the trick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie, and I believe it is one of the most underrated Disney movies, especially of the renaissance. It's full of the ingredients to make a perfect Disney movie: Comedy (thank you, James Woods/The Muses), a brilliant role model for young girls (Megara), and catchy songs, which you know already. It sucks that this movie doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Although I think that almost everything that comes out of the Disney studios is pure wonderful (with the exception of Cars....yikes), this is definitely a stand out in what they did. I'd even go as far as to say that this movie trumps one of Disney's classics of the 90's - Aladdin. Maybe it just wasn't marketed properly, but I believe this should be up there with the greats. In short, I love this movie, as I've mentioned 500 times already. My 3rd favourite in my list of Disney movies, and very hard to shove from that position. And who put the glad in gladiator?

		<fullReview>So i picked this one up for 50% off at one of the local big box stores. My 4 year old daughter is in a real Disney phase right now, just devouring everything. We were at the point where we were picking up the more obscure Disney flicks from the 90's, like HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and TARZAN (which we have found for dirt cheap!) I remembered seeing this back when it first came out in 97, and remember feeling like it was more of a boy movie, but for the price i figured "eh, if she even watches it once we got our money's worth out of it."My daughter had worn the DVDs for "SLEEPING BEAUTY" and "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" right out, but neither of them compare to how much she loves "HERCULES"! Ever since i bought the movie a week ago she has watched the movie 2 times a day, each day, since then. It has trumped her love of every other Disney movie! I know a lot of people feel like Meg is a side character who doesn't really connect with most young girls, but my daughter looks at her as the absolute best Disney Princess of them all.I also have to say that "I won't say I'm in Love" has gotta be near the top of the list of the most under-appreciated, underrated Disney songs. My daughter keeps asking for me to replay that song over and over and over, and she dances up a storm to it. If you're thinking this movie might not appeal to the young Disney Princess in your life, think again.Really a gem for what you pay for it, right now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a guy born in 1993, I grew up when Disney was putting out some classics. I.E. The Lion King, Aladdin, Toy Story, the list goes on and on. But I have to say, when you talk to people about Disney in the '90s, Hercules doesn't usually come up in conversation. I have no idea why. For those who denounce it for it's lack of mythical accuracy, what a bunch of garbage. Do you think Aladdin was historically accurate? Can lions talk? No, so what's the big deal with tweaking Greek Mythology in order to make a children's movie? There shouldn't be one. This movie is such a complete, feel good flick that it motivated me to write a review on here. I'm on this site every day without fail, and I've never felt enthused or irritated enough to post a review. Well I watched this movie again for the first time in years and I just had to. Incredible soundtrack, inspiring story, and great dynamic between the characters. Personally this is my favorite performance of James Woods. In fact, I'm not even a fan of James Woods but he is awesome in this, Hades is almost lovable as the main villain. This movie was as much fun for me at age 19 as it was when I saw it in theaters at age 4, probably even more enjoyable. Watch it despite what you've heard. Show your kids, I know I'm planning on it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, but underrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just had to sign in to write up a review. And after a year or so, I had to come back and edit it after another thought.Overall: I find it great! It's a fun watch and you shouldn't toss too many thoughts into it or it'll make everything go sour. This is the same for a lot of shows and movies. And that's the same for The Walking Dead, which I analyzed in details and found lots of parts that didn't make a whole lot of sense either. So details are not important.Originality/Creativity: It's a pretty neat and original story as compared to others of the time (1997). It gave a total twist to the female roles in typical Disney movies. The humour of Meg and Hades was really different too. Artwork: I really don't know. When I was a kid, I found it gorgeous with those random swirlies. Looking at it now, it's a little weird but I don't dislike it. The artwork is very fantasy-like, which really works for this. Music: I really love the Muses and the insert singing of Hercules and Meg. The lyrics also really suit the movie instead of taking insert songs, where the lyrics doesn't really "fit in". Of course there are also really good music/songs by other Disney movies too. They got really awesome music most the time, like Little Mermaid.Parts that doesn't make a lot of sense: I think there are a few around but I just want to point out like three. At the beginning Zeus says that Hercules got his strength. So Zeus should be pretty should too. But when the Titans fought with Zeus, he acted like he has no strength and only got thunderbolts. So he threw thunderbolts one at a time and did nothing to the mountain/rock titan. As a result, Zeus lost his part of the fight. When Hercules came, he basically flew around in circles to annoy Hades and then release Zeus. And this time, by throwing two-three thunderbolts at the same time, it blasted the mountain/rock titan's head off and scared them off. The tornado titan also did nothing during the whole fight other than helping Hercules kill the other titans. In conclusion, to make this whole scenario make any sense, Hercules' role in this whole battle is only for morale purposes and using the tornado titan to kill the rest is just extra to fulfill the part where he wins the battle. When Hercules lost his strength, apparently he still kept his God-like durability. He was flung half way across the city within a second and smacked into a concrete wall. I don't know about you, but I'll be pretty dead. But let's just say that he did retain his God-like durability. Then Meg's sacrifice was for nothing other than getting Hercules' strength back since Hercules wouldn't even felt that pillar dropping on him. And isn't the deal that Meg will be safe from any harm? So even self inflicted harm like stabbing her own leg would be just fine. For some reason, both Hades, Meg, and Hercules thought it had to be lethal. Third point, when Hercules saves Meg by jumping into the river of death, we can clearly see that the 'river' part is fairly far down from the ledge, where Hercules jumped off from. But for some reason, he was able to reach all the way to almost touch Meg, when he first arrived. Okay, let's just say that was an illusion created by the angles. But when he stuck his hands into the river, it virtually instantly 'dried up'. However, for some reason, he was able to maintain his body's health and fluid while swimming towards Meg. Somehow, he prolonged his death. Educational Purposes/Authenticity to Source: I basically threw a random low score that makes me "feel" right. Hera isn't Hercules' mother. The "step-mother" was the real mother, at least according to Wikipedia. Hercules isn't a God, just a demi-god, which he stayed true to (in the end, sort of). Hercules had all those adventures, or "trials", which is "sort of" what Hercules in this movie did to become the "true hero". Basically, some facts are somewhat right but not for the right reasons. So it's pretty bad. Cautious Note for "Reviewers": It's really bad to put false information in a kid's movie. It's giving kids false info. But at the same time, it's a kid's movie. It's suppose to be childish, silly, not real and fantasy-like. This should be an element put aside. And to top it off, reviewing a kid's movie should be done with a kid's perspective in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hercules - Zero or Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hercules is a spectacular Disney Classic with a fun, action story mixed with a tale of love and betrayal. It has some great musical numbers such as, 'Go the Distance', 'Won't say I'm in Love' and 'Zero to Hero'. These things make it seem like a fantastic film that all Disney lovers must see. And that is how I see it but many people don't; they find the movie very inaccurate and dislike the pop culture references or think the score and story are poor. To be honest, I don't understand, much, why these people don't like this classic tale. Yes, the plot is not much like the real story of Hercules but this is a children's movie - it wasn't made to be historically correct or educational. I agree, the pop culture references (action figures, other modern day merchandise, erc.) are a bit annoying and don't fit in hugely but fantastic Disney Movies such as Aladdin were full of these references and nobody trashes them in reviews. I found the plot and score really good and they worked well together to make the overall outcome even better. The film has interesting characters that are humorous (Hades and Pain and Panic) and very heroic ( Hercules and Meg) who all have a back-story which is referred to, often rather subtly, somewhere in the movie. This makes you feel for the characters more. All in all, Hercules is a really good Disney movie that many children (especially boys) will want to see. It is no Beauty and the Beast or Lion King or Aladdin but it is absolutely splendid with its story, music and characters. Disney's Hercules is definitely a HERO not a zero!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most underrated Disney movie, and one of the greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some people when people think of the best Disney animated movies they generally over look Hercules. I find this odd because Hercules is without a doubt in my mind one of the best animated movies Disney has ever made. From the characters, to the songs, the animation and just everything about this movie is good.Hercules is not accurate to Mythology, but then again how many Disney movies are accurate to their stories? One of the reasons why Hercules is good is because it doesn't try to hide violence, it doesn't try to tame the underworld, it doesn't try to be absolutely kid friendly. The monsters can be slightly goofy, but generally they are creepy. The Hydra ranks as one of the coolest monsters ever in a Disney movie, because while it is CGI, it is animated to look more like a traditionally animated monster. The underworld is exceptionally dark for a Disney movie, but it is wonderful just how much detail they put into it to make it dark.The characters are probably the main reason why this movie is so good. None of the characters are your average Disney characters. Hercules is the brave, slightly arrogant, but a bit awkward hero. Pegasus (yes I know Hercules in mythology never rode Pegasus) is a good horse character though a lot of Disney movies have horse side characters. Meg is a unique female character because unlike most Disney Princesses who are near perfect and beautiful and everything, Meg is quite the opposite. She is sarcastic, a brunette, and doesn't seem to take anything too seriously. While there are plenty of more interesting characters, Hades is a fantastic villain. While at first he seems kind of wimpy for being the Lord of the Underworld, later you start to realize just how dark and evil he can be. He seems almost like a lawyer at times in just how well he phrases things and how well he plans.Overall Hercules is a much better Disney movie than the average animated movie because it actually focuses on action, unique characters, a beautiful art style, and a good soundtrack. The art style in this movie is good because it tries to be similar to Greek art style. Again, great movie that was actually original and had great dialogue. A great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HerculesIf you went solely on Greek statues, then you could assume that all Grecians have no arms.Fortunately, the Greek demigod rendered in this animated-adventure has both limbs.Orphaned from his parents, Zeus (Rip Torn) and Hera, thanks to Hades (James Woods), Hercules (Tate Donovan) is raised by humans, with no knowledge of his birthright.It's not until he visits the Temple of Zeus that he learns of his true bloodline. As well as his purpose: to reclaim his position on Mount Olympus through gallantry on Earth.And to do that, he needs renowned hero-maker/satyr Phil (Danny DeVito) and his winged- mount Pegasus.Elsewhere, Hades plans to usurp his brother by releasing the Titans.One of the few Disney movies geared towards young males, Hercules is an action-packed party of mythological proportions.Furthermore, it may inspire a few fatties out there to go kill themselves a lion with their bare hands.

		<fullReview>Wow. What a spiteful bunch of comments to read. There is WAY TOO MUCH hate in this world, eh? This movie is one of the few i clearly and joyfully remember as a childhood favorite. I even remember i had a computer game with Herc that i absolutely loved. So, watched it again today (thats a HUGE time gap), no intentions, random selection. I was less impressed, of course, the magic feeling i had then could not be repeated, but i still enjoyed it a lot. From today's point of view, the aesthetics are almost worthless, but i don't see why such a thing should cloud the viewer's judgment. The world has changed!As a kid who grew up with this particular movie and all of other Disneys adaptations, i am here to say WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS ENCHANTED WITH THIS MOVIE. So were all of the other kids i knew. Therefore, all of the 'concerned parents' commenting here, i can't believe you. People like YOU will find something treatening and offensive in anything! The world was such a better place when parents in general weren't paranoid freaks! No wonder your kids don't enjoy it today, they are used to all the modern crap the media feeds them.It is true that the facts aren't true. But who really cares? It is for children, right? For me, this was just enough to make me fall in love with Greek myths, and learn as much as i can about them as i grew up. That was the point. Everyone who wants to know the real story, can look up for it. This is a positive distortion of it, and it is the best way to present things in a kid's mind. You got the villain, the hero, the pretty girl, the helpers. You can't give children complex drama and bloody plot twists....i mean really?!I really don't think that this movie deserves all of this negative criticsm. A) It is FOR KIDS. Sc**w the facts, if they are a bit too much! B) We, the kids of that era, LOVED it. C) You cannot make a parallel between technology now and the one used 10+ ago. As far as originality is concerned, i found the 'nipple'spirals used in this movie a really interesting touch, because they reflect well upon the image and style of the ancient times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that made me want to be a Disney fan again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back when I was a big kid and going through an anti-Disney phase, because I thought all of the movies (even the classic animated ones) were just for little kids. But then one day, around my 14th birthday in September of 2009, my autistic twin brother bought this movie on a DVD and I decided to let him watch it in our bedroom one night. At first the movie didn't keep my attention, because I was thinking a Disney movie would hardly grab my attention, and I was sort of tired that night. Until the amazing song "Zero to Hero" played and the movie instantly grabbed my attention, since I thought the song was so cool and fun. After watching the whole movie, I thought to myself 'What have I done?! I actually was trying to avoid these songs for all these years?! I should watch more of the classic Disney movies as soon as possible!' I did watch most of the great Disney movies on Youtube, and I saw that this movie had some songs that made it to the Top 100 Disney songs of all time (I Can Go the Distance, Zero to Hero, I Won't Say I'm In Love, and A Star Is Born). And I am now officially a Disney fan again, thanks to this fun movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the privilege of watching this movie just a few hours ago, and I really wanted to watch it again!! This yet another great Disney which hasn't received as much recognition as it should have.I'm not a mythology fan; reading Greek mythology in school makes me gag. Disney's representation of the myths and gods was, while cartoony, highly entertaining. I liked the characters a lot. Hercules and Meg made an adorable couple and their chemistry was definitely there. Phil was funny and a really nice guy. Zeus was portrayed as a kind, fatherly character, though in mythology they make him sound like a bad-tempered jerk. Hades was entertaining, and one of my favorite Disney villains along with Maleficent and Shan-Yu. I loved the effect of him bursting into flames when he was angry. I also laughed at his two brainless minions, Pain and Panic. The animation was slightly cartoony, but at the same time it was incredible and it in a way individualized the movie. The landscapes, Mount Olympus, and the Underworld were truly breath-taking. What particularly wowed me was the Underworld. I looked a lot like what I imagine the Underworld to look like, with it's towering, spiky stalactites and stalagmites, greenish smoke, and terrifying pit of dead souls swirling around endlessly. A chilling yet detailed masterpiece. In addition, I noticed in the scene when Hercules fights the Hydra, it was animated in an almost 3D style. It looked really cool!This movie has a whole lot of action in it, possibly more than any other Disney movie. I loved to watching Hercules battle the Hydra, or the Titans try to take over Mount Olympus, or Hades send out horrible monsters to defeat Hercules. Every moment is a thrill!The music is very interesting. The five or six girls who sing all throughout the movie sing in a weird gospel style, which is an interesting choice of theme for this particular movie. I don't have a problem with it though, I thought it was creative. I also enjoyed Hercules' song about "going the distance" and finding where he really belongs in the world. I found it quite inspiring. Hercules is a great movie. Mythology fan or not, this movie will entertain you and help you discover what a true hero really is. Watch it! You will enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disney film for Mythology fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a nack for the Greek myths and Hercules is another favorite Disney movie because of the amazing music by Alan Menken (composer of The Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc.) and colourful animation. The film is based on the myth of Greek hero Hercules who must become a true hero in order to reclaim immortality and entry to Mt. Olympus. The story has been altered in the Disney twist, so in the Greek myth, Hercules isn't the son of Zeus and his wife, Hera, but the product of Zeus cheating on his wife with a mortal woman, Alcmene (Hercules' mortal Foster Mother in the film) -- this was a fairly common practice for the king of the gods. Hera was really Hercules biggest nemesis and she hunted down and tried to destroy him many times, like she did with all of Zeus' illegitimate children. And, Hades doesn't appear in the tale except when Hercules traveled to Tartarus (the underworld) to retrieve his pet Cerberus. He wasn't a "devil figure" but the hard-working guardian of Tartarus. So anyway, this film might "cheese-off" mythology buffs like me...a little.I love the film really! It's just one thing that I am not to comfortable with, and it's the constant references to other things. The jokes of a New Yorkish city that needs saving and Air Nike shoes and the other celebrity-product-endorsing...I mean it is getting old! I know it's family-orientated, and I respect at what the animation staff (and Disney himself) are trying to do...really! So I am not going to complain about it. "I Won't Say" is one of my favorite scenes from the movie. And also the "Go The Distance" musical sequence, and when Herc and Megara go up to Mt. Olympus. So Mythology fans, film fans and musical fans, I would advise you to over-look the flaws and enjoy this beautifully animated Disney classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walt himself said: "I believe the best learning happens when something is presented in an entertaining way." Walt was right of course, and Hercules teaches a little while it entertains a lot. The opening gives kids a window into ancient Greece and it's fables designed to impart lessons to the masses.The movie itself has some A-list entertainers and is fun and well written. Obviously it's aimed at kids, but the grown-ups will find plenty of laughs and lots of tender smiles. The thing that has always captured the publics imagination regarding Disney classics is the power of the heart and the struggle between good and bad (or righteousness and evil in this case). I won't be redundant and share the plot with you. Quite frankly if you don't know the story of Hercules this movie is a pleasant primer. Maybe it will inspire you to go to the library and learn more about Hercules and Greek Tragedies in general. The Tragedies predate many spiritual works and probably provided much of the motivation for theological and philosophical works to follow.Just sit back with your kids or someone you luv and enjoy 90 plus minutes of light hearted fun with a timeless message. It's better than anything on TV or cable if you need a justification, but you wont.</fullReview>

Although the story doesn't quite go along with the actual G Hercules story, it still implies them in the story including some of the monsters Hercules had to fight in his twelve trials. What the story lacks in tradition it makes up in songs and laughs. The songs from this movie are up there with the songs from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast. Phil is definitely competition to the Genie and Sebastion. The lovely Meg plays starts a new type of Disney girl in that she is sarcastic and clever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the best Disney films of the bunch. What can you expect from a film created by the same geniuses who did The Little Mermaid and Aladdin? Although there are a few errors in terms of the mythology it's based on, it's a fantastic watch. The comedy is flawless for all ages- I saw it for the first time when I was 9 years old and nine years later I'm still finding the jokes hilarious and discovering more gags that I hadn't spotted before. The songs are brilliant- the composer is a complete genius. I watched Hercules on DVD two days ago and I'm still singing the songs at random. They're catchy and just... wow. I love "I Won't Say I'm In Love" (Megara's solo). I'm still impressed with Susan Egan's singing voice to this day. The Muses... wow. I love the choral touch they add to the songs. And the fact that they're actually telling the story is really unique- it's kind of an advance from Aladdin where the stall owner is telling the story, except the Muses appear throughout the film whereas the stall owner only appears at the beginning of the first film and the end of the third. My favourite character is definitely Megara- what's not to love about her? She's tough, she's funny, she's sarcastic and she has a heart of gold. A classic Disney girl. If you haven't seen Hercules yet, I strongly recommend that you do- you shan't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was fantastic, even though I may be slightly biased because I am a big fan of Disney films in general! This is by far my favourite however, I loved the fact that the kid who was bullied at school for being different was strong enough to become a true hero, and fall in love all at the same time. The humour of Phil (and even Hades), the comic slapstick of Pain and Panic, the naivety and courage of Hercules and the romance with Meg all add together to make a classic. The songs will be stuck in your head for days to come, and the heartwarming ending to "A Star Is Born" (especially when Phils dream is realised of Hercules becoming a constellation) is enough to bring a tear to your eye! Superb film which I'll definitely watch again!</fullReview>

Which has been executed in away that doesn't actually confuse the younger audience. Instead it allows them to become quite involved with the story line and join in with the action as the story progresses as well as the finger clapping, toe tapping songs! The music for this Disney picture is amazing, right up to the standards we 'd expect.This film is worth buying in any edition.

Someone made a comment about this movie saying they didn't understand why Hercules was given the potion to be mortal instead of Zeus. REWATCH THE MOVIE STUPID!! THE WHOLE PLOT IS THAT HERCULES- NOT ZEUS- HERCULES IS GOING TO RUIN HADES'S PLAN! now that i have that off my chest, this was a wonderful movie. I think it was well done, well thought out, and very interesting. I have a new favorite Disney movie! I also think the voice's for the characters were well matched. As for the plot? As most of us know, Hercules is a god. He gets turned mortal by Hades, the lord of the underworld, in the event that he is to spoil his plans to rule the world. Hades thinks him dead, and goes through life joyously trying to recruit people for his take over. Hercules grows to be a strong hero, trained by Phil, and falls in love with Meg, Hades's minion, and Meg falls in love with him. What else happens? WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I first when to see Hercules when it was released in theaters. I liked it but didn't think it was up to par like other Disney classics such as Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc... But I've been trying to collect most of the Disney DVD's for my two children Tristan 4? and Shea who is almost 3. So I asked my mother to buy me Hercules, Pocahontas, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame for my birthday. On Jan. 24th, so she picked up all three, so that I could sit down and enjoy them with my children. Well my kids love Hercules. They laugh, clap, and cheer along with the movie. Which makes me feel good. My son Tristan loves it, he loves Hercules. Since we are Florida residents with seasonal passes, I promised him that we would go to MGM Studios soon to try and look for Hercules &amp; Megara. My children love to meet and have their pictures taken with all of the characters. My point is because a movie may be a little different from the standard Disney classic. To give it a chance, you may find you'll enjoy it. I know I did. Tristan also loves Aladdin too! Shea's favorite is Beauty and the Beast. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Below Musker and Clements standards, but still one of Disney's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Ron Clements and John Musker...Their 1989 flick The Little Mermaid saved Disney's motion picture franchise, and it was no surprise: the film boasted delightful characters, a feel-good story, gorgeous art, catchy tunes, and a heart to shame everything Disney had done since 1967. Surely they couldn't top Mermaid, could they? Wrong, they could! And they did, in 1992, with Aladdin, a film that I still consider the greatest, most perfect motion picture ever created, animated or otherwise.Musker's and Clements' next film for Disney didn't come till five years later, when they put a spin on Greek Mythology with this film, Hercules. While Hercules doesn't quite measure up to The Little Mermaid, and certainly won't challenge Aladdin, it is still my favorite of the modern Disney films save Aladdin, Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.The film is one of the funniest and most energetic that Disney has ever done. Phil is a riot, but the real showstopper is Hades, who ranks as one of my top 5 Disney villains in history. There are gags, wisecracks, and all sorts of comical scenes. Arguably the cleverest script of Disney.The story isn't the hottest of modern Disney, but that's okay because it's merely an excuse to put together one gigantic laughfest after another.The music isn't too shabby. I like the score and the songs (especially The Gospel Truth) are catchy enough. It deserves more respect than what it's getting.Unfortunately, since the film is on a caffiene spurge the first 2/3rds of the film, the character development that made Mermaid, Beauty, and Aladdin outstanding films is severely hindered. You really don't know too much about the personalities of the characters. Nevertheless, the characters are great fun.Certainly not Disney's best, but definitely one of the best and maybe the most entertaining.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie; One of the best from Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While breezy, and obviously not following EVERY detail of the classic mythos, it does a nice job of humanizing a rather cold and often cruel character. It's made for kids. That said, it's a wonderful film about trust, love, faith, and the true nature of being a hero as opposed to being popular and rich. Add to that, there are these great Broadway-style songs that really help expression the emotions of the characters. Megara is brash and modern, as are the Muses who add class and beat to the story. Danny DeVito is at his slimy best. And the guy playing Hercules sounds and delivers the kind of innocence that Christopher Reeve portrayed in Superman. No Disney film is going to deal with the adult themes that take place in the various legends they portray. This one uses that legend well, though, and builds an enjoyable and unique story for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of Disney movies, I must say this is a disaster. I disagree with the person who said that it grows on you; I find it to be the opposite. The first time I saw it, I was indifferent. The second time, I was bored. The third time, it had been a few years so I wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered it to be. Well, I was wrong, it was worse. The jokes are forced, the characters are unlikeable, the animation is horrible, and the music is not up to Disney's standards. Quite disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hero's dream well played out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disney scores an impressive movie with this story about the title character and his quest to become a true hero. HERCULES has a very enjoyable sound track that you cannot help but move to (no matter how annoying you think the Muses are, it does not stop you from liking their music). Every song offers the same gospel/soul stuff, but they are all so good! Animation is also dead on with the personality of the characters though some of the scenes with Zeus really make him look like a wiener. At the beginning when Zeus teases with baby Hercules looks really silly for the king of gods compared to the poise of Mufasa in THE LION KING. Hermes was also completely not funny and seemed to take away from everything he was in. Little things here and there really did not seem necessary either. In Thebes, where Phil and the chariot driver were yelling at each other was not only stupid but there could have been another funny joke in there. Once the River Guardian was defeated, Pegasus did not have to trot all over him and then stomp on the back of his head. For a children's movie, I would not like all the children who watch HERCULES to turn into sore winners. But in an era where the media acknowledges girl power and independent women constantly, it was good to see just one movie that talks about a young man pursuing his dream of belonging.Hooking up with Pegasus and Phil, Hercules trains hard for the hope to be with his father and mother, Zeus and Hera. The crew heads off to Thebes where saving the town from hard times is their plan. Meanwhile, the after life god Hades and his cohorts, Pain, Panic and Meg, continue to plan their world domination against Zeus while trying to stop Hercules, who is destined by the Fates, to stop them. What also adds into the mix is Hercules' attraction to Meg who shows signs of feeling the same as well.HERCULES is a very fun movie with very fun songs and very likeable characters. It has been far too long for a Disney villain to have a personality as crazy as Hades. Considering the last few villains have been too articulate as Meg would put it. Except for a couple of dragging parts, HERCULES is great for the kids and parents. There is a great mix of comedy and drama for a good animated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The weirdest Disney movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the gracefully stylish art created for the background as well as some truly amazing animation and pretty amusing cultural references and visual gags, I found this movie to be quite loud and rather bawdy for my liking. Instead of a straightforward adaptation of the ancient Greek legend, this Disney version turns out to be a comically caricatured, rainbow color-sodden cartoony take-off with a great deal of very creepy gothical fantasy thrown in.The story takes place when Hercules was a fat little baby in the queenly Hera's arms (the irony is that Disney made Zeus and Hera out to be such proud, doting parents when the original version actually protrayed Zeus as a philandering womanizer while Hera, while a wife to him, was REALLY his sister and a vengeful, fire-breathing one to boot.) Hades, the big bad old villain with blue fire for hair decided that he wants to take over the whole Olympus kingdom (which looks just like a big, fluffy sculpture of marshmallow and whipped cream), so he had his wacky sidekicks, Pain and Panic swipe the kid and depose of him so he wouldn't grow up to overthrow the bad guy. But he did and he turned out to be such a gawky, awkward urchin with too-big hands and feet. So poor Hercules turned to the pot-bellied satyr, who would be his personal trainer to make him into the most perfect hero you will ever clap your eyes on. Thus he became rich and famous - a pretty ridiculous protrayal of today's pop culture, especially Disney itself. But the evil Hades had a few more sly tricks up his toga sleeve...including Megan, the very svelte auburn-tressed temptress with a smart-aleck mouth.This movie is just like a big bowl of colorful, juicy lip-smackin' eye-candy - but bewarned, parents...it will also have TALL, SHARP TEETH with its very scary monsters and some creepy moments that would make some really sensitive viewers shudder and shudder long after the credits begin rolling. But at least the kids will get the message that heroism just isn't everything after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 3-year-old son's seen "Hercules" more than a hundred times, so I've got this one pretty much memorized. It is a clever, lively film. Cheesy in spots, but few Disney films aren't. Fine animation, as per usual from Disney. In the post-"Little Mermaid" pantheon, I'd put it ahead of Hunchback and (barely) ahead of Mulan and Aladdin. But behind Lion King, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas and Beauty and The Beast. (I haven't seen Tarzan yet, so I'm not sure how it compares with that.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Solid Disney Offering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw Hercules on video and found it to be quality entertainment. The Disney take on Greek mythology was creative, with James Woods as Hades a definite highlight. An example of a creative touch: Hades' hair is always operating at a slow burn, but when he gets mad, the flame turns from blue to orange. Hercules as the protagonist is likeable and earnest, so that you really want him to win. Of course in the Greek myth Hercules was the child of Zeus and a mortal. Since Disney won't tolerate adultery among its animated deities, of course Hera is presented as his mother here. A minor detail, I figure if you want the real Greek myth then read the original. Meg as the love interest is a contrast to the usual lily white Disney heroine, a little hard edged but still likeable enough in the end. Danny Devito voices Phil, the trainer to the hero (shades of Rocky), and is very effective and amusingly animated. Several of the action sequences are outstanding, including one where the hero battles a multiheaded beast. I was quite dazzled by this sequence. Also loved the metaphor of the Fates cutting the string of life to send another soul to the underworld (was that from Greek mythology or a Disney touch?)I cannot help but reflect upon how animated features have changed over the years. Characters are voiced by recognizable stars, which becomes a bit distracting. They have quick cuts like an MTV video, cultural references that will mean nothing in twenty years. The timelessness just isn't there anymore, but I nonetheless enjoyed this film a great deal. Disney still has the magic, and no one else can touch them in this area. Compared to the average film showing at your local movie house, even an average Disney offering is a clear winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Disney disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Walt Disney pictures released "Pocahontas", it seems that all of their films following it have gone downhill. The last great Disney film was "The Lion King". After that, the last few Disney films have never managed to recapture the awesome might of "The Lion King". I refused to see this film when it first came out, and I also avoided it on video. I finally sat down and watched it with my niece, who owns every Disney movie. My overall impression of the film was, well, it could've been better. The villain reminded me of the genie in "Aladdin", and he wasn't evil enough. The songs are forgettable, and the usual comic relief was washed up. There's nothing really to say about this. The animation could've been better. The CGI creature with all the heads(I don't remember what it's called) was about the only cool thing in the movie. It reminded me of Gerald Scarfe's animation sequences in "Pink Floyd The Wall"(maybe it was Gerald himself who designed the creature in "Hercules"). The love story(which is part of Disney's recycled formula) was slapped in the film, as was the comic relief and all the rest of what's included in the film. It was decent, but not great. There was nothing new. And the villain's final curtain was quickly done and overwith, which was very unsatisfying. It's hard for me to like Disney films anymore. They lack the power of "The Lion King", and the brilliant lyricism of "Beauty and the Beast". Kids might like it though, little kids. Don't watch it if you've already become fed up with Walt Disney Pictures' lack of delivering a good film to it's audiences.</fullReview>

Yes, there are characters other than Hercules, Zeus, Athena, Hades, etc. that have been added on for enjoyment, but it's still very exciting, indeed.Some of the characters that I have liked the most included Hades; here, because it's a Disney film, he is bad, but not really bad like in the myths.

		<fullReview>With Hercules Disney enters the world of Greek mythology, but Hercules is not really worth seeing, since there in my opinion are many other far better Disneymovies(Mulan, Lion King, Pinocchio etc.) The story is about Hercules, the son of Zeus, who is kidnapped and grows up on Earth instead of in the resident of the Greek Gods. When he grows up, Hercules wants to be a God, but first he has to show that he is a true hero, by doing several tasks. The animation in Hercules is certainly not up to Disney`s usual standard but ok nevertheless. All the songs are very bad, and in my opinion completely pointless. The film is sometimes entertaining but I felt bored at many points in this film. 5/10</fullReview>

Nothing will top what goes down with the Hydra however.Think of this as a sequel to Aladdin in ways, same kinda outlook, same kinda sensibility.

		<shortDescription>Thin acting, inconsistent plot, good animation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The animation is up to full Disney standards, but the writers and director need to be upbraided for not following through. The plot departs critically from Greek legend in most respects, but assumes that the viewer knows the legend in enough detail to recognize the Seven Labours. The music and the one-liners were excellent, but they merely made the flick worth watching -- they couldn't make up for the criminal lack of central action. James Woods did an excellent job as Hades, and Danny DeVito did credit to Phil, but the other voices needed more motivation from the director. Hercules came off as a clone of Aladdin between scenes.When a writer violates The World As We Know It (real or legendary), the audience has reason to expect proper remuneration for our suspension of belief. This is true with Science Fiction, superheroes, or slapstick. In this coin, "Hercules" returns about ten cents on the dollar. There is rarely later justification for most of the changes. The Fates, for instance, could have been left complex and ominous instead of a frivolous interjection.Finally, I was personally and generally offended by the rotten parent-child development in the movie. A "family movie" shouldn't show such frivolous disregard for any sort of family stability. I can hear someone crying "But we're dealing with Greek Gods here, by Jupiter!". No, we aren't: Herc's biological parents are shown as a stable couple in Olympus. Once Herc discovers he's not a regular mortal, he drops his adoptive parents out of the movie (except for a walk-on appearance in the final scene), and goes ladder-climbing after the parents who give him little to no guidance. I am a Disney fan, a step-child, and an adoptive parent myself -- and I was offended by the lack of treatment in the name of entertaining my kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>otherwise it would be the worst in my opinion. Let's talk about the problems:First, the accuracy.This movie had nothing to do with its source, and while this is common in Disney, this was just insulting.-Hades wasn't the villain, heck, he even helped Hercules. Hera was. This is a problem because we were denied the possibility of a less clichéd villain fighting for a less clichéd cause. - Um, why is there gospel music in Greek Mythology.- Hercules killed Megara. You probably should've mentioned that.But that's understandable, Disney does that a lot. And also it's a kids movie, I get it. So this is forgivable. Now the worst part: The Clichés.-Hercules is a dorky awkward bully victim. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD HE'S HERCULES. WHO WOULD BULLY HIM.-Everybody hates him because he's different and calls him a freak. Seriously. This is getting old. Once again, WHY WOULD YOU INSULT HERCULES.-Hades wants to... that's right... take over the world. -Hades has two minions, a fat guy and a skinny guy. -Hercules is your typical idiot hero after he grows up.- Hercules is the chosen one.- Hades reveals his plan in front of Phil.Next, the pop culture references. Air Hercs, really? On top of that one of Hades' minions own these.It was unfunny, clichéd, and horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 3/28/2009 ? 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Musker &amp; Ron Clements): OK Disney animated feature about the son of the great Zeus and his silly adventures. This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare). The movie is narrated by a 60's like Gospel group, who end every song with "the gospel truth." I'm sure this didn't make the religious right very happy about this movie(but they never really made movies for them anyway?but don't tell 'em). All in all, the movie is watchable but not the kind of Disney fare that we've come to expect from them. The same formula just not executed as well as some of their other movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I laugh when I read most of the reviews here because they are so concerned about accuracy to story. As any real film viewer knows, movies aren't about story or the intricateness of the plot. They help, but aren't necessary.This gets the dubious honor of being the most interesting of Disney's Phase III releases. I'm not saying it's worth watching, but you should notice a few ironies if you do.Disney has, since the start, found something where they invest themselves in their work. In 'Beauty and the Beast' it was in Belle. In 'Pocahantas' it was in the "New World" concept. They also find interesting ways of skewing perspectives (e.g. in 'Dumbo' the elephants are both the Axis powers and the Republicans. One symbol is obvious, the other isn't). Here it is not a character or a place, but an idea. Consider:--The modernization of Hercules with the endorsement machine. Not since 'Dumbo' have we seen a similar portrayal. Disney flaunts the very process that makes their marketing campaigns so huge. Since 'Little Mermaid', Disney has relied on flooding the market with hyperhype (is that a word?) to guarantee success.--Gerald Scarfe as designer. I would have loved to see Scarfe's original ideas implemented since he knows about mix of real and cartoon in his art. Too bad that many of his ideas fell victim to Disney's "cutesy" machine. It would be great seeing an animated version of this reminiscent to his art in 'Pink Floyd'.--James Woods. One of our best characters actors left, is it any wonder that Disney chose him? Dreamworks felt threatened by this talent so they grabbed as many "high name" starts as they could for their equally mythical 'Prince of Egypt'. Funny how Woods' readings here trump everything Katzenberg tried.Overall, you don't need to see this or any other Phase III Disney, but if you do, start with this.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules, sounds like it would make a great idea for an animated adventure, its got everything, from adventure for the guys, to a love story for the girls, to monsters and magical gods for children, and adults , so how is it that Disney messed this one up?I don't have the answer, and I've never ran into anybody that does, part of the problem may lie in that Disney decided to mix up the Hercules' story we remember from high school, and instead give us a family friendly version (but hey this is Disney what did you expect)? This new version almost works, but it's still not effective because rather then give us something new it mainly rips off aspects from the Superman films, as well as Empire strikes back.On the plus side, the animation is wonderful, and the voice talent is good. Tate Donovan is sub-par as Hercules, but Danny Devito and James Woods are excellent as Philoctetes and Hades, and Rip Torn is pretty funny as Zues.Now don't get me wrong, Hercules is not Disney's worst movie of all time, it just that with the studio's huge resurgence in the 1990's, with the likes of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, hunchback of Notre Dame etc... Hercules just doesn't measure up the their quality6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie for everything in it except for the countless mistakes and inconsistencies. Heracles (the Greek spelling; Hercules is Roman) is the son of Zeus and a mortal woman, Alcmene (said to be the foster mother), not Hera. Pegasus and Heracles are never near each other in every Greek myth. Heracles does date and eventually marry Megara. He also kills her, too. I've not seen it in a while, but I remember only four or five Titans. There were really between seven and twelve Titans. Cronus, the oldest of these Titans, is the father of Zeus, Hades, Poseidon, Hera, Hestin, and Demeter. Having only a few Titans that represent fire, wind, earth, and water (ice) is being entirely too inconsistent. Earth is the mother of the Sky and the Titans, anyway. More problems exist but I can't remember them off hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hercules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Greek legend has always been in popular culture, some call him Herecles, but he is commonly known as Hercules, strongest man ever to live (in fiction), so this Disney film brought him to life. Basically baby Hercules is born on Mount Olympus, and Hades: Lord of the Underworld (James Woods) has plans to take over, but can't with this new God in the works. So Hades' henchmen Pain (Police Academy's Bobcat Goldthwait) and Panic (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Matt Frewer) kidnap Hercules, and turn him mortal, apart from the last drop which means his God-like strength remains. Growing up, young Hercules (Josh Keaton) feels like an outcast unable to control his strength, so his foster father Amphitryon (Hal Holbrook) and mother Alcmene (Barbara Barrie) show him the symbol of the Gods they found on him. After going to the Temple of Zeus, and gaining the wings of horse Pegasus, his true father Zeus (Rip Torn) tells him to seek Philoctetes the satyr (Danny DeVito), the trainer of heroes. He trains him until grown up and Hercules (Tate Donovan) is ready to fight, and after he meets Meg (Susan Egan), and defeats the constantly head growing Hydra his dreams start coming true. Hercules has become the most famous person in Thebes, and Greece, from all his fights with Hades' monsters, but Zeus tells him he still hasn't proved himself a true hero. Hercules then gets his chance to spend time with Meg, and they are truly in love with each other, she even tells Hades, who owns her soul, that she won't help hurt him. Hades knows that Hercules' weakness is his love for Meg, so he blackmails him to give up his strength to let loose the feared Titans from their prison and take over Greece. But his powers come back when Meg is hurt, and he saves her soul from the Underworld, punches Hades into the sea of souls, and Hercules has proved himself worthy to be a God, but he decides he would rather stay on Earth with Meg. Also starring Samantha Eggar as Hera, Paul Shaffer as Hermes, Charlton Heston as the brief Narrator, Wayne Knight as Demetrius the Pot Maker. Woods is great as the sometimes sarcastic and cool acting villain, and DeVito is also great as the grouchy and easily annoyed trainer. The animation is as good as your going to get, the characters are all good, and the story is simple and fun, it is an easily enjoyable animated musical adventure. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for "Go The Distance". Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rest of the movie was passable but the music made my wife and I both shudder because it was so awful.If you're looking for a movie you can watch with your kids, look elsewhere.Since I need 10 lines of text I'll go on to point out that: * Danny DeVito should NEVER be allowed to sing again * the lyrics are just plain pathetic and generic * James Woods is the only likable character and he's the antagonist * my son didn't even like itBasically, any sane adult will want to pull their hair out if they're forced to watch this all the way through.I am having trouble washing the stink of that movie off of me, it was that bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretty irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Hercules, Disney accomplished a new goal: to get the enjoyable moments of a movie down to just a few seconds. Apparently the minute or two of pleasure to be found in the duds Pochahontas, Hunchback and Tarzan was far too generous. Every moment here cheapens the previous one. This team just can't wait to show you their next un-original idea. (columns falling like dominoes, anyone?) This one has it all: obnoxious, post-Aladdin characters who appropriate a celebrity's entire persona (a la Robin-Williams: James Woods, Paul Schneider, Danny Devito, Bob Goldthwaite) instead of developing a character; this is lazy and irritating in the extreme. I can't tell you who did the voices in The Little Mermaid, because that movie had it's priorities straight. You also get crappy post-Elton John schmaltz like 'Go the Distance,' penned for those who enjoy easy listening a.m. radio, or maybe (I imagine) for figure skaters to have something schlocky to skate to. And a mediocre end-credits performance from some bad singer who apparently needed the exposure. I have no idea why Meg is interested in Hercules. He's very annoying. Other characters note how irritating he is, and he is... an earnest jackass who keeps screwing things up isn't much to look at. There is one terrific way to not be irritating, and that's to take the hint... and calm the hell down. This idea never occurs to Hercules (or his creators). The song "I Won't Say I'm in Love" constitutes the films only non-irritating, pleasant moment. The movie is also the lame stab at a new aesthetic that Disney attempts every 5 movies. It just looks kind of flat and cheap. It's obsessed with spirals, notably in the depiction of nipples. So when the spiral appears obsessively all over the same character, they basically have nipple-ears, nipple-elbows, nipple-chins and nipple-pins fastening their tunics. It's weird. This movie reflects the continued lack of thought that would naturally follow the previous six or seven formulaic Disney flicks that people gave easy raves. So go ahead, and drink the Disney Kool-Aid. This time it's crap flavored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all depends on your perspective,...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether or not you like this movie really depends on your perspective. For the casual viewer, it's an entertaining film, though few would place it among Disney's best. For obsessive history teachers like myself, the film is so problematic that enjoying the film is next to impossible, as the film bears very little similarity to the Hercules myths. In fact, when the film debuted, I remember hearing about protests in Greece because many felt that Disney's "fast and loose" attitude towards the source material was cultural offensive. I can understand and appreciate this, though frankly, sometimes I wish I weren't as well-versed with history and could just turn off my brain and enjoy the film from a completely mindless perspective. Sorry, but if historical accuracy means anything stay away,...but at least the films are better than the Steve Reeves films or the god-awful Trans-lux cartoons of the 1960s!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Herules" Is Okay, But Would Have Been Better Had Disney Stuck To the Legend Closer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a well-known cast including Danny DeVito, Bob(cat) Goldthwaite and James Woods, "Hercules" could have been a big hit like "Aladdin" or "Beauty and the Beast".  Unfortunately, because Disney took more than a few "creative liberties" along the way, "Hercules" is another forgettable Disney film that doesn't reach brilliance.  Disney's "Hercules" gets 3/5 stars. A decent film. Nothing great. If you want to see a good Hercules flick, see "Hercules in New York" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, a.k.a. Arnold Strong. It's one of the best "cheap" films ever. Don't expect an epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the only Disney animated feature I HATE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, IMHO, is AWFUL! I have been a huge Disney animation fan. I'm a huge Jazz and R&amp;B fan (and in fact, love all music styles). I generally like how Disney tells a story. This fails in all 3 counts. The music is either dull or totally annoying. The Animation is what I can best describe as "experimental New wave", and is visually annoying (Pokemon has better animation). Lastly, the story is totally destroyed. Not one real toe-tapper you could walk away from the movie singing.I have been converting all of my Disney animated videos to DVD as they have come out. All videos, but one, and I'm thinking of dumping it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Disney movie FOR KIDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The music was great and. of course, the animation superb. I do not look to Disney to teach my child morals or any life lessons (Mom's on the job) but I do expect fun entertainment. This was my daughter's first movie to see on the big screen. It taught me to go see Disney films first by myself. I was very disappointed with the sophistication of the Hydra scene. Did we really need the green goo spewing everywhere? This had my child covering her eyes and wanting to go home. You can certainly believe that this did not transfer to my burning up the wallet on Hercules merchandise. Many adults LIKED the movie but the Disney machine needs to be mindful that pleasing the KIDS is where the money is. I'm off to see Tarzan.</fullReview>
