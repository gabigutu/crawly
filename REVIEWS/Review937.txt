		<shortDescription>Such a sad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God, what a terrible movie. I know that I shouldn't have high standards when it comes to rom-coms, and trust me mine are super low, but this one hits rock bottom. It is so condescending and sexist that I had a real hard time watching it to the end (I've watched it with a couple of friends so that made me stay). I can actually enjoy trashy films that are so terrible that they are awesome, but this one actually tries to make a point and it fails miserably. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, even New York can't help it (and that says a lot). If you are looking for a rom-com, do yourself a favor and skip this one. And then send me a "Thank you" note for those 90 minutes of your life that would gone to waste (plus millions of brain cells you would lose in the process).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest, I was dragged to this movie by a girl friend. I was tired of the rom com genre. I had seen it all before. Ill say this, this movie strips away all those clichés and goes in the opposite direction. What a lovely and funny R rated comedy with a lot of heart. There are so many charming moments that I cannot even explain them all. Rebel Wilson does her usual thing but here she perfects it and brings a certain edge to her performance. Its my favorite performance of hers. Dakota Johnson gives the best performance of her young career and Leslie Mann owns her roll. Its her funniest, saddest, and truest performance to date. Yes Im still talking about a raunchy comedy here. There is more to this movie than you might think. The men in the film are actually better written that most clichéd men in romantic comedies. Finally, the ending is just perfect for those single people out there.I advise seeing this with a friend and not with a significant other. **** out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not impressed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am finding that the more movies I watch with Dakota Johnson just leads to disappointment. Is it just me or is there no emotion in her face when she acts. The movie trailer gets the audience pumped up for a romantic comedy. Super pumped and thought this is going to be hilarious. There were funny parts, but it left me disappointed and frustrated in the end. For example the love Tom has for Lucy. If a guy truly felt like he did(cant get her off his mind). It wouldn't take him 3 months to try and talk to her). Lucy felt something as well for Tom, even for a moment when they kissed. Now a girl that is obsessed with finding a guy wouldn't have just dropped it. It would be running in her head repeatedly, whether creating something that wasn't there or convincing herself it was nothing. Something positive about this movie is it did show all different aspects of relationships and how people feel. as well as majority of women jump to soon and forget their wants/needs just to please a man.( hence the saying you have changed). Men do it too we pretend to be someone we are not to please someone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid at all costs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's risky to title a movie like a self-help book, because the audience may actually expect to learn something by watching the story unfold. The bad news is, if you're seriously looking for a guide on how to be a single lady, you'd gain more by listening to Beyonce. 'How to be Single' centres around Alice, played by Dakota Johnson ('Fifty Shades of Grey'), and her transition into post-breakup life in New York City. Once she arrives at her new job she becomes fast friends with Rebel Wilson ('Pitch Perfect'), a guru on the single way of life. This involves a lot of partying, drinking, and waking up in random people's bedrooms, all to a soundtrack of Izzy Azalea and Taylor Swift. You get the picture. Romcom staple Leslie Mann plays Alice's older and supposedly wiser sister. This character goes from hating children to booking herself a sperm-donor online, in the space of about a week. Another subplot, which has very little to do with the main story, involves Alison Brie ('Community') who is also looking for love in the Big Apple. Instead of the partying/one-night-stand formula, she devises an online dating algorithm to find the perfect man, with some pretty bad results.The central message of the plot is confusing, and changes throughout the film. The protagonists develop relationships with around fifteen men between them, which becomes quite hard to keep track of, and also leaves us wondering whether any of the women are ever truly single for more than a day at a time. The trailer for this movie does a good job of making it look like a decent enough comedy. Rebel Wilson has to be given credit for some of her one-liners and stunts, but the big problem is that the few jokes from the advert are by far the best in the whole script. The rest of the time, there's a truckload of weak, over sexualised jokes that just don't serve their purpose. In other words, if the trailer doesn't make you laugh, the full 2 hour feature may just make you cry. If you do end up seeing this, a good way to make yourself laugh is to imagine you're watching one of those 'bad lip reading' videos. The dialogue in many of the scenes is quite literally on that same level of obscurity.At this time of year, cinemas are chock-full of Oscar nominated films that work hard to deliver you quality entertainment. Amongst them, this sticks out like a sore thumb. I did my best to enjoy this movie, because it does try to be funny. But like your uncle who tries to stay hip and relevant by using Facebook, the results are cringeworthy and frankly, a little bit creepy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How to Be Single" should have "not" in the title somewhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many unattached adults find being alone difficult ? especially on Valentine's Day, so I guess it makes sense that there would be a movie called "How to Be Single" (R, 1:50) in theaters starting the second weekend in February. What doesn't make as much sense is using such a title for a movie that is more likely to make many singles feel even worse about not being in a romantic relationship on said holiday.Dakota Johnson, Alison Brie, Rebel Wilson and Leslie Mann play four women navigating singlehood in New York City. In spite of what the movie poster implies, they are not a group of party-animal gal-pals who are all on this journey together, but there are connections here. Mann plays Meg, an obstetrician who doesn't need a man or a baby to feel fulfilled (thank you very much). Meg is the older sister of recent college graduate Alice (Johnson) who becomes best friends with new co-worker, confirmed bachelorette and hearty partier Robin (Wilson). Lucy (Brie) is a control freak with high standards who plugs data from dating websites into algorithms and spreadsheets in the hopes of finding the perfect man. Through Alice, Meg and Robin kind of become friends-in-law, while Alice and Lucy both end up involved with the same guy at different points, but that's the extent of these characters crossing paths.These four women all view being single differently and learn different lessons along the way. Alice breaks up with college boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun) because she feels she needs to experience being single for a while. When she is hired by the same law firm where Robin works, Robin takes Alice to a bar and tries to school her in how to be single. Alice hooks up with handsome bartender Tom (Anders Holm), which actually makes her miss her relationship with Josh, even as she keeps bumping into real estate developer David (Damon Wayans Jr.). As independent as she is, Meg starts thinking that she might want a baby, but not necessarily a man, although sweet younger man Ken (Jake Lacy) seems interested in changing her mind about that last part. Meanwhile, Alice becomes friends with Tom (since she lives above his bar and has most of her first dates in that bar). Her data analysis leads her to the handsome Paul (Colin Jost), but she also attracts the attention of funny bookstore owner George (Jason Mantzoukas). Robin doesn't want to meet Mr. Right, but just to drink, dance and be with Mr. Right Now.Part of the problem with "How to Be Single" is those characterizations. Instead of following these women as a group, screenwriters Abby Kohn, Mark Silverstein and Dana Fox (adapting Liz Tuccillo's 2008 novel of the same name) jump back and forth between loosely connected stories. This muddles the movie's message and makes the plot a little hard to follow. The script manages a few laughs (mostly crude sex and toilet humor) sprinkled throughout the movie and almost overshadowed by the large number of un-funny and uncomfortably awkward moments. In spite of director Christian Ditter's attempts at character development, the characters still feel shallow. Then, the resolutions of some of these stories send mixed messages which seem more likely to upset than comfort unhappy singles.But before I render my verdict, here are a few fun facts: (1) This movie is based on Tucillo's first novel, but her earlier 2004 book, "He's Just Not That Into You" (co-written with Greg Behrendt) won a Quill Award, was a New York Times best seller was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show and was adapted into a film of the same name in 2009, a movie with a better cast, better script and better director than this one and with moderately more entertainment value. (2) Johnson's character gets involved with the character played by Wayans', whose uncle, Marlon Wayans, co-wrote and starred in 2016's "Fifty Shades of Black", which was a parody of Johnson's 2015 blockbuster "Fifty Shades of Grey". (3) In the theater where I watched "How to Be Single" (on Valentine's Day), I saw no one sitting alone. The audience was mainly groups of women (which seemed to enjoy the movie a little more than I did) and couples (which vocalized somewhat less approval). (4) This film's original title was "How NOT To Be Single". Okay, that last one isn't a fact, but it does fit this rarely funny and forgettable movie, with its mish-mash of confused, self-centered characters and convoluted messages. "C-"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't seen worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had loads of talent to tap into and the writers flopped big time. The director had about zero vision during the whole run time. I'm surprised the producers still have jobs. Heck, I'm surprised anyone has a job after this movie. If a normal commonplace job had this much of a screw up at a $38 Million dollar budget, they would be sued and living on a street corner.I will say, I'm a man, and this is clearly not for men. It's for women strictly, even the previews were geared towards women. So, that being said, I was brought along with my fiancé to watch this dreadful film.Normally, I can limp along and see the silver lining or notice the jokes as they are meant to be portrayed. However, they couldn't even nail a single joke with me or with any of the other 7 people in the theater. I saw one guy get up and leave, I told my fiancé he had the right idea.As the title says, I haven't seen worse, this is by far the worst movie on record for me. Please, do yourself a favor, take the overpriced movie ticket money, walk outside and literally give it to ANYONE. It will find a better use of its own purpose AND yours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is there a point to this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's got no plot. It's got no point. It has absolutely no clue how to be funny.Nothing in this mule has a reason to exist.There isn't a single cliché they used that made any sort of sense. The plot is just confusing and pathetic. Did anyone who reviewed this actually NOT be paid to write a good review.Most of the scenario is in Manhattan so of course, it's unrealistic with massively large apartments and set in the Meatpacking district. Utterly and totally stupid. Nothing in this movie made sense. Not by any sense of the word. Anyone who says they like it is obviously from Kansas and has no clue what relationships are like. This is for the Sex and the City crowd. Stay away. Stay far away from this dog.Er, sorry, POS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mixed cast out of established actors and "Newcomers" aka. "Isn't that the guy from (insert show-name here)" loosens up the mood and gives the general idea that the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Creative details like glowing numbers on bottles and texts in the air also contribute to this.Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud-moments. Which is always a plus!Rebel Wilson is hilarious. Everybody has to agree at least on that.Surprisingly not the most stereotypical cheesy wannabe perfect life- ending. A deeper meaning in said ending compliments the movie as a whole, without coming over as forced.Of course movies like that always sort of have this fakeness about them. I mean, everybody knows that you could never be able to afford this huge apartment in NYC nor experience a love story like that. But you don't watch these films to get realistic life-reviews. You want to simply look at pretty people partying, doubting existence and having sex. In a not weird way of course. "How to be single" will provide you with all three, without making you gag over the silly tackiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie had potential but fails to deliver. I rate the movie low for two reasons: 1). Movie tried to focus on too many relationships and did a terrible job of developing any of them. The relationships between the various characters is fragmented. The movie would have been better served focusing on fewer relationships and letting us see growth between the characters. 2). Movie is also being pushed to make one think it is a comedy, however in my opinion the majority of the funny parts are shown in the advertisements. I went to the movie looking for a comedy with the characters facing various comedic situations. Had the movie been pushed as one with a more serious view on relationships it us possible that I may gave enjoyed it more. I cannot recommend seeing this movie in the theater. Wait for the DVD or for it to come out on HBO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No spoilers. I just walked out on this one after THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES, and that's saying a lot.I went expecting a good love story, and all I got was a filthy, sordid sex tale.The blonde woman Alice met was played by someone who apparently never took acting lessons.Don't get me wrong. I'm used to looking at beefcakes, but this film went too far with that.And to think I thought it might be good from the trailer. This isn't the first time I've been fooled by a trailer.In other words, save your bucks, or if you feel you just have to see it, wait for the DVD or On Demand.I give this movie the lowest rating ever. It just isn't worth it, believe me.That is, unless you want to be disappointed by mediocre performances. This movie is full of them.There. I think I've said enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful and boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to make you feel good and absolutely okay with being single while it turns out to be a movie about relationships and their importance. I expected a lot more from the story of each character and all I got was a super-mixed mess of complicated relationships with many people, awkward sex and one night stands. Dakota Johnson's character is so cringe-worthy I can't even. When I think about it, every each one of them is cringe-worthy. Dakota's sister in the movie refers to babies as 'love seeking terrorists'??? yet she desperately wants one, then meets a guy then hides the pregnancy (how can you hide being pregnant from someone you are dating by the way)...AWFUL. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Be Free of Seeing This Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to Be Single (2016): Dir: Christian Ditter / Cast: Dakota Johnson, Leslie Mann, Rebel Wilson, Alison Brie, Nicholas Braun: Disjointed romantic comedy about facing everyday life as a oneself challenge. Dakota Johnson plays Alice, who lands a new job after a separation from her boyfriend. Rebel Wilson plays Robin, Alice's co- worker who is constantly clubbing and partying. Leslie Mann plays Meg, Alice's sister, a nurse who desires to have a baby but is also single. Alice currently stays with her. Alison Brie plays Lucy who is buried in her laptop at a bar where the bartender makes obvious moves on her while trying to maintain a womanizing sense of reputation. Chief problem with this film is that only Johnson's Alice is truly engaged in a story. She attempts to rekindle the relationship that she left only to be met with the news that he is engaged to another woman. The other three actresses are involved in subplots that could easily be stripped away without notice. Mann is appealing as Meg who is pregnant through sperm donor. She becomes the object of desire for a younger man but this could easily be an afterthought. Wilson as Robin is clearly an overly loud comic relief token written more as a convenience for Alice. Brie as Lucy doesn't seem to be involved with the other three girls at all, and her reading session with a group of children was hardly funny. These subplots are disjointed and required a writer more confident than what was issued. Otherwise the film is fetching in its locations with a theme that examines the struggles singles face such as the possibility of watching this film. Score: 4 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, someone would expect a nice, more down to earth, version of Sex and the City. No. This movie sucked in so many ways. No true laughs there, no epiphany. I wasn't expecting this movie to learn about love or anything like that, but this wasn't even decently written. I mean, come on! What's up with all you scriptwriters there in Hollywood? Filled with situations that are simply not true and that cannot apply for anyone, this movie has no real beginning or end. You get the journey of this lost girl that looks to find the life she hasn't had so far. So far so good. Then she gets into an amazing mess that no real person can get into. And then she just goes around having sex with people to try and re-discover herself! Whoa! There wasn't even one thing, one situation or a character that I liked in this movie, or that I thought could be actually a real person. Too far-fetched, probably to get the humour working for them, which didn't happen as well. Lousy cast, lousy performances. Don't you even bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall rating 5/10. I went into this movie with too much expectations. I thought it would be one of those comedies where you get to see something different that you can really laugh about. This was not like that. It was not about how to be single. the majority of the movie dealt with the typical issues we all have seen before in other romantic comedies ie. relationship issues, going to the club and meeting someone, your party girl in the mix, someone finding happiness and then the main character "deciding" to be alone because the relationships she was in did not work out. Throughout the movie you get a few things to chuckle about and then it's done. It was too predictable and seemed a lazy attempt. Marketing and glitters!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How NOT To Be Single</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to Be Single is about a group of people who are trying to deal with relationships in their own way. That's the most simplest way I can explain the plot and this movie just evolves into so much more? drama. First off, the best thing I can say about this movie is the performances from Dakota Johnson and Leslie Mann. Johnson plays a girl in her 20s trying to get over a relationship with her college boyfriend while Leslie Mann plays a doctor who is not sure if she wants to be a relationship ever. Both of them do the best with what they have and they are probably the most enjoyable part of this movie. Also, there were 1 or 2 parts where I was laughing, but that doesn't save the movie from the bad things. First off, the writing is bad. It puts every character in a stereotype that doesn't make them interesting. Also, most of the humor was awkward or just not funny at all. Rebel Wilson surprisingly wasn't that funny. I've seen her in Pitch Perfect and I thought she was hilarious in that movie but in this, she's not that funny at all. Also, you can clearly tell that characters are so unrealistic and there is no way that any of these characters would do the things they do. Another thing that made me mad was the themes of this movie. From reading the title, you would think that it would be about how to get over a relationship and move on. In reality, this movie should've been called How NOT to Be Single because because the movie switches from "It sucks to be single and you need to be in a relationship" to "It's okay to be single" and then it just goes back and forth from there. Overall, this movie was saved just barely from the performances. I give this a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to Be SingleThe easiest way for a person to stay single is to stop bathing.However, the singles in this rom-com are more concerned with attracting than repelling.To gain worldliness, Alice (Dakota Johnson) dumps her boyfriend, moves to NYC, lives with her sister (Leslie Mann), and works at a law firm where her co-worker (Rebel Wilson) introduces her into the singles scene. Elsewhere, Lucy (Alison Brie) is knee-deep in online-dating horror stories.But overtime each finds a potential partner (Damon Wayans Jr., Anders Holm, Jake Lacy, Jason Mantzoukas) and must choose their ultimate path.The painfully familiar story of four single females navigating singledom in the city, HTBS is neither insightful nor plausible. The women are weepy, the men are unrealistic, and the script is disjointed and laden with unladylike language and behaviour.Besides, if being single is so much fun then why can't we torch all of the wedding gowns?

		<shortDescription>Problematic in its themes and thoroughly misguided with its casual depictions of treating people unfairly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "How to Be Single," yet another comedy released this year hoping that its mediocrity will be forgotten by the time the halfway point of the year comes around, I began to feel a certain pessimistic sadness wash over me. This is presumably a film to showcase the daily events of many single people in heavily metropolitan areas with few cares and big plans every single weekend. Of course, one must reserve some incredulous circumstances that occur in the film as being part of the theatrical spice, but fundamentally, we can hopefully agree that this film looks to profile the kind of debauchery young, single people hope for on their Friday and Saturday nights while they're not confined to one person.In "How to Be Single," nobody talks to one another, nobody genuinely cares about the emotional well-being of one another, and nobody seems to hold kind of pride or self-respect for one another, male or female. This is an observation on my part and not a testament that the characters of the film should live according to my personal standards. I've never been one for telling people how to live their lives, for I'd be damned if they told me how to live mine. Having said that, however, there is not a shred of honesty or decency on part of these characters; there's just an engagement in mindless actions, empty sex, and a desire for a lifestyle of free drinks and early headaches. If there were ever a film to show just why young people's relationships suffer and why commitment is so difficult to find, it's "How to Be Single." After that lofty opening, you're probably expecting an intensely negative review on my part. You'd be wrong, for I didn't hate "How to Be Single; in fact, I found myself laughing quite frequently and holding great admiration for its talented cast of performers, all of whom have high energy and fearless comedic presences. But even before the lights came back on, I felt uneasy after most laughs and each scene that involved characters practically throwing themselves at one another for sex, one male character explaining his methods to have the perfect one-night stand, and the umpteenth sex story Rebel Wilson's character explains in elaborate detail, I began to wince and quietly keep to myself. It's almost to the point where you can place the death of commitment and honesty between people when sex or a potential relationship is involved alongside the death of chivalry.The film revolves around Alice ("Fifty Shades of Grey"'s Dakota Johnson), a young woman who is dumped by her boyfriend before moving to New York City to work in a law firm. She moves in with Meg (Leslie Mann), her single, workaholic sister who is considering having a kid as a single mother via a sperm donor, in addition to befriending her bawdy co-worker Robin (Rebel Wilson), who holds her countless one-night stands as a badge of honor. During her time in New York City, Alice meets Tom (Anders Holm), an attractive bartender who has rigged his apartment to basically beg a woman to leave after sleeping with him, despite his crush on Lucy (Alison Brie), a bar-regular who spends her time wasting away on dating sites.As stated, "How to Be Single" features a slew of commendable, high-energy performances by actors who will go on to be tomorrow's regular comedy headliners. Dakota Johnson shows her talents in a lead role that allows for more freedom outside of confining dialog and flat emotions, Leslie Mann continues to prove herself as one of the funniest and most likable actresses in comedy, Alison Brie, despite having fairly brief scenes, manages to make the most out of them with her sarcasm and dry wit, and Wilson creates a fun, if standard, physical role for her character thanks to her fearless on-screen presence.This is one of those films where I seriously hope the actors got paid more than the writers because they almost effectively undermine the shortcomings and noticeable imperfections of the screenplay every chance they get. Sadly, the trio of writers, Dana Fox, Abby Kohn, and Marc Silverstein, nearly spoil the pot here by throwing too many ingredients in without adequate preparation. Many of the plot-strands in this film aren't well developed, and much like hookup culture itself, real relationships are stunted and have an inability to develop when there's simultaneously too much and too little going on. One doesn't really notice this until the film ends and they're walking out of the theater, to their car, or to the bathroom and reflecting on how desperately little in this film gets solved as a result of the film's scattershot tendencies.This sort of disorganized narrative may have been more forgivable if the film had something groundbreaking, or at least meaningful, to say about being single, but it makes the same inexcusable thematic misstep as last year's "Paper Towns" with its end monologue. It basically states that going out and having carnal sex, mistreating others, and playing with people's emotions is okay so long is it's in the pursuit of self-discovery, which is unforgivable, unacceptable, and absolutely ludicrous. A film with this kind of theme is harmful, but thankfully it doesn't pander it to the extent of "Paper Towns." While "How to Be Single" is frequently entertaining and sporadically funny, it's also thematically problematic and, all-around, misguided with its casual depictions of treating people unfairly and justifying the character's poor behavior as a path to finding themselves. The commendable cast do all that they can to save this film, but the flaws are too weight to save a spiraling plane from heading anywhere but downwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible, just horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a social commentary perspective, I can't help but feel like this movie is trying to convince women who are single and hating it... that their feelings are wrong and they should instead be happy! And according to the directors and writers, that means becoming someone like Rebel Wilson's character, Robin.I don't know of any 20-something (who isn't lying to herself, or hiding her tears behind the extra shots of vodka) that actually enjoys sleeping with random men every night. What a sad, horrible, and self-degrading way to live.(*)And this view seems to be backed up by the other characters as well. Meg (Leslie Mann) views being a mother as comparable to being a "slave to some tiny little love-terrorist". Wow. How could ANYONE want to be a mother when that's what the thought conjures up in your mind???? I'm only 24, and I can't wait to have kids, I can't think of anything more rewarding.I don't know, this film makes me feel sorry for my generation. It's so disheartening to see the basic fabrics of society (long term committed relationships and motherhood, mainly) being ripped to shreds just so Big Corporations can convince us to fill the void with more nights out with random strangers, spending money we don't have because most of us graduated college saddled with thousands of dollars worth of debt.It's just sad. I only made it through about 20 minutes of the film.(*)And I'm not trying to shame women who sleep around, I'm just saying I don't know any woman who actually enjoys this kind of lifestyle for more than a year, tops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so the first 5 minutes did it for me; all the clichés about men, women and dating you can possibly imagine crammed into the movie right form the start. It is all just so tiresome, the characters are so incredibly stereotypical and uninteresting and everything is just so utterly.. meh. During the first 5 minutes I was utterly annoyed with every single character in the movie. Did not like a single one of them at all.I got a few giggles out of it though, mainly thanks to Jake Lacy's character.The 1/10 comes from the few (and far between) funny lines and the ending, which I actually did not guess :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Single cringe-worthy women who are trying not to be single</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a woman myself, I find this movie to be... eh and actually cringe worthy. So, the movie starts off with the basically the main character Alice breaking up with her four year boyfriend cause she wanted to see what it was like being single (the hell, really? What a moron are you for leaving a boyfriend who wanted to stay with you and then come back thinking you guys can get together after sleeping with someone). Then most of the time of the movie she or the other women are trying to get guys (or really sleep with them) and not really being single at all. It's a very typical drama New York movie that we see almost every other chick flick movie. Nothing new. Nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I went to the cinema to watch a random movie. There were not much options, and she has already heard about this movie (how to be single), and so she suggested to watch it. if you think it was about love, it is not. If you think it is about sex, it is not. If you think it is comedy, it is not (except for that crazy fat lady, she is funny though).The most thing I love in my life is watching movies, especially in the cinema, I am fine spending 3 days in a row, 24 hours watching movies. but this movie... I was trying hard to laugh, it is not funny at all. it is romantic nor drama.I would have this movie as my last option on a boring day that I have nothing to do</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I needed this movie, as stupid as that sounds. I've been in relationship after relationship since I was 15- including a failed marriage- and at 27 years old and recently dumped, I have no idea how to be single. No, this movie didn't teach me exactly how to be single, only that I need to be. I never, ever, thought I'd realize that from a movie, especially one I rented on a whim. A few laugh out loud moments, and a few tear-jerkers were a bonus. Rebel Wilson was the comic relief, obviously, but I really connected with Dakota's character, regardless of what anyone says about her acting 'skills'. It taught me an important lesson, and that's worth the 10/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'HOW TO BE SINGLE': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new romcom directed by Christian Ditter (who also helmed the romantic comedies 'LOVE, ROSIE' and 'FRENCH FOR BEGINNERS'), and it was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (who previously co- wrote 'NEVER BEEN KISSED', 'HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU', 'VALENTINE'S DAY' and 'THE VOW'), as well as Dana Fox (who also co- wrote 'THE WEDDING DATE', 'WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS' and 'COUPLES RETREAT'). It's based on the book by Liz Tuccillo (who also wrote the book 'HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU'). The film tells the story of multiple different single people, trying to navigate single life, and relationships, in New York City. It stars Dakota Johnson (of 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY' fame), Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann, Alison Brie, Anders Holm, Nicholas Braun, Jake Lacy, Damon Wayans Jr. and Jason Mantzoukas. It got mediocre reviews from critics, but it was a decent hit at the Box Office (like almost all the other previously mentioned romcoms). I think it's slightly better than all the other previously mentioned romcoms (out of the ones that I've seen).The story revolves around Alice (Johnson); a college student who temporarily dumps her boyfriend, Josh (Braun), so she can try the single life. She then moves to New York City, and becomes a paralegal. There she befriends her coworker Robin (Wilson), who loves one-night stands and drinking excessively. She also moves in with her workaholic sister, Meg (Mann), who really wants a child, but fears relationships. Alice sleeps around a bit, and then decides to get back together with her ex; who's already moved on. She's then forced to remain single, and fight it out like all of her new single friends (and sister).The movie is actually funny, and even emotional (in places). The characters are mostly likable, the performances are decent, and the film is mildly entertaining (at times). It's also irrational though (at other moments), and it's randomly filled with bad clichés; the ending is especially cheesy, and it makes no sense. I definitely enjoyed parts of it though, and I can't say that it's a bad movie.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

An attempt at a comedy that totally misses the mark... I'm not sure if I really laughed much at all. It's a disappointment.

		<fullReview>"How to Be SIngle" isn't really a rom-com. I mean I guess it technically is, but there aren't established 'mates' in this movie. And that's part of what I really enjoyed about it. It carves it's own path with the characters, and we don't really know who's going to end up with who until very late in the film. That aspect adds a little bit of realism. The film doesn't follow a cookie-cutter template for this type of thing, and the ending doesn't fit the bill either.The comedy is crude, but not overly crude like the Vacation remake, or some other junk that's out there, and I smiled through much of this film.Dakota, Rebel, and Leslie are a nice little trio. Rebel fits into her role here a lot better than she has in previous films. Dakota's character is a bit subdued, but it kinda fits as well. Leslie's character-arc adds a nice subplot.The film is entertaining, mostly enjoyable, and actually has some style here and there with the music and cinematography, which is usually void in this genre. Seriously, there's some nice lighting, some good panning, and many wow moments for a film like this. Especially late.I'm a bit dumbfounded by all the negative reviews. Perhaps coming from those expecting a straight comedy, or a straight cookie-cutter rom-com, some that didn't watch much of it, and some who didn't like the realistic and harsh nature of some of the relationship plots.HTBS is worth your time. I actually rented this for the wife and had no intentions of watching it.The multiple story lines/character-arcs share airtime nicely. Leslie Mann and her younger boyfriend are a blast, and Anders Holm's 'womanizer' is also handled nicely. You'll wanna see how this turns out. I have the feeling some of the negative reviews didn't get that far. Recommended. 69/100 I've seen enough bad rom-com's to know that this isn't one of them. I think the 1 and 2/10 reviews on the first couple of pages are totally off-base. Good fun. Watch it, come back and let me know you approve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the trailer for this movie and didn't have huge expectations but went into the movie expecting a decent movie with some funny moments but I was wrong. How to be single is one of the most boring and meaningless movies I've watched in my life. This movie is a total waste of time, it doesn't even have one moment when you can say "at least this was good". Dakota Johnson gives another lifeless performance and Rebel Wilson proves that she is a one trick pony, using the same antics that once where funny but now are more of the same. There is not even one character who stands out in this movie. My advice is don't even watch it for free on TV, you are going to waste precious time of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a total chick flick, so women will probably enjoy it, men maybe not so much. The plot is totally lacking. The movie basically consists of women getting into and out of relationships for about 90 minutes, that's about it. Throw in a few funny moments and that's the movie. It could have been filled out a little better, but if you're into relationship movies you'll probably enjoy it. Of course the acting, camera work, editing, &amp; production is good, it's just the writing which suffers a bit. It just needed a little something else to make this movie good. Still, it's probably a good date movie, but not one which I'm likely to seek out to watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Be Messy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching this movie, because I have a soft spot for silly romantic comedies that sometimes happen to be good, I kept wondering why the whole movie had to be so crowded. If the movie had just focused more specifically on one or two story lines. It was all over the place, I didn't feel for the characters because I didn't get to know them enough. It could have been quite the good movie but whenever you get a piece of information about a character the story quickly jumps to the other. I didn't feel Dakota Johnson's performance here, it wasn't awful but she's not exactly great in the role. I feel like Rebel Wilson, even if she always plays the same type of character with funny one-liners here and there, did light up the movie. And I was particularly touched by one of the story lines, but it didn't get developed enough. Everyone gave good performances, nothing out the extraordinary. But I quite liked the ending. For a messy movie who didn't quite know who to focus on or what it was trying to be, it wrapped up nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questionable values with shallow characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't worth watching. It adds itself to the pile of nonsense comedies that teach a 'right' way to do something, which to me, is clearly not the right way. While the film has some funny moments, mostly coming from Wilson, but even then her character is predictable and too much. I quite liked the acting and chemistry between Johnson and Mann, they acted well as sisters. I initially liked Johnson's character as well, but after awhile, she just became another shallow character. The other characters on screen aren't as vulgar as Wilson is (though that is her brand), and the writers are sure to add vulnerabilities in all of them, but they aren't well developed. Characters come and go, without any strong relationships being established, creating a superficial world. I am adamantly against the idea that being single means having to sleep with every guy/girl someone meets. That is definitely not the 'right' way. What are movies like these teaching the younger generation? Not only is it a difference of opinion, it's a difference between cultures, and having more of these shows coming from Hollywood, enhances the stereotypes of Americans. Plus, it gives pressure to those who do not act like that, but believe that they should be (when all their friends do). A pretty ridiculous movie, that I was wanting to get over with. I do not like to stop movies halfway unless I really can't stand it, so had to endure this. The flawed but yearning characters need more depth.One thing that may have been an upside, was the pseudo-feminist narrative between Meg and Ken. It was great how the gender stereotypes got switched, but the eagerness of Ken, and reluctance of Meg makes me skeptical about the whole relationship. It's not that easy. Overall, not worth paying for or wasting time watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horribly long and very boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about 20-30 mins too long and it truly takes forever to end. The ending was very nice, but everything that led up to it was atrocious. Probably the most unnecessary element of the movie was the terrible side story of Alison Brie aka Lucy which totally distracted from the main story, didn't add anything very funny, and COMPLETELY bloated the run time. Another con...Too much Rebel Wilson. I love Rebel, but she does her best work with minimal screen time and she's just too much in this movie. Her humor is not clever in any way, it's just loud and in your face; another example of this poor script.The lead actress was good enough but the story around her was just not interesting so her talents go to waste. At one point in the movie, all the three guys that "love" her meet up in one spot but you realize that the love story lines were so poorly developed that they really have nothing to talk about; it's super awkward! One of the few pleasant surprises of this movie was Leslie Mann! I normally can't deal with her roles as I find them whiny and shrill but she is very charming and funny in this movie. Her boyfriend, Ken also ends up being the funniest thing about this movie.Overall just a bad movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Pass on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't watch this film if you're wanting a laugh.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film because I was in the mood for some light-hearted comedy. I am a fan of Sex and the City, and thought this would be similar with younger characters and some hilarious shenanigans with Rebel Wilson among the cast. I was sadly disappointed. Imagine a long episode of Sex and the City without the likable characters, amazing outfits or comedy moments. That was 'How to be Single'The story follows Alice (Dakota Johnson) as she takes a break from her long term boyfriend and moves to New York where she aims to experience the single life for a while with her new found wild friend Robin (Rebel Wilson). After a short while she decides she wants her boyfriend back, but he has moved on of course. From this point on the film is pretty pointless and goes nowhere. Dakota's acting was as lack-lustre as it was in 50 Shades of Grey. She has no charisma, no enthusiasm for her roles or energy in her performances. She is as dull as dish water as we say in the UK. Rebel Wilson was the only interesting and slightly funny character, but she didn't get enough screen time in my opinion. The male characters were forgettable and boring, you couldn't invest much interest in them because, again, they were only in a few scenes each.I think this film had the potential to be similar to The Hangover, Horrible Bosses and Bridesmaids, but there were no laughs to be had. None of the characters got into any funny situations, it was just plain boring.So overall I'd say, don't bother watching this film if you're looking for laughs. If you do want a laugh watch The Walk of Shame or any of the above titles instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The anti-romantic comedy had some funny moments thanks to the quirky humor of Rebel Wilson and a solid supporting cast. Marketed as the movie for lonely ladies to compete against the boy's superhero movie this weekend, the story is short on plot but packed full of awkward moments and punchlines.The movie revolves around four women and their attempts to date in New York city, a remarkably original idea. The travails of dating are shown with similarity but the message here is that a woman doesn't have to have a man to be happy. Dakota Johnson is the main character Alice who is taking a hiatus from her college boyfriend. Alice meets Robin played by Rebel Wilson who is the life of the party, and the film. Most of the humor comes from Rebel's one liners and her drunken behavior. Wilson should get credit for carrying this movie.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com</fullReview>

If your girlfriend tries to drag you to this movie, say no. Stand up for yourself. Any girl that is in a happy relationship should not want to go to a movie that says being single is better, because it's not. This is sick. What is this world turning into. It's just sick people that only care about sex. That's something special and people should not just go around flinging it at everyone. Thats not okay.

		<shortDescription>This movie may not be the guide to finding your soul mate or staying single</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you follow the life lessons from "How To Be Single" you could possibly pick up some sexually transmitted disease and most definitely will remain single for the rest of your natural born life. Essentially this is a chick flick and no male has any right to challenge it's view point, but I will. Why are males always represented as bastards? We are simple creatures with simple needs not like you complex females. We need good loving, good company and good food. End of story. For all of the the above we will remain loyal obedient creatures for life, a bit like your dog. Dakota Johnson, Rebel Wilson, Leslie Mann and Alison Brie form an unofficial lonely hearts club in New York City...just looking for Mr Right and often sleeping with Mr Wrong. The message from this movie is supposedly that we need to learn how to be single in a world filled with ever-evolving definitions of love...however the main characters never seem fulfilled until they have met their soul mate after bedding hundreds of potential candidates. How To Be Single is at times a funny movie mainly thanks to the Aussie one woman invasion force of Rebel. Some of you may find too many home truths in this film. If you like Sex and the City, but hated 50 Shades this may be for you. Did I mention there is a lot of sleeping around in the city that never sleeps as Starship once sang. In fact I doubt 24 hours goes past when any of these characters are not in some type of relationship. If you're really looking for a guide to the single life this ain't it, but it could be a fun date movie with no sport involved. Personal Highlight: the sauna scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to Be Single should be named How Not to Be Single. Not that it's material is bad, because it's very good indeed. However, it may give off the wrong impression to its younger audience. Dakota Johnson makes some very rash decisions, not knowing who she wants to be with, and where she wants to be. Her newest, closest chum Rebel Wilson hits life hard. Her opinion of a good night is ending up in a strangers house, having many sexual encounters and not remembering much of them. Leslie Mann is the older sister to Johnson, an independent woman with a younger love- interest rattling her cage. And then there's the weird Alison Brie, the egotistic Anders Holm, and the family man Marlon Wayans Jr. These are characters picked out fresh from the stereotype's pool. Gags are thrown in, coming mainly from the outrageous Wilson (no surprises there). Apart from its misleading title, manages to make us chuckle, if not smile. Most women (and men) out there will fall for the adorable baby that Mann has to briefly look after in a very early, very memorable scene. It will be hard to contain yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of the movie is very simple and straightforward. It's really amazing how it was still so all over the place. I was kinda duped by the 6+ rating it had here. :oThe story is around different people with different approaches to life and how they realize what they want (though I wonder if they really did). The challenge was that the characters were not painted well enough to let the viewers associate with them. they don't have that much connect but still it is amazing how they keep dishing out advice to each other. The characters do reach somewhere in their life journey, but not all that convincingly. There are some funny moments every now and then, but the story doesn't really keeps the viewer interested. The central theme of the movie is about the realization that one needs to love oneself before loving others, but much of the movie doesn't seem to be heading in that direction and all of a sudden all the characters are pushed towards that realization as the movie comes to an end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the lives of various singles in NY. Alice (Dakota Johnson) takes a break from college boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun) to find herself. She befriends new co-worker hard-partying Robin (Rebel Wilson). Her sister Meg (Leslie Mann) is an OBGYN who suddenly wants to have a baby. After sleeping with bar owner Tom (Anders Holm), Alice tries to return to Josh but he has found someone else. The deliberately-single Tom is taken with Lucy (Alison Brie) who is searching for marriage. Alice dates widower dad property developer David (Damon Wayans Jr.). Meg meets younger Ken (Jake Lacy) at Alice's office Christmas party.I actually expected four single gals in a raunchy 'Sex and the City' type comedy. That's not what this is although Rebel Wilson does her best to make it one. In fact, I don't remember Alison Brie having a conversation with the other three women. This is really about a bunch of connected singles. It has a bit of fun. The story wants to be substantive but it gets tied up. It's better than those Day-of-the-year movies by Garry Marshall but that's not saying much. It has moments of fun by these actors and the characters are likable enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How to Be Single" recycles the idea of the popular show "Sex and the City" but with less "sex" and less "city." Unfortunately, the film is not funny, and it struggles to try to develop a serious and hopelessly confused notion of what it means to be single.The cast is led by Dakota Johnson, who tries hard to make the far-fetched situations and scripted dialogue into a naturalistic performance. Her character named Alice has relationships with three men, and none of the encounters seemed believable. It was as if the filmmakers were caught somewhere between farce in the zany dialogue and romantic comedy that never sizzled.In a film like "How to Be Single," there should be some laughs and some poignant moments. There is a longstanding tradition in American film history of the successful genre of "screwball comedy." This film had pretensions in this area, but the result was dismal and gloomy situations, relationships, and dialogue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt a bit hoodwinked with this movie. From all the previews I saw, I thought it was going to be a comedy like The Hangover, but it was more of a drama with some funny parts. And unfortunately most of the funny parts were what I saw in the previews. It was still an enjoyable movie, just not what I was expecting.There were five main characters, only one who is actively trying to find love. The other four are either just having a good time, committed to work, or want to find themselves. Throughout the movie, all of the people, except the one who didn't want to find love, end up trying to find it, or actually getting into a relationship.Each character has their own story, and they touch with the other's stories, some more than others. I didn't find it confusing, but when you're expecting a comedic romp through love, and get a chick flick instead, it can be a bit bewildering. I did think the movie was done well, and enjoyed it. So if you're PMSing, and want to watch a chick flick, this one may be for you. Don't forget a carton of ice cream, but, for me at least, this one didn't require a box of Kleenex too.</fullReview>

How to be single is in fact debating how to party and have fun and look for easy aventuros relationship but still remain single. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ofxyXBAEw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ofxyXBAEw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ofxyXBAEw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ofxyXBAEw</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay honestly, I don't get what these sons of are talking about. This movie is unexpectedly great. ANYBODY who gave a low score probably judged this film for the first 20 minutes and stopped there.I loved Alice's story. How she was almost into different relationships (that last one where she almost hooked up with her first ex really made me thought they were gonna come back together) and in the end she didn't! I loved Robin's story where she just really liked Alice just to stick around with her and it was SUCH a twist when she told Alice that Alice only calls her when she needs her to whore around.There were so many incredible elements in this film that were written off by these critics as just companies perpetuating promiscuity among young people. Of course there'd be sex but that's not the point. Every character had good overall development and they had different personalities that showed throughout different scenes in the film.I had ZERO hopes for this film when I watched the trailer but after watching this I was impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the reviews above me, I almost didn't recognize the movie! I found it interesting, maybe not that big of a thing, but hell yeah i'd watch it again. I didn't like the fact that it was sexist and racist (only white people) but I don't regret watching it at all. A week ago, I became twenty, and that is definitely the sort movies you'd watch in your twenties. The main actress said something that made total sense and that I strongly related to that I had to re-tweet a quote of her. Some of the scenes weren't really something I enjoyed watching but the moral of the movie is really worth watching it for. At the end, there is this beautiful friendship moral. all in all, after watching this movie, you will realize that being single isn't something people should be ashamed of,it is not easy, but it is the best opportunity for us, women, to be more than just "women". I laughed, I owed some scenes and I was like : you kidding me -_- at some scenes, so I wish you all enjoy watching it, for i did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It isn't absolutely a bad romantic comedy movie. It's refreshing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How To Be Single is not a typical romantic comedy,but refreshing, entertaining one for what it's worth. I expected this movie for worse and actually got a lot of fun for sure. Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud-moments. I love the way they used of music and colorful set decoration. Anyway, I repeat it's not a typical romantic comedy but it's romantic and you can have a lot of fun without expecting too much.All in all, as I said, I overall enjoyed this film for what it was worth as a romantic comedy. It was refreshing and modern. The cast brought a great comedic energy in their own unique ways. I would recommend this movie as a great candidate for a nice date night out. Although even the story is something interesting to embrace. Overall I enjoyed 'How to Be Single'. As I said before, the plot is a very modern plot that many people have either been involved in or have been a witness to personally and all while everything happens, it is quite comical from beginning to end. Each actor and actress had a very entertaining and comedic role and all brought a creative energy to the film with each minute that passed. Dakota Johnson included. After seeing 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (yes, I know, I watched it, stop judging), I thought Dakota was unimpressive to say the least but in 'How to Be Single', she brings a very low-key comedic energy to the table and I found myself laughing at many of her quips and one- liners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Its Moments, But Nothing Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'How To Be Single' is at best, a passable Romantic-Comedy, that has some moments, that make you laugh. But its nothing great, as the narrative is inconsistent &amp; lethargic.'How To Be Single' Synopsis: Three women try to remain single, despite love &amp; lust around them.'How To Be Single' works prominently when Rebel Wilson is on-screen. The actress is pure live-wire. And sadly, she appears in a supporting role, that is short on length. Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein &amp; Dana Fox's Screenplay is average. And it would be great if there was more of Wilson. Christian Ditter's Direction is ordinary.Among other Performances, Dakota Johnson doesn't have the energy to handle an entire show on her own. Leslie Mann is comfortably side-lined, but does well in her bit. Alison Brie is just right. Damon Wayans, Jr. is restrained for a change. He's good here. On the whole, 'How To Be Single' is a so-so fare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film tries to be a Sex in the City style of film, but at least in Sex in the City the characters came across has interesting. But here only Dakota Johnson and Leslie Mann are the only ones here, you really get invested in. Yeah I'm surprised cause lately I was finding Leslie Mann unwatchable. But everybody else just don't really jump out at you, leave very little of an impression. Alison Brie serves very little purpose in the film, and so does Damon Wayans Jr, to the point where if they both where written out of the film, it would not change a thing.The main problem here is Rebel Wilson, every time she dominates each scene she's in, it made it very hard for me to like her, she comes across way too animated to be identified as a character. It's also unbelievable that anybody would be friends with her character, she never come across very supportive, the rules of the single life has Wilson explains it, never really convinced me she even knows what she is talking about. Now I don't dislike Rebel Wilson, I have not seen much of her work, but what I did see like in Pain and Gain(2013) and Night at the Museum 3(2014) made me feel she could have a good career in movies, but after How to Be Single, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.I did like Dakoda Johnson and Leslie Mann, and there the reason I'm not giving this a lower rating, If the film was only focused on just two of them, instead of trying to be this ensemble kind of thing, I think I would have like it more. He's Just Not That into You(2009) did it better than this.I laughed more at Deadpool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fat Amy's Guide on How to Sleep Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How to be single is a film that aims to profit off the ongoing trend of Female driven comedies, and although successful it may be, the quality of the film itself is no where near on par with such films like Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids which I'm sure it tries to aspire to be.The film is called how to be single but the film really is not that great at explaining how to be single. The film also doesn't deliver it's message that it's OK to be single that well either. The film falls into the basic chick flick formula showing that being single is about sleeping around and finding a man, as the majority of this film is exactly that. I was thinking that if at the end of this film every character ends in a relationship, then this film would have completely failed, and for the most part it does, exceptions being Rebel Wilson and the bar tender guy who are the only characters who, at the end, we are 100% sure are still single.The acting was typical. Every actress plays the same role they have been type casted in and performed many a time before. Dakota Johnson is the weak lead like in 50 shades, Alison Brie is the eager control freak as seen in Community, Leslie Mann is the hormonal cougar in many a Judd Apatow film and Rebel Wilson.... Well... is Rebel Wilson who has randomly been let loose on the set of this film with no real purpose except so that the film can cash off her Fat Amy shtick.This film to me wasn't particularly funny. The laughs of the giggling female cinema audience where funnier than the actual movie. The film relies a lot of its laughs on their comedic relief character Fat Am.... I mean Rebel Wilson, as that is what she is getting paid to do in this film anyway, just play her persona.How to Be Single is a very basic chick flick movie, like a spin off episode of sex and the city. It's not the next Pitch Perfect or Bridesmaids which are good, fun movies for everyone, but is one that I'm sure a group of girlfriends would have no trouble fitting into their movie marathon, right in-between Twilight and the Notebook.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gentle, over sentimental mess that yet cannot be faulted for not trying and not caring. The most irritating thing about a film is when you see the filmmakers having no passion about the project; that happens way to many times with this kind of mid budget film and so, if "How to Be Single" can be proof of one thing, is that investing passion in your film always gives some kind of results.One thing that really emerges from this film is that it is actually more funny than I expected. Some of the comedy really pays off and curiously enough it is always coming from the characters that the film is more interested in. Dakota Johnson, as I have said for some time, is quite a good actress and manages to take out something good out of this mediocre material. So does Alison Brie and of course Leslie Mann is always fun to watch.On the other hand Rebel Wilson is annoying, uninspired and worst of all an appalling cliché. I knew everything that was going to happen to her character two minutes into the film, probably the same time at which I gave up thinking she was going to be any kind of funny or interesting in the film.Overall there is lots of sentimentality, too many times characters give up character coherence in favor of a shock value or a cool scene that doesn't fit and end up in clichés. Yet, the director still manages to find a small balance of some heartfelt moments and genuine good comedy with actually a couple of character archs that were surprising and paid off.Unfortunately the cinematography of this film is a big low point. It is as standard and dull as photography can get. Basic coverage of every scene and the most basic and uninspired editing around it. It's not like it is out of focus or not lit properly, its just that it is so straight forward and dull it almost cheapens every moment in the film. For example, there is a piece of comedy involving Rebel Wilson getting out of a car that is shot with five freaking cuts. It takes away the whole comedy from the moment that could have been shot with a single steady shot and it would have made the scene ten times funnier.Although it is really forgettable and right now as I am writing I can't remember a good portion of it, there is still something to be found here, even though I will never recommend this for a theater viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please be old enough to watch this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally a movie that talks about the bitter-sweetness of single life, in a slightly superficial and super funny way. Please note: You need to be 25 or older to understand these women and actually have some dating experience. If you: a) have been in a committed relationship your entire adult life, b) is younger than 25, c) have not dated a few guys or girls, etc. - it is likely that you will not relate to this movie and will be silent throughout it's duration, and let two 26 y.o.'s fill the cinema's sound space with their laughter/agony of recognition... (I will not recap the story line since I assume you already read the summary). However, we follow newly-single Alice (Dakota Johnson), her sister Meg (Leslie Mann), Alice's best friend Robin and the stranger with no connection to the others: Lucy (Alison Brie) and their lives in New York, but in a non-cosmo-SATC- way. As you may have guessed, I like this movie. It is funny, relevant and full of women either in search of their own self-worth and independence (something I find is HEAVILY missing in American movies - why is marriage a woman's only quest in the first place?), or they have found it and are ruling the city of New York (all hail Queen Wilson). The movie shows a variety of women (note: not girls) who are figuring our life and meeting a lot of different guys on the way. Personally, I've met some of them too (warning: may contain spoilers... of my own life as well). Where was I - guys on the way! Tom (Anders Holm) - the notorious single guy who flee from all commitment, he tells you know, but you don't believe him, because you can fix him! (in real life, you may get hurt). You usually meet him on Tinder or as Alice did - in a bar. Josh (Nicholas Braun) is the really nice guy you know you should have stayed with, but is also boring AF so you might be OK without the wrong guy. You meet him in high school or at that voluntary thing you do on Wednesdays. David (Damon Wayans Jr.) is a catch, but not ready when it comes to it. And then there are George (Jason Mantzoukas) and Ken (Jake Lacy) the total dream guys, don't exist in reality. The total Hollywood-fantasy who will forgive all(!) your craycray and make sure the wrong guy don't hurt you ever again. Enjoy the type on TV and know that real-life-men have flaws as well and we all need just some social intelligence to co-exist in society.If you are of age(!!!) - the movie is best enjoyed with 1/2 bottle of rosé and the mood for cheap laughs. Don't expect a life-changing experience that will transcend how you reflect on the glorification of both relationships and single life, happiness and the downsides (like, justifications to society - why is this your business anyway?) but the movie may serve as source for conversations on how to be single and like your life. And again: please be old enough to watch it. You really can't relate if you're 14.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft-focused post-Valentine's rom-com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dakota Johnson plays Alice, a young woman we meet as she "takes a break" (in Friends language) from her college sweetheart in order to discover herself ? i.e. sleep with someone else to convince herself she's in love. It backfires and she finds herself alone in New York. That's when she meets Robin (Rebel Wilson), who takes her on an odyssey of booze, clubs, and sofa-surfing. Meanwhile, Alice's sister (Leslie Mann) is trying to conceive via IVF, while resisting the charms of a hunky admirer (Jake Lacy).There are myriad subplots, each involving variously unattached women and men. Some are affecting (a man grieving for his late wife) and some are misguided (a manic woman breaking down before a group of children at a book reading), but it all amounts to a brisk and enjoyable constellation of familiar rom-com elements ? with just a few mild surprises thrown in for good measure.The film's very title tells us this won't be a serious feminist essay, but as a soft-focused glance at the pariah world of singledom it does the job. At times it's even vaguely complex in its exploration of paradoxical human needs. It's also admirably restrained in its condemnation of sexually-active men. Yes, it's a chocolate box New York and the final message lands like a candy floss hammer, but fair play for populating the narrative with no clear villains.Dakota Johnson is fine, even if she has the air of a dramatic actor shoehorning herself into comedy. That's no easy thing ? De Niro's been trying and failing for decades. Alice is an everywoman, and the humour comes from the situations she finds herself in (e.g. tone-deaf attempts at casual flirtation; awkward parties where her three exes meet). Many of these situations are triggered by BFF Robin. Wilson is used to spectacularly indecent effect, although it's a pity it takes so long for the story to give her any depth beyond hedonism.Mann's tussle with independence versus commitment would normally be the stuff of entire rom-coms; perhaps its relegation (along with threads) to smaller sub-slices is a tacit acknowledgement that How To Be Single is a greatest hits package rather than something bold or new.Apparently this movie cost nearly $40m, although it's hard to see where the money went. It's aesthetically limited and stagey and it's no star vehicle. Still, it'll make its money back because it's the safest bet on the post-Valentine's schedule. A determinedly straightforward watch, from top to bottom How To Be Single aims to be a three-star movie and succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The time we have to be single is really the time we have to get good at being alone." Alice (Johnson) is afraid her life is passing her by and decides to break up with her boyfriend in order to experience what she is afraid of missing. She instantly meets Robin (Wilson) and her plans change. While learning to be single like begins to lose more and more of herself. Now, with 3 potential mates Alice must decide what is best for her. This is a movie that actually surprised me a little. I expected a typical cookie-cutter romantic comedy that is full of generic scenes and totally predictable. That is not what this movie is. While somethings happen the way you expect, most of the movie doesn't play out the way you expect and that makes this movie that much better. This is not a straight chick-flick and many guys will enjoy this as well. Rebel Wilson is tremendously funny in this as always, but the reason to watch is surprisingly for the writing. There are essentially 3 stories going on at once, but are seamlessly woven together to where they don't feel disconnected. Overall, one of the smartest and most different "chick flick" movies I have seen and this is a movie that I recommend. I surprisingly give this a high B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny jokes, bad story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: this movie is not a guidance for lonely people. You don't get some advise, how to behave as a single man oder a single woman. So the title is bad chosen, because all you get are the same clichés about relationships, like in all the other romantic comedies. Plus nothing is really romantic in this movie.We are following Alice who tries a time-out with her first boyfriend. She moves to New York and tries to find out, who she is and what she wants. And - of course - as a single lady there is nothing else to do then some drinking and having one night stands.And that is all, what the movie is about. If you are single, all you want to do is try to find "the" right partner, if you are in a relationship, all you want to do is some drinking and having one night stands. Wow. Thank you for that.Besides that very thin storyline, we have surprisingly much jokes. At many times the whole crowd was cheering and laughing, sometimes i had tears in my eyes. Most of these jokes are made from Rebel Wilson - but you have to like these kind of jokes. She is almost playing the same character as in Pitch Perfect, so if you don't like her in that, i would not recommend this movie.The characters aren't very deep, each one stands for one relationship stereotype. The problems are the same as in every movie.To sum it up: bad story, worse stereotype characters but a lot of funny jokes. Wouldn't watch it in cinemas.</fullReview>

I think that the title fits perfectly. The main character, Alice, breaks up with her college boyfriend because she wants to be single for a while in order to find herself and achieve that, she does what most people do : she gets involved with other guys.I think that the main point of this movie is precisely to show that what most people believe it is to be single is not actually being single. Alice understands that by the end of the movie and I really liked that. It is rather refreshing for a rom-com. Other than that, yes, How to be Single is not innovative but it is not such a bad movie.</fullReview>

This movie in particular is based off a book, so maybe that's why it did so much better. The movie had a weak plot, but it was interesting nonetheless. All the characters and situations were believable. The movie looked at issues that are common to both men and women in their 20s and 30s, and explored the pros and cons of these issues, and turned it into something funny. The only unbelievable part was that a beligerent, careless chick (Robin) could land a job at a prestigious law firm. I enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice (Dakota Johnson) met true love in college when Josh (Nicolas Braun) came to her rescue during a wardrobe malfunction. Now, four years later, Alice is restless. She loves J but feels that they should each "take a break" and experience singlehood for awhile. Josh is not happy. But, they part company and Alice expects it to be brief, relatively speaking. Therefore, Alice takes a new job as a paralegal to a large Manhattan law firm and moves in with her baby doctor sister, Meg (Leslie Mann). Her first day on the job, Alice is shown around by receptionist Robin (Rebel Wilson), who is unconventional to say the least. After briefing A on the hidden places for trysts at the company building, she then tries to educate A on "how to be single". Right away, Alice hooks up with a sexy barkeep, Tom (Anders Holm). Alas, Tom, who has no interest in a long term relationship, unknowingly likes a wedding-hungry gal, Lucy (Alison Brie) who meets up with Internet matches at the drinking establishment, as she lives upstairs. Its complicated. Making a date to see Josh again, Alice is startled to learn he has moved on with someone else. Also, Meg, makes her leave her apartment, since Robin dove naked down the laundry shoot. Nevertheless, Alice rebounds with a snug new apartment all her own and a possible new love interest, David (Damon Wayans, Jr). Meg, too, who has devoted herself to her career, wants to have a baby by a sperm donor, just as she meets a cute younger man, Ken (Jake Lacy). Who will be lucky enough to walk down the aisle and who will learn how to stay content whatever the situation? This, dear romance fans, is not your mama's romcom but its not in the same mode of an Apatow love story, either. There is a definite vibe of reality in the modern search for a mate so impossible happy ending is not in the works, either. Yet, there is sweetness and kisses between the heartache, making it pleasing to those who adore the genre. The cast is quite fine, with Johnson strong as the female lead and supported nicely by Mann, Wilson, Braun, Brie, and the rest. Wayans Jr. made the biggest impression, as his role as a single father has weight. Then, too, the Manhattan setting is terrific, from small apartments to huge buildings and parks. Costumes, too, are trendy and fun while the educated script and smooth direction add to the movie's enjoyment. Beware, folks, that there are many sexual situations and conversations, which some viewers won't appreciate. In summary, though, if you want to embrace any romance bone Hollywood throws out very rarely these days, you show go catch How to Be Single.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how to be single review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How to Be Single" is one of my all-time favorite movies! For me it depicted a real life situation. dating someone throughout college, then breaking up and not knowing how to live your life without the other person. This movie I think depicted how a single woman in her mid 20's is learning how to live being alone, singe, and figuring out who she is. What I loved most about this movie was that the single woman at the end decided to do her, as in do what she has been putting off to the side, pleasing her self instead of another person. All in all i give this movie a 9 out of 10 points. if you love comedy with a real life situation, I am sure you will enjoy this movie as much as i did!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of How to Be Single</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2016's How to Be Single (my latest review) takes place in New York City. Unless you've been living in an igloo somewhere, you'd know that it's the biggest hub in the whole United States (8 million denizens and counting). Somehow though, every character in "Single" seems to coincidentally run into each other as if it's the town of Mayberry. The Big Apple contains five boroughs, hundreds of neighborhoods, and almost 500 square miles. Small world? I don't think so.Anyway, despite featuring a comic force of nature in Rebel Wilson, marginally attractive actors/actresses, and a look of NYC that is as glistening as ever, How to Be Single is a directionless romcom. It's the type of vehicle that requires a tacked-on, concluding narration device just to let you know what's really going on. Oh and by the way, this film has a made-up notion of a drinking hookup rule (the number of alcoholic beverages a man and a woman would have to consume before they fall into bed together). Total ludicrousness!At a running time of just under 2 hours and penned by three screenwriters, "Single" uses tactics that other (general) flicks have presented over the past few years (visible text messaging, tired d*ck jokes, droll fast cutting). As buffoonery, it's a pre-Valentine's Day release that's a legend in its own mind or should I say, an unknown director's catacomb that marches to the beat of its own drum. The story is as follows: Alice (Dakota Johnson) is a career woman who dumps her college boyfriend so that she can find herself as a young adult. She moves in with her sister (Leslie Mann as Meg), finds a job as a paralegal, and bar hops with her party girl/co-worker named Robin (Rebel Wilson). Over periods of fast-forwarding (fall season, Xmas, St. Patrick's Day), Alice runs into ex-boyfriends, has a one night stand or two, and eventually decides that she's better off not being in any kind of relationship at all. Johnson isn't much of an acting juggernaut but she's darn adorable. I'm no casting agent but I feel she's still pretty much perfect for her role.By hook or by crook, How to Be Single is R-rated, has the obligatory bad language, and contains the required, flask notions of innuendo. However, I was surprised at how non-juvenile it was compared to most raunchy comedies. The filmmakers and everyone else involved really wanted to say something. Too bad the proceedings get drowned in a vat of drunkenness, casual sex, self-prophesied female starlets, and douche-like, male characters (Anders Holm as a womanizing bartender and Nicholas Braun as a manipulative suitor). Disappointing. Rating: 2 stars.Of note: Hallmark's favorite holiday has passed but I still think every guy should avoid taking a date to see "Single". With its demoralizing of women just looking for Mr. Right, you as gentlemanly John Doe might be cursed by your sweetie or relegated, significant other. All strapping males have been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to be Single</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and watched this movie "How to be Single" with two of my other single friends. We went expecting it to be a hilarious movie and that's exactly what it was. Its basically a show of how each person reacts with breakups/ relationships in their own ways. We laughed the whole time. I kind of expected it to answer the question a little bit more but it didn't at all. Just kind of showed how they coped with the relationship. Most of the humor was kind of awkward in that matter. It kind of switched back and forth between being single sucks and needing to be in an relationship than back to its okay to be single. For the most part we enjoyed it because of the characters who were in it but I have seen better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dakota Johnson.. fantastic portrayal. completely believable and i got lost in the performance. Rebel was great.. not her usual crazy over the top, more like a good hint of crazy in a nice cup off hilarious coffee.Leslie Mann i have always been a fan of hers, since George of the jungle. Wish i could meet her and get to know her.Damon Wayans Jr. Great, i believed your performance, excellent for the family legacy. Beyond what i have seen from your family history.What a fantastic change of pace for a relationship movie... it really is a great way to spend your time, and to the earlier review... if you only stayed for the first 20 minutes.. than you missed out on the whole point of the film, Great writing, it wasn't campy or overdone or even cliché... it was the first real look on real life in the 21st century. Great Flick. Go and See it. I don't really know how to talk about it without giving away the ending. The cast of characters are all good looking enough to be beautiful without it being unbelievable people, i mean Channing Tatum is a great looking human being, but he doesn't wake up and look like that, he works his ass off everyday, so these people are the beautiful people who can chug a beer and not have to run to the gym after ahaha OOOH and the small reference; training to go hiking... that was brilliant and completely real. way to go.. -James</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to be single....NOT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, this movie is more about relationships than being single. I went to the movie on Valentines Day with my single friends and we left and immediately all looked at each other and said "Ok well now I'm sad I'm single." So it really isn't what you think it will be. BUT the movie itself is VERY funny. All of us enjoyed it a lot and laughed our butts off. I would recommend it and I would watch it again. Overall, funny and good movie just not really about being single in my opinion. You will laugh the whole time of course because Rebel Wilson is in it and alone she is hilarious.... and putting her with Dakota Johnson was thought to be a misfit but actually worked out well and together they make a good team.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alice decides to take a break from her boyfriend in order to find herself. Apparently this means moving out, becoming a paralegal, hanging out with fat hedonist Robin, having a one night stand with shallow barman Tom, then realising that she's ready to settle down with her boyfriend. Unfortunately, he has now found someone else. Various others move in and out of Alice's ambit ? rich single dad David, Alice's sister Meg, a single doctor who doesn't want children then does, who has a wander-in-to-her-life quite nice bloke turn up, Lucy who writes algorithms to get the best results from dating sites and gets on well with shallow barman Tom up to the point when he realises, why, she's been in front of me the whole time, and so on.I have no idea whether or not this stuff actually goes on within the singles community in New York. I guess it might. It certainly doesn't resemble anything any people I have ever known have been involved in. And it has a bad case of identity crisis. On one hand, it tries to be out there, right on, unconventional while, on the other, it also wants to be deeply conventional. So I guess I have to acknowledge that there are at least two of the plot threads which don't resolve in the way I expected them to. And I also have to acknowledge that the characters in this are mostly quite good company, and I didn't mind hanging out with them.It isn't particularly funny or romantic, it's all a bit inconsequential and shambolic, and Rebel Wilson is given too much rein. But it passes the time fairly amiably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flirty And Fun Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebel Wilson? Check. Dakota Johnson? Check. Leslie Mann? Alison Brie? Single girls in New York? Check, check, check! How To Be Single ticks many of the boxes I have when it comes to chick flicks. I prefer my rom-coms to be heavy on the com and lighter on the rom, and this movie fulfills that requirement. It's not (too) schmultzy and what I loved most about it was that it didn't check the other 'cookie-cutter' boxes that you sometimes find in films like these ? the girl and guy that hate each other in the beginning don't actually fall in love in the end, and the main character doesn't end up fulfilling what should be her life's sole purpose of finding a man. (Spoiler alert! Oh wait, is that warning meant to come before the spoiler? Oops?).Dakota Johnson is absolutely adorable in this film. She's quirky and awkward, but in a real, believable way. Rebel Wilson plays her outrageous but lovable sidekick Robin who she meets at a law firm where she starts a new job, and Robin spends the rest of the film trying to convince her that the only way to live life is to do it unattached. Alison Brie and Leslie Mann play smaller roles as the friend and older sister respectively but they each have their own idiosyncrasies regarding love which you will either identify with as one of our own, or recognise in someone you know.My one criticism of the film has to be the seemingly disjointed events that take place. For instance, whilst the story mainly follows Dakota's character Alice's love life (or lack thereof), it is suddenly brought to our attention that she is having friendship trouble with Robin at the climax of the film ? even though there haven't really been any signs of the debilitating friendship along the way.Other than the sporadic screenplay, this film was a perfect movie for, in Beyonce's words, all the single ladies. And what's even better about it is that although he may not put a ring on it in the end? that's okay.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining romcom for what it's worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I enjoyed 'How to Be Single'. As I said before, the plot is a very modern plot that many people have either been involved in or have been a witness to personally and all while everything happens, it is quite comical from beginning to end. Each actor and actress had a very entertaining and comedic role and all brought a creative energy to the film with each minute that passed. Dakota Johnson included. After seeing 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (yes, I know, I watched it, stop judging), I thought Dakota was unimpressive to say the least but in 'How to Be Single', she brings a very low-key comedic energy to the table and I found myself laughing at many of her quips and one- liners. One last point that I thoroughly enjoyed was how the film was shot. It showed excellent shots of New York City capturing the beauty in the city. Also there was a small feature that I liked in the form of how a small text box would pop up as the characters were about to text another person through their cell phones. I thought it was creative and refreshing. A few points that I was not a fan of this movie were for one, there are a few time lapses that are confusing to follow. Sometimes it jumps a couple weeks, sometimes a couple months and it was just hard to follow at times. Another point was, as much as they brought great energy, the introduction of all the characters seemed quick and forced to a point where it is a little confusing to remember who was who and their relation to the story.All in all, as I said, I overall enjoyed this film for what it was worth as a romantic comedy. It was refreshing and modern. The cast brought a great comedic energy in their own unique ways. I would recommend this movie as a great candidate for a nice date night out. Although even the story is something interesting to embrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It feels unmistakably like imitation adventures for derivations of Carrie Bradshaw and crew.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the film really gets going, it's apparent that "How to Be Single" has modeled itself almost entirely from "Sex and the City." The New York setting, the music, the characters, the momentary male nudity, and the dreaded voice-over designate this feature project as a smaller, episodic production along the lines of the aforementioned television series. And, indeed, with the cast of four primary women and their array of farcical sexual situations, this simple comedy looks and feels unmistakably like imitation adventures for derivations of Carrie Bradshaw and crew. And that's not a good thing."This story isn't about relationships," insists Alice Kepley (Dakota Johnson), even though the picture proceeds to be entirely about the pursuit of significant others. She goes on to suggest that women's lives should not be defined by relationships, and that what happens in between such unions is real life. Women are supposed to be cheerful about being single, or at least hide any display of embarrassment about solitariness, but all they truly yearn for is meaningful connections. Throughout the course of the film, her character, along with her costars, can do nothing but show open dismay or discomposure over breakups and separations.When Alice decides to broaden her experiences with the opposite sex, she leaves longtime boyfriend Josh (Nicholas Braun) for a paralegal position with Brown, Light, and Finkelstein in the Big Apple - where she immediately meets nonstop party girl Robin (Rebel Wilson). Taking the unpracticed youth under her wing, Robin shows Alice how to have a good time - and having a good time is defined by heavy imbibing, spontaneous sex, and memory loss. An early montage demonstrates that the essential routine for serious partygoers involves drinking at a bar, drunken intercourse, waking up next to a stranger, nursing a hangover, and stumbling into work to prepare to do it all over again. The problem with this setup is that, despite its modernized representation as adolescent convention, the characters appear despicable for succumbing to such progressive yet fleeting existences. Love looks so much better in cinema when it's not marred by empty, casual sex.Additionally, in this hopelessly fictional world, women are unable to possess both a good career and a good man. Though the story was molded by numerous writers (based on the book by Liz Tuccillo), it betrays an incredibly sexist attitude with this message. Furthermore, it proposes that young people are inherently prone to partying and promiscuity, while older people must be responsible and boring; this is the standard categorization of maturity and anyone who falls outside of this compass is abnormal. "Reading is for ugly losers!" instructs Robin, as Alice is forced to choose between loneliness or sleeping with convenient acquaintances. Meanwhile, dating-website mathematician Lucy (Alison Brie) is convinced that the odds are against her for finding a worthwhile companion, and Alice's sister Meg (Leslie Mann) decides she wants a child, but can't depend on a relationship with a man to have one - resorting to a sperm donor whom she never has to meet.Rebel Wilson plays Rebel Wilson, spewing penis jokes and booze quips every time the mood becomes too dour from all of the collapsing relationships. And the rest of the cast adopts generic personas of romanticists perpetually disappointed by the cold reality of loveless hookups and shifting desires. It's a group of characters that commands little sympathy and less purpose, exhibited as juveniles merely waiting to develop away from the childish fantasies of love and happiness. What a depressing assemblage of contemptible yet physically attractive spirits.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With some laughs and an unpredictable story, How to Be Single is a surprisingly likable movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Valentine's Day has just come and gone and serves as a reminder with how special relationships can be. The holiday also can be harder for those that are not in relationships. It's not just for those that are sad that they are alone, but it even harder for those that are content with their single status. Some often questions for those that are fine with being single are, "Isn't life just sad without a lover?" and "your moment will come soon". I'll bet that the person that tell you that are ones that are in relationships (like your friends or even parents) and are not walking in your shoes. I myself have been in and out of relationships enough to know the benefits of being single. For one thing, the extra time gives me a chance to explore other hobbies. Traveling alone is awesome as you get total freedom with what you want to see. You even have a better chance to hang with friends (whether they are in relationships or not). It's within this grace period when you can also decide with even if your ready to give romantic relationships another go. Different women explore the single lifestyle in How to Be Single.Recent post grad Alice (played by Dakota Johnson) decides to put a break on her college boyfriend in order to go see the world. Her heart takes her to New York City where she acquires a job as a paralegal and a couch to sleep on at her older sister Meg (played by Leslie Mann). She also gains a friend with Robin (played by Rebel Wilson), who uses her single lifestyle to party and have constant one night stands. She teaches Alice how to successfully pick up guys and how to have fun the Robin way. One such place for Robin and Alice is a bar run by Tom, who has an even bigger routine for one night stands, going as far to remove food and running water in his apartment so that women have to leave the next morning. Tom becomes friends with the young woman living above him, Lucy (played by Alison Brie), whose so determined to find the right guy that she even creates an algorithm and posts several profiles on dating websites. While Alice and Rebel continue to explore with hat it means to be single, Meg decides to become a mother through sperm donation and even starts to date a guy younger then her.I'll give How to Be Single a lot of credit for not falling into the traps of most romantic comedies. That's not to say that it does in some areas, but often the story will drift into different directions, not letting you sure where things are going to end up. The movie takes advantage of the fact that it's a comedy and while Rebel Wilson does will with her usual personality you've seen before (though without making any predictable fat jokes), I would have not expected Dakota Johnson to be as funny as she was.How to Be Single is probably one of the few chick flick movies that prove that they can be just as funny as any guy comedy. A lot of the dialogue reminded me a lot of Bridesmaids and 500 Days of Summer. While some situations, especially the sub plot of Alison Brie's character, don't connect to the main story, a lot of it is made up with it's own humor.As I said, despite making jokes about romance, it accidentally follows some romantic film clichés like falling for someone too quickly, but they don't happen too often.I'll give this seven single statuses out of ten. How to Be Single was a genuine surprise with how much it made me laugh and not be able to know where the story was going. It should make most single people feel good?and even those that are in relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre Rom-Com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "How to Be Single", starring Dakota Johnson-Fifty Shades of Grey, Crazy in Alabama; Rebel Wilson-The Pitch Perfect movies, Ghost Rider; Leslie Mann-The Other Woman, Last Man Standing and Anders Holm- Workaholics_tv, The Interview.This is a rom-com about the lives of several young people living in New York. Dakota just moved there, to get away from a bad relationship and meets Rebel, who takes her under her wing and shows Dakota how to be single in New York. Leslie is Dakota's sister, who also happens to be an unmarried doctor that is wrestling with the idea of becoming a parent by insemination-she has never had kids or a husband before but the maternal instincts are starting to kick in. Anders is a bar tender at a popular bar that the ladies frequent a lot, both the bar and Anders. Not much new here, it's not bad, it's just kind of mediocre. I do like some of the actors, especially Dakota. I guess they had to have a date movie for Valentine's Day. It's rated "R" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 50 minutes. I don't think I would buy this on DVD. It would be alright as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie was really real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was really genuine in the sense that the ending wasn't too cliché, it was real. Though some parts of this movie's comedy was over dramatized (not a bad thing) the romance part was super real and it gave you a real punch in the face of reality. The movie revolved around a few characters and how their lives were connected though not the main point of the story. The point of the story or what I got from it was to find yourself and that life doesn't always go the way you want it to go. There was some parts of the movie where I just got frustrated because I wanted someone to end up with someone else, but that doesn't happen in life. this movie actually shows that not everyone's in a relationship and the movie does really show you "How to be single" (and happy). So yeah, I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is New York City Really This Much Fun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been to NYC many times but never had so much fun like in all the movies filmed there. Viewers unfamiliar with the city will get the impression Manhattan is hosting one continuous party 24/7. The movie focuses on 4 female characters who have lots of quirks and psychoses and spend lots of time discussing their feelings. Rebel Wilson steals the movie with her bawdy dance moves, vodka chugging and bar hopping, and is the kind of person you want for your best friend. There was also a scene where the female doctor (can't remember character's name-- Meg?)has a baby thrust into her arms, sits the baby down and has a one-sided conversation with baby as the adorable child coos and smiles the whole time. This particular scene is what inspired the 8/10 vote (thumbs up) I give the movie as it was the most open, honest, beautiful display of emotion I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. There are a few things I didn't like about this movie and all movies that have characters obviously in sexual relationships. Nowhere in this movie was the word "condom" mentioned, nor was anyone shown reaching for the bedside table to retrieve one. Maybe the writers/producers feel it's unromantic, or we are just supposed to assume they DID use protection, but I just wish this would somehow figure into the screenplay. Otherwise I liked this movie and would recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie definitely deserves more credit...Rebel Wilson never disappoints with her endless wit; kept me laughing from beginning to end. Dakota Johnson as the main lead was also amazing and has tremendously improved since her role in 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. Whether you're single or not, there are many relate-able emotions or traits one encounters during relationships. Some of my similar top favourite comedies are 'The Hangover' and 'Bridesmaids' - 'How to be Single' fits nicely in this category. The movie wrapped up nicely leaving me satisfied despite the unexpected ending...Will for sure re-watch on a rainy-vegetating kind of day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching How to Be Single I got a sudden bout of amnesia and deja vu; I feel like I have forgotten something like this before. A group of women trying to find themselves, pithy off-screen narration, a menagerie of attractive men who come and go, scenic second unit footage of New York City... hmm, the name Carrie Bradshaw rings a bell for some reason.How to Be Single starts with college freshman Alice (Johnson) falling hard for a guy (Braun) on her dorm room floor. Years go by and she comes to realize she's never been alone before. Clearly a change must be made so she takes a "break," moves to the city with her sister Meg (Mann) and promptly finds a job as a paralegal. It is there she meets Robin (Wilson) a wanton woman who has mastered the art of being single. Alice struggles to find her own in the city and between the career minded Meg and free-wielding Robin, she has a lot to ponder. Also in the mix is Lucy (Brie) a woman with a tangential connection to the main trio and is trying desperately to find her "one and only" through a series of disastrous blind dates.Yes, How to Be Single plays like a decent episode of Sex and the City (1998-2004) only without the ostentation. These girls don't go to fashion shows and hook up with millionaires, they live in Brooklyn, gasp! Each of the foursome are in search of some kind of fulfillment in their lives, something that might make them whole. The movie seems adamant about convincing you that finding a soulmate is not always the way to go. Or at the very least a diversity of solutions are available to those in search and there's no single box everyone needs to climb into.It's a message worth spreading, and while the movie favors to meander down various narrative avenues and dead ends, it does eventually get to it's point. Rebel Wilson's character represents a hedonistic approach to the single life and much like the Alan character in The Hangover series (2009-2013) she gets all the funny lines and isn't a character but an agent of chaos. She's also best appreciated in small doses which the movie wisely obliges. Alison Brie's character is the complete opposite matching Wilson only in the level of broad-stroke characterization. If the movie was wholly about her, I would have simply found her too shrill to endure. Though I will say that her chemistry with potential love-interest Anders Holm is enough to take that bitter pill to the end credits.Ironically while the film tries to subvert conventions it was Leslie Mann's character that makes the most poignant transformation. She plays a career oriented doctor who is keen on the idea of having a baby thus goes to a sperm bank with the intention of having a child on her own. Predictably she falls in love with someone and has to keep her pregnancy hush-hush for a while. Her chemistry with the youthful Jake Lacy is likewise a fun little respite from the film's narrative sloppiness.I haven't mentioned Dakota Johnson's character at length yet, and there's a reason for that; Alice isn't that interesting. Her main conflict comes from having to choose between three men she took the time to get to know: her ex, new love interest Damon Wayans Jr. and the aforementioned Anders Holm. Everything comes to a head at her rooftop birthday party but then nothing actually happens. Johnson is famous for her role in Fifty Shade of Grey (2015) and lord knows she plays vulnerability well but confidence? Joy? any of the other Inside Out (2015) characters, not so much.Fundamentally How to Be Single is a worthwhile movie despite its rather various faults. It remains reliably funny throughout with various riffs and wisecracks provided by Wilson, Holm and the always charming Mann. For millennials this movie may be an introductory course to lipstick feminism where the choices are many and the points don't matter. Yet for those of us who remember the misadventures of a similarly inclined New York City foursome, I think it'd be better just to dust off that season 3 DVD case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's starts off badly but ends so well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought I was going to really hate this movie. It starts out force feeding us these opinions on what it means to be single and the dialog that the actors spit out is just so dry and formulated that I just wanted to shoot myself.Luckily, I didn't because the film took the turn for the OK, as we get to know the characters a little bit better. Give it up for some good acting and decent character development that causes you to feel something for everyone in the movie. Even the smallest character had a story to tell, some were interesting and others were touching and well done. It's a strange movie about letting relationships take there course without showing all that stuff, because the main story is about the relationship you have with yourself. So not as Sex in the City as the poster would make it seem, and not as funny as the Rebel Wilson heavy trailer would lead you to believe(her turn as comedy relief in this movie falls flat), but overall just a good film to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this really how to be single?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rebel Wilson seems to sleep round a lot in the city that never sleeps. She often wakes up with out a clue as to where or who she she is with. For some reason she decides to show Dakota Johnson more then around the office. Like Ms. Johnson learned nothing in in her Grey movie. She didn't learn she is capable of playing more then a fluff character. Leslie Mann is there as her usual self. She is adept at comedy. Most of the others in the cast seemed awkward and uncomfortable.If your looking for plenty of drinking, parties and shallow relationships they are here. There are some laughs but not enough for a movie that feels a bit too long. It has a Sex in the City" feel without a clothing budget.This is a sit back and enjoy your popcorn movie. If you miss the theatrical run you may want to catch it at home on rom com night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into the cinema, I was thinking "just another love story but they fun to watch". But I was positively surprise when I realized that I wasn't able to guess the plots and twists of the movie. One or two followed the classical 'romantic movie pattern' but many of the plots I did not see coming and walked out with a really good feeling.Dakota Johnson was a positive surprise! After 50 shades, I didn't think I'd like her in any movie but this has officially changed with this movie! Rebel Wilson - so hilarious, you just wait and see!! Single or in a relationship, this is a movie that I would love to force my girlfriends to watch in good and bad times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good comedy, not your normal retarded one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My sister kind of forced me into going to see this movie. I saw trailers and though it looked interesting, I wasn't all too thrilled of it. It wasn't a must-see for me. It was more like, "I can watch it when it comes out to Amazon's Instant Video." But I went along anyway.When we got to the theaters, everyone was heading to Deadpool. And apparently, barely anyone went to see this movie. Besides us, a few couples, a few other randoms (not even twenty people) was in our theater. And it was opening day. I suddenly thought, "This movie isn't that great, then." The thing with me is that I've seen too many movies and with this one, I thought it was going to be your retarded romantic comedy kind of thing. Like, it wouldn't be funny except for a few chuckles here and there, but it would just be stupid. Basically like Grown Ups 2.The first thing we see though, is a guy having a boner while talking to some girl across his apartment. I was like, "Uh... really?" Not a good first impression. We see Rebel partying like crazy and you know, everything else.I won't lie, there were a few things I saw in there that was like, "Huh?" Which was why I gave it a lower rating.Another reason why I gave it a lower rating was because it kind of tells the story between three girls - you have the protagonist, Alice, some random chick named Lucy (who apparently doesn't know anyone else except for a bartender that Alice knows), and Alice's sister, Meg. Robin, who is played by Rebel Wilson (who you may know it from Pitch Perfect) isn't in it as much. She's more of Alice's side-kick, a support character, basically. Anyway, the main story is based on Alice and Lucy doesn't have much of a story. The movie is based on Alice and Meg... So I was disappointed to see them go off into different directions to Lucy who had no real part in the movie except for a few areas and Robin who was a support character which I wanted to see more of her (because let's be honest, Rebel is awesome). So I gave it a lower score because they A) could have done more with Lucy's part or B)had an unnecessary story added.Eh, it may have worked in the end, but I don't really think so.The comedy was on point though. As said before, there were a couple areas that made you go, "What?" and it was supposed to be funny and either you do laugh because it was funny or you laughed because you don't know if it was supposed to be funny... you know? But basically, the comedy was really good. It wasn't your normal retarded type. Even the people that came was laughing as much as I was, so that's a good sign. My sister even made the comment that I was laughing too loud. Haha.Overall, though, I went thinking it was stupid and not that great, but I left pretty satisfied and I liked it more than I thought I was going to.It also has a nice moral to it, so... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The main lesson of HOW TO BE SINGLE . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . is that each American Singleton must carve out a few weeks sometime in their twenties to hike Arizona's Grand Canyon alone. The best time to do this is in the winter, when the place is NOT overrun by casual tourists. This is what Alice, the main character of HOW TO BE SINGLE, dreams of doing during this entire flick, and what she actually DOES in its final shot. If you live in the flatlands, like Alice, get in training for your Vision Quest by using a step climber at your local gym, as Alice is shown doing. (It's a 5,000-foot vertical elevation drop down to the Colorado River from the South Rim, where Alice is shown, and another 5,000-foot elevation climb back UP, so you'll need to be in pretty good shape. Do NOT try the North Rim, as it's glacial in the Winter, and there's only one way down and up even in the Summertime; the South Rim offers about eight different round-trip routes.) Use a 45-pound backpack, like Alice, and include a sleeping bag rated for MINUS 40 degrees (Fahrenheit), just in case. (You can zip it COMPLETELY shut at night and you'll be very cozy, even though there will be ICE on the OUTSIDE of your bag--over where your mouth was--when you unzip in the morning.) Transportation to the South Rim is spotty Mid-Winter, but this means that Park Ranger Patrols will be few and far between, as well. (Technically, you need a permit two years in advance to hike on the least challenging "Tanner Trail.") But if you cannot walk 50 miles or so from Flagstaff, AZ to the Desert View Trailhead, you probably do not belong in the Canyon. (If you get to Desert View before dawn and do not have a good flashlight, just sleep on the floor of the tourists' rest room--you'll probably have it to yourself, unless Alice has beaten you to it!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventional Valentine's Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young woman searches for love in New York City in this enjoyable romantic comedy based on the novel by Liz Tuccillo, and produced by Drew Barrymore. It's a Valentine's weekend, and a movie like this is ideal. "How to be single" has many twists and crazy characters, talented cast and smart script. It's silly and at the same time fun and to be honest, no one will leave the movie theater knowing anything more about how to be single. Turning the usual boy-meets-girl theme, and letting women decide whether it is better to be with, or move on from the men in their lives, this unconventional comedy is refreshing and interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's how I summarize the first 45 minutes or so of this film. You're getting into the story. Trying to laugh at the funny parts, but really only laughing when Rebel Wilson is part of the scene because she's hilarious. You're following well, but haven't fully bought in to the storyline. You're waiting for her to come back so you can laugh again, because that's mostly why you paid money to sit in a theater and watch a comedy movie.The film plods along with intermittent and proportionally large laughs when Wilson is on screen, but then something strange happens. The movie actually starts to be enjoyable. More characters are introduced. The setups are actually paying off now. Dakota Johnson is actually doing things that are funny. We've learned all the characters and all the stories the filmmakers have tried to weave together, but now we're starting to get invested. How to Be Single is pretty self-explanatory. Johnson plays a girl who breaks up with her boyfriend of four years because she feels that she needs to learn more about herself alone. She meets Wilson, a wild spirit, who tries teaching her how to get the most out of her single life.Johnson feels out of place comedically at times, but she is the main driving force of any emotion evoked by this film.The events take place over the course of about a year or so. It recognizes that these things take time and never rushes through stages in a breakup and the self-discovery that comes along with independence.It's nothing crazy that we haven't really seen before, but in some ways it is. It's surprisingly not very predictable and its humor plays on self-awareness. Just get past the first act and it's pretty much smooth sailing from then on out.And guys should enjoy it too. The film never becomes too self-righteous or alienates the idea of relationships at all. What this movie does best is finding the balance between uninhibited humor and benevolence. It acts as a good intentioned allegory on loving yourself before being able to love someone else.On another note, Wilson is flat out funny. She does her usual competent-slacker schtick here, and continues to help prove her case as the funniest woman in Hollywood right now.Twizard Rating: 82</fullReview>
