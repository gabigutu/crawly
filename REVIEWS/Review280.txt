		<shortDescription>Its a story that spans over 7 decades and gets in depth about gang wars, crime, hatred, revenge that gets passed on from one generation to another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the screening at the Sydney film festival. Its definitely one of the best Hindi movies ever made. Direction, screenplay, narration, acting, music, cinematography, everything about this movie is top notch. Anurag Kashyap is truly the best at whatever he does. You wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Manoj Bajpai's has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. Not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. Dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get. The opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. The way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. All the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. Its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the Indian cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Bollywood's answer to Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, its true.Scorsese and Tarantino are there in Bollywood too,Anurag Kashyap surely belongs to that class.A Movie which gives you the raw look of everything love,ambition,politics,revenge,comedy, this movie has everything in it.I was expecting another disappointment with another Bollywood movie but right from first scene this movie blew me away. The story spans last seven decades of Indian history with events taking place in mining towns of Wasseypur and Dhanbad. The tale of the cities is portrayed in the rivalry between the family of Shahid Khan,an ambitious man who loots trains in British Era by the name of Sultana Daku and Ramdahri Singh and Local Contractor turned Politician. The animosity is passed to the next generation where Sardar Khan portrayed by Manoj Bajpai,who wants to avenge his fathers death by destroying Ramdhari Singh and his family and the Qureshi's who outcast his father. Manoj Bajpai has outclassed himself. Every single actor has done his part perfectly. You will feel like you are actually living in that part of the world. Hats off to the team, they have thoroughly researched every detail and make the whole scenario looked like real. A Must Must watch for if you love quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been nearly 5 years since I went and saw a movie first day first show in the theatres. But such was the level of anticipation with "gangs of wasseypur" that I found myself standing in front of the ticket counter at quarter to nine. The movie, which is 160 minutes long, starts with a shoot-them-up which may be the most authentic shoot-to-kill scene in Hindi cinema. The movie tells the story of rivalries between different sects of Muslims: the butchers, Qureshis, and the Pathans, Khans and extend over a period of three generations. The story starts from the pre- independence era when the British owned the mines in Dhanbad. After independence, these mines pass on to the wealthy landlord who hires an exiled Pathan to act as his strongman. The pathan, the father of Sardar Khan (Manoj Vajpayee) has been kicked out of his village, Wasseypur, after a confrontation with the local musclemen, the Qureshis, and is now forced to work in the mines of Dhanbad. He starts becoming too big for his shoes and is bumped off by the landlord thus beginning a series of killings and counter-killings. The acting by the "star" cast is stunning with Manoj Vajpayee leading the pack in as good as a performance as "Bheeku Mahatre" in Satya. When he stares lustfully at the back side of Reema Sen (here resurrected after being in the wilderness for nearly half a dozen years), you can feel the lust as a physical thing. He is backed by a very strong ensemble cast. The real strength of the movie is its dialogues. The words, replete with the choicest of abuses, feel as if they were wiretapped. The conversation rings true to life and had me laughing at the sheer vulgarity of it. The patois is captured very faithfully. The only negative point about the movie is its length which could have been edited somewhat in the second half when the third generation takes up (like the long Godfather III, if you may). Anurag Kashyap has put his soul into the movie and that is visible from every frame of the movie. The direction is the best I have seen this year in Hindi cinema and will only increase the expectations from the second part of this opus. And that is why I am jealous of the lucky bastards at the Cannes film festival who got to see both the parts back to back. The movie ends at a tantalizing junction and the prospect of meeting with these barely lovable characters for a second outing left me salivating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just returned from the first day late night show of this movie (the first part) and it has totally blown me away. The movie starts with a bang and carries the charm throughout. The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.Siddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.Apart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.The camera angles, especially the final sequence is superb. Anurag Kashyap is India's answer to Quentin Terentino. Gangs of Waseypur is already a Cult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Direction and Acting so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur stands firmly on the grounds of direction, acting, screenplay, story-line, cinematography &amp; music. Manoj Pandey has delivered an outstanding performance. The movie has to be rated "A" because of a lot of abuses (which implies, its not a family flick). But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra &amp; Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>&#x200e;'Gangs of Wasseypur' is a visceral epic! Not the kind of regular rubbish that is churned out every now and then. Mr.Anurag Kashyap has brought us something that can be categorized with the likes of 'The Godfather'.Manoj Bajpayee is rocking and superbly supported by a fabulous Richa Chadda, Reema Sen and Piyush Mishra. And final cherry on the acting caked is Nawazzuddin as a vulnerable young lad who is basically a romantic at heart but is getting transformed into a ruthless gangster much like Michael Corleone in the Godfather series. Manoj Bajpayee's character is quite akin to much more ruthless version of Don Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando in 'The Godfather'.By repeatingly mentioning 'The Godfather' I am not trying to take away anything from GOW. GOW is a superb film which needs to be watched by anyone and everyone who has the slightest of respect and love for films and filmmaking.Sneha Khawalker's rockingtingly superb music brings a whole new level of excitement in the film and Rajeev Ravi's cinematography is very very efficient, sprinkled with quite a few shots of sheer brilliance.All this make a nice, superbly tasty biryani and the credit can only go the masterchef Mr.Anurag Kashyap.8/10, and I'd defo recommend all my friends to go and watch this film in CINEMAS!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting drama spanning decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most awaited movies of the year, the first part of Gangs of Wasseypur lives up to expectations. However, the only disappointing aspect of the movie is that one has to wait for the part two of the movie to see how the story unfolds. The movie is based at Wasseypur and other surrounding areas of Dhanbad. The time-line of the movie spans from early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie is expected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of Pathans Shahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local don Ramadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chronicle about Sinister fraternity of the Crime from the eyes of Anurag Kashyap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic tale about loyalty, crime, lust, treachery and vendetta. A cinematic magnum opus.Set in Dhanbaad's(Jharkhand)Village, called Wasseypur, "Gangs of Wasseypur" starts with our very own "Kyunki Saas bhi bahu thi" and goes beyond the cinematic ethics. A saga which has all the ingredients of a cult cinema like black humor, full mouthed characters, adultery, bullets,vengeance and everything you expect in a film by Anurag Kashyap.En route to end of British Raj in India, Shahid Khan, a dacoit, loots the British trains, masquerading as Sultana Daku, is shot dead by Ramadhir Singh's goon. Shahid's son, Sardar Khan, pledges to avenge his father's death and shaves his head. He becomes one of the most notorious gangsters of Wasseypur. The film reconnoiters his connections with power, politics and fraternity of crime. There is a clash between two Muslim groups Pathans and Qureshis, about their covetousness for glory and money.Manoj Bajpai gives an impeccable performance as a violent and lecherous man. It is one of the powerhouse acts, we will ever encounter. The real find of the decade is Tigmanshu Dhuila a well-known cult director (Hassil, Paan Singh Tomar, Saheb Biwi aur Gangster etc), who embodied the character as if he himself is Ramdhir Singh.Richa Chadda is believable as Sardar Khan's anxious and bold wife. Reema Sen is good as a silent and steamy concubine of Sardar Khan.Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a born thespian; he is believable as weed smoking, Amitabh's die-hard fan and black sheep of the family. We have already witnessed him in "Kahaani" and "Peepli live". I think he is one of the most underrated actors, has now got an opportunity to flaunt himself in GOW II(I saw the trailer of Part II after the credit rolled).Rest of the cast Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Huma Quershi(debut-She looks ravishing while persuading the theater's security guard for the second show of the movie "Trishul") and others are so authentic that you will easily relate the characters with North India (Bihar), the dialects, the dialogue delivery, the expressions are genuine.The music by Sneha Khanwalkar is down to earth, a triumph, it has the rustic soul and is very unique. One can understand the geniuses by listening the beats and lyrics. Some of them are folks sung by the locals.And after all it's Anurag Kashyap ,who can go to any length to enhance the quality of Indian Cinema. Undoubtedly it has been screened in Cannes,and people watched the entire saga (a delirious 5 Hours 20 Minutes run time) and lauded with the accolades. However, it should have been edited 20 minutes.Impatiently waiting for Part II.8.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Solitary Epic of Indian Cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Premiering at Cannes, this was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Maybe not for the Multiplex going, entertainment seeking audience but for people who actually care for gritty cinema. I, personally, have always been a fan of Anurag Kashyap, Manoj Bajpayee as well as Piyush Mishra. So, for me this movie was like cinematic heaven, before it even started.It is a story unfolding through generations in Wasseypur, Jharkhand(erstwhile Bihar). It starts with Sahid Khan( played brilliantly by Jaideep Ahlawat), who robs trains by the pseudonym of Sultana Daku which is in fact the pseudonym of another Dacoit that lives in the village. So, on one such attempt, the original Sultana Daku kills of Sahid Khan's gang and throws him out of Wasseypur. Thus starts the rivalry of the Khans and the Qureshis. Sahid Khan moves to Dhanbad where he leaves this life of robbery behind him and starts working in a field mine. During child birth, his wife dies while he was unable to reach her in time because he wasn't informed by the authorities. The son grows up over the years and India soon wins independence. With Independence, the British abandon the mines which are soon given to a Jamindar, Ramadhir Singh. He needs Pahalwans(bouncers) to run the mines and keep the workers in control, so he hires Sahid Khan. What Ramadhir Singh did not foresee was that Sahid Khan himself wanted the throne all for himself. When Ramadhir Singh finds out, he sends Sahid for a job at Banaras where Sahid Khan is assassinated. He also tries to kill Sahid's younger brother and son but they escape. The kid grows up to be Sardar Khan( Manoj Bajpayee) whose only aim in life is revenge against Ramadhir Singh, the guy who killed his father. "Goli Nahi Maarenge Usko, Keh Ke Lenge Uski".I won't say that if i continue with the story, it'll give the movie away but the thing is every twist and turn of the story, every little detail, Anurag Kashyap wants you to explore for yourself. There are so many characters and so many stories that it becomes more of an epic than a movies. With Piyush Mishra's narration, the movie unfolds smoothly as you will keep watching dumbstruck at the crime and the 'bakaiti'. The usage of slang is in abundance. Definitely, not a movie that you can watch with your family, or even girlfriend, for that matter. Brilliant performances, a brilliant script, and wonderful direction leaves you expecting for more. Waiting for the 2nd part eagerly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bollywood movies are generally based on fantasy and imagination. Where the audience is made familiar with the characters which he 'wishes' to be.Gangs Of Wasseypur Adopts a different Approach.It makes the Audience identify with reality and makes familiar with the characters that 'are' around him.Being from wasseypur in dhanbad i was super excited to watch the movie based on my locality. i had presumed the movie might be 'inspired' by the gang wars, but no movie is 90% the actual story of the town.The movie has penetrating dialogues, harsh naked truth characters and language. Manoj Bajpayee's acting was breath taking. the scenes are still vivid even after 2 days of watching the movie. His Chemistry with the character 'Durga' was awesome. 'sardar khan's interaction with ramadhir singh in the movie is very interesting. The movie was brilliant in first half. The only place where the movie could improve is that there are so many characters that a normal audience will be confused and may just lose the plot. One needs to watch the movie carefully.9/10 to the movie made about my locality. Wasseypur Zindabad!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Gangs of Wasseypur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-written and directed by Anurag Kashyap, this film will probably propel the filmmaker into the ranks occupied by the likes of Coppola and Scorsese in crafting Mafia styled epics, filled with the themes of brotherhood, revenge, betrayal, sex and violence. Showcased at this year's Cannes Directors' Fortnight with its sequel screened back to back, Kashyap has brought forth a sprawling, three generation span long tale of the titular Gangs of the coal mining town, where three crime families engage one another for infamy, riches and power supremacy.And what he had done to provide some gravitas to this tale, was a semi-documentary look at its background against the town of Wasseypur, where we witness how the wheelings and dealings between shady businessmen and their workers, and how some become politicians through bullying, gangster tactics, the laundering of money, and eventually buying support to ascend the political ladder. It's an intriguing commentary about, by extension, the country's state of affairs, and how some can grow influence through the use of hired muscles out to do their dirty work, for the duration of their useful lifespan, before being discarded.Beginning in explosive fashion with a full assault on a property, key figures get introduced, but only to keep things under wraps until the companion film in Part 2. We then get brought back to the 40s Wasseypur and Dhanbad land, where the British found themselves up against the formidable forces of the Qureshis , only for Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) to impersonate their mysterious leader, pre-empt their attacks and undercut the Qureshis in their own game. Soon the Khans got exiled, only for Shahid to be brought back to Wasseypur when Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), a rich, corrupt industrialist, needed a muscle man to help in his exploitation of workers. But jealously meant Ramandhir's orders to get rid of Shahid, and thus opening up the feud to the second generation, led by Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) who is hell bent on revenge.But in a tragi-comedy sort of way, the character of Sardar is somewhat tough on the outside with his ruthlessness, but all soft and fuzzy inside with his libido being lacking in control, with first wife Nagma (Richa Chadda) being relatively tolerant of his gallivanting ways only because she gets pregnant too easily, and the introduction of a Bengali girl Durga (Reema Sen) whom he met while on the run. This sets up the third generation of cast with Sardar's sons Danish (Vineet Singh) and Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), with a hint on what's to come disrupt his family dynamics with illegitimate son Definite, entering the picture, whom we'll see more of in the next film whose trailer gets airtime right after the end credits. On the other corner are the heir of the Qureshis in Ehsaan (Vipin Sharma) and Sultan (Pankaj Tripathy), who are caught in the middle with their alliance with Ramandhir, and the marriage of Sultan's sister Sharma (Amirota Jha). And what makes it interesting in the entire male dominated world, is the story of the women behind the men, as seen from the major character arcs on Sardar's family involved in romance of some sort, playing critical roles in defining the male characters and contrasting them in both their private and public lives, and instrumental especially in the final scene, and going into the next film.It might be overwhelming at first with a myriad of characters being introduced, but Kashyap got his presentation all under control like an old hand, bringing on new characters with proper title flashes, and providing adequate screen time for each to establish his or her backstory. This wonderfully crafts out motivations and characteristics of each family member, especially between the sons of Sardar, who will all play pivotal roles in the sequel, since the very first scene here would have shown each of them under different camps, and teasing us with just how allegiances would play out with family members now standing under different banners. Part of the engagement now would be to develop the narrative to reach the inevitable, and with the ensemble set up, the possibilities are endless.And as such, Gangs of Wasseypur has its fair share of surprises thrown about, where those slighted will almost always come back with a vengeance. Revenge may be high on Sardar's agenda, but there's a permeating poetic justice that provides a cruel twist of irony, with the narrative rich enough to allow various subplots to populate the story and to add a vivid texture to the characters instead of letting them become one dimensional characters. It's a sprawling epic that called upon the best of Bollywood sans the usual Masala formula, to showcase the skills, craftsmanship and talent in the industry that are capable of making a serious, critically acclaimed film with commercial appeal. Definitely highly recommended, although I'm reserving judgement until Part 2 when the film is complete. If you haven't watched an Indian film for some time already, if at all, then make Gangs of Wasseypur your launch point now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The India Gangster EPIC covering 70 years... Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur is a 2012 Hindi crime movie directed and co-written by Indian movie-maker Anurag Kashyap starring veteran Indian actor Manoj Bajpai in the lead role. The five hour long movie premiered at the Directors' Fortnight section?an independent section held in parallel to the Cannes Film Festival?at the 65th Cannes Film Festival. However, as far as the commercial release of Gangs of Wasseypur is concerned, the makers have decided to screen it in two parts of roughly 150 minutes each. Set in Wasseypur?the Muslim-majority district surrounding Jharkhand's (earlier a part of Bihar) coal capital, Dhanbad?Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur is a crime saga that revolves around the three-generation long sanguinary rivalry between two disputing Muslim clans: the 'Khans' and the 'Qureshis'. However, this bloody battle is not religious but strictly territorial in nature as the two clans indulge in incessant fights seeking carte blanche to run their respective crime syndicates in Wasseypur. It's worth mentioning that the events and circumstances depicted in Gangs of Wasseypur are fictionalized accounts of the real life events that occurred in the district of Wasseypur during the pre and post-independence India.Anurag Kashyap's crime saga, irrespective of its entertainment quotient, marks a new beginning in Indian Cinema. It is for this very reason that Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be an essential viewing for anyone whose purpose for indulging in Cinema is not limited to seeking entertainment. Amongst the new crop of Indian movie makers, Anurag Kashyap seems to have a definite edge to be the obvious choice to lead the Indian juggernaut in the global arena. Now, whether Kashyap lives up to the expectations is for the time to decide, but what can be safely said at this stage is that with Gangs of Wasseypur Kashyap has significantly bolstered his prospects as a moviemaker. Gangs of Wasseypur, Kashyap strives to strike the right balance between various cinematic elements that helps the movie touch the lows and highs of cinema, thereby helping it break the stereotype associated with quintessential Bollywood Cinema. Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed in Indian Cinema depicting shootouts, prison-breaks, brawls, bomb blasts, rallies, kidnappings, rapes, train-robberies, forced marriages, women in labor, lovemaking, killings, and butchery. One interesting facet that makes these scenes really effective is the level of realism and conviction with which they are carried forward in the movie. In Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap presents a grim picture of human decadence: Amongst the hundreds of masculine characters depicted in the movie, one doesn't get to witness a single likable character, for most of them come across as bestial beings desperate to serve their basic instincts of survival, physical love, wealth and power. On the other hand, the women are portrayed as secondary beings who are looked upon by men as materialistic pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits. Manoj Bajpai delivers a tour de force in Gangs of Wasseypur. His portrayal of Sardar Khan ranks right up there with the very best performances in the history of Indian Cinema. Sardar is ferocious killer as well as a voracious lover whose feral instincts to kill (his adversaries) are remarkably matched by his play boyish passion to for physical love. The rest of the cast gives memorable performances that help bring characters to life with a special mention of Nawazuddin Siddiqui whose underplayed cameo as Sardar Khan's younger son offered a great contrast to Manoj Bajpai's over the top portrayal. Siddiqui is expected have a major role in the second part of Gangs of Wasseypur considering the similarities of his part to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Whether Siddiqui will succeed in carving a niche for himself as Pacino had managed with his portrayal in The Godfather I &amp; II is for the time to decide. The Cinematography of Gangs of Wasseypur is at par with the best in the world. Kashyap's sense of timing with the use of music is also exemplary. Kashyap expertly introduces occasional bursts of music and comedy to punctuate the slowly augmenting tension tension at different junctures in the movie. Kashyap's use of dark humor to judiciously propagate violence has an uncanny similarity to Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking. His choice of music in the movie's final sequence that depicts the brutal killing of one of movie's major characters ? la 'Sonny Corleone' assassination in The Godfather is bizarre yet remarkably effective.Overall, Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a unique cinematic experience that's not free of its flaws. However, despite its apparent flaws, Gangs of Wasseypur has enough to offer to a keen movie-viewer who would not allow him/her to be overwhelmed by movie's abundance of everything. Gangs of Wasseypur serves be a sanguinary carnival of epic proportions that's surely not meant for the faint-hearted. The movie is an essential viewing for the lovers of Indian cinema, for they will get to see something really refreshing in Gangs of Wasseypur, and also for those who want to get acquainted with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant...just brilliant. An exhilarating movie experience which demands to be seen only on big screen for its rustic visuals which takes you straight into raw and rugged heartland. Very very entertaining as well and humor keeps you to the edge of the seat throughout. At times it reminded me of Sholay on epic, comedy and entertainment level.Though not for people with faint-heart, GOW bleeds excellence in almost every frame and every scene. An epic and brutal saga spanning over decades and generations. Its epic, visceral and poetic all at the same time.Watching GOW on big screen wasn't just watching a movie but an experience. An experience which also proves Anurag Kashyag as the face of new age Indian cinema after GOW, Black Friday, Dev-d. And how can I forget the brilliant No Smoking which was quite David Lynchish. Manoj Bajpayee is impeccable and irreplaceable in his career best performance.Music is fantastic and specially how well the music have been utilized is another USP of the movie. For example the beautiful "Ik bagal mein chand hoga..ik bagal me rotiya" from Piyush Mishra. Suddenly the mood and visual of the film changes. The song reminds you of some 50-60's lullaby and how poetically it has been shot reminds you of Bimol Roy's classic "Do Beegha Zameen". So many references of the era gone by...from those colorful posters to Bachchan era..to the era of violence and lawlessness of such places..at times it feels like poetry in motion.Just magnificent...Indian cinema at its best!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The good thing for the film was its screening in two parts. It's not that you will not like the film for 5 hours but there are a few moments when you might feel bored. Now about the film I would say that this is the only film that I can remember now, the characters of which you would bond so much. Making such a long film is a great risk and that was worth it. The story is purely based on revenge. What these 5 hours has made us feel in the end was that the revenge was truly authentic. You will bond entirely with all that hatred. Of Course we have to pick up a side with whom we sympathize. The shaking feeling was when Ramadheer singh told Faisal that the whole fighting had started due to his grandfather and he wanted to live, otherwise his grandfather might have killed him. This was the moment when I realized that he was not at all wrong in his place of thinking. But then I also realized the power of films. The director wanted us to have sympathy with the family of Manoj Vajpayee. That is one angle of showing the film. There can be a story made from the point of Ramadheer where we will sympathize with him.While watching the film I felt like I am revisiting a lot of films. There were a lot of instances when one can feel that he is watching the Indian version of godfather. Now the way this film is made defines what inspiration is. I also felt in the last 30 minutes like I was watching instances of City of God. Anurag Kashyap has properly set a standard for the Indian Directors about how to take inspiration from foreign films. When the audience sees that the starting scenes and the characters which were shown so early are linked in the end, they are hooked to the seats. They might feel amazed at that instant (also considering the fact that all these important twists and links are shown in the last 20 minutes of the film) and say that the film is amazing after leaving theater. While this is obvious for the Indian Audience who is deprived of such stories since they are used to watch senseless themes of Cocktail and many others. So, I would not say that the story or anything is so amazing, but this is what the audience of India need to start with. There is a lot more potential in filmmaking and I have no doubt that Anurag Kashyap too has that power to make films like the seventh seal. But he is bound by the mindset of our audience. I believe that he is taking his viewer's through a carefully chosen path to make them mature enough to understand films of Ingmar Bergman or Stanley Kubrick.PROS:The film has a good story along with good performances which is the first reason to watch the film. To keep the viewer engaged, the film has a lot of twists till the end. I would not consider this film in the black comedy genre but it definitely has so many instances when you will praise the director for his witticism. Coming over to the songs, I felt that the soundtrack was better in the second part. The best humoristic moment in the film was when the two goons were catching each other and their bikes went out of petrol. That moment was too hilarious. Both are standing in the queue to fill the tank. There are many instances like this which gives you authentic feel of India. The second part bagged good songs as well. The portrayal of the ladies in the family was awesome. The way that the film involved us in their daily household activities was something not usual in Indian Films. Coming to the characters, I got attached with Nawajuddin Shiddiki much more than Manoj Vajpayee. His portrayal was very close to that of Al Pacino in Godfather. All the supporting cast performed extremely well.In all, rarely in Indian cinema has this type of film been made especially with so much characters and their development.MESSAGE: "!!Revenge!!"VERDICT: "A must watch"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shock Therapy Masala -- Reservoir DOGISTAN pushes the Bollywood envelope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GANGS OF WASSEYPUR, Part 1The flagship Indian feature seen this year at the Florence Indian film festival, "The Gangs of Wasseypur" is a Bollywood production in the sense that it was made in Hindi (rather than one of India's other 21 official languages) with professional Bombay performers and staff, but the content, style, and conception of this new opus seems to be pointing the Bombay film industry in a new direction. Wasseypur director, Anurag Kashyap, 40, is no newcomer to tinseltown having already helmed half a dozen features there since 2000 and acted as producer or writer on many more. Among his works until now are "Black Friday", 2007, which addresses the terrorist bombings in Bombay of 1993, "Dev D", 2009, a modern reworking of a semi-sacrosanct Indian screen classic, and "The Girl in Yellow Boots" 2011, which dissects the misadventures of a girl in the Mumbai sex massage trade, all hardball films of controversial content, one way or another. He also worked on the script of Ram Gopa Varma's unflinching study of the Mumbai underworld, "Satya" in 1998, which was deemed an Indian neo-film noir and is a kind of prequel to the current rural gangland saga. With "Gangs of Wasseypur" Anurag has pushed the Bollywood envelope about as far as it will go ...Wasseypur is a small town in the Dhanbad district of the god-forsaken state of Jharkhand, also known as the Coal Capital of India, and has been described as the most violent, lawless, and fearsome place in the entire land because of the endless gang warfare going on there for over half a century. The names of real life rival dons Sabir Alam and Fahim Khan, the actual warlords of two rival mafia clans, are indelibly associated with Wasseypur where the film is set, however, while the movie characters called 'Sardar Khan' and 'Ramadhir Singh' are theoretically fictional, it is pretty danged clear that any similarity to actual persons living and dead is far from coincidental. Anurag Kashyap, who has roots in Jharkhand knows the scene there only too well and is obviously not interested in glamorizing it or gilding any lilies. He wants people to wake up to reality, to put it mildly. .Gangs is a big hit all over India but, according to The Times of India, the initial showing in Wasseyput itself was called off for fear of violence.The direction Anurag explores in Wasseypur is a total departure from normal escapist Bollywood masala into the territory of stark black realism --"Reservoir Dogistan" -- to borrow a page from the Cineblitz fan magazine satire of the picture. The Anurag analog of Tarantino's slicing off of an ear is the carving off an entire head from the body of a still squirming victim as fountains of rich red blood spurt up gloriously in a beautifully backlit set -- very cinematic if this kind of bloodletting is your cup of tea. It obviously was at Cannes where Gangs was declared a masterpiece, and maybe it is --but not for the faint of heart or the mushy sentimental Yashraj crowd. The language of the film is incidentally not exactly Hindi, but a regional variety known as Bhojpuri, which is actually Anurag's native tongue, and part of the reason that attracted him to this gory tale from the gritty Islamic coal pit belt of Jharkand province. The fact that most of the protagonists are Indian Moslems is more or less incidental, just one of the facts of life in this grisly manifresco -- Assalamu Aleikum.Another feature of this film is the utter obscenity of the language employed by the characters. The general flavor is conveyed by constant use of "motherfucker, asshole", and variations on these themes in the English subtitles, but the director assured me that much is lost in translation and that the original dialogues are far more varied and graphic -- which is apparently an important selling point in terms of shock therapy and linguistic titillation for the Indian public. A kind of documentary effect is created by the insertion of frequent dateline intertidal to help viewers keep track of events and set them up for the next assault on the senses. Actually these titles are necessary simply to keep track of who does what to whom, when and where, in this densely populated film where people keep getting knocked off every other minute and are almost interchangeable with the next corpse. Pehaps the whole thing is best summed up when one character says "In Wasseyput even the pigeons fly with one wing because they need the other one to protect their ass". Lots of catchy dialogues of this kind have made Gangs into an instant cult classic.There is also a lot of sex in the film but this is not a sexy picture. The main guy of Part I, Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai, the only previously well known actor in the cast) is an insatiable satyr and will screw anything that moves, merely to get his rocks off without the slightest trace of anything but rage. But don't worry -- he gets pumped full of hot lead at the Intermission (end of Part 1) with a bloody shot to the head to top it all off. An emerging new star, Nawaz Siddiqui (the relentlessly pot puffing son Faizal Khan), takes over in Part II and smokes more hash than the cocaine consumed by Al Pacino in Scarface '83 -- in fact, in terms of graphic violence and substance abuse these films are distant cousins. Or one might think, Sergio Leone with a twist of the knife in the gut and countless shots to the head. Well, the French have a name for it --"danse macabre". A film not to miss, but make sure to check heart and mind at the door and abandon all hope Ye about to pass through the portals of your local Wasseypur show.</fullReview>

The beauty of this magnum opus lies in its sheer brilliance in acting deptt &amp; the mammoth courage of Mr. Kashyap to envisage &amp; put it in screen for us.

		<shortDescription>160-odd minutes of sheer cinematic brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was first alerted of this movie by the sheer waves it was making in the Cannes Film Festival, and for the very obvious reason that it featured the hugely talented maverick director, Anurag Kashyap who had already carved a niche for himself by virtue of his brilliant direction in many unconventional, "art" films. The other reason was that one of my favourite actors, Manoj Bajpayee(one of those rare Indian actors who actually understand the meaning of acting), the genius who lived through his characters in films like Satya, Raajneeti, and 1971. Apart from these factors, what attracted me to the film was its gigantic ensemble cast(Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Tigmanshu Dhulia).I went to the theatre to catch part 1 without knowing what to expect, given Kashyap's penchant to making excellent films whose heady content are marked by ambiguous overtones; you never can really interpret any of Kashyap's films in one way!Ditto for Gangs of Wasseypur as well. I will not dwell on the plot, you will have to see the movie yourselves. What I will dwell on is the cinema itself. Firstly, to say that it is a violent movie is an understatement: there isn't just violence, you have men being butchered, gore splattered mercilessly. Hell, you even see a 10-second footage of blood on a floor(with a newspaper crumpled next to it, soaked in blood, just like how the policemen clean all the gore in crime scenes). Gunfire splits your eardrums, and believe me, it's a true-to-life sight.The movie begins with a rival gang blowing up a man's house with machine guns and makeshift bombs. The way Kashyap positions his camera and randomly puts in close-up shots of the machine guns followed by an overhead shot of the men firing at the doors of the house reminded me of those stalwarts of slickly violent films, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino. Kashyap's direction is not fast-paced by any means, it is indulgent, it is leisurely-paced and that gives enough room for character development, which is where Kashyap scores, big time. The citizens of Wasseypur are all fleshed out realistically, and the protagonist, a lecher who dreams of revenge and power is too true.Next up is the performances of the case which is nothing short of phenomenal. Manoj Bajpayee...well, well, not for once did I think that his Bhiku Mhatre would be overshadowed by any other character, but as Sardar Khan, the sadistic, scary and scheming Mafia lord and a lecher to boot, Bajpayee delivers a performance that is worthy of a National Award. Riccha Chaddha as Nagma Khatoon, Sardar's poor wife who has to put up with his frequent extra-marital affairs, is a veritable brimstone who spews abuses and threatens policemen with a sickle&gt; She is arguably the find amongst new actresses in the Hindi film industry. However, the biggest surprise is the performance of Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadhir Singh. With restrained emotions and an intense body-language, Dhulia delivers a tour-de-force.What separates this film from the rest of the bullsh*t that the so-called "Bollywood" industry spews out, is its subtlety, a device that Kashyap uses to great effect. The scene where Sardar's uncle realizes Ramadhir Singh's plot of killing Shahid Khan(Sardar's father) by recognizing Singh's umbrella, is very effective, because it doesn't shove over-emphasis up your nose. Apart from that, the performances of the case, are not over-the-top, nor are they too wooden. They portray their characters realistically, and underplay them brilliantly, unlike some Srk's some Sallu's and some "Big B's" who don't even understand the meaning of the word subtlety. Bajpayee controls his problem of occasional hamming by restraining his emotions perfectly. Kashyap helps, too, with some tight screenplay, not allowing any character to wallow in their grief and breaking out into songs. Overall, 'Gangs...'is one of those movies that you have to watch, simply because it can easily lay claim with being one of the best movie in gangster genre along with City of God, Godfather trilogy, and Nayagan.PS: Watch the last scene of the movie, you will be astonished with Kashyap's black comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A raw,real revenge drama with epic dimensions by genius Kahsyap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In India the film will be released in two parts.Here I am reviewing the first part of the epic.With Smriti Irani gleefully welcoming the whole nation to Tulsi's family of "Kyun ki saans bhi kabhi bahu thi"(famous Indian soap opera),the family setting is disrupted by a series of bang-bang thus setting the mood for a raw violent epic tale of deceit and revenge.Welcome to Anurag Kashyap's take on the violent gang-war of coal mafia in Bihar,the movie is one of rare docu-fiction made in India that has the signature mark of Kashyap?arguably the best Indian film maker of current generation.The movie runs for a span of six decades telling us the evolution of coal mafia to its pinnacle of violence. With Sahid Khan impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku starts looting the trains just prior to the Indian independence. With Shahid Khan being thrown away from the village in Dhanbad he started working in a coal mine from where the game of rivalry took its first step as Shahid Khan was betrayed and killed by Ramadhir Singh's henchmen and later on Shahid's son Sardar vowed to take revenge. The basic premise is simple about the age-old tale of son avenging the death of his father and how it all gets engulfed into a family rivalry with lies, treacheries and betrayals. The executions seem to be homage to Tarantino as the tale moves forward with its blood soaked screenplay.There is intelligent use of wit and one-liners which helps in building the proceedings. Rarely have we seen humor revolving around slaughtered bodies and body parts in desi films. As the movie spans over decades there is key eye for detailing which are reflected in every sequences. The usage of black and white footages increases the credibility of the docu-drama. Like Kashyap's previous films this also deals with the dark psychology of human. This time he chooses to unmask the violent reality ruling in the heart land of our country and ropes in enough humor to unleash the stark reality. For people of Wasseypur killing is like having lunch and that disturbing essence has been beautifully captured. The violent existence had injected hatred in the nerves of each individual. Syed Qadri should be applauded for having the courage to write the story. Being hailed from Wasseypur he even got life threatening calls for the story. Technically GOW is one of the best films of recent times and indeed shows reflection for the praises that are shown in various film festivals. Direction from Kashyap is unquestionably top-notch. Rajeev Ravi's camera makes the proceeding more real. Shot in real locations the camera and colors hops between reality and fiction playing with various colors. Sneha Khanwalkar's music is one of the real heroes of the film. Whenever the scenes were tending to get a little repetitive the music saves the scene. Sneha's music reflected the particular era. While "Ik Bagal" hits the right notes for 40s, "Hunter" is a effective modern day rendition of imagination of a person who is at "high".Without giving any spoilers I would say the sequence of "Jiya ho Bihar ke lala" and the way it has been shot in itself becomes a learning lesson for many budding film makers. Also without glorifying violence Kashyap seamlessly merges blood into the narrative and not for a single moment it looked gory.There is no space for melodrama or pseudo-morality. In fact he can give a lesson to mainstream film makers of effective use of action in a realistic yet entertaining fashion. I couldn't think of anyone except Manoj Bajpayee as Sardar Khan who has revenge in his mind but his weakness for female body costs him dearly. Richa Chadda as Nagma Khatoon excels in every scene.The rebellious wife of Sardar is probably the best written character in this film. Nagma is sensitive yet ferocious who has a clear thought process and her character symbolizes freedom otherwise absent in wives of male-dominated India.Tigmanshu Dhulia as Ramadheer Singh patronizes evil and he is a treat to watch.A superb director himself he showed that he is equally brilliant in front of the camera as well. After being part of several films Pankaj Tripathy really gets his due in a meaty role and he proved himself as Sultan Qureshi. The anger oozes out from his personality thus shaping the character.Piyush Mishra is as always effective and dependable.He speaks with his eyes and their lies the talent of the veteran.His lyrics here are as strong as the ones in Gulaal. . Reema Sen effective as Durga. Nawazuddin Siddiqui excels as Faizal Khan the younger and the rebellious son of Sardar Khan.He is there only in the last hour of the first part but one could gauge that he will dominate the second installment.His fianc' dbutant Huma Qureshi is gorgeous and spontaneous. Jaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan is superlative. He simply had the necessary energy to spark the proceedings in the initial hours.He steals the scene where his wife is about to deliver her child and yet he is caged in a coal mine following which he fights back with his master.It symbolizes the life we are leading at present when we are buried under burden of material existence and can't stand behind our beloved even in harsh times.There are many such sequences which work as metaphors to the degradation of the standard of life.Overall GOW-I is a epic masterpiece. Kashyap dares to go beyond the conventional means while telling an off-repeated story of revenge.In fact this film is a case study for film makers who can learn the art and use it to make something unconventional yet entertaining.As a film lover I am eagerly waiting for GOWII.P.S:The trailer of GOWII sets the mood with characters like Perpendicular,Definite,Tangent.The film looks to be more quirky than the first installment.One of the characters,a lean structure shown chewing a blade with an assassin look seem straight out of Tarantino films and my expectation increases manifold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A class apart !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would suffice to say that Gangs of Wasseypur is a film which is in a class of its own by such a far distance from its peers from the same house, that, by the sheer fact of its existence, it manages to add a chapter to the history of that very house.However, as someone from that very land, it is difficult to stop here without rambling a bit about its beauty and force. The place of Gangs of Wasseypur and its impact on Indian cinema and filmmaking in India can only be judged fairly as time passes. However, in its content and style, Gangs of Wasseypur seems to have been cut from an entirely different cloth, of a class much superior.Gangs of Wasseypur was released theatrically in two parts. But, for all purposes, it may be considered a single film, despite the somewhat different flow of the two parts. Delving deep into the plot (which is by no means drab) isn't of much use as Gangs of Wasseypur is not about the plot, it is about the treatment. Gangs of Wasseypur is not nearly as much about the story as the storytelling. A revenge saga with political, criminal and romantic themes intertwining ? the tale is gripping. But what raises Gangs of Wasseypur into the level of extraordinary is the glaring realism, brought to life by powerful performances and crisp presentation. Anurag Kashyap's talent has been on display before, but perhaps never as grandly as here. He tells the story of the lives of his commonplace protagonists in an unusual place and circumstances and is aided by an excellent soundtrack, which draws upon an array of sources and styles. Sneha Khanwalkar's soundtrack is an overflow of both creativity and hard work, and both show aplenty in the excellent output that bursts forth.Veterans like Manoj Bajpayee and Piyush Mishra are classy as expected, but the performances from relative unknowns are the icing on the cake. A special mention must be made of Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The emergence of Nawazuddin in a lead role in a mainstream film is in itself a remarkable fact in the annals of "Bollywood", for reasons unnecessary to explain. His screen presence, dialogue delivery and expressions are phenomenal and encourages in one the audacity of hoping ? hoping for many more of such powerhouse performances in the years to come.The character building is magnificent, which lets one flow with the story without any jarring effects. The second part does tend to overflow with the number of characters at times, but the distinct flavour of each new element and the twists introduced thereby make it worth the trouble of tracking the complex plot.The only adverse criticism which can be made about Gangs of Wasseypur is that certain themes and parts of the film are 'inspired' by legendary mafia Classics though it must be said in the same breath that the 'adaptations' have been made with great skill and care, rendering the story a life and charm distinctly of its own. Gangs of Wasseypur's relationship with the Hindi film industry is multi-layered. On one level, it awes some of Gangs of Wasseypur's major protagonists. On another level, it is mocked. And therein lies the ultimate accomplishment of this great film. Just as evolution is about improving upon and refining what you inherited to leave behind something superior, Gangs of Wasseypur evolves from the land of Bollywood which it is born into and goes one, or maybe two, steps further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur: Crude, Violent and Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap's ambitious Epic Gangs of Wasseypur is a lethally long and detailed view of the life of a single gangster family and not gangs exactly. Spread across 7 decades and over three generations it tells an authentically made and wickedly enjoyable romp of violence, politics, power and sex.The film begins in the early 40s with the genesis of the gangs getting formed between the Muslim communities of the Qureshis (Butcher clan) and the Pathans. Trying to take advantage of this divide is the local contractor of coal mines Ramadheer Singh (director Tingmanshu Dhulia).As the film progresses, the three groups transition from one criminal activity to another and keep slowly increasing their enmity siding with one another. The Coal mafia point is lost midway and the criminal activities start ranging from human trafficking to even fisheries extortion. What strikes from the word go is the sheer realism of the ganglands of Bihar from nearly perfect performances of the very believable Bihar characters, to the dress sense punctuated by what is an almost unheard of in your face soundtrack made up of local Bihari hits mixed in modern sounds, this is Anurag's best in terms of art direction (maybe only bettered by his far superior Black Friday) There is so much going on in the movie that at times it's hard to enjoy all of it. The sexually crude songs playing constantly in the back ground, the numerous acts of violence (at times hard to connect) or for that matter the out and out vulgar dialogues spouted by pretty much all the characters of the film.However there is one major drawback which makes the film's narration slightly uneven and over dependent on a poorly placed cricket-like commentary to bridge the gaps. For example not much is shown or discussed of how the coal mafia operated other than the commentary and thus we get only glimpses of how the other two gangs, The Qureshi's Butcher Gang (led by Sultan) and Ramadheer Singh's sophisticated political gang, are evolving. Instead, the script chooses to spend almost incessant time on the family and life of the alpha male Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) including his long drawn out romance with the Bengali immigrant Durga (a very hot Reema Sen) Sardar Khan's Feisty wife Nagma (played perfectly by Richa Chaddha) ends up having more screen space than the main antagonist Ramadheer Singh (who could have been a tour de force). In the end Ramadheer Singh comes across more as a weakling against a thug like Sardar Khan. A little hard to believe considering he's been a landlord for a long time and is a politician to boot. I guess with the film being made by Anurag Kashyap, a lot of folks will tell you that this is an awesome film which could hype-kill the movie. It is undoubtedly a masterstroke in terms of gritty depiction of the ganglands but it could easily have been a lot crisper and stayed a little true to its title.You could also give a benefit of a doubt to the script considering there is the still to be released second part which requires the side characters to take centre stage and hence so much time spent on their development.Of course, the 3 hour long film picks up in the last thirty minutes when the third generation begins to come into the fore in a godfatheresque fashion and the film ends with a perfect act of violence you would have expected a long time back. The second part of the film will be released in a couple of weeks and rest assured that those who have seen the first part will flock to see how this saga ends in what should be a definite cracker. To sum it up, don't go in expecting a master piece and you will thoroughly enjoy and even love the film. Special Mention: Try listening carefully to the songs playing in the background esp. Womaniya and Hunter ? tunes which refuse to leave your head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Wasseypur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a great movie buff, one of the greatest around. A great proclivity for cinema I have got. I have been a sincere fan of Martin Scorsese's works, all of them. I believe that a great director can put all the elements of greatness in a movie and make it reach the epitome of cinema. He can set fire to water if there is a natural demand for it. Not the actors, but the directors have always given cinema a turnaround whenever required.Now, this guy - Anurag Kashyap, is heavily influenced by Scorsese, and may be some other directors too. Being influenced and then delivering beyond imagination is a gargantuan task, only few blessed people can do. The film style and techniques which he carries with himself are rare, almost rare in the Bollywood where some quacks in the name of cinema produce utter rubbish stuffs and beguile the audience of real dimensions of cinema. Let's quickly talk about the movie. Every dimension of cinema has been given full respect. Everyone's performance is quite commendable. The cinematography is simply amazing. The dialogues are such a bliss to any Bihari ears. Thanks to the God, I have got a pair. A great music to spice up the situations. You know, the music will remind you of Kill Bill. Music has been Tarantino's one of the greatest weapons. Tarantino has also influenced Kashyap. The direction of the movie- let's not talk about that. I have talked a lot already about the director.One thing I want to mention particularly. Many directors tried to get into gang-wars, mafia and other stories involving Bihar and U.P. But the level to which this movie takes you has never been achieved earlier. I was just flabbergasted. How could the director boil down to such intricacies? That's the job of a genius, ain't it? There were few things I did not like about the movie. The movie needed a little bit more work on editing. The narrator should have been a better one. A powerful voice was what I thought lacked. Also if the movie were little bit peaceful in the first half, it would have been a legend. Remember Taxi Driver. That calmness and that peace. And one thing particularly- it should have been released in one piece despite of any length it had got. But bad things come in twos and here is Bollywood's baddie my friend.Do not listen to what one says. Just go for it. It will satisfy the voracious you. A perfect roller-coaster ride. And those who follow the quacks I mentioned - please avoid this movie. We do not want such slumps despising something heavenly.P.S.- Do not watch this movie with your girl otherwise you will end up answering the one and only question throughout the movie. "What does that mean"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kashyap Brothers are the new Dabangg of Bollywood. This movie will win the Oscar in best foreign language film. This movie will be in the nominations this year. This is bigger and a lot better than Sholay. You can just play the dialogues and enjoy the movie. I have seen this 3 times and want to see it several times by now. As many times I see it I just feel Real and nothing Reel. Its so interesting. As many times I see it I feel that I have seen this character somewhere, I have met these people somewhere. The characters are just &gt; Naam ke Musalman aur Fitrat se Insaan. None of the characters are good at all, they are all bad. But they are giving some core and basic truth about humans and their strength from wherever they do belong (U.P., Bihar, etc.) they are not less than anyone, and they are too connected to the soil.A lot better than Kahani, Ishqiya, Satya, Peepli Live, or any other this genre of movie. If you can portray so much reality in a movie, then the movie maker is really outstanding. Reality in looks, in language, in expressions, in problems and their solutions. Reality can be more felt when someone is really from these regions of the world. The kind of tension and awkwardness that is shown can be generally felt in these regions."Chaabi Kahan Hai ? Gaand Mein Dali Hai Kya Chaabi, Sala Sab." Khee Khee-Khee .. Hee-HeeMost importantly I liked the posters of the film. They are like I am seeing the covers of 80s and 90s Comics, Manoj Comics, Tulsi Comics etc.I am waiting for the sequel. "Jia ho Bihar Ke Lala, Jiya Tu Hazar Sala. Tani Naachi Ke, ..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie is a legend in a Hindi cinema ever and will be... The movie starts with a bang and carries the charm throughout. The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie.Siddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good.Apart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kashyap's magnum opus is effortlessly watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gangs of Wasseypur," Anurag Kashyap's five-hour epic, is one of those films that has the potential to be in the league of Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in America" but falls just short of true greatness. A film reminiscent of Leone's 1984 masterpiece, it spins a fictitious tale of revenge that spans through five decades of the mafia in the town of Wasseypur.The film opens in the 1940s, where Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), a worker in the coal mines of Ramadhir Singh (Timangshu Dhulia), is shot to death by his boss when Singh overhears him telling his son of his ambition to take over the coal mines. His son, Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), grows up harboring a deep sense of hatred to Singh and decides to avenge the death of his father. Along with his protgs Nasir (Piyush Mishra) and Asghar (Jameel Khan), he slowly begins to take over Wasseypur by first taking over the petrol pumps and selling petrol and then moving on to the coal mines of Singh. Singh, who by now is well aware who Sardar Khan is and what his intentions are, employs Sultan (Pankaj Tripathi) to eliminate Sardar Khan and slow him down. Danish (Vineet Singh), Sardar's first son, gets injured in the first attempt to eliminate Sardar. This compels Sardar to publicly insult and shame Singh. On the second attempt though, Sardar Khan gets gravely injured and eventually dies, thus making way for a blood-letting spree to grip Wasseypur. The second part focuses on the rise of Faisal Khan and his eventual redemption after the death of his elder brother.The first part of this crime saga is funny and frustrating at the same time. The second part is a lot better than the first one although it shares a common theme of vengeance and bloodshed. Kashyap's portrayal of Wasseypur is that of a town where blood spills at every corner and bullets are fired at the slightest provocation. The opening sequence, masterfully directed, is a miniature of the whole movie. Most of the first half is an introduction to the town of Wasseypur and what started the greed and ambitions of its wily local gangsters. Most of the setting, including the clothing and the lingo, remains faithful to the rural areas of the state. The screenplay is imaginative and the dialog is colorful, superbly capturing the small-town lingo with the easy humor and the heavy dose of expletives during conversations. Rajeev Ravi's loyal camera snags the breathless action at just the right time and the film is a visual treat with the exquisitely shot lanes and landscapes of the town, thereby creating a world within a world with apparent ease. Kashyap directs superbly, with a continuously moving camera, he laces the film's most violent sequences with unexpected humor, which greatly helps in building the required amount of suspense. Of the performances, Bajpai, who gave us one of the great elemental performances in the history of Indian cinema in Ram Gopal Varma's 1998 gem "Satya," is sensational in the role of Sardar Khan. He portrays Sardar as an overgrown child with a cool swagger who fears his wife although he's the most powerful chap in Wasseypur. He may have already snagged a few nominations for his performance. Siddiqui, who is nothing short of terrific, plays his youngest son in perhaps the best performance of the year. The character of Faisal is immensely complex but Siddiqui plays it easily, nailing the rapid, witty conversations with his love interest Mohsina, played by Huma Qureshi, and the calm and arrogant conversations with his detractors. He's a live-wire."Gangs of Wasseypur," though terrific, is a deeply flawed film. The runtime, which exceeds 320 minutes, could've been cut short drastically, which would've eventually resulted into the film being some kind of a masterpiece. Kashyap tackles each sub-plot with the dedication a filmmaker usually gives to the main plot, which makes the film look like a number of short films strung together using a common theme of vengeance. A considerable amount of screen time is given to the romantic sub-plots which temporarily leaves the main plot cowering for screen space. Also, the film later splits at the seam because the number of characters it employs is too many. I lost track of how some of the characters is related either to the protagonist or the antagonist. The web of guesswork is a tad easier in the second part because the film examines the relations between the main characters unlike the first part in which most of the characters and situations were introduced."Gangs of Wasseypur" works mostly, partly because it employs a stellar cast and partly because the makers are well aware of their ambitions though they let the plot take shape at its own pace. I'll go out on a limb and say that the first half of the second part is one of the best 90 minutes I've seen in recent gangster flicks. The biggest issue I have with this film is that it contains too many stories which it tries to tell all at once and though some clobber you with their ingenuity, the others fall flat. The film does tend to get a bit exhausting when it reaches its climax, but overall, it's one effort that has caught our attention completely. And for that one reason, I would recommend this film to anyone who relishes the new phase of the old-fashioned Indian gangster films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as many movies are being made in Bollywood these days that provides a good entertainment, Kashyap has given a good hit on the nail with his movie, Gangs of Wasseypur 2 to move the nails even deeper into a wood of mafia story.The GOW 2 smoothly begins reminding the audience about a squeal start, quickly hooks the viewer to await for the next revenge killing in the movie.The actors are well placed in their characters and handled well by Kashyap till each of them start to blossom to their purpose of remaining alive in the scenes. As any Bollywood movie would have to provide a ting of romance to pacify the Indian audience, love is well played with subtle blossom in a rough ride.All Bollywood mafia story based movies try to use good swearing language in its dialogs. This one is equally good in dialogs to keep the audience hooked further to each scene. There is no scene that is boring or would want the audience to to seek an extra break.Overall a good movie with a well crafted soundtrack , detailed direction and screen play that aligns well. A good bloody entertainer,If you want something more than a usual Bollywood duet and love feud!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review of any movie.The Gang of Wasseypur movie is very well written and directed. Manoj Bajpai(Sardar Khan) acting is brilliant. This is a story of two Muslim communities i.e. Qureshi and Khan. After partition (separation of Pakistan and India), a coal mine was purchased by a Indian businessman named Tigmanshu Dhulia(Ramadhir Singh) from British Government. Ramadhir Singh hired a hit man to take care of his coal mine workers. Ramadhir Singh is a political person, he used different people to keep his influence in the Wasseypur village and he didn't mind to take someone's life, if he goes against him.I read somewhere in the previous review that the director Anurag Kashyap is the answer of Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino. I agreed with the person. Some scenes in this movie remembered me Quentin Tarantino's action flick Kill Bill.The Muslim events and festivals i.e. Eid, Marriages etc. are very well shown on the big screen.I rate this movie 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dance of rawness, cruelty and rustic yet engaging ruthlessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part 1: 8.5/10The last scene perhaps defines the entire movie as "an unapologetic dance of rawness, cruelty and rustic ruthlessness"! Bullet ridden body of this character drenched in his own blood, gets up to the tunes (of Bihari pride) of 'Jiya ho Bihar ke lala' flashing a gun in his barely movable fingers. Anurag Kashayap makes a statement by having a dropped pistol being fired as a cycle rickshaw runs over its trigger! The streets of Wasseypur are violent, dark and haunting but blame (or don't!) the director, you start to like it after a while.Tracking a history of revenge and animosity, this drama is hilarious also (and really hilarious!) at appropriate intervals.Manoj Bajpayee lives another life through this movie and probably the best of what he has ever done before! It won't be surprising if the first word you speak as you walk out of the theater is of Bhojpuri!Part 2: 6.5/10Nawazuddin Siddiqui is highly impressive as Faijal and so are other characters who act like they have always been living those lives. Commendable performances and detailing! But....one misses a legendary character like Sardar Khan. You are getting introduced to a new character every 10 mins and one feels like saying 'why another character!' While GoW1 was a fresh thought and was gripping GoW 2 is repetitive. People already know that one by one they are going to die in a predictable sequence, if not now then surely in the next scene. Suspense and surprises are missing. Violent comedy of errors does not amuse anymore and inserted humour is suddenly stale. It is safe to watch GoW1 and assume that in GoW 2 Sardar Khan's sons will take his revenge in same gruesome violent ways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Saga of Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violence and revenge are weak words when compared to Gangs of Wasseypur. Wasseypur is a part of current town, Dhanbad in Bihar where this saga of revenge unfolds through the generations. Anurag Kashyap has done research on smallest narration and made this epic closest to reality Bollywood has ever made. The story is loosely based on real incidents but if you consider the flow of events, the way it unfolds, it is bound to become a cult. The silver screen cannot be real than this. Anurag Kashyap After DevD, Gulal and Black Friday has done all the peers proud by GoW. The ensemble cast and its choice was the key to success of this movie. Even the not so important casts were detailed much. The bang was so stereophonic it could give one hell of goosebumps. Movie starts with crimson burned train robberies and run out of wasseypur. Jaideep Ahlawat's coal fight was one of the best directed fist-fight, while Pitush Misha self punishment was something unheard of. The Birth of Protagonist Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee) , still hard to digest. Where the mother dies due to heavy bleeding but the father is informed about a beautiful son she gave before loosing herself on life. Soon the Muslim Mahabharat was set to pace not limping through the ages but was galloped by a nice and crisp narration by Mishra. The rise of coal-mining and dabangg leaders were smooth and so was the introduction of Ramadhir singh (Played by Tigmanshu Dhulia - famed Director of Paan singh Tomar, Haasil and Saheb biwi aur Gangster). The movie paced itself with orphan Sardar Khan's marriage and his quest for the revenge of his father's death. Teri Kah ke loonga song was the key to rise to another level, beautifully sung by Sneha (Music director) and Amit trivedi (DevD). This song was the cog-wheel of the movie, throughout. Here comes the gags and humor plastered through hard facts of life, where a leader behaves differently inside his house and inside a brothel. Enters Richa Chadda (Oye Lucky lucky Oye !) as Najma Khatoon. She was given the role of a tigress , sending her man to please himself by another whore in case he is cocky. Although she doesn't hail from Bihar but the way she spoke Bhojpuri with so earthiness that she walks away with the cherry on the cake. While Manoj Bajpayee can beat any actor when it comes to lecherous ways, his smile on the bare backs of Reemma Sen while sucking on Nalli Ghost Mutton was lecherous at its zenith best . The camera and Anurag was so perfect in providing small details of then Bihar. Rustic and Rustic. Where a Man is a 'Mard' when he woos other women. This was the right backdrop of one the best song ever in Bollywood, sung marvelously by Rekha Jha and Khushboo - O Womaniya. I must admit that Sneha used her talent to compose the song from the people who has good diction of the land and recording it a way that other music directors need to break the mold. This is it, This is real cinema. This is Cinema. The songs and their timing was near perfect and so engrossed that a person might miss the wordings. The local flavor is so enriched that people from other part of India might look for sub-titles. But the time has come to leave Punjab and its Butter masala flavor and reach out to new directors from Eastern part. There was a time in Bollywood where you have to have a Punjabi song to cater to Diaspora Indian by all the directors from the region, be it Chopras, Kapoors, Anand or Singhs.... The clich is cut here and a Niche is set. Every department Camera, Screenplay, music, Lyrics, or cinematography is well rehearsed and close to the story of the land. You will not find Hindi glossy songs or dance out of the swoosh of hand . Even the "item boy" played brilliantly by Yashpal Sharma is close to the earth. Launda-Dance was all the new thing, never entertained on silver screen. This was the show of brilliance, where Sharma is singing Lata Mangeshkar the way a Bihari sings.Tigmanshu Dhulia was so subtle and in the skin of the character that real Ramadhir might take a lesson from him. His casting was so perfect and on the terms with story. No character was built super-size. The theater was burnt by Bajpayee and further destroyed by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. He was the Al Pacino of this Bhojpuri 'The'Godfather. Nawazuddin was so intense with his eyes that glares were seen despite it was covered by dark aviator sunglasses. His smile when the Hunter song was played and the police interrogation was not to be missed. The black skin and lips were purposely brazen to support Chillam (Charas) smoking. The unintentional revenge in Varanasi was also best directed scene in the flick, the way Pacino shot the police chief inside the Italian restaurant. Pankaj Tripathi was another cast which was full of inner venom and potential , as Querashi. Vipin Sharma and Jameel Khan also had good share of screen presence as side kicks and they were well portrayed. Huma Qureshi was the sex-appeal of movie came at the end of first part and Rajeev Ravi didn't miss the opportunity to showcase her in the best Ray-bans proposing Amitabh. The master punch was the end of movie, end of Sardar khan, dragged to the Flawlessness with holes in the head and a pistol in the hand , when Manoj Tiwari blurted the anthem "Jiyo ho" with such a adrenaline energy that you remain glued to your seat. Sublime Excellence.A rare feat. 5/5 Ekdum Bhokali.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bangs of Kasai-pur (Butcher-land)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap stands for the rebel in Indian cinema. He knows it too. Black Friday, Dev.D, Gulaal give him every reason in the world to be proud of his tag. This feeling is clearly reflected in Gangs of Wasseypur, which turns out to be his most ambitious &amp; financed project ever. He works with his long-time friends, Manoj Bajpayee, Tigmanshu Dhulia and others, deciding to make a film which does not fall into the clich of other commercial films. An epic film that tells the story of violence originating through monopoly of coal mines in North India but later feeds itself off the ego of proud descendants of their brave forefathers.It is as difficult to loathe this film as it is to hate history lessons taught through audio-visuals. The story takes us in, helping us to absorb the details. It starts in one era, moves to another, shows familiar black &amp; white clips, returns to some other era before finally falling on a linear time-line. Characters, places, eras are introduced either by text or the voice-over by Piyush Mishra who plays the uncle to a revenge-vowing bald Sardar Khan (Bajpayee, excelling himself like never before) who's father Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat, strong screen presence) was killed off by his employer Ramadhir Singh (Dhulia, another remarkable work). Yes, it is difficult to follow the names but fairly easier to remember the faces. The characters develop beautifully through the plot. I wasn't bored at any point, maybe could have watched the second part too.Kashyap's screenplay stresses more on the plot than the characters. He makes lovable characters throughout the film but has no mercy on them. For instance, the revenge-vowing lead is unashamed of his libido and sleeps around which his wife (Richa Chadda) eventually comes to terms with, which one would would not usually expect (there are numerous other examples with almost every character which would kill the suspense, if mentioned). But these are heartless gangsters which you would feel no sympathy for if you heard about them on the news. This Godfather-esque play of values which have been used time and again in movies makes you expect more from the film as it moves on. Sadly, it doesn't deliver the expected punch as the characterizations lead to digressions in the plot rather than help it move forward.Then again, how do we fall in love with a movie knowing that whole genealogical parts can be comfortably replaced by sporadic lines of reminiscence? And what exactly goes wrong in this movie that boasts of a strong ensemble of actors, a terrific earthy music score (Sneha Khanwalkar) and spot-on cinematography (his regular, Rajeev Ravi)? It is not hard to see the bits &amp; pieces of frustration (that oozed in No Smoking (2007)) in the ambitions and grandeur of Gangs... Kashyap was in the past forced to tone down Black Friday (2004) by Censors and has not yet been allowed to release his first film Paanch. Maybe, this time around, he decided that not cutting down at all on the partly mundane details would enhance the epic-quotient of the film. It does not. However, the trailer and characters for GoW-Part 2 are 'definite'ly more interesting.PS: I'm a die-hard Kashyap fan and it pains me to not be able to fall in love with his movie. But this is certainly, not his best.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We need audience to love such cinema; for directors to produce such amazing work!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a high-expectations set Bollywood movie that does not disappoint. This movie is not for the faint hearted nor is it for the lovers of nonsensical cinema. The movie is about gangwar between 2 Muslim sub-religions- Qureshi/Pathan. The movie begins with a bang and grabs you attention right from the outset. It spans over 7 decades- 1940 - 2004 holding you throughout , where some movies fail to do so in 2-3 times/decades. I do not want to dwell on the story, because its better witnessed than heard.The entire ensemble is praiseworthy; but Manoj Bajpai is top-notch. In the world of Khans, actors like Manoj and Irrfan Khan are left rewardless. Both the actresses leave a mark which is very rare these days. After Gulaal, Black Friday , Anurag Kashyap brings together yet another powerful movie.He easily remains on of the most under rated directors we have.A couple of negatives which prevented this one from getting 10/10 .. One:editing; at least 20 min could have been saved. Two: dialogues: They weren't as powerful as Once upon a time in Mumbai/Singham but still did the work. The hype has increased for part 2, hope it lives up to its predecessor. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fascinating film. There are innumerable characters who you might easily forget between two scenes, but like with the legendary "McGuffins", you can subsist without knowing everything about every character. The story is set in, and is about, Bihar. The language is coarse, but beautiful, as the dialects from up there are. Manoj Bajpai is Sardar Khan who has revenge on his mind. Or so he says, for he takes a longer time ogling at women and impregnating them. If this role were an ocean, he dives into it headlong. If it were bread, he bites into it. No coincidence that his best remembered turn before now was as Bhiku Mhatre in Satya, which too was written by Anurag Kashyap. The setting is young India of the 40s, which grows into an indifferent one of the 2000s. Wasseypur is the cauldron of corruption, violence and disrespect. It is also very colourful. Richa Chadda as Naghma, Sardar Khan's wife is excellent. She gets all the great lines and she thrives on them. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, the most exciting acting talent since Irfan Khan, is the Michael Corleone to Sardar Khan's Don Corleone. He gets very few screen space, but with the promise that the next part of this epic will have him in a key role. If the music and the pace of the film can be kept so, Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is one you would check your local listings for every day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Then there was the whole concept of coal mining, which is a culture unto itself, the most dangerous occupation in the world, and which draws and develops a certain kind of man." Martin C. SmithManoj Bajpai wants revenge on Tigmanshu Dhulia who had treacherously killed his father. Sometimes there comes a story which has an epic kind of sweep. Spanning generations, introducing several characters, all caught up in empire building, love, lust and enimity. There isn't much point to them, the protagonists aren't clearly defined, the storyline meandering, their lives entwined in the events that befell the nation and the small town that the story inhabits. Set in the backdrop of Wasseypur, a small part of Dhanbad, capital of India's coal belt, numerous characters come and go. India gains independence, Emergency is imposed, coal mining is first unionized and later nationalized. However, the story, at its core remains about Tigmanshu's star rising ever higher and Manoj building his own empire from humble origins, while seeking revenge.There are times when you wish things would happen quicker. That there were less characters. Or that there was a point to some of them, who are introduced to either only die or shine bright for a few frames before being forgotten. The environment is beautifully captured, including the lingo, the mannerisms whether it's the abject despair of the poor mine worker, condemned to live his life in the black shafts. The bestiality of the butcher, as he hacks away at his meat. The cowardice of the cops. The empty bravado of the minister's goons. Or the naked lust as hungry men eye their next catch, the woman to slake their base desires, even as the wife lies at home, pregnant. However, there are several things which let the film down. For a film set in the coal belt, we see very little of it. Apart from one memorable scene where, caked in the black coaldust, a few men fight for their lives and another where coals water absorption properties are highlighted, there is too little was about the black mineral and much more made of ancillary businesses. National events of importance are also given short shrift or brushed over, their impact shown quickly, transitions happening smoothly rather than in real life where each change creates havoc in such a tiny eco-system. Great camera work, flawless performances, several one-liners and very catchy music keep you engaged, though, as our two key protagonists slug it out and religion comes in, with different sects of Muslims engaging in war amongst each other. The story moves forward with a Godfather-esque gait, a kind of glacial majesty, in stops and starts, not always making sense. But then, isn't that how real life is ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important thing for a movie depicting real life events is the characterization. Every character has to fit in to the role he/she is given and kudos to Mr. Anurag Kashyap, he has done exactly as prescribed. The best part about the movie is that it's action and the dark comedy never seemed unreal. The flow of the movie seemed perfect for a blend of action and reality. Acting was just perfect with every actor doing justice to his/her role. Screenplay was gripping with straightforward dialogues and good characterization. The film never seemed to aberrate from its central theme.One of the most creative things about the movie was the old book styled beginning. It made the movie look more contemporary to its setting. One huge relief about the movie was that the music was well chosen and well timed. The cinematography was also perfect. The setting of the movie looked very real. Bihar/Jharkhand/Uttar Pradesh, thanks to their governance in last 15 years, have not changed much and that helped a lot to this cause.The only negative part about the movie is its language and some gory scenes nevertheless these were inevitable. A movie not advisable to sensitive viewership. A few families were seen leaving the movie theater midway after it got too much for them. Overall the movie is a good watch for them who could take these negatives as a part and parcel of the movie without which it could not have been as good as it is and a value for your money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur - The Mother of All Revenge Dramas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur is a story of three generations seeking revenge, each putting it: "Hamari zindgi ka ek ea maksad hai-- Badla". The first is a laborer who is fighting to establish his empire; his son was born to avenge his father's murder, and the third generation child who accidentally discovers sexual relationship of his mother and his grandfather (father's brother). The movie starts with the political rape of a city map and ends at rape of human trust for egoistic satisfactions. The songs like "Ik bagel Mei Chaand hoga" and "Keh K loonga" are the soul of the movie. For this I should write a special note on Sneha Khanwalker and her team. But I avoid writing on her as I fear falling in Love with her. I don't know what for you is the importance of "Gangs of Wasseypur" but for me it is the story of that small kid whose honest father is brutally killed in the garden when he was teaching his son that flowers should not be killed. It is also about that child who is continuously crying when just outside his father is celebrating after killing someone. A bit about that butcher's child on whom camera stops for a second when Sardar khan is burning and bombing his home.For me the film has stuck in that Coal mine where your skin will be ripped off if you work a minute less than 12 hours, where there is no light or oxygen and there is a face of a man who wants to turn cruel forever, beat his own people, burn their houses and gain power. And on death he wants to leave his son in that fire where he will grow his hairs only after taking the revenge of his father's death. Oops!! He will not take the revenge, He will rip him dry (Keh K lega uski).How many films are there which show the history, geography and present of Coal Maafia. Which show children bringing stolen iron from the same streets where an Icecream cart is going along? How many films will point out that Tata, Birla and Thapar got everything for Peanuts. And that Britishers used to provide salary and shelter whereas the Indian Govt provides only salaries that too after breaking the shelter. How many films will stop at the face of the person burning houses and show his dilemma and guilt. That is why, "Gangs of Wasseypur" might have a lot of abuses and gunshots, a lot of people and buffaloes getting butchered off, but it is the Real story of our internal layers. A pinch of Wasseypur is within all of us. Those are our own homes where a wife in a hushed voice asks her husband, who is planning a murder, whether to serve food in Bone China dishes because the guest is a Muslim. They are our own fathers who might be killing the whole world outside but they get panic attacks when their sons get a little wound. This is our life and its multiple characters, violence of our own world and Slaughter-Houses where an Eye for an Eye is making the whole world blind. This movie is not important for its story but for its characters and their reactions to various circumstances. It is so natural that people stop back to collect their slippers which are left back while running after committing a murder and loot. The movie stops again and again on kids watching all this and warns us that they will turn up doing the same when they grow up. The movie rises above the bar to establish the reality of its characters, their lives, their streets and city. Somewhere with the posters of "Kasam paida Karney wale Ki" "Coolie" "Guide" and sometimes with the charismatic happiness of first time seeing a revolver, someone with a dream of Automatic Guns and somewhere with the luxury of a new Fridge in the home, the movie walks you through the real evolution of India. You might confuse it with a normal story of vengeance, but this movie is different because it gets cooked in the kitchens of gangsters, walks in their terrace, eats Chaat with them, drink Lassie, and the movie sits with the gangster when they are watching their girlfriend washing clothes at a hand pump. The movie is shy when they touch the hand of a girl for the first time, sings in their marriages and it laughs when their hands receive shocks while firing from a country made revolver. Ranging from theft of Icecream to Coal, Fish, Ponds, Petrol and money, this movie shows you all the loot happening in our country.In train, railway lines, lodges, hotels, on road, in the mourning of Moharram and on Ghats of Banaras, Anurag Kashyap takes the movie with so ease that you feel that Manoj Vajpayee is taking a revenge for you. The movie takes you back to the homeland of India. An even when Sardar Khan falls after getting shot, he doesn't gets an Ambulance, Car or bike but a Rickshaw whose owner name is written as Jaiswal Building Material. He has to fall on it, rickshaw has to move on and vanish. The same rickshaw which is been driven by many Sardar Khan's everywhere in India. But these Sardar Khan's don't have own a piece of land anywhere in this country.It is a movie where every character or object has to take a stand, and prove the reason of its being. It is neither about Revenge nor about Wasseypur. It is about that Violence in which many of our generations and races have got wasted. It is about the Faizals who are forced to leave school, clean the toilets of Trains and then resort to drugs and looting. The movie laughs at that violence, it laughs on everyone, on us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertainment, Entertainment &amp; Entertainment. What a movie! Excellent acting by Manoj Vajpayee. People who loved gangajal must watch this. Funny dialogues, a local touch of Bihari Hindi tone. People from southern India may struggle to grasp the dailogues but when they'll get it they will keep ROFLing. The story basically talks about the gang war in Wasseypur &amp; Dhanband (Jharkhand) starting from 1950s till present. It presents the glimpses of coal mafia raaj and war for contracts among bahubalis. The movie flow is such that you'll never get bored. The movie'll have part two also. But this movie being part one also is a complete package of entertainment. I am not telling the complete story as I don't wanna spoil the real fun waiting for you. SO rush to your theatres asap. Again I would say a masterpiece by Anurag Kashyap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that is what the entire bollywood industry should do - bow to this movie. all these years bollywood has been churning out me too movies with fake western wannabe characters and music and dance and I practically stopped watching this cr@p every since I was around 16.GoW shows what real authentic Indian cinema can be, what it should have been - mind bogglingly rich in colors and smell and taste and overwhelming - just like India.I think this movie surpasses City of God in artistic value and screenplay. If Slumdog got an Oscar, this should get two. But then again, the Oscar committee may not quite appreciate what is essentially a very Indian backdrop. Actually to tell the truth - North Indian, more specifically Bihari, UP flavor.But who cares. The filmfare awards committee should take back all the FF awards given out till date and hand over to GoW. No hyperbole. This movie (should) redefines Indian cinema. Nevermind the average reviews of all the paid reviewers in Indian media. They are about as intelligent as the rest of the bollywood. This movie is AWESOME.</fullReview>

It will show you the horror in which people lived during past 60 years in Dhanbad area. Go for awesome acting, music and thrill. Overall, a different and unexpected experience.PS: For the people in India who feel that taking kids to a R-rated movie is OK for their 'early education', this movie will show you why you should never do that.

I am warning people out there that if You like non sense action like bodyguard or some baseless movie sorry sir/ma'am this movie isn't made for you....according to me this movie is 1 of the best movie of bollywood till date....anurag gave so much attention to the detailing that you can't just ignore it and every character has given life it's own time to breath.......performance of all actors are awesome and manoj bajpayee is at all time best.....the plot,the story is larger than life and as you all know that this story is based on true story....some people will get shocked after watching this movie that this is the same country that they belong to.....this movie is not made for people who thinks that real India is shown just in 'yash raj films'..............for me its the best film ever made</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anurag Kashyap's another wonder!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every Human being on the earth has different shades/dimensions within themselves. Good, bad, sensitive, insensitive, fear, bravery, jealousy, courtesy, and the list is endless. Unfortunately, majority of the movies we see portray the characters as having only one dimension. And typically Indian Cinema is narrower in this aspect. From Indian cinema perspective there are only "good" and "bad" characters. Anurag Kashyap, is one of the handful directors, who stick to the fact that, there is nothing like good and bad. It is all about CHARACTERS!!!and each character WILL have multiple dimensions within himself/herself.KUDOS to the amazingly talented path-breaking director of Indian Cinema, Mr. Anurag Kashyap for giving such an epic movie called "Gangs of Wasseypur". Watching this movie is a bliss for a cinema lover. No wonder, it was hugely appreciated at the Cannes Film Festival.GOW is an end-product of a the most impressive story-telling, dialogs, characterizations, background music,casting and all other crafts in film-making!! Every character and the scene is written so wonderfully that, you are glued to the seat throughout the 160 minutes, forget the whole world, and feel as if you are there in the movie and seeing the characters live in front of you.Of course, it is not for the weak-hearted, as it has brutal violence, which is essential to get the right impact of the severity of the events. There are umpteen number of characters in the movie, and each of them have performed first-rate. They are not glamorous, they appear real. Not just that, the emotions the characters portray, are real, including the abusive language. (yes, indeed they are used in real life). Though the movie, has a native backdrop(Bihar), the theme is universal- REVENGE.What I liked: (I liked every part of the movie, but would like to mention some extra-extra-ordinary things)Manoj Bajpayee's screen presence, is FABULOUS!!Straight-forward, Bihar-accent-ed powerful dialogs (I felt that aha, I wish I was a Bihari for these 3 hours, to enjoy the dialogs more heart-fully)Timing of the songs and background music and the variation of these music pieces, elevate the movie to the next level.What I did not like: Nothing!!Summary: DO NOT MISS!!!Note: The movie ends at a critical point, and also lays the foundation for the sequel- "Gangs of Wasseypur-2", which will hit the screens soon, and I just cant wait to watch that. As per my assumption, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, will be having a major role in the sequence. Nawazuddin, is one of the finest actors, we have. (Recently, you watched him in New York,Kahaani and Paan Singh Tomar. FYI, he will also be playing a major role in Aaamir Khan's Talaash.)</fullReview>

I am going to take some time to absorb the stress. To be frank, I desperately need Yash Chopra's goody goody movie dose to clear my hangover.As with old Hollywood era, one side there were Tom Hank's feel good movies and other side were Clint Estwood's unadulterated Taxan flick. In Bollywood, we are coming up with good number of nail biting northern rural dramas (Can anyone forget Omkara or Ishqiya.. !). I personally believe these are much much better than latest trend of copying of southern OVER POWERED HERO's movies (does anyone needs Name?).When top notch direction meets with crunchy script a full blown entertainment is sure to be due. And Manoj Vajpai ..who?? (Yes yes yes fair enough.... I still remember Manoj Vajpai of Satya frame) is coming up at his own. There were others (still not able to get their names &#xf04c;), who were equally impressive. The only disappointment was editing, 20 minutes of cuts could have given GOW a Gem status. But yeah, may be that I can wish for part II. All in all, its treat to watch, if you like Spices more than Sugar ;-).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not often that movies are compared to The Godfather. Even if they are, they stand nowhere in reality. But this movie here, not only competes with, but also manages to establish itself right there. This is Atom vs Zeus from Real Steel.The direction and acting performances are commendable. Everything about the movie is realistic. It is so honest that it scares you.Not going to spoil this movie at all, The main plot is that of a war between two class of families that lasts over seven decades. This movie is split over two parts, due to the long running time. But it captures you from the very beginning and keeps you hooked till the end credits in the second half.I loved every bit of it and recommend all action lovers to watch this. A 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hands-down one of the best movies of the decade, not just from Indian cinema, but from all over the world. IMDb has merged it into one, but it's actually a 2 part saga of crime, loyalty, family, relationships and most importantly revenge.The story is stretched across three generations and starts with a disagreement between the Pahtan's and Qureshi's. Both these sects of Wasseypur already had a tough disagreements in the past, but Shahid Khan, a Pathan, masquerading himself as a Qureshi bandit boils the tension to a whole new level and Shahid Khan is forced to leave Wasseypur. Shahid moves to Dhanbad, where he meets a coal mine owner called Ramadhir Singh. Shahid plans to move up the ladder by killing Ramadhir Singh and taking his place, but to his surprise Ramadhir gets to know about this and haves him murdered.What begins is a vicious tale of revenge that leads to three generations of hatred and violence.There have been revenge movies before, but the one that can come close to GOW is Kill Bill. I can't decide which one is better at this point, but much like GOW it was 2-part revenge story where the motive was to eliminate one person.Acting in the movie was flawless all around. Manoj Bajpayee was perhaps the one who was the most interesting. However, Nawazudding Siddiqqui, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Richa Chadda and so many other actors give spectacular performances.Anurag Kashyap was able to deliver such a brilliant film, and I feel this movie still hasn't receive the recognition it deserves.Don't ignore this masterpiece just because it comes from an Industry notorious for creating happy-go-lucky dance sequences. It's not a film for the fainthearted, but this new generation of cinema from Bollywood needs to be appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The time-line of the movie spans from early 1940s to early 1990s. The second part of the movie is expected to span from early 1990s to mid 2000s. It's a story of Pathans Shahid Khan (played by Jaideep Ahlawat)and his son Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpayee, Qureshis, and politician-cum-coal mine owner-cum- local don Ramadheer Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia)and his son. The tussle between Pathans and Qureshis, and that between Shahid Khan and Sardar Khan on one side and Ramadheer Singh and his son on the other side are the highlights of the movie. In between, one also sees different facets of coal mafia, revenge, rivalries among Muslims, and even love stories too. The movie is intense, gripping, and has a fair sprinkling of cuss words one finds in Bihar and Jharkhand, where the film is based. The music of the film is another highlight, and one needs to watch the film to fully realize the relevance of songs in the film. In short: a must- watch movie for those who love hard hitting movies with great acting from all the actors.</fullReview>

These is the story of Sardar Khan &amp; his sons, their revenge. These movie is made into two parts &amp; both the parts are equally good but still I would like to give extra marks to second part because of one actor Navazuddin Siddique, What an actor these guy is!These story revolves around small village in Bihar name Wassypur where main business of people is to work in coal mines or do coal trading. The first part start with gunfire in the house where in the background the music of famous tele serial 'kyoki Sas bhi kabhi bahu thi' is playing, Which is totally unique for any bollywood movie. Then starts the story of Sardar Khan in the flashback. This role is very well played by Manoj bajpai, one of the jewel in bollywood. How Sardar khan become the local don from ordinary coal worker. His tussle with Tigamnsu Dhulia to take the charge of local town. His relation with his wife then his affair with another girl who later become his second wife. These all stories of him captured well by director. the language used in the movie is very authentic which speaks locally in the area of wassypur. Another interesting part in the movie is love story between of Nawazuddin &amp; Huma Qureshi which I loved the most. you should watch the scene where Huma Qureshi goes to meet him in jail. All the character in the movie is so important that you can't think any others actors in that roles. To name a few are Rajkumar Rao, Richa Chadda, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Reema Sen, Vineetkumar Singh.Anurag Kashyap is one of my favorite director he either makes a best movie or worst movie so these is one of the best movie. Don't miss it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1941 British colonial India, Shahid Khan is robbing trains under the guise of legendary bandit Sultana Daku. He is discovered and banished. After independence, Ramadhir Singh takes over some of lucrative coal mines but they struggle without British managers and money. He hires Shahid Khan as muscle to keep the workers in line. He overhears Shahid's plan to murder him for the mines. He kills Shahid and tries to kill his family. The son Sardar Khan is rescued and raised alongside his cousin Asghar. Decades later, Sardar is told of the murder and vows revenge. Sardar uses daring, intimidation and his criminal ways to take on the powerful magnate Singh as one of the most feared crime lord.I can definitely see the comparison to the Godfather movies. I really love some parts of this movie. Shahid Khan could be a movie all by himself. In fact, I would preferred his story to be expanded into either part I or a prequel of sorts like in Godfather II. Sardar is a very compelling character. I'm a little confused with some of the family melodrama. The story feels a little rushed covering a long timeline. The whole movie feels like a vast long story being crammed into a space that is too small. If this was Godfather, this would be twice as long in length. This is great brutal violent overwrought material. This is good but it's not quite Godfather epic great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*I am not a fan of Indian film, mostly I hate it, but Gang of Wasseypur is good. It is not the typical Indian movie with lot of dancing and typical good guy as lead character.Watching Gang of Wasseypur is like watching The Godfather instead of watching Indian movies.The main core of the story is almost similar with The Godfather, but overall with the Indian aspect in it, the story is different. the writer picked real events that happened in India, and put it in the story. So there is little bit history lesson of India there, which is cool.The character is very different with the Godfather counterpart, Sardar Khan is not like Vito Corleone, he is more violence and kinda selfish, although their core story almost similar. But they are totally different character. The other filler characters is totally different.Good news , there is no dancing in this movie, but surprisingly, there is many good soundtracks in this film. They put great traditional Indian music instead the typical music in Indian movies.If you like The Godfather I think you can appreciate this Gang of Wasseypur, even if you hate Indian movies like me. This is not typical Indian movies, totally worth checking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Part - I of Indian filmmaker Anurag Kashyap's Epic Crime Saga.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur is a 2012 Hindi crime movie directed and co- written by Indian movie-maker Anurag Kashyap starring veteran Indian actor Manoj Bajpai in the lead role. Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur is a crime saga that revolves around a three-generation long sanguinary rivalry between two disputing Muslim clans: the 'Khans' and the 'Qureshis'. However, this bloody battle is not religious but strictly territorial in nature as the two clans indulge in incessant fights seeking carte blanche to run their respective crime syndicates in Wasseypur. It's worth mentioning that the events and circumstances depicted in Gangs of Wasseypur are fictionalized accounts of the real life events that occurred in the district of Wasseypur during the pre and post-independence India. Despite a taut narrative, Gangs of Wasseypur occasionally suffers from redundancy in its plot that often reflects in its expletive-driven, harangue-like dialogue. Another thing that can be disconcerting to a seasoned movie viewer is Gangs of Wasseypur's obvious similarity to Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather Trilogy. Now, as much as it may sound like a disparaging remark for Gangs of Wasseypur, in reality it's a testament to the timelessness and universality of Coppola's masterful crime saga that continues to inspire movie-makers worldwide even after so many decades. Anurag Kashyap has indeed succeeded in leaving a mark with his rustic adaptation.Another interesting thing to note is that the name 'Gangs of Wasseypur' bears a striking similarity to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. The similarity is obviously not limited to the name, for the battle scenes filmed in Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur match and at times surpass the gore and grotesquery depicted in Scorsese's larger than life portrayal of gang wars in the nineteenth century New York City. In Gangs of Wasseypur, Kashyap strives to strike the right balance between various cinematic elements that helps the movie touch the lows and highs of cinema, thereby helping it break the stereotype associated with quintessential Bollywood cinema. Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most disturbing sequences ever filmed in Indian cinema depicting shootouts, prison-breaks, brawls, bomb blasts, rallies, kidnappings, rapes, train-robberies, forced marriages, women in labor, lovemaking, killings, and butchery. One interesting facet that makes these scenes really effective is the level of realism and conviction with which they are carried forward in the movie.In Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap presents a grim picture of human decadence: Amongst the hundreds of masculine characters depicted in the movie, one doesn't get to witness a single likable character, for most of them come across as bestial beings desperate to serve their basic instincts of survival, physical love, wealth and power. On the other hand, the women are portrayed as secondary beings who are looked upon by men as materialistic pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits. Manoj Bajpai delivers a tour de force in Gangs of Wasseypur. His portrayal of Sardar Khan ranks right up there with the very best performances in the history of Indian cinema. Sardar is ferocious killer as well as a voracious lover whose feral instincts to kill (his adversaries) are remarkably matched by his play boyish passion to for physical love. It is this balance that helps him keep his composure amidst pervasive insanity and gives him the courage to single- handedly knockout his adversaries. Sardar Khan uses a combination of brute force and acumen to rise to the top of the food chain. Manoj Bajpai musters all his talent and courage to perfectly fit into the shoes of Sardar Khan. It wouldn't be a hyperbole to say that no other actor could have fit better in the role of a 'Desi Bahubali' than Bajpai himself.The rest of the cast gives memorable performances that help bring characters to life with a special mention of Nawazuddin Siddiqui whose underplayed cameo as Sardar Khan's younger son offered a great contrast to Manoj Bajpai's over the top portrayal. Siddiqui's low-key portrayal is also in great contrast to his portrayal of a tough, haughty cop in Sujoy Ghosh's Kahaani. It's remarkable that in such a shot period of time he has shown such great versatility as an actor. Siddiqui is expected to have a major role in the second part of Gangs of Wasseypur considering the similarities of his part to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone. Whether Siddiqui will succeed in carving a niche for himself as Pacino had managed with his portrayal in The Godfather I &amp; II is for the time to decide. The cinematography of Gangs of Wasseypur is at par with the best in the world. Kashyap's sense of timing with the use of music is also exemplary. Kashyap expertly introduces occasional bursts of music and comedy to punctuate the slowly augmenting tension tension at different junctures in the movie. Kashyap's use of dark humor to judiciously propagate violence has an uncanny similarity to Quentin Tarantino's style of filmmaking. His choice of music in the movie's final sequence that depicts the brutal killing of one of movie's major characters is bizarre yet remarkably effective.Overall, Gangs of Wasseypur serves to be a unique cinematic experience that's not free of its flaws. However, despite its apparent flaws, Gangs of Wasseypur has enough to offer to a keen movie-viewer who would not allow him/her to be overwhelmed by movie's abundance of everything. Gangs of Wasseypur serves be a sanguinary carnival of epic proportions that's surely not meant for the faint-hearted. The movie is an essential viewing for the lovers of Indian cinema, for they will get to see something quite refreshing in Gangs of Wasseypur, and also for those who want to get acquainted with it.(This review was first published at A Potpourri of Vestiges)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangs of wasseypur is not a superficial film.It is a film with a motive.There are very few movies in India which dares to show such a violence.Truly what a movie.... Undoubtedly it is the best crime film made in recent times in bollywood.The story,story treatment,screenplay,acting,direct ion and even music of this movie was so original and flawless. The whole movie revolves around revenge.The movie takes us to a ride of rustic India.Every frame of the movie depicts of cinematic brilliance.The movie depicts an actual event of tussle of three crime families which results in a violent blood feud.The screenplay of part 1 was so tight that you don't even get time for a blink but part 2 was weak and clichd. Manoj bajpai was amazing and played his part perfectly.Richa was good but didn't get much chance.Nawajuddin was amazing and Huma was OK.Tigmanshu dhulia was superb.He did a great job.Rest of the star cast was also good. Anurag is like an artisan and he crafted a great cinema.It is among the most original films ever made in India.Music of the movie was inspired by folk songs and was good.Cinematography was also very nice. In my opinion part 2 is inferior to part 1.Still i enjoyed both movies.If Hollywood have The godfather then we have Gangs of wasseypur.It is not a commercial potboiler but is a true cinema.India needs more movies like this..... 8.3 out of 10 is my rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap has essayed a very realistic portrayal of small town gangs in the badlands of Bihar. Excellent cast. Very subtle yet deep performance by all. Morals of the society under focus is handled very well without succumbing to stereo-types. The cost - except for Huma Qureshi - lacks typical Bollywood star looks which adds to the sense of reality of the movie. One area where he could have done better is visuals. It was hardly pleasing to the eyes! Lighting was not handled better and seems to have been left natural. Photography bereft of clever lighting results in less than pleasing visuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revenge saga that makes us yearn for more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A revenge saga that makes us yearn for more.This was released on June 22nd and its sequel was out on Aug 8th, in the meanwhile I had a tough time to sit back and wait, coz the end climax made me wait and see what is going to happen next. its taken forward by the protagonist Sardar Khan and we move forward with him. This film is for sure an epic just coz the scale is too grand to weave a script. It spans across 60 decades from 1941 to 2004. It starts at 2004 in beginning and ends in mid 1990's and there are many references o show us the age. If radio was heard or Trishul being seen in cinemas or to Kyu Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu This is authentic and great many kudos to Rajeew Ravi the cinematographer and the production design of Wasiq Khan who brought alive the 1970's the 80's and yes even the 40's. Just an aberration here Trishul was released in 1979 while it was shown to be as 1989.Music was raw and pleasant and even philosophical like song of Ik Bagal Main, to a silly yet hilarious song like I am Hunter, Sneha Khanwalkar adds a voice to the already interestig script. The audiography is good and so is the voice of Piyush Mishra as he says the back story behind what was happening on screen. But the most interesting of all is the script itself that is driven by Sardar Khan played by Manoj Bajpai and by Ramadhir Singh played by Tigamanshu Dhulia, its their rivalry and how they deal with this. So instead of killing simply each other, they decide to tell and take "Keh Ke loonga Uski"The dialogues are witty and the violence is gruesome. All in all, its a gory depiction of a true incidents told entertainigly. Kudos to Anurag Kashyap the pioneer of great Indian Cinema for making it in this way.There is a scene in which Sardar Khan tries to open the door by smashing with his legs and hands and screaing while his aide simply opens the bolt and says "Yeh aise khulta hai" such moments are what made this revenge drama witty and hirlaious. It's sarcastic one may say as it makes a mockery too of few things, yet it's not cynical but intelligent. Manoj Bajpai might well win many Best Actor awards or at least be nominated to many. Anurag Kashyap for sure is the best director yet again and I hope he wins the elusive best director award at least this time. A 4/5 for movie that is made like an epic. There are many characters still there is a connect that keeps us glued even in a repeat watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Godfathers of Wasseypur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very best Hindi movie epics...epic not just in scope, but also in execution...I kinda expected it to slip into becoming a self-indulgent mess, but Kashyap is ever- reliable, never allowing himself to get the better of a tale excellently told...perfectly cast, and one of those examples where the music, song-breaks included is as relevant to the narration as are all the other events that form part of the overall tapestry....I would have preferred to watch both movies back-back, but work pressures did not allow that...so, viewing 1 and 2 separately, though 2 could not have existing without 1, I much preferred GOW2...but maybe just because I am not a fan of showy characters (like the one played by Bajpai in 1, though he was, as always, fantastic, and perhaps even outdid his last best performance)...Siddiqui is the man...both in this, as well as every other movie I've seen him in, including 'Kahaani' and 'Talaash'....I can watch GOW2 any number of times, and listen to it's musical numbers, as well as most of the background theme tracks on repeat....Strongly recommend, preferably on the big screen, with a like-minded audience....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review might be biased because I am a great fan of Anurag Kashyap's movies. Having said that, I do not think people would disagree with the admiration shown. Gangs of Wasseypur is Kashyap's take on Indian godfather. If you are an international at heart, you need to know the local nuances to understand the comic timing, the intensity, the issues, the reactions of characters. However, even an unfamiliar would be taken through the streets of Wasseypur really smoothly.Sardar Khan essayed by Manoj Bajpayee, and his wife Richa Chaddha have played their part nicely. From setting up of his empire around Wasseypur to expanding his business and later on transferring the legacy to his sons, Bajpayee has eased into the character. There is no typical bollywood masala dance numbers, yet the background scores are simply apt for the story. The real plus about this movie is the way the characters get developed and mature over the course of the movie. That is something which people rarely notice yet decides the pace and the coherence of the movie. This movie is certainly one to watch, and will invariably lead one into the next part. Both the movies offer 6 hour of serious entertainment and a crash course into the old mafia raj of pre 1990 India. I rate this movie 8 out of 10 for the aforementioned credits.</fullReview>

Mafia worked in every business - not just coal mining. Extortion was their business indeed! Kidnapping, killing, murders were just the bi-products. All this has been shown in 'as is' form in this movie. At the same time; it has the family background of mafia criminals. The side effects of Hindi films on the family ... wow ... that has been shown here just fabulously.The direction, acting is marvelous, all the actors are at their career best acting performance.

		<shortDescription>The most standout Hindi movies of 2012</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOW is one of the most standout Hindi movies of 2012 directed by Anurag Kashyup. The five hour long movie was released in two parts and every moment of the movie is worth watching. Pepped up with experimental music and quirky dialogues the movie is jam-packed with brilliant but not so mainstream actors. The movie is set in the Dhanbad's Wasseypur, a place rich of black diamond and plagued with rivalry between two Muslim operated gangs stretched across generations. The move beautifully captures the mafia-politician-police nexus in then Bihar, the Bollywood loving junta of Wasseypur and is loaded with songs that you will keep on humming for days. While Manoj Vajpayee's awe will keep you glued to the screen it is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who leapt across the heaven for me. The characters in the film are complex and well-developed and have nothing in common except narcissism and disregard for law. Cinematography is absolutely brilliant and the shot where the coal dust is all that is in the air you will feel as if you are sniffing it under your nostrils. When Jean-Luc Godard said that all you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun, he was probably not wrong; the movie is full of desi guns and village belles where shootouts take place at every nook and corner of the town. The screenplay is steady and doesn't break the environment it creates from the starting. This is a tale of revenge, blood-money and insanity which will leave a spot on your brain for the years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur to Gangs of Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. The movie travels you back to the time as even the details of the way houses and gullies used to be at that time looks of that era. The film takes time to pick up the pace initially especially till the time the central character of Sardar Khan played by talented Manoj Bajpayee enters . He doesn't shine as the hero of the movie but he is an ordinary man with enough guts to take up the mighty dhoti clad politician cum businessman Ramadhar Singh played by the ace director Tigmanshu Dhulia. The initial 30-45 minutes are more about building the plot of the story than jumping directly into the theme. The son revenge over his father death is never a revelation in the bollywood mainstream but the tight script laden with many one liners which make you feel that this movie is so close to reality and thats where the film scores an advantage. The chemistry between Sardar Khan and his wife Nagma, played by the tall Punjabi girl from Delhi, Richa Chaddha is blunt. They love , they hate , they abuse and they need each other. Thats the reality of many young couples in everyday life, isn't it. The film makes you think hard on drawing the line of morality as every character in the movie has shades of Grey. Whether its the another dominant Muslim faction of the butchers , or the Khan clan of Sardar Khan or the corrupt politician, they all are opportunistic and are hungry to reign their supremacy. The film literally travels with time and Sardar Khan moves from Dhanbad to Wasseypur , a small town near the coal district and forms his mighty gang which is more powerful than the butchers and the politician. The violence strikes many times but it never makes you close your eyes , instead it makes you think that many bloodbaths happen with a cool and calm mind and not in fit or anger. Sardar Khan's character is serious about the revenge of his father's murder but is also equally serious about his mistress played by the Bengali beauty Reema Sen. One is left hard to understand if Sardar Khan is using the lady to satisfy his lust or the lady is using him to satisfy her lust and greed. Nagma, played by Richa Chaddha is a strong and outspoken women who doesn't bow to go against her husband even when her husband doesn't live with her anymore. Howver , at the same time she doesn't spare him either and hurls abuses at him on his greed for sex and womanizing. The film binds the audience with fast storytelling in the middle and doesn't give time to predict the next scenes. One style of filmmaking is that never give enough time to audience to think what will come next and you have won the hearts of the audience. The two young sons of Sardar Khan are like poles apart in their living but the traces of their father's mentality is preserved. While one is more crazy , smoking cigarettes and pots ; the other is slightly peace maker who proposes to marry the girl from the leader of the butcher family in order to get united. The script is good , the dialogs are sharp , story telling is structured , movement is fast , songs and lyrics are unorthodox of any typical bollywood film but what works the most in the movie is the characters. All the songs have become a rage whether its Hunter, womaniya or jiya ho Bihar ke lala. In fact , I have heard these songs as caller tunes of many people whom I call, which reflects the mass acceptance of the songs with a difference. The characters, I would say are the heart of the movie; whether its a cameo by the guy who dances on the old Hindi movie hit "Kasam paida Karney wale Ki" , the guy who is singing "salame ishe meri jaan" in both the male and female voice during the Nikah of Sardar Khan's son or the Ray Ban girl who preaches in chaste bihari accent to Sardar Khan's son to catch hold of a girl's hand only after taking her permission. The lead actress or the "Womaniya" of the film played by Richa Chaddha ( if you remember , she played the role of a spoiled girl who is after Abhay Deol in Oye Lucky Lucky Oye) is terrific as Nagma . Its not easy to fit under a role of a woman which demands boldness not in terms of skin exposure but in terms of the skin of the character and she has done it a perfect 10. Piyush Mishra always comes good and here is no exception. Nawazuddin Shaikh who plays as one of the son of Sardar Khan is also good and the in the next part "Gangs of Wasseypur II" he will be seen in a more crazy character. Not to forget to mention the last scene of the movie, where Sardar Khan is attacked by his enemies in his car. I don't want to mention any spoiler hence would not go beyond this on the film's story line. The movie is simply binding,amazing as the violence and murder makes you not only shiver but also laugh at times. The characters act violently as if its like any other daily work for them. The movie is inspired by bits and pieces of some real stories from the small place Wasseypur , but still you cant take credit away from a tight script writing. I think that "Gangs of Wasseypur " is going to open gates to for many such reality struck movies. we will get to see some really good movies from the talented filmmakers who would define the new "Gangs of Bollywood"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap's 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is An Interesting Film with Terrific Performances! Kashyap, known for off-beat films, this time attempts to deliver a story that can be termed as his most "commercial" flick to date. And even though this 1st installment isn't flawless, its absorbing &amp; supremely acted nevertheless.'Gangs of Wasseypur' Synopsis: A son seeks vengeance when his father is killed by a coal mine owner.'Gangs of Wasseypur' is violent, abusive &amp; fearless. Kashyap delivers a revenge story, that literally has shock value. 'Gangs of Wasseypur' runs for a long 160-minutes, but manages to arrest its viewer attention on several occasions.Kashyap's Screenplay begins tepidly, but picks up rapidly. The Second-Hour, in particular, is absorbing &amp; memorable. Kashyap's Direction is Masterclass. Cinematography is rustic. Editing is sharp. Music by Sneha Khanwalkar is excellent.Performance-Wise: The Ever-Terrific Manoj Bajpai is marvelous yet again. As Sardar Khan, The National-Award-Winning Actor pitches in an unforgettable turn, that's sure to be remembered for a long time. Director-Turned-Actor Tigmanshu Dhulia is fantastic. He's menacing to the core! Piyush Mishra is natural, while Richa Chadda &amp; Reemma Sen are very good. Jaideep Ahlawat is terrific in a brief role. Pankaj Tripathi is simply outstanding. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is perfect, yet again. Vipin Sharma is efficient. Huma Qureshi is first-rate. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenplay, cinematography, character selection, story telling and direction at a new high with this Anurag Kashyap artwork. After a long long time (of course excluding the likes of Shyam Benegal, Meera Nair only to name a few), here is a director who has produced something wonderful out of small but brutal village incidents . The actors simply seem to fit perfectly into the roles been offered. Every actor has done justice to the character he portrays (except the character Ramadhir Singh who lacks the intensity as a villain I would say). No exotic locations, no overtly or skimpily dressed stars, no so called "superstars", this movie is a sure treat to watch i.e. of course of your above 18. We Indians and of course the stars should come out of their mindsets of making "blockbusters" which in most cases make least or no sense to the viewers. This movie is bound to linger in the minds of masses for a long time. Rating: Casting-10, Direction-8,Dialogue-9,Screenplay-9, Plot-9. Overall:9. Eagerly waiting for the 2nd part to hit the screens!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mainstream Re-invented !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Explosive, Rollicking &amp; Hard Hitting ......... are the right adjectives which can be associated after watching Mr. Anurag Kashyap's gun blazing, gob smacking bihari gangster opera named "Gangs of Wasseypur". Not many films in bollywood can claim to be real , dark and deep yet entertaining to the core but Gangs of Wasseypur is gonna jolt the viewer from inside with its real and gut wrenching depiction of an infamous land known for its dangerous coal mafia and sinister gang battles. Film sets it up to be fire brand from the very first scene when a gang armed to the teeth with bombs and machine guns blast their way into the palace-fortress of the reigning don, Faizal Khan and from that very first scene film takes the viewer back to pre-independence era where the story actually sets up.Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) is a Pathan who is fond of theatricals and his cunning greed triggers him to loot the British trains in the name of a fallen infamous dacoit Sultana Daku. Shahid Khan is eventually murdered by the young owner of the coal mines, Ramadhir Singh, setting off a power struggle between the two clans that lasts till the final reel. Quentin Tarantino once said in an interview - "Violence is the purest form of emotion.... it has no moralities or politics attached to it". Gangs of Wasseypur also pays homage to his lines and turns out to be a blatantly violent film. The reality with which violence has been depicted in the movie makes it a heart pounding and an authentic piece of work. There is never a dull moment in the film as its funny and entertaining to the core some of the scenes are so funny that it will literally delight the viewer.The director has to be given full marks for covering a span of 50 years in a single film with very beautifully presenting the changing times by showing the film posters and using old classic songs in the background of scenes and letting the viewer to think and wonder about the time period. Piyush Mishra as Sutradhaar of the film very cleverly narrates the story and changing times. GOW is so smartly paced and articulately presented that even due to its long running time the viewer will be engaged and will be left craving to see more till the last reel.Talking about the performances, Manoj Bajpayee delivers a winning act as a fiery, dangerous, casanova bihari gangster whose only motive is to avenge his father's death. He has actually elevated the whole movie by leaps and bounds, his performance mesmerizes and delivers shock and delight in equal measures. Richa Chadha is actually a revelation as Sardar Khan's wife, she is actually a fire cracker as Nagma in the film her scenes with Manoj Bajpayee are one of the high points of the film. Piyush Mishra is a treat to watch in a restrained performance as Sardar Khan's uncle.Tigmanshu Dhulia surprises as a corrupt Politician Ramadhir Singh he proves that not only he is an ace director but a fantastic actor also. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is excellent as Faizal Khan , Huma Qureshi is looking very beautiful and is fantastic in one of a scene where she first confronts Faizal Khan for making advances on her and then very sweetly gives in after wards. We will be seeing more of Nawazuddin and Huma in the second part later this year.Moving onto the technical part, the music of the film is a masterstroke of a soundtrack kudos to Sneha Khanwalkar for making raw, folkish songs interlaced with western beats. Everybody are rooting for Jiya Tu and Hunter Song well yes they both are brilliant tracks but my favorite is Keh Ke Lunga.. this venomous song brilliantly sung by Amit Trivedi and Sneha Khanwalkar sets the mood of the film right from the word go.Womaniya is naughty as hell and talks about the feminine brilliance. Film is very beautifully shot courtesy Rajeev Ravi's consummate camera-work his camera always seems to be in the right spot to capture the action. Dialogues are fire and very desi full of expletives which makes the film very authentic and real. Screenwriters Anurag Kashyap, Zeishan Quadri, Akhilesh Jaiswal and Sachin Ladia has to be given full marks for writing pacy and fantastic screenplay and story. Last but not the least Director Anurag Kashyap's penchant for deep, dark and daring makes this film a class act. He created a brand of its own with real and hard hitting films like Black Friday, Gulaal , No Smoking and Dev D previously but Gangs of Wasseypur actually breaks the convention and clichs of Indian cinema and reinvents the mainstream and commercial cinema.Lastly the final thoughts to culminate this review will be that please don't afford to miss this one. This blood feud vendetta saga shocks, entertains and mesmerizes.</fullReview>

The people who say this movie is a crap definitely did not understand the movie properly. Anurag Kashyap at his best (Don't ask who is he. Thats the dumbest question to ask after watching the movie.)Manoj Bajpayee at his best after his memorable performance in "Satya". But I do agree that this film is not for family audience. If u want to watch it, watch it alone. And about the filthy dialogues in the film. These dialogues are not included in the film just for fun, or just to get some laughs from the audience. They are included because they are necessary for the context of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Animosity is a great equalizer; the feeling doesn't discriminate between caste, religion or economic background. Two enemies are men on a mission and anything or anyone else in their way is collateral damage."Keep your friends close and your enemies closer", Sardar Khan (played by Manoj Bajpai) lives by this philosophy seeking revenge from his closest enemy Ramadhir Singh (played by Tigmanshu Dhulia), a vicious politician and chief of a large coal mafia based in the coal capital of India, Dhanbad. The movie starts with the elimination of Faisal Khan and his family in 2004 and backtracks to 1941 Wasseypur. The animosity between Sardar Khan and Ramadhir Singh dates back to the 1950's when Shahid Khan, Sardar Khan's father, who works for the coal mafia leader Ramadhir Singh is killed by him. Sardar Khan then vows not give his arch enemy an easy death but finish his strength and then his life gradually. "Teri Keh ke Loonga" is how he proclaims he will seek his revenge ? To screw his life like man from the front and not stab him in the back like a coward.The rest of the movie revolves around both minor and major encounters between the two protagonists. The confrontations are both sinister and hilarious between these equally dangerous men. Anurag Kashyap has brilliantly delivered these difficult scenes with utmost simplicity that sometimes you can miss the subtle hints. Songs are well placed and in the background, Hunter &amp; Womaniya are my personal favourites. The swearing and cuss words are never out of place and go with the local lingo.This is out &amp; out a Manoj Bajpai movie; he is brilliant in simple scenes, from fighting and killing a muscleman in the middle of a market, to where he seduces his second wife Reema Sen while she is washing clothes. He is playful and sinister at the same time. Tigmanshu Dhulia (well known as director of the recent hit Paan Singh Tomar) as the coal mafia leader delivers an impactful performance with minimum dialogues and maximum expressions. The surprise package in this one is Richa Chadda, (Dolly from Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye), playing the character of Manoj Bajpai's first wife is as naughty and as mysterious as her husband's character, at times swearing more than him. The supporting cast is brilliant and every character is a natural from the train driver in 1941 to the silent assassin, Yadavjee, who keeps making his appearance at important junctures in the movie. The man to look out for in Gangs of Wasseypur 2 is Nawazuddin Siddiqui (the no nonsense intelligence officer Khan in Kahaani), playing the role of Sardar Khan's younger son Faisal khan leaves a mark albeit a brief role in this part. Yashpal Sharma does an unforgettable cameo as an item boy on the yesteryears song Salam-e-Isq from Muqaddar ka Sikander.I had been waiting to watch this movie after such rave reviews and finally got a chance to see it last night. Watching a movie with such high expectations a lot of times backfires like the country-made revolvers which are used by the gangsters and as they say in the movie "Katte ka pipe fat ke flower ho jaata hai". But this one was like a slow poison, gradually making its impact as it starts and so subtle that by the time you realize you are totally hooked on and attached to the characters. The climax leaves you hungry for more and I am desperate for the second part to be released.A secret: Don't walk out of the cinema hall when the credits are rolling. If you are patient and stay till the end, you will be treated to the trailer of Gangs of Wasseypur 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason why GANGS OF WASSEYPUR will not immediately take its rightful place in the pantheon of Hindi cinema as one of the most daring, visionary, innovative and masterful films that Bollywood has ever produced, is because it is too long (at 2 hours 40 minutes) for kids looking for a fun way to while away a couple of hours, too gory for adults looking for "wholesome family entertainment", too complex even for movie critics who have to chew their pens all through the film, struggling to come up with catchy phrases to describe the film with, a film whose plot defies explanation, whose characters defy categorization, a film whose very existence, proves without a doubt, that Anurag Kashyap is not only a genius, but a mad, psychotic genius at that. GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is Anurag Kashyap's gift to the torrent-crazy cinema buffs of India. This film deserves (and requires) an audience prepared to give it the time and attention it needs, an audience which has gone in for the experience and nothing more, an audience which has gone in without moral inhibitions and an audience which can appreciate Kashyap's shattering of certain cinematic traditions and embracing of others, which makes the film such a delightful watch.It would be incongruous, having called the plot too complex to explain, if I tried to do just that (i.e. explain), and indeed the task exceeds my ability. The massive, epic behemoth of a screenplay details the decades-long blood feud between Sardar Singh (Manoj Bajpai) and Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia), making detours into the workings of the coal mafia of Dhanbad, train-robbers, badland politics, romance, seduction and infidelity. These detours have been criticized by many critics, calling it the reason why the film is self-indulgent, overlong and needlessly complex. But it is those little moments, not really important in progressing the plot (and in the hands of a more commercial-minded director, would probably have been snipped) but magical in exposition of character, like a slow-mo dream sequence where two people reciprocate their mutual attraction by putting on matching Ray-Bans, or another scene where Sardar and his mates humiliate Ramadhir and his son in a police station, and then gleefully walk into jail as punishment (which jail they later break out of). It has to be admitted, perhaps, that the editing scissors may have been sharpened in some places, but there is not much that can be cut off, which would not decrease the overall impact of the film. The film is a gargantuan experience, an epic in the truest sense of the term, an ambitious chronicle of the dusty hinterland of India over the period of six decades. And what's more, unlike most epics, not for one moment, did I realize how long the film was. It is that rare thing, a gripping epic thriller.The acting is spectacularly good, whether it be Richa Chadda as Sardar's long-suffering feisty wife, Reemma Sen as Durga the seductress, Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Sardar's Michael Corleone-esque son, or Piyush Mishra as Sardar's uncle. But the meatiest two roles in the film, played by Bajpai and Dhulia, are transcendent. Dhulia stuns as the powerful mine owner-to-politician, spitting out expletives with a quiet venomous voice, so that waves of hate seem to emanating from the big screen. And what to say about the erstwhile Mumbai ka Don, Bhiku Mhatre? With one of his most powerful roles in recent times, Manoj Bajpai makes every second of his screen time count, running the gamut of emotions with the ease of a maestro, from lust to rage. His eyes say it all.The behind-the-scenes departments are phenomenal here. Full marks to Sneha Khanwalkar's exquisite and innovative soundtrack, with songs like Hunter and Keh Ke Lunga (the movie's theme song, so to say), which break every tradition in Bollywood music, and complement the visuals beautifully. The production design by Wasiq Khan is also flawless, capturing the colours and textures of India's Hindi belt from the 1930s to the 80s. The mise en scene is spot on in every frame of the film, from the blood-spattered Kasai mohalla of the Qureshis to the white Ambassador of Ramadhir Singh. Kudos also the exquisite cinematography. Kashyap and his DOP Rajeev Ravi (No Smoking) create a restless roving camera, which swoops up and down and in and out in a delightful array of moves, some of which I have no idea how they did. The opening scene where a house is riddled with bullets and hand grenades, men poking rifles through holes in the doors and firing in every direction, is shocking in the immediacy of the violence. You are not just watching the scene, you are in it.The film is filled with cinematic homages from a Disco Dancer-era Mithun impersonator to the last scene of the film, which is uncannily similar to the scene from The Godfather where Sonny Corleone gets assassinated. The shadow of The Godfather looms large over this film, many characters fitting the moulds of Vito Corleone, Tom Hagen or Michael Corleone. There is even a blood-thirsty Virgil Sollozzo-type among the multitude of characters in the film. But unlike Sarkar, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is not a Godfather remake. This is a film unique to India, a story of an Indian town in the lawless badlands. As a cinematic experience, it stands tall beside Coppola's classic and calls out to be considered an equal. At last, we have a Bollywood film (and make no mistake, this is a masala potboiler at its very best), that can flick the best of world cinema in the nuts. Now that is as good a reason to see the film as any. Long live the King of Alternative Bollywood, Anurag Kashyap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best part of the movie is such minor detailing. The era shown from 1940's to 2004 is wonderful. This is the best manoj bajpai has acted after satya. The direction of anurag kasyap is very impressive. Music is good. The great part is bihar is shown perfectly. Great cinematography. Parts of Movie are gruesome, not for the faint hearted. As it is based on true story the mindset of the people of wasseypur is very raw. Some parts make you feel how can a person be so ghastly. The epic to show the small time thugs become such a big gangster is unique. My only concern is the movie is too fast, however some wonderful acting and inch perfect detailing stills the show. For me this the best movie of 2012 till date</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was presented very honestly by Anurag, as said in the disclaimer movie is based on the story and report heard from the people and read in local news paper. And this fact was reflecting in the movie and presented really well.Although a lot of efforts were made to give a look and feel of Jharkhand, a common Jharkhand man like me will still find it hard to be connected with the cinematography of the movie. Music will be a exception here the work of Sneha Khanwalkar is truly exceptional.This movie should be considered as a milestone in Indian cinema, as well as in Anurag Carrier. From here Anurag will always struggle to meets this standard in future. Talent and effort of many actors like Richa Chadda,Pankaj Tripathi, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Jaideep Ahlawat is payed off in this movie. A huge expectation is build for the second part, looking forward to watch the character of Piyush Mishra, Timangshu, Nawazuddin in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening scene will take you in the time in which the incident is happening, TV serial is used as an element to show time and space and also the whole theme of film "Ik peedhi aati hai, ik peedhi jaati hai, banti kahani nai"(One generation comes other goes, creates new story). First sequence gives a feel of war film or video game. At some parts it is little difficult to understand the narration. Film will also give a feel of TV serial sometimes rather than a film. Very close to reality,a documentary style which is Anurag Kashyap's style. Beautiful use of camera, good art and costume. Songs are beautifully fixed into the story and its nice to see how they merge into as background music. Humor has been created with silence and at some parts with violence, appreciate the performance of actors who handled the piece beautifully. Abuses are an important part which brings the film very close to reality. Also somewhere the spine of film gets weak, because of so many characters. Overall its a gripping film, one can even watch both parts together without getting bored. Music, action and dialogues may take away the real story away from your vision but be with it. I also felt that film is like a collaboration of short films, where different incidents are happening at several places, stories want to say so much but they are just stuffed in. Film is also lacking emotions of sorrow, they hardly transfer to the spectator. With the film moving forward, the main purpose of protagonist seems to be forgotten by him, and story starts revolving around some other unimportant issues. Film is like Mahabharat of kalyug. In male dominating society woman becomes reason for most wars. It is important to see both parts together to understand the whole thing. Or I will say both parts together is one film, which should be released together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap has done it once again. For those, who thought "DevD" was worthy of the TOI rating of 5/5. GOW deserves a rating of 100/100. A movie can't be bigger than this, bigger not in terms of budget, but in terms of ambitions. I was completely blown away by this epic saga and have ran out of vocabulary when it comes to praise this movie.The story starts with a bang. Indian villages of British era were never so authentic since the last time they were shown in Gandhi(1982). Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat) sets the pace of a gory battle that will eventually be continued till the next 60 years. Ramadhir Singh(Tigmanshu Dhulia) gets every nuances rights of his character of a Bhumihar landlord. There is not much story, to be honest, but it's the screenplay that overpowers everything, it gives us characters that will etched in one's memory days after leaving the theater. The sets, locations, dialect, accent literally takes you to Bihar. Whether it's 1941's Bengal or 2004's Jharkhand, the essence of the movie remains hardcore Bihari. However, this isn't completely a grim movie about the then prevalent anarchy in the state. The movie also showers us with some colorful characteristic of the state, such as, Mithun worshiping or the innocent love affairs(Danish's love at first sight and Faisal's interactions with Mohsina). The way they looked into each other's eyes with "salaam- e-ishq" playing in background to the way entire scene at the pond when he touches her hand are a delight to watch. Nawazuddin Siddiqui shines in his short role though it is evident he is going to be at center-stage in part II. There are numerous sequences that will remains etched in your memory for a long time, especially most of the scenes with Richa Chadhha(playing Bajpai's wife).Reema Sen showed village sensuality in a way never seen before. The music of this movie is strange, as it not exactly a bollywood music, which allows people to go to bathroom or to go for a smoke. Here each song is an integral part of the movie. All songs are short and takes the story forward. However the best part of the music was the use of old songs in the narrative, e.g., "Kasam paida karne wale ki" title song. You have to watch it to believe it the way it was shown in the film.There is no point writing the story here as this is not a story driven movie, This is a character driven movie and characters with powerful actors. Kahsyap has calculative selected his cast as every actor has given a marvelous performance. However I felt bad for Yashpal Sharma, he should have been given a proper character and now let's talk about the Amitabh of this Trishul, even though Waheeeda, Sanjeev, Shashi and Hema played such beautiful characters, the film would have been nothing sans Bachchan. Same goes for Amitabh of this movie, Manoj Bajpai. I have no adjectives to describe his performance. His role was the strongest and he didn't let his director down but then, he always have been a terrific actor, it's the directors who fail to give him a strong role. I still remember his "maa'm, maa'm" from "Kaun", which I think one of his most underrated performances. The way he has been shown in the climax will give goosebumps to every person sitting in the theater, the song "Jiya ho bihar ke lala" comes at this juncture and it is one of the finest climaxes ever in the history of Indian cinema. Overall, GOW is a movie so damn brilliant, it needs to be seen in order to be believed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur - Definitely worth a watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gangs of Wasseypur" reflects the tumultuous era of the 1970s in the coal mining district of Dhanbad and its surrounding region. The movie portrays the dark days of the gang war era of the region. Anurag Kashyap successfully brings out the temperament of those gory days through skillful direction supported by a gritty storyline. Though primarily a revenge story, the offbeat feel of the movie makes it a gripping experience altogether.The story goes like this. Sardar Khan, played by Manoj Vajpayee, is the lead character in the movie. His only aim is to seek revenge for his father's death from Ramadheer Singh, a businessman-turned-politician, played by Timangshu Dhulia. The film revolves around the life of Sardar Khan, his marriage and re-marriage, the butcher gang and introducing his son to the world of gang war.The movie starts with introducing us to Wasseypur and then the plots shifts to the main story by introducing the main characters. The background is always the coal-mafia and helps the film with its original and mystical setting. The movie begins from the British Raj and then moves on to the post independence present era. This reflects the vengeance which has been passed from one generation to another. Here, one negative point about the movie is that you feel you have missed something even if you miss one scene. The storytelling might be a bit on the faster side as there is so much to show.Syed Zeishan Quadri, Akhilesh Jaiswal, Sachin Ladia and Anurag Kashyap have written an excellent script which is very innovative in its own way. It reflects the various shades in the character of Sardar Khan, from being a womanizer to a caring father and a ruthless gang leader. Interestingly, the film also shares its unique brand of humor. The direction of Anurag Kashyap is worth applauding. The scenes are very crisp and short; no fancy entries, nothing extravagant about the look of any character. There is lots of blood but none to make the matters sensational. The music score by Sneha Khanwalkar is a treat in itself. The music merges beautifully with the story and the background and gives the audience a unique experience of being one with the characters. The entire crew is exceptional and brings the characters alive. Over all, Gangs of Wasseypur is a movie worth watching.</fullReview>

The swear words are like the actor is himself given the right to add ON_SPOT swears. The story up till 4th generation embedding in just 2.5 hours is actually a achievement in itself. Tigmanshu Dhulia proves that good directors can also be excellent actors. The movie is actually a 5 hour 40 minutes and if it would have been released in one shot,it would have definitely grabbed my attention for sure. Work of both the actresses is outstanding.The sexual crave is given a hidden shadow over violence and betrayal of husband. The whole 1900 period atmosphere is perfectly captured with rustic style of clothes and scenario. The start of the movie is a perfect sarcasm depicting a 2000 based serial into 1800 era show.The famous Indian daily soap build a curious mood and the next immediate scene has a gunshot into the TV.Outstanding direction.The young actors have also done an appreciable work and the part 2 would be equipped with a lot of modern weapons i guess. Cannot wait more for release of Part- 2. Do watch. 9/10 (Just because profit was given more preference than releasing the whole movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur - Celebration of Revenge in a never-seen-before way in Indian Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur: Spread across 6 decades, 'Gangs of Wasseypur' (GOW) is a revenge saga narrated as raw as possible with violence, gore, filthy dialogs. So are my readers already wondering why I would give it 5 on 5? As a movie lover, the reason is that, it is indeed raw, on-your-face, violent, gory and laden with filth and betrayal. How else is a Mafia-revenge saga supposed to be? To have attempted to make a movie with such a subject is worth praise, and to have made it in a way that the Tarantinos of the world will get a run for their money is another thing all together. GOW premiered in the Director's fortnight at Cannes this year and the movie is a proof that Indian cinema is not just running around the trees and the 'Khan's, Kapoor's and Kleavage'. The movie starts in the current era and takes us 60 years back to the British era, where the Coal mafia is born and sets the background for the movie. Money, Power and Sex are three vices which have always existed, and the characters in the movie are driven by these. Born of these vices are corruption, greed, lust and revenge. The movie showcases the birth of Coal mafia in pre-Independence and its growth post Independence, Scrap trade, trade unions in the free India and how the hunger for Power and Money has corroded our society. The story of Wasseypur is not a far reality from the rest of the country. The characters of the movie are etched to perfection, be it the men in the movie - Sultana Daku, Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), Ramadhir Singh(Tigmanshu Dhulia), Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) or the women - Najma (Richa Chadda) and Durga (Reemma Sen). They are not graceful and their tongue is laden with filth. But what else is expected out of a society of people who live in blood and gore! Hats off to all these actors to have pulled of their roles to such perfection. When you see the movie you see Sardar Khan and not Manoj Bajpai, which is a great achievement since he is the only most familiar face of Bollywood in the movie. It surprised me to see his washboard abs, which otherwise is such a selling point for our Khans and Kapoors, was never mentioned in the promos of the movie. The dialogs and the background score of the movie just enhances the movie watching experience. Some of my favourites were mouthed by Najma, Sultan and Sardar Khan. The scene which cuts into India's Independence is one of my favourites in the movie (Won't say what it is here, pls watch the movie to experience it for yourself). Sneha Khanwalkar's music just blends with the movie like salt in water. My favourite tracks are 'Hunter', 'Womeniya' and 'Bihar ke lala'. The surprise package of the movie was Tigmanshu Dhulia, who has given us movies like 'Haasil', 'Sahib, Biwi aur Gangstar' and 'Paan Singh Tomar', showcasing his acting talent. His look is menacing and the scene where he beats up his son is so believable. I am sure more movies are going to be coming his way and would love to see more of such thrilling performances from him. And lastly what can I say which is already not being said about Anurag Kashyap - The Man who had the guts to show us that Devdas, Paro and Chandramukhi were all driven by lust! He indeed is a gifted director who has the vision to put on screen, what I call the 'celebration of Revenge' in Indian cinema in a never-seen-before way. Take a bow Anurag, 'Kasam Paida karne wale ki', you are making Indian Cinema and movie lovers like me swell in pride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangs OF Wasseypur is a typical Hindi movie of Eastern Indian slang and Bihari mannerisms.The movie resembles a bit in plot to RGV's 'Raktha Charithra',but that was based on a political vengeance of AP origin and this had its Bihari features like Village love, Enjoyable vulgarity and the vengeance part was violent and realistic.It mainly revolves around Muslim families whose culture was depicted very lucratively and background of the movie was new.Castwise, Manoj Bajpayee was at his best retrieving his capability as a lead role player and the other actors were decent as they weren't the crowd-pulling actors but sure they were crowd-moving actors.Actresses were pretty and played their part well.Cinematography was innovative and interesting too.The only problem with the movie being the Hindi accent which is difficult for novice Hindi learners like Hyderabadis ( Maddus).The climax was a bit prolonged though as it ended abruptly giving pavement to 'GOW 2'. But,surely this movie is a must-watch for all kinds of youth who believe that director( Anurag Kashyap ) makes a movie good or bad and the cast make only extra collections.Surely waiting for GOW 2 Rate it : 3.5/5 My rating: 3/5(as I faced problem with Hindi accent)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With people bringing in movies without any story, just for entertainment, here comes Anurag Kashyap with an entertainer of his own. The movie is abstract in its kind and the plot is quite raw. Manoj Bajpai steals the dhow with touch of brilliance from Tigmanshu Dhulia. Excellent se bhi upar SUPER excellent movie! Anurag should continue what he does best! The story traces its background to the 'bahubali' era of Bihar and easily narrates the rise of criminals in politics. Richa Chaddha is perfect for the bold role. Every scene in the film has a meaning and it shapes the movie pretty well. the ending could have been better though. Music by Sneha Khanwalkar is very good. specially the 'Womaniya' song. Manoj Tiwari takes the song Jiya ho Bihar ke lala to the next level with his lively voice. Overall a great movie, a genre which should be encouraged in India.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People have been heaping praises on it and comparing to works of some great names. Tarantino is frequently invoked, and so were Coppola, and Scorsese. Is this a bastardization of those films with Hindi cuss words? Is this an "art film"? Or is this a Bollywood potboiler?In one of best scenes of the film, Manoj Bajpayee's character publicly threatens and humiliates Tigmanshu Dhulia's character on a megaphone. And a man is gyrating to Mithun's "Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki". It is a bully making a threat, a guy who is attempting to get popular rage directed against a politician, and a romanticization of 80's bollywood, all in one scene. And the language is utterly foul.It's easy to get distracted by the bad language of this film. It's also easy to forget you are watching a film. This often feels like a documentary. But wait, that's a compliment. It takes it's time to get going, delves deep into the history of gang violence in Dhanbad region, and it's so detailed in each period that it could easily be a film made in those times. But it could't, really. Because no one made this kind of cinema then, and few enough make such cinema now.On its surface, this is a simple revenge story. Dig just a little deeper though, and its a comment on how Bihar in particular, and our country in general have come to be dominated by dirty politicians and gangsters. Its triumph is that it is typically Indian, comfortable with contradictions. This is a film that straddles between the big picture politics and domestic drama; between grimy reality and flights of fancy, and between brutal violence and laugh out loud humor.In the end, however, it's a story of a bunch of powerful characters. Everyone is comparing this to Tarantino because of the collection of badass characters. The gangsters, the politician, and the women. The gangsters are powerful, but always end up being overpowered by their women. To see where the power lies, watch the scene where Bajpayee's character is forced out of his chair by his wife played by Richa Chaddha. Or the scene where a budding gangster is chastised by his date for touching her.Some characters speak with their silences. Reemma Sen is silent, except when she is enraged. A gun seller who pivots the plot of two major characters doesn't speak a word throughout the film. And in one of the crucial scenes, where he is seeing his arch enemy clearly for the first time, Dhulia's silence is most eloquent.From the philosophical "Ik Bagal" to gyrating "Womaniya" via the naughty "Hunter", the music is as eloquent as any. Sneha Khanwalkar stays true not only to the mood, but also to the era in question. So does the background music. Some of the action shots have the full on 80's vibe.Could it have been shorter? Sure. Could it have done with a little less self-indulgence? Sure. Did it leave us unsatisfied because we have to wait for part 2? Yes.But the real question is whether this is Bollywood. It has everything: comedy, romance, family drama, violence, clash of strong characters, and scintillating music. What it doesn't have is escapism. It keeps you totally and thoroughly in the bad, brutal world even during its flights of fancy. But hey, this is India. We redefine ourselves every few years. Kudos, Anurag Kashyap. This will be remembered in the history of Indian films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap has given Indian cinema a gem in the form of Gangs of wasseypur. This is an answer to Movie like City of God and mostly to Scorsese and Tarantino The story spans 7 decades of rivalry between the family of Shahid khan and Ramadhir Singh in the town of Wasseypur and Dhanbad.It has everything revenge,ambition, gang wars, crime, hatred, politics,comedy, love. Do not miss this movie at any cost, it doesn't get any better than this. The acting from Manoj bajpayee is at its best, but Nawazuddin siddhaqui steals the show winning everyones heart with his brilliant performance.This movie has given him recognition and is becoming more and more favorite of everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Short of a Grand Epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with such juicy characters, music, cinematography, dialogues etc., this film certainly slips into your 'favorites list' as soon as you have seen the end credits or may be long before it.I have watched it at least 6-7 times and its not even been a year of its release. Certainly, the Hero of this film assures us that if you have good taste then you'll surely find my work delicious and ahead is a great scope for great cinemas. I hope you know who the real Hero of this film is.I have always admired Dibakar Banerjee(my favorite), Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Farhan Akhtar and Shimit Amin but Anurag Kashyap was heavily ignored by me and now I feel sorry for it. I think these people are equally competitive when it comes to International Cinema.The actors in the film were at par with powerhouses, especially Manoj Bajpayee, Nawaz, Richa Chaddha, Pankaj Tripathi and Tigmanshu Dhulia. The script was so well researched.I saw the Making of the film which was released last month, and it was such a wonderful experience watching it too. I came to know that both the parts were made in a very tight budget of 18 crore, which is certainly an impossible thing to be done by Dharma and Yashraj. It was so kind of Mr. Kashyap to let us take a look at some of the tricky scenes and shots of the film.Thanks for Such an Unforgettable Cinematic Experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone in the Cannes Film Festival said that 'Gangs of Wasseypur puts Tarantino in a corner with its cool command of cinematically-inspired and referenced violence, ironic characters and breathless pace', how right she was. The son of Hollywood-Bollywood Anurag Kashyap has made this path breaking work of art as one of the best movies in recent times. Gangs of Wasseypur 1 had Sardar Khan i.e Manoj Bajpai all over it. Manoj Bajpai starts off saying that he won't let a hair grow on his head until he takes revenge on Ramadhir Singh for his father's assassination but later in the end of the film he himself is assassinated by Qureshi under the instruction of Ramadhir Singh. GOW 2 starts off where Danish Khan(Sardar's Eldest son) is planning to take revenge but eventually gets himself killed in the action. Meanwhile Faizal Khan was growing into a drug addict and one speech from his mother Nagma suddenly indulges him to take up weapon in one hand and keep ganja on the other. Faizal's journey from nobody to the who's who of Wasseypur is shown with the help of a three minuite speech by the narrator which somewhat fails to unfold his character properly ,but still Nawazuddin Siddique has pulled off another gem through his acting. Though an improperly portrayed character of Faizal is pulled off by Siddique with sheer genius but Durga's (Sardar Khan's second wife) son Definite definitely steals the show. Starting from the uprising of Singh-Khan feud by the assassination of Shahid Khan to the birth of a vengeful Sardar Khan- from the rise of Sardar Khan as a "face you should fear" to his assassination at the hands of Ramadhir- from the rise of Danish,Faizal,Perpendicular,Definite ,Tangent to the dramatic and stylish assassination of Ramadhir Singh , Gangs of Wasseypur series definitely had all the spice in it to be earmarked as an epic trend-setter in the history of film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched some of the legendary movies from Hollywood and the elements which makes them legendary is what I find with Gangs of Wasseypur. It is : 1. The honesty in depiction of a story with suitable characters and adherence to the plot. 2. Not succumbing to the temptation of attracting large family audience to earn more money. 3. Showing what is exact, without any cosmetic changes.Anurag Kashyap had to include some necessary 'entertaining' moments to hold the audience, but it didn't look a deliberate attempt and indeed mingled well with the plot. GoW talks about a revengeful attitude that percolates to many generations. There are villages in India where this attitude stays for decades as the political struggle for domination over masses continues aided by weak law and order situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This blast will echo for decades &amp; be heard by people across the globe. This is why I watch movies, every once in a while I stumble upon such a masterpiece which moves me to tears. You would feel emotionally drained as if rug had been pulled from under your feet &amp; will take you by surprise. Had it not been a bollywood production this masterpiece would've been in IMDb top 10. Probably the best &amp; most important film from bollywood/Hollywood put together. This film will make anyone think hard about how not to take things for granted and it is really heartwarming without being soppy. The music is worthy of praise too, the raw emotion and feeling is amply conveyed.A few simple paragraphs cannot truly describe the significant achievement of this film &amp; I felt compelled to write a review soon after watching it. After some persuasion from friends I finally got to see it &amp; have been recommending to others ever since. When it comes to movies I'am quite picky &amp; very hard to please guy. There have been occasions where I have literally walked out of the theatre &amp; times where I felt like I have wasted my time. I often watch movies on solid recommendations &amp; tend to follow certain directors &amp; cast. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is. It is a moving film which will shake you from inside. A real must-see. Amazing story brilliant performances.Very rarely it happens that movies are made that are very simple in expression but possess monumental appeal this fact is truthfully exemplified in this movie. Enough good things can't be said about this movie. It is undoubtedly one of the best and most moving films ever made. One of the most memorable and wonderful movies of the century. I can't say enough good things about this film I really can't - I mean it. Its one of my personal top ten films of all time. There is not another film more deserving of solid 10/10 in the list than Gangs of Wasseypur. Thank you so so much Mr Anurag Kashyap for having wonderfully put together this incredible masterpiece.</fullReview>

This the most perfect film Bollywood has ever produced...The film goes through the lives of gangsters and goons...instead of just showing their activities(which all bollywood films does), this film takes you through the pain, sense, feeling of the lives of those gangsters. I did a really really lot of research of those Bihar gang wars and have concluded that the film tells 75% of the truth....moreover HATS HATS off to my favourite director ANURAG KASHYAP SIR for excellent cinematography (that hawk-eye view of filming !!!), filming, screenplay, story and the whole package.....and of-course to the reality in the film that he has shown... And lastly I want to say that this film changed my life...after this film released, I started watching only sensible and reality films...THANKS TO SIR A. KASHYAP...!

Each character in the movie has a different shade of human. Manoj Vajpayee is great as usual. Nawazuddin was hardly known before GoW. Timanshu was only known as good director. After watching GoW, i say he is much better actor than a director. Piyush Mishra proved why he deserves respect in the industry. Great dialogues. Teri keh ki luga,,, tumse na hoga Beta... Great Street music:: This movie is a career change for Nawazuddin, Richa, Hema Qureshi. I want to see all of them again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was a movie that gave a real feel of the crime in Bihar without actually having to be a part of the crime itself, it is this one. This story is the sort that needs to be seen and told at the same time - and it is how Anurag Kashyap chooses to go about his job. The beauty of the movie is that there is no single hero in this movie. Each character is imperfect and yet lends to the whole that is the movie. While the language may be abrasive and the expression rustic, the movie as a whole delivers an experience. Manoj Bajpai delivers a stupendous performance as Sultan Khan, but that can be said of all the others in this movie as well. Just a warning though. This is definitely not a movie to take your kids to!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I call a real bold step towards true wholesome cinematic experience in Bollywood. Anurag Kashyap is known for his out of the box storytelling ability and he has taken this to greater Heights with Gangs. Based on real cum fictional story Gangs show you what real Bihar was few decades back. My few friends are from Bihar and while watching the film I can actually relate to their conversation. The film is all about brilliant moments and they are numerous that you wont give a damn about the story. You will feel entertained by some mind blowing dialogues which I can only say 2nd to sholay. I have seen many Sunny Deol Movies with meaningless dialogues please don't compare with them. Anurag Kashyap's hardwork shows, he has done immense research which you can experience it on the way everything is shown in detail. Bang On characterization, well timed songs, witty and funny dialogues, brilliant script and direction. This film is going to take away all filmfares this year. Strictly for adults must watch guys in theatre as I don't think Indian Govt will allow this movie to be aired on television. Don't miss it. I am eagerly waiting for its ultimate part bring it on Anurag.</fullReview>

Wanted to see more of this brilliant actor. Nawazuddin : M w8in fr that second part, where you play the protagonist, cuz I believe you can play any role after Kahaani :)Cons : 1. Length. Some people may find it tiring to digest 2.40 hrs long movie. 2. Some background songs have been recorded on a high volume, which irritates the viewers sometimes. Pros: 1. Anurag Kashyap 2. Manoj Bajpayee 3. Richa Chadha 4. Mast music</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for its execution, performances, music and dialogues BUT don't expect something fresh in its story content.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GANGS OF WASSEYPUR also tries to walk on that thin line between the meaningful and entertaining cinema which in fact turns out to be a worth watching project due to its execution, performances, music and dialogues, but at the same time doesn't has anything fresh to offer in terms of concept, storyline or script. Following the path already discovered in Hindi Cinema by Ram Gopal Varma in his Rakt Charitra Part 1 &amp; Part 2 releasing in the gap of two months, Anurag decides to go the same way with his GOW Part 1 &amp; 2. But for some undisclosed reasons he doesn't mention this two part film in GOW's posters or promotion as was boldly done by RGV. Anurag's films have always been region based projects featuring subjects revolving around cities like Mumbai, Rajasthan, Punjab and more. So following the same trend, this time he takes us to a rather lesser known region of Wasseypur (Dhanbad) and its coal mine industry dealing in gang wars. The film gives you no time to settle down and simply starts off with a long bloody sequence of guns, murders and bloodshed. But then it takes too much time of almost 40 minutes to tell you the background of the story and the lead actors enter the screen only after this initial hiccup. The first half mainly deals with defining the basis of all the rivalry going on with small references of the Coal-mining history starting from the British era. Thankfully, the director comes into his form post intermission and gives you many more striking sequences which are surely not for the faint hearted. There are more brutal murders and the deadly gang wars continue till the next generation which somehow also gives you a feeling of being repetitive. Further, the length of close to 3 hours leads to a little restlessness as it moves towards the climax. But 3 things truly save the film despite of having all the routine content as far as the storyline is concerned.First being the execution/direction, including the way it has been brilliantly shot making you feel the rustic ambiance of the locations. Particularly the second half which has more happening on the screen as compared to the first. The writing is noteworthy with dialogues written exactly in the way they are spoken in such remote areas with all those cuss words. Second are the performances by the entire cast excelling their own previous acts undoubtedly. Lead from the front by Manoj Bajpayee, GOW would not have been possible without him for sure. The actor plays his role with such ease and conviction that you are bound to ask that from where he actually belongs from. Along with Manoj stands tall, a surprisingly competent performance from the director of PAAN SINGH TOMAR, Tigmanshu Dhulia, who is truly mesmerizing. With his superb act he clearly reveals the secret that why all the actors always come out with such great award winning performances in his directed movies. That's because he himself knows the art so well. Completing the trio is Piyush Mishra, who once again reminds the industry the power house of talent within himself of being an actor, writer, lyricist, singer and composer. In the supporting cast, Jaideep Ahlawat, Jameel Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Vipin Sharma &amp; Yashpal Sharma (in a cameo) are really great sinking deep into their respective characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui gets into the limelight towards the climax and looks like he is going to be the surprise package of GOW-II (as shown in the trailer). In the female lead, there is another power packed performance from Richa Chadda, who is still remembered as the OYE LUCKY LUCKY OYE girl. But after this movie, she is sure going to be called as GANGS OF WASSEYPUR girl. Reema Sen superbly provides the much needed subtle, sensuality to the project and so does Huma Qureshi who has a much meatier role in Part II. Last but not the least comes the Soundtrack of the film by the extremely talented Sneha Khanwalkar which exactly provides the director what he needed to enhance the overall impact of the film on the viewers. The songs are earthy &amp; folk mixed with the modern arrangement and even sung by the local singers which perfectly suit the mood of the film. Anurag intelligently uses the tracks merged in the background score which neither hinders the pace nor work as an obstacle to his narration.So, GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is sure going to get rave reviews from all corners. But whether the same would be the result on the Box Office or not remains dicey. The film is no doubt exceptional in the way it is presented, enacted and executed. Still its overall theme remains the routine with nothing new to offer to the common viewer and there are too many characters thrown in by the director in his narrative. Hence, it is immensely watchable for everyone interested in something exceptional tried on the screen but at the same time, it also doesn't have any surprises or twists and turns in its clich story content. So, once again the choice is all yours after reading all the energetic write-ups on the film written all over the media.</fullReview>

He has done full justice to his role, his character is dark and devious, at the same time he's romantic and funny, Nawazuddin plays it perfectly.Piyush Mishra is superb in both the parts.Tigmanshu Dhulia (Ramadhir Singh) is marvelous, I didn't even realise that it's his debut film.Richa Chadda was fab in part one but doesn't have much to do in part two.Reemma Sen and Huma Qureshi have done a nice job.Zeishan Quadri (Definite) has played his role very nicely.Aditya Kumar (Perpendicular) is superb.Jaideep Ahlawat (Shahid Khan) in part one had done a very nice work.Pankaj Tripathi, Raj Kumar Yadav, Vineet Kumar, Satya Anand, Vipin Sharma and Anurita Jha have played their roles perfectly.Part one gives some very nice comic relief, Part two also has many 'lol' scenes. Actually I haven't laughed so much even in comedy movies of recent times.Anurag Kashyap proves that he's an outstanding director. He should definitely get opportunities to make big budget films.The sound is awesome and the music is superb especially in part one, Hunter, Bihar Ke Lala, O Womaniya &amp; Tain Tain To To are my favorites from part one and Chhi Cha Ledar, Kala Rey &amp; Electric Piya from part two.I'll rate it 9/10. It's a 'MUST WATCH', excellent flick...!!!!</fullReview>

Expressions of the actors and effects used are very realistic. Also this movie tells a very long story and thus entertains more than other movies. Many actors of the movie are seeing for the first time on a major film but have done a job far better than today's actors. This is real cinema. I do not like today's Bollywood films but this movie has blown my mind. This is the Indian cinema at its best. Crude language and expressions are used at the right time and complete the character the actor is trying to portray. This should be nominated for the Oscar. Not suitable for children and family viewing but is highly recommended for everyone else.</fullReview>

The movie is a class in itself. Director's chair was handled by Anurag Kashyap, n he did it with pretty style. The soundtracks and score in the entire movie is very refreshing and we got to hear something different this time. Performances have been extracted from the actors like never before. Manoj Bajpayee's acting was the best thing in the movie. One more thing you would like in the movie is the 'Attitude'. It's like 'jaan jaye par shaan na jaye' for these guys.

		<fullReview>The opening scene drives the nail in, and pushes it out through the other side. Unflinchingly real and gutsy, gives us a rare glimpse into the gang wars of the rural heartland. Anurag Kashyap has shown us exactly what he intended to, without worrying much about critics, censors, reviews etc. Independent filmmaking at its best. Characters look like they've been recruited, right out of the gangs themselves. However, it's not a movie for those accustomed to KJo, Sugar coated and eye candy movies. Dialogues are coarse, but apt. Not a movie that you would want to watch with your mom. Watch is alone or with a film buff.This movie is no less that any Tarantino or Coen Bro's movies. If you know what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Art movie, Commercial movie or Sci-fi..You get all (Sci-fi coming with the science of bomb making :-)) I couldn't stop watching this movie in spite of aching back, tired eyes, mid night. Got me hooked. Every actor has done justice..no over the top no where you could feel if it was a film..As if you are watching out of your window (if you are or were living in such a place).For me this is one of Manoj's best work till date..amazing ..He is so natural in his role, can't imagine anyone else doing it.Dialogues are superb and so close to everyday talks on the street, makes one connect immediately with the characters.This is a multiple times must watch..Will be a cult classic.Hats off to Anurag, and all those behind the scenes. I wish there is a Director's cut available on discs. An uncut version no matter how long it is...Actually I wish it to be made like a Sas Bahu serial..that can run for ever :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gangland saga from eastern India</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie which takes off a bit like the Doordarshan documentary of the yore which is made tolerable only by the rasping narration of that genius Piyush Mishra. The historical narrative was really unnecessary and could have been dramatically played out in a shorter frame. It not only prolonged the movie but also delayed the development of the main plot, speaking of which I was a tad disappointed. A movie is an audio visual narration of a story. It needs to be different from a television serial. GOW's progress is more of a series of interesting episodes rather than a firm plot. It's another matter that Kashyap has managed to pull it off but at the end of it all one does start wondering about what one has just watched. There is a heavy emphasis on blood and gore and even heavier on profanities under the garb of realism. Oh yes, it had the audience freaking out especially when it's the female character mouthing them. Of late there have been a spate of movies, all relating to the Indo Gangetic Plain, which have freely used the vernacular color to the language more as a shock value rather than depiction of common conversation. I am certainly not a prude but I do shudder to think of what would be the end product if the Punjabi movie makers were to follow suit. Poor Santa and Banta are like soap water to this strong refresher course in abuses. But there's a sequel! The second part, of which a long trailer is shown after the end credits, promises to raise the bar further. And that also brings me to the concept of two part movies. It would be great fun if a saga is played out in different time periods but then each part has to be complete in itself. GOW fails here. Just when you thought things were getting interesting you are left dangling with a promise for more. The extended climax was needless and not in sync with story line that you were following. Maybe redemption follows in the next part. So what makes the movie work? For one it remains faithful to the milieu it is woven around. The spoken language, never mind the ear scorching expletives, does immense credit to the script writer. There is complete irreverence to the gross violence which is offset by the quirky and earthy humor. Extensively shot on location, the background of small towns, ordinary faces caught in extraordinary circumstances and racy dialogs combine to form an interesting potpourri. Mercifully the politicians and the gangsters have not been caricatured. The protagonists are the ordinary people, loving husbands and carnal adventurers who seek to justify every action as divinely decreed. And that sets Anurag Kashyap apart as leading the pack of parallel cinema makers. He manages to combine high drama and recognizable realism. The other makers of gangster sagas in Bollywood (read Ram Gopal Verma) have never been able to get over their obsession with the Godfather series so I am particularly delighted at the prospect of developing our own cult series and I do hope it goes beyond the revenge theme. The performances are power packed without exception. Manoj Bajpayee sizzles as the revenge seeking ordinary driver turned gang lord and his understated approach to the role is near perfect. Tigmanshu Dhulia dons the actor's mantle to portray the character based on Surya Deo Singh and acquits himself as the calculating Mafiosi pretty effectively. The honors however must go to Richa Chadda for her feisty portrayal of Manoj Bajpayee's strong headed wife who reluctantly accepts his philandering ways. She brought the house down when she exhorts him to eat well lest he "under performs" on his nocturnal trysts. Classic one liners like this keep the viewers interest alive just when the play begins to drag a little. I have to spare a few lines for Piyush Mishra. Maybe it's a little premature to say so but for once I am going to stick my neck out and dare to compare him with the all round mad genius of Kishore Kumar. This man is extraordinary. A writer, singer and an actor to boot !! I first saw, nay experienced his genius in Gulaal and was completely taken in by the force of his talent. GOW only further strengthens my belief that we are witnessing the unfolding of a legend. Like the great Kishore, he too does not respect any boundaries to his creative abilities. Just take time out to read his lyrics (for Gulaal as well as GOW) and you will see what I mean. There have been attempts to compare Kashyap with Tarantino which I would think is an insult to our boy. The only movie that makes Tarantino worthy is "Inglorious Bastards". But I have to admire him for the music selection for his films. And that is where he is comparable to our laddie. The music of GOW, so rustic in the Bhojpuri flavor, is a delight. I wonder if you have ever heard names like Sneha Khanwalkar, the Musahar of Sundarpur, Ranjeet Baal Party &amp; Manish Tiwari. They are the guys who bring the tradition of minstrels of Bihar &amp; UP alive. While Piyush Mishra transports you right back to the 50s with his soulful ballad the catchy beats of "Hunter" and "O Womaniya" will have your feet tapping. And then there is the highly unusual "Bhaiyya" which is just a rhythmic beat, at best a Bhojpuri trance fusion. Awesome stuff but everyone is going to talk about the risqu song. If you can ignore the double meaning it is going to ring in your ears for a long time to come. I already have the entire album and am a repeat listener. There is so much to like and/or criticize and so less to ignore. Kashyap is going to be liked by some and hated by others but he is never going to be ignored. Way to go !</fullReview>

It's good to see filmmakers take a more rational and smart approach and really bring out a story in a way it's supposed to be told.

		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap has a way of making movie that may come easily to him but is highly elusive for other current directors of India. This movie is not about making an Indian version of Godfather or gangster movies of yore. It is refreshingly original and true to its roots, be it's cinematography, music or even the acts. This movie has its own sense of comedy, drama, violence and it wont disappoint you. Dialogues as well as music is there to support the screenplay and no more. Direction is articulate and has its own baritone. Divulging parts of stories to justify my points will just be wrong. I would just say that this movie is selectively epiphanic, part wise hilarious and in totality a pure genius. Also I suppose you should go and watch this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film desperately in need of an editor...A story spanning several decades, condensed into 320 minutes (!). Set in the city of Wasseypur, India, two rival factions have been fighting each other for many years. We see how the feud began, and how it developed...Boring and, at 320 minutes, seemingly interminable to the point of being painful. Based on the story outline, the movie had potential: a gangster movie spanning several decades - quite Godfather or Goodfellas-like. However, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Incredibly unfocused with pointless detours and sub-plots. Pretty much just drifts for all those 320 minutes.A bit (actually, a lot) of editing, and much more focusing on the main plot and the movie could have been interesting.On the plus side, the usual Bollywood nonsense of random song-and- dance scenes is kept to a minimum. In fact, no dancing, just singing. The small amount of musical interludes is also a negative in a way. When I saw how long the movie was I figured it was because it had the usual song-and-dance stuff, and I would just fast forward through that. Alas, no such luck.</fullReview>

Some of the dialogs were hard-hitting. This film will definitely change people's perception on Bollywood cinema. It has got its place already in my favorite Gangster films list alongside movies like Godfather, Pulp Fiction etc. Manoj Bajpayee has portrayed the character of Sardar khan Beautifully.

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur works like an explosive leaving you wanting for more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bloody Brilliance in every scene throughout the run time. It ensures to shock and delight the audience simultaneously. Its Anurag Kashyap's best work till date after "Black Friday". It's a break through in Indian main stream cinema. I feel myself blessed for being a audience to this quirky, dark, highly amusing and straight on the face brilliant Film.The Cast, Sneha Khanwalkar's music, the direction, dialogues, script, the comic timings and the gore takes this movie to a next level. It's a revenge story spanned across 3 generations. The story is based in Wasseypur, a dingy small hammock near Dhanbad where the coal mafia reigns. Its not a place for weak hearted. Country made guns blaze anywhere anytime, bombs are hurled as its cricket balls being played in gullies. Assassins throw bombs &amp; fire bullets while riding rustic bikes. Every Scene takes you to height of various emotions a person can feel. The best scene was the opening scene where "Saans bhi kabhi bahu thi" opening credits play and slowly it zooms out and we see that it is being played on a TV. And suddenly dozens of men running the gully firing AK- 47 &amp; hurling bombs. This action sequence is so brilliantly shot that you will feel it's a Hollywood flick. There was another scene where a girl is complaining to Sardar Khan that few guys are eve teasing her. While listening to the girl Sardar Khan's eyes are on revealed back of Durga. The expression in his eyes was full of lust. The expression was so original &amp; comic.All the characters were so believable. The characters look just as normal people we see around all the time. The entire cast of the film has delivered a commendable performance. Manoj Bajpai's character Sardar Khan was dark, amoral, lecherous, merciless yet highly amusing. Richa Chaddha character as Sardar khan's wife portrays a fearless woman of strength, helplessness. The star cast was heavenly made for each character. Manoj Bajpai proved that he is one of the best actors India has got. He was bloody brilliant. Richa Chaddha was equally brilliant. Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Jameel Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Pankaj Tripathy were apt and great in their performance. "Gangs of Wasseypur" is one film where everybody's performance was exceptional.The movie ends teasing and the audience wants some more of it. Its not the end. It is followed by second part. And it will be definitely awaited eagerly by all who has had the fortune of watching the first part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shut-up call to the word 'parallel cinema'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a serious reservation against the terms 'parallel cinema' or 'art movies'. These terms are used to confine some dazzling cinematic experiences to selected audience. Why do people go to watch movies? For romance? For great music? For action? For sex? For humor? Would you go to watch a movie that has all the four things in it? Probably not. You will call it an 'art movie' because it does not have a Khan or a Kapoor or a Kumar in it. Instead it has Manoj Bajpai in his finest performance ever. Yes, even better than Satya and that's a lofty claim.'Gangs of Wasseypur' (GoWp) is a shut-up call to the word 'parallel cinema'. This is a pure commercial film with everything a marketable film has. Its romance does not have huge silk curtains flying in the background coupled with violins. Its romance means the girl asking the guy to seek permission before holding her hand while sitting in front of a dirty lake. No, its action does not have shots of the hero jumping from Burj Khalifa or fancy car chases. It has gory action where fingers are chopped off and swords and daggers define weaponry. It's sexy but not in a bikini and beach way but for the rawness of a man's lust and woman's quest for security in his lust.Its music is fabulously done by the unique Sneha Khanwalkar (Love, Sex Aur Dhoka &amp; Oye Lucky Lucky Oye) but it does not have lip synching choreographed with hundreds of kids dancing along with the lead couple. Instead it has songs like "Keh Ke Loon Ga" (I'll tell you first and then screw you) playing in the background when the protagonist, if he can be called that, goes after the antagonist.In fact, background music is the strength of GoWP jointly shared by Sneha and the brilliant Piyush Mishra. Both for performance and music, Mishra has started just where he left from in Gulal. How fitting is a song like 'Ik Bagal Mein' that expresses the feeling of one happiness coming with one sorrow in the background of scenes like a man uncertain of celebrating the birth of his son when his wife dies during childbirth.GoWP is not epitome of story writing. The basic premise of 'if a Hindu wants to rule, he gets two Muslims to fight with each other' is subtle yet bold enough to raise eye brows. The story is a simple 'Karma is a bitch' saga where a son challenges the political powerhouse to avenge his father's killing. It sounds like a run of the mill 80s revenge story or even The Godfather. Rest assured, that its not. It also kills the rumors that it's an inspiration from the Brazilian film "City of God" because its not that either. The only similarity between GoWP and City of God is the power struggle between two gangs. The milieu and the events are totally different from each other.It's the treatment and pragmatism that makes this film special. There can be a lot of criticism on making it an expletives ridden violent heavy 160 minutes, but the fact remains that expletives are as much a part of our lives as breathing is. You cannot expect goons of Bihar to talk to each other like cultured Lucknow literary geniuses.GoWP has perfect casting. Every single character has come out with individual brilliance no matter how trivial his or her role is. It's impossible to pick out someone who did not do well. The only differentiating factor between the actors is the length of their screen presence be it Jaideep Ahlawat as Shahid Khan or Jameel Khan as Asgar Khan or Reema Sen as Durga. Richa Chadda as Manoj Bajpai's wife is a surprise show stealer. Another surprise package is Pankaj Tripathy who gets the biggest role of his career and grabs it with both hands. The talented story teller Tigmanshu Dhulia (Haasil, Shagird and Sahed Biwi Aur Gangster) puts down his pen and comes in front of the camera for one of the strongest performances in the film. His anger management and cunningness is remarkable. Piyush Mishra, the name is enough. Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Huma Qureshi are perfect in their roles and will get more exposure when the sequel revolves around them.The film, however, belongs to Manjo Bajpani. From Bhikku Mahatre to Sardar Khan, take a bow. He is hungry, he is horny and he is humorous. He is everything you don't want your enemy to be but he is scared of his wife and admits that in front of his son. He doesn't remember his father but he remembers the revenge. He is a mercenary with an objective of his own. Jiya ho bihar ke lala.This is Anurag Kashyap's finest work to date. He has overcome the criticism of using intricate metaphors (Gulaal) and unfathomable links (No Smoking) or making films ahead of their time (Dev D). He has kept the narration simple to make sure no one leaves the theater in confusion. The killing scene of Shahid Khan reminds you of Bhikku Mahatre's death in Satya. A powerful man can go down in a jiffy. It was Kashyap's dream project and his passion shows in the entire film.It's important for the economics to work in favor of films like GoWP which was not a case for 'Gulal' and 'That girl In Yellow Boots'. With satellite rights apparently fetching half of the film's cost and a decent theatrical start in India, looks like Kashyap has finally covered that bit which will also help the sequel of this film.GoWP is a proper adult audience movie. There are people who will not like it. Those are the people who will not go to watch it. Whoever does, will have a hell of a ride and will go for the sequel as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GOW (part 1 n 2) is total entertainer. Even after the days of watching the movie, u cant forget the dialogues, characters, etc. The best part is that the dialogues of the movie was not written. It was like an extempore for the actors. For me Definite(Zeishan Quadri) was amazing. Superb story and acting by him. The makers of this film paid attention to every small things which happens in Bihar. All the dialogues, behavior, characterization was properly etched. None of the performance of any actors looked like they are over acting. The film received an Adults Only certification from the Indian Censor Board but is still unusually explicit for Indian standards as it contained authentic lingo and violence generally suppressed by Mainstream Indian movies.The films soundtrack is heavily influenced by traditional Indian folk songs. So if you want to experience an all new wave of cinema in Bollywood, GOW is your movie. It's has some real quirky moments which I'll leave for you to explore in the film. Watch it for its sheer cinematic pleasure! Always an Anurag Kashyap fan. Aapne "Keh k le li"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs of Wasseypur Part II : A REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a difficult wait, I must admit. 8th August came excruciatingly slow. The 10:55 pm show at PVR Cinemas arrived even slower. But when Faizal came back for his sandals, I instantly gave my heart to Anurag Kashyap.Gangs of Wasseypur Part II provides a fitting closure to the epic that we saw unfold in Part I. It delivers the final punches with so much intent, that you, as the audience can only be awed. Kashyap has made this movie his own. His characters are alive on the screen, and crafted with the care of a sculptor. The land of revenge transcends into an era of war as you watch the numerous characters wax and wane with time.With this movie, Kashyap has done something which all erstwhile directors have failed to. He has taken the Western style of storytelling and applied it commercially in an Indian setting. A movie which the masses will hoot for and the critiques will clap for. A movie that rolls up Scorsese, Tarantino and Fincher into one; a movie that elicits each and every emotion from the audience. There are completely epic sequences where you just go 'F**K! ', and stare at the screen trying to absorb each and every moment.This piece of work has probably fulfilled the complete meaning of 'cinema'. It is a potpourri of emotions, a lesson in criminology and a study of human philosophies at the same time. We apparently see rampaging goons, a power struggle soiled by blood betrayal but underneath the strong currents of vengeance flows rivulets of love, companionship, trust and friendship. And FEAR. The movie is bleak, disturbing and atmospheric. The dialogues deliver a lot more than what's said. You can feel the steel inside the men who run Wasseypur, no matter whether they have a funny hairstyle or an irritating lisp.Faizal, in my opinion, has made history. While we were thinking he is this idiot pot-smoking numb nut, he somehow transformed into a conniving cobra waiting to strike. His journey from a freeloader to a crime syndicate mastermind is fascinating. We see him beheading Fajal, we see him run like a mouse and we also see him cry as a child. His character is multi layered, exactly like Sardar, and that is why he becomes so intriguing on screen. Mohsina was the real surprise for me. She slips into the role of Faizal's wife with ease, with eyes that can become ice or fire in a blink, and lips so red that can burn your desires. She is Faizal's emotional support, comforting him in times of dilemma and loving him like a mother. The couple is absolutely fantastic to watch and adds a unique flavor to the revenge saga.The background music reminded me of Scorsese, the suspense of Fincher and Mr.Quentin Tarantino is all over the place. Every Tarantino fan should clap at the epic climax of the movie. It is immaculately shot, a feast for the senses and something that Gangs of Wasseypur thoroughly deserved. The climax leads to an anti-climax where Kashyap again stamps his bloody authority. He shows how the lust for power has capability to destroy blood loyalty. He shows how, at the end of the day, all your dreams can vaporize like a mirage.I somehow feel Kashyap visualized this film as a black comedy, a film which changes a few definitions. Where love becomes a bullet through the head, friendship becomes a knife across your neck, trust becomes a cell phone speaker and death somehow means Asha Band Party. All the while, you try and make sense of this world. Do not worry if you fail, because then you are definitely at Wasseypur, whose soil carries the blood of generations and in whose womb, coiling and writhing, waits a dark force. Vengeance.P.S :- It would be a grave injustice not to mention Definite, Faizal's brother. Watch out for him, because not for nothing does the blood of Sardar flow in his veins.PPS :- I simply cannot avoid mentioning couple of scenes. When Faizal breaks his leg and when Ramadhir talks to his son, JP. Don't miss them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I don't know from where to start talking about this movie. I saw the entire 5+ hours of this movie in one go at the osian's film festival last night (4th Aug 2012). I have seen a lot of movies from the international cinema and have always wondered about when will India throw such movies out. I wanna put my hands down and say that finally India has thrown one. This movie is as cult as it gets. You get to see the real India and real characters on screen. Usually when I see an Indian movie I keep comparing it with the English/foreign movie that I saw and 90% of the times the scripts are copied/semi-copied. For Gangs of Wasseypur I couldn't really think of any movie that comes close to this. The script is as original as it gets. If at all I have to give a summary of what this movie is like then here it is. It has the seriousness and character of GodFather, the plot as tricky and mind blowing as that of 2009 Oscar winning movie "The secret in their eyes" , "The departed" or Incendies. The acting doesn't get any real than what these guys have put up. I though de niro in "The Raging bull" was the best acting I ever saw, but I was left numb after seeing Nawazuddin Siddiqui as Faizal in this movie. You name any character and you know Anurag has not left anything for chance. Even a doctor who had a role for 15 seconds was bang on with dialogues and emotions. This movie brought a tear to my eye not because of some emotional scene in the movie but simply because I wanted India to produce an epic or a classic that the world can see and yes I can say this is it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a movie which takes us to the bihari cool world. take any scene u like whether its the cloth washing scene, hospital scene ( one of the best ever), failed attempt of throwing bomb, ending scene. everything is a gem. u can watch it again and again for those little nuances which are created amazingly by anurag kashyap. the music is so well placed and completely raw and original. manoj bajpayi's expression of lust and anger was out of the world and too good. every scene is so perfectly directed and choreographed and specially keeping the background of bihar and jharkhand in mind, it only adds to the reality. absolutely loved the movie and its clear by the fact that this is my only 2nd review in years. one more thing for those who thinks its a copy of godfather - if a movie is about generation of mafia families, it doesn't mean its a copy of godfather. not a single sequence matches those from godfather.in other words - keh ke leli</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal tale of gang wars. All for revenge, power and lust.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a scene of few villagers watching 'Kyun ke Saas bhi kabhi Bahu thi' where Smriti Irani invites the viewers inside her sasural, introducing the family. Anurag Kashyap has used a narrator in the movie who narrates the story and takes through each and every character in detail, but in a cold blooded manner. He takes you through the bloodshed laden war saga between different casts of Muslims, the butchers, Qureshis, and the Pathans, Khans and local jameendaars. The saga extends over a period of three generations. After some time your mind starts connecting in the characters. Bloodshed, cruelty, brutality, lust, betrayal and vulgarity become a part of your mind. You laugh at the comic acts by the main character just after a scene where he kills a person brutally. Your mind accepts the brutality, lust, betrayal and loves the main character, Sardar Khan played by The Manoj Vajpayee. That's where hats off to Anurag Kashyap, a director with own style of storytelling. Iwill not compare him with other famous directors of global cinema, but add him as one of them. Then comes the casting, hats off to Mukesh Chhabra here as all actors selected for the movie play equally important role bringing the sheer reality live. In terms of acting,needless to say, Manoj Vajpayee is a legend and hits back with a bang. This industry really needs directors like Anurag so such marvelous stunning actors get a chance to show their real mettle. All other actors, especially to mention Tigmanshu Dhulia (as Ramdheer Sing), Richa Chadda (as Nagma, wife of Sardaar Khan) are fabulous. They bring out the director's vision in reality. The camera work and choice of locations is just perfect. Especially use of flesh chopping scenes at butcher shops makes you familiar with a language of brutality. It makes you feel involved.Anurag has used music as a tool to narrate the story line. The main strength of the movie lies in storyline and the suitable dialogues matching it. The dialogues are vaguer, as used by rural locals. They are as important as flesh and blood scenes are required to show brutality. No point in mentioning that the movie is not a family entertainer. It is not meant to be a family entertainer. Need to mention that this is an adult movie, for the adults who do not look for 'Kamzori ka akseer ilaaz' in local classifieds. Awaiting for the next part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kashyap's best work after No Smoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, Gangs of Wasseypur. Let me indulge in a few truisms. Yes, this is the greatest Hindi film of our generation. 'Godfather meets Park Chan Wook' will be an unfair tag, and so will be to draw parallels with Tarantino or any other global contemporaries. This magnum opus is SO Indian, and only the genius of Anurag Kashyap could deliver an uninhibited, arrogant, dark, brutal, savage, larger-than-life revenge drama, taken to dizzying heights of cinematic brilliance that induces extreme emotional orgasm. No conscience-talks, no unnecessary moralizing. The screenplay by Zeishan Queresi is a knockout as it successfully merges history with fiction, beautifully captures the socio-political fabric of rustic India with a historical commentary which provides more authenticity. The humour is out-of-this-world loud and bloody brilliant, expletives galore - unabashed, unapologetic. Rajiv Ravi's camera work is the best I've seen in Indian Cinema in a long, long time and sets a benchmark difficult to emulate. Sneha Khanwalkar's background score is a killer and the songs often add to the narrative. Now, coming to the actors - all of them are outstanding, I'm at a loss for words! The subtlety of Jaideep Ahlawat and Piyush Misra, the feisty and sensuous female characters amidst the male brigade sparkle, Tigmanshu Dhulia's spectacular debut....However, everyone is overshadowed by the pothead-turned-Michael Corleone Nawazuddin Siddiqui. Manoj Bajpai is reborn. As Rajeev Masand says - "It's difficult to separate the actor from the character." With a single-minded unmitigated and unflinching determination for vengeance, his quirky humour, lecherous glances, penchant for the theatrical grandiose - he's the driving force of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abundant in expositions and anorexic in turning-points, Wasseypur's saga would've worked better as a TV miniseries. On silver-screen, it feels stretched and you feel stressed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anurag Kashyap's Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 has a winsome quality about it which makes it effortlessly and addictively watchable. The episodic nature of the film makes it not very different from a soap saga, and its director Anurag Kashyap perhaps realized this point during filming. That why his film begins with the opening credits of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi (Because a Mother-in-Law was once a daughter-in-law), a hugely popular television serial that aired in the 00s about three or four generations of a family living under one roof. Fortunately, Gangs of Wasseypur has none of the overbearing melodrama which Indian soap operas have; the film is all about gangsters, guns, gore, gaalis ( profanity) and revenge. Also about making many babies, which is maybe when the film comes closest to a television soap. This film, combined with its sequel, would have been a fantastic four- part television miniseries, but Kashyap chooses to divide his five-and- half hour magnum opus into two feature films, giving them both theatrical releases. This is perhaps why I thought Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 was like a tome without any major turning points to translate it well to silver screen. The film plays out like missions from the latest Grand Theft Auto games but unlike the video-game, it doesn't let us have our breaks when we need some. A guy I knew was a speed-reader who could finish a tome in one sitting; to watch Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1, maybe one needs to be a 'speed-viewer' to take in the film in its entirety. The film is made up of too many expositions that extend right up to the very end, and there are times when you feel as though your hard-drive is being loaded with much more information than your storage capacity. The major turning-point in the film for me came only with Nawazzudin Siddique's entry, which happens way later in the film; until the flurry of excellently written, well-acted and impeccably choreographed scenes did impress me but I found myself a little lost and confused about where the film was going. Gangs of Wasseypur Part 1 covers six decades, beginning in the forties where our narrator Nasir tells us about the history of Wasseypur, a region located in Dhanbad in the state of Jharkhand. The place is dominated by Sunni Muslims, with the Quereshi sub-caste of animal butchers being the most feared in the area. We learn that the British trains passing through the region were robbed by dacoits, mostly the Quereshi Muslims led by Sultana Quereshi. When word spreads in town that someone is impersonating Sultana to rob trains using his name, the Quereshi Muslims suspect Shahid Khan after they find his business flourish suddenly. One night, as Shahid Khan's men plan to rob another train, the Quereshis attack them and slaughter everyone except Shahid and our narrator Nasir. The two men are banished after this incident and Shahid finds work at a coal mine. His pregnant wife dies in childbirth leaving him with a son and Shahid later kills the muscle-man at work who refused him leave the day his wife died. He is later hired as the new muscle-man at the coal mine by Ramadhir Singh, an industrialist entrusted with a few coal-mines after the British Raj. Their alliance develops until Singh overhears Khan's plans to kill him in future; Khan is later shot to death by Mr. Yadav, a supplier of ammunitions, under Singh's order. However, his son Sardar escapes along with Nasir which leads to a twenty-year jump in the story. Sardar Khan, now a grown man, vows to avenge his father's death and slowly gains control of Wasseypur. His foe Ramadhir is now a shamelessly corrupt politician who forms an alliance with Sultan, a feared butcher in Wasseypur belonging to the same Quereshis who banished Shahid Khan, to stop Sardar from extracting revenge. What is interesting about the cinematography in Gangs of Wasseypur is that the film does not have many close-ups and when it does, it's for undoubtedly the best scenes in the film. Consider the scene in which Ramadhir Singh summons Quereshi to confront him about having lied about killing the young Sardar. We first have a static shot with Ramadhir towards the left of the screen, and Quereshi entering through the door on the right and sitting down, taking a quick look at Ramadhir's office like guests do usually. Then it cuts to middle shots (covering head to torso) of Ramadhir and Quereshi as Ramadhir asks him whether he remembers Shahid Khan. After this, the camera goes for close-ups of their faces as Singh talks about having seen the 'ghost' of Shahid's son and requests Quereshi to dig out the bones of the 'dead' kid as they have to be used for a ritual to drive the ghost away. Quereshi nods uneasily and the camera pauses on his face for a second before he is slapped by Ramadhir. The rest of the time, Anurag Kashyap allows Rajeev Ravi the cinematographer to capture the panorama of Wasseypur, with outdoor scenes being interspersed with shots of onlookers and evocative sceneries such as the idle lake at dawn or the mining sites. The unconventional music and narration seamlessly stitch together the various scenes taking place over six decades, and lighting works fantastically especially during the shooting sequences taking place at night where the street-lights act as the only source of illumination. Despite all the praise I've given, I still feel Gangs of Wasseypur, because of its episodic nature, would work better as a television miniseries. On the silver screen, the saga feels stretched and you feel a tad stressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After Gabbar Singh, kids will now talk about Sardar Khan....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since a movie has come in bollywood which would make you say, once more. In the recent times bollywood has tried a lot with super heroes coming and flying, love stories with a western touch, awful sequels and horrifying remakes, but this gem from Anurag Kashyap truly deserves a 25 topo ki salami. The movie is set out in a never heard location where the coal mafia and our sweet politics have tied hands. It starts of in the past when the Britishers ruled the nation, and how when they left the whole game of mining changed. The characters of Sultana Daku have been highlighted with strong history and then remade into the world by Shahid Khan(Jaideep Ahlawat). He was killed by his own recruiter Ramadhari Singh who owned the mines after independence, and then set the whole story for the minutes to come ahead. Sardar Khan(Manoj Bajpayee) the protagonist, the son of Shahid Khan and the to be mafia of Wasseypur is all burning with the fire of revenge as he comes to know about his father's death on to the hands of Ramadhari singh. He cleverly enters the campaign of former and slowly gathers power, money and prestige to play against him. But he was not his only enemy, the movie brings out another revenge seeker group of Qureshi's. Revenge, humor, strong performances and situation-ally accurate music hold the key for you to bear the 165 min long drama of Anurag Kashyap. Backed by the stupendous story of revenge, the director has been more than successful in delivering an experience not to be forgotten for a long time. The direction and screenplay are the highlights of the film which have bring out the true essence of the melodrama. All the characters have not just performed but have lived them. Not even a single moment comes when you will feel, oh i have seen this or what the hell is this. All in all it's a movie whose all characters have a strong impact to the way it progresses much like the greatest epic of Sholay, not that I in any way want to compare it with the latter but this movie would make you feel that the bollywood is reviving and the Hollywood will get tough competition in future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guns of Wassyepur.Bollywood very proudly flaunts badges like mindless entertainment, leave your brains behind comedy, potboiler, masala entertainer etc. The recent box office success of these films proves that there exists a larger population of people who step into the theatre to consume these films and most of them find it entertaining too.Gangs of Wasseypur is Anurag Kashyaps Take your brains with you masala potboiler film.On the surface it is a revenge drama spanning almost 70 years that starts between Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahalawat) and Ramadhir Singh (Played by two actors, the older part is played by Tigmanshu Dhulia) and is inherited by future generations of Shahid Khan.At a running time of 2 hrs 40 min the film is engaging and entertaining with not a single boring moment, that is if you find a connect with the characters and their world. They are crazy, eccentric, quirky and extremely violent without any remorse. The voice-over and the political information overwhelm you so much that it feels like you are sitting for an exam. You have to be so attentive especially in the first hour. Jaideep Ahalawat as Shahid Khan is the emotional anchor of the film. His track is the only time the revenge drama works which later fades away and I was watching it more as a madcap entertainer. Jaideeps fight sequence in the coal mines reminded me of Kaala Pathar. His intensity as an actor is terrific in whatever little he got to do. For me he is the find of the film.The world of Wasseypur is filled with strong women who speak their mind and don't take things lying down. Richa Chaddha, Reema Sen and Huma Qureshi deliver terrific performances. Every scene that had Richa Chaddha in it was my favorite. The last time I enjoyed Manoj Bajpayees performance was in Aks. This one beats it and is his 2nd best after Satya.Even though Tigmanshu Dhulia plays his part with silent menace his character comes across too weak to oppose the overpowering character of Shahid Khan which takes away some spice from the film. Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the lanky Faisal Khan is the Amitabh Bachchan of the 70s. In his eyes there are multitudes of emotions.If I sit down to write down moments that I enjoyed in the film I can fill pages mentioning it. If Anurag Kashyap has intended to make it as a masala entertainer against the backdrop of revenge he has definitely succeeded in making one but if his vision was to tell a revenge drama he falls flat on the face. I just didn't care for the revenge angle. Supporting his vision is the mind blowing music by Sneha Khanwilkar and the background music of G.V.Prakash. Both of them add funk to the violent and dark tone of the film. And to all those who worry about the duration of a film and say it is slow paced I would say that the duration of a film appears long only if it fails to engage you. An engaging film can never be too long. Gangs of Wassyepur didn't bore me for a second.Word of mouth Gangs of Wasseypur is Anurags tribute to the American gangster movies and Godfather and also his answer to the masala films of our times.Its an item film. Rating 3.5 (Good)Ticket Meter Worth 250 bucksP.S. pls stay right till the end to watch the trailer of GOW2.</fullReview>

'Moora' and 'Kaala Rey' are hauntingly purposeful in calming the audience who is braving an intense and horrific scene. But it's not just the music, every sound counts. Right from the trucks honking away to the tune of Dhoom's title track to the orchestra bleating away at the many funeral processions, each leaves you with pickled feelings. A good example of how well the music blends with the visuals would be the breakdown part of the song 'Chhi Chha Ledar' where this chase sequence slows down to gel with the score.Chhi Chha Leather, definitely one that weathers!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOW - a movie that Indian cinema can be proud of !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an era where mediocrity is sold in the name of entertainment and an average cine-goer is relentlessly served mindless blockbusters, Gangs of Wasseypur is leaps and bounds ahead of its times be it in terms of direction, screenplay, performances or dialogues. Anurag Kashyap once again stands out with this hard-hitting yet entertaining masterpiece, reaffirming his reputation and this one, in fact, catapults him into another league altogether. He can easily be termed, dare I say, Tarantino of Hindi Cinema. There have been countless movies in world cinema in general, and Bollywood in particular, based on the themes of revenge spanned across generations and gory tales of mining mafia but the panache with which film has been directed means that the viewer is never allowed a loo break. The premise of the movie is violent but it has its share of light moments that perfectly punctuate it without diluting the mood.Though every one has pitched in with enthralling performances, I was particularly impressed with Manoj Bajpayi portraying Sardar Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia portraying Ramadhir Singh and Richa Chadda playing the wife of Sardar Khan. The dialogues are superbly penned and hailing from the heartland where the film is based, I was amazed by the details of mannerisms (or ill-mannerisms) and accent perfectly depicted in the movie.The background score is riveting and perfectly timed and so are the songs and music. Kudos to Sneha Kalwalkar for bringing out the folklore of Bihar so magnificently.If there is anything about the movie that I would change, it would be its length. The run time could have been shorter with a little bit of editing but even with this length, the film does not let your mind wander. Looking forward to the second part for an epic finale. The trailer at the end of credits sure promises it to be one.</fullReview>

This movie is much like Rakth Charitra series by RGV, except this one is too long for no particular reason and none of the characters generate any sympathy, they are all evil immoral degenerates (like Bukka from Rakth Charitra). Heck, even the lead women characters are conniving manipulators. Abusive language is pervasive throughout the movie, more for shock value than anything else. What is the point of revenge back and forth over and over again? This could have been a good 2 hour movie. At the end, it did not matter to me if a Khan wins or Singh wins the battle of revenge. It does not matter, they are all thugs. The only redeeming quality is the awesome performance by Bajpai, Siddique, and Chadda. Piyush Mishra and Yashpal Sharma were wasted, they should have had more prominent roles, they are perfect for this genre. Music and background scores are forgettable. Watch for performances and shock-value, nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come on u Hollywood guys...made this type of flick..then compare with us..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just unable to come out the madness of this flick had created over me...really Manoj Bajpayee and crew strike a thunder over the cold blooded cinema, as it seems for past some years..Really don't know when I used so much of my mind, so much of clapping, so much of whistle, so much of laughing, and so much of intensity of myself for a Hindi Flick...really awesome..kudos to Anurag Kashyap...Even I feel doing praise of that film like this is also an insult to that masterpiece..waiting eagerly for 2nd part..!! Really some person could feel that we all are over-hyped that movie, but when you love main-stream cinema and also love to see actors like Manoj Bajpayee, Irrfan Khan, Naseeruddin Shah and Nana Patekar on Big screen and then you got a movie like this, then really you will over shout for that review. Even I could say that its my first review on IMDb and I just got time for writing a review just because of madness GANGS OF WASSEYPUR created over me. And just to give some revert to brilliancy of Mr. Manoj Bajpayee created over the scree. Thank You Sir, for making my day. Go fir it otherwise you will miss something for sure. Thanks Nishant Gupta</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done director, welcome back Bollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bollywood is lost into entertainment, but that is what Bollywood needs now days desperately, movies based on story and reality.Movie is based on story of real Indian culture of mafia and the way the characters represented them was marvelous.After long time i watched any Bollywood movie, was actually bored from the recent entertainment story-less movies with big cast only with purpose of business.was missing quality story Bollywood cultural movies like old times. This movie should be consider at least as the participant in category of best foreign picture in Oscar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just too much in every way you can think of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Staring the movie convincingly with a long shot of nicely coordinated action-thriller sequence, the movie then plunges into any and all Bollywood movie's recipe, especially those which aren't shot for the global audience. After the opening credits, it's all just non-stop and hyperbolic drama of cheesy quality, overly stocked with too much dramatization. The movie toys with viewers' level of tolerance by simply telling the story of the descendants of the first character. In a way, we'll all think that the story is more fitting for a two-season running TV series than an age long movie. Furthermore, the movie dazzles me with even more irony by having the "to be continued" tag line at the inconclusive ending. The acting overall is a standard over acted work of Indian movies, nothing else to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what you called Best Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I assume that most of the Bollywood Fans were sick of so-so movies. We waited long for good movies this year. Few movies may have earned handsomely but it's not a great cinema.The year started with two Good Movies, Kahani and Pan Singh Tomar and was a blissful delight.Gangs of Wasseypur is what you called an overwhelming delight to watch. Right from first cut till the end the eyes were glues to the screen and the mind was set in Wasseypur.The time has come for Indian Cinema to forget about beautiful faces and focus on acting. Each word is very well placed and delivered, every set and action is very normal; this is what makes this movie a great delight.I belong to Jharkhand, It was very natural for me to understand the songs, dialogues and satire very easily. The movie has used the regional accent and used the Frequently Used Words of the region quite well.Few dialogues have become popular through out the country, Guys who are not from Jharkhand/Bihar..Listen to the songs, download the lyrics and try to understand it..U will fee the real spirit of GOW.http://gangsofwasseypur.blogspot.in/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb but wont appeal to all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GANGS OF WASSEYPUR is yet another Anurag Kashyap film and again he proves why he is one of the best directors. The film again is set in a North Town Wasseypur which is near Bihar/Dhanbad. The film successfully narrates a story that pasts generations, the story is complicated as usual in Kashyap films but his detailed narration is fantastic. The story may seem a normal revenge saga but it's not. The characters are acidic, in fact you don't root for any as all have shades of grey. There are several brilliant scenes like the shootout at the start of the film(as the family is watching Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhu Thi) which is continued in Part 2. In fact if you watch both films you'll understand things better. It does take a long time to get used to the lingo and the story but once you get settled it's a superb film The film manages to keep you interested till the end though at times it does get too confusing with half a dozen sub plots. The film also carefully depicts the 40's, 50's era till 2004 perfectly We also have some take-offs on movies like Nawazzudin is a Amitabh fan and watches TRISHUL(1978) in theatre The film does seem slow and may make people fidgety plus the violence does startle for people who are used to watch Salman jump buildings, remove his shirt or SRK's movies. Direction by Anurag Kashyap is terrific Music is superb, all songs mostly in background are fab Dialogues as usual pack a punchIn Anurag Kashyap films he always introduces us to fresh talents plus extracts finest performances from them. Manoj Bajpayee makes a terrific comeback, he is tremendous in a role only he could play, with those cold expressions and eyes and his dial delivery he proves yet again he is a brilliant performer.The film does have other great performances too Richa Chadha who is launched with this film is flawless as his wife and portrays the various shades(spewing bad words) tremendously Reema Sen too is effective Piyush Mishra excels, Nawazuddin Siddiqui(is the lead in part 2) gets a brief role but does a great job as usual, talking with his expressions. He looks perfectly the character Huma Qureshi is decent in a brief role, Vipin Sharma is good in his role Tigmanshu Dhulia who directed HAASIL, CHARAS and SAHEB BIWI AUR GANGSTER makes his acting debut and he is the find of the year He is simply flawless and outstanding in his act</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gangs Of WhySoLong!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a gangster film, in a time when gangster films have been done to death. In order to create one that is truly good and stands out from the rest, you must start off with a good initial idea. This film lacks that idea, and creates an extremely generic, clichd crime film that more than certainly over stays it's welcome. This movie took me two days to watch, and throughout I was wondering if it was possible to get any more boring. 320 minutes of hacking off limbs, weird music scores in the middle of a scene and nonintellectual dialogue just ruin what could have been an epic if they could have pulled off such a runtime.Ultimately Gangs Of Wasseypur fails on a grand scale. Nothing in this film is remotely interesting, the film takes too long to end (hence it takes too long for anything meaningful to happen) and the direction, acting and script almost make it the worst I've seen. I would give it an 'F', but I don't think it is deserving of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to like movie but couldn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on DVD last week. I had heard about this movie and had liked the promos. Usually, I like these kind of movies that are not commercial and then have characters that are based in real location. I must say that I am disappointed after having just seen only the part one. Movie looked very disjointed to me. The characters didn't seem real. The rise in power of various characters seemed very unnatural to me. Manoj Bajpayee is a good actor but what he did in this movie is same as what he has done in other movies. None of the female characters were impressive except getting a few lines that you would not expect females to say. I loved Sneha's music in LSD but was somewhat disappointed to hear her music in this movie. There was really no song I can remember from this movie except may be one line "keh ke loonga" (loosely translates to "I will tell and then take your ..").Disappointed by part 1 but will wait to see part 2.Just saw part2 of this movie on DVD. Part2 was really more of part 1 with the next generation involved in killing and philandering. I did not like either parts and was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of Wasseypur starts off with a bunch of guys raiding a house tearing into pieces in the year 2004. It then flashbacks to 1941, and then, 3 hours later, ends in 1990, with a "To be continued". By this time, my head was hurting like crazy, and half the theater had walked out. Now take an intelligent guess on how good the film was.I know of people who've loved the movie, but it definitely isn't the one for me, and am guessing everyone. Unless you like such dark, vulgar films with no story, stay away.Acting: 7.5/10 Story-Screenplay-Direction: 3/10 Technical Aspects: 6/10Verdict: 4.5/10Please visit sasikanth.me for more reviews :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is a watchable gang.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched "GANGS OF WASSEYPUR". Movie is good. One time watchable. Starting is slow but after some time it catches the pace. Audiences were hard-core serious film lovers but they were enjoying the love scenes most. Yeah, love scenes are literally very entertaining and innovative. There were only eleven females among 160 audiences. Dialogues are THETH Bihari but enjoyable. Music score is also good especially the Womania...Music has the sweet taste of local folk. Manoj Bajpaye is awesome. One actress as Nagma Khatoon impresses. Rest actors are also good. Actually, casting is perfect. The ambiance, music, casting create the feel that it is real Wassyepur. At the climax the behavior of Durga is not justified. The exaggerated shooting scene at the very beginning of film seems imposed, it was not real, just an attempt to surprise the audience. Overall, movie will not disappoint the audience. It is a complete PAISA VASOOL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not sure of why this movie was added to my watch-list, somehow done and found and watched it. What a waste of time. To me, this is one of the most overrated movies ever. But, at the same time I don't want to be ignorant to the people who this movie historically (or fantastically) about, may be it contains deep emphasis or aspects which a foreigner like me can't infer.Why? It is a very long movie, add a slow pace to it and finally get a tantalizing experience. This orphan boy was keen to revenge in a scene while having hug from his woman, on to kill the murderer of his heroic father, and then, somehow lost focus. First fought for the rights of mine against him, then insulted him, then jailed, then escaped. Later went into a political rival against "him". Come on! You should respect to your father's memory and take revenge... Nope.Passed the scenes, especially nonsense ones, rapidly.Finally, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Worst movie ever seen in my life. Stupid and illogical sequence of killings, random unwanted scenes and dialogue, no specific plot other than revenge, no plan, poor direction, No relation between scenes, no humor other than keeping names as definite and perpendicular as if it evoked huge comedy. The only few memorable scenes are 'keh ke lunga', 'karne se pehle permission to leni chahiye' and 'beta tumse na ho payega' ,which are just digestible But anyways its my opinion, such movies will keep on coming and people will keep on liking it . If I'm wrong let me know why should one like it and what did we learn from it?&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Let Down...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst films I've ever nearly sat through. Can't believe it's Anurag Kashyap's film!I am seriously wondering how is this averaging 8.6 out of 10 on IMDb? Seriously? I feel sorry for people who can't see through the filth...When the movie started it looked like it's going to be a neat documentary-like film about that region of India, but within few minutes it started getting little strange as the plot and storyline kept getting more and more inconsistent and boring. I should mention that I generally like Anurag Kashyap's films. Until now I used to look forward to his films. After seeing this move I would be careful.I don't want to put any spoiler in this review, you should watch it and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A village nymphomaniac and his abusive wife. Why wouldn't the audience whistle?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The splitting headache I got after watching this excruciatingly long movie was nothing compared to the one I'm currently having on seeing this feature film make IMDb's top 250. This movie relies on a few basic rules that make the majority of Indians go crazy but sadly, I don't see it. Reasons why my friends liked it: 1. Yaar it's cult. 2. That dialog about asking for hand-holding permission was killer. 3. That dialog about his wife asking him to eat well was so funny. 4. That song is epic! 5. Blah blah blah. The story is overly exaggerated (as claimed by some Wasseypur citizens themselves recently) so whoever says it's a REAL movie is welcome to take it up with them or me. It's painfully lengthy and slow. The last scene is too far from reality and only reminds me of Hrithik Roshan in Agneepath. The protagonist hates monogamy and loves sex, which makes Indian men whistle of course. Every second word in the movie is an abuse (again I hear whistles and even louder when the women are abusive). If this is all it takes to make a great movie, look out for my blockbuster tomorrow in a cinema-hall near you. Too many generations, too much of Godfather, excessive confusion, nymphomania, cheapness, vulgarity, abusiveness and gore. This movie was terrible. But please, see for yourself and I hope that some of you will agree with me after experiencing the above yourself. The rest of the GoW lovers, no offence, but your taste is pretty bad in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a much hyped movie, nothing great..quite messy..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gangs of V'pur,the much hyped movie, could not do justice with the expectations. Looking at the trailer, it seemed a must see movie, but all hopes turned negative in the first half of the movie itself.The idea, no doubt is superb, but the film is not well directed. Rather, i would say there are several loose points throughout the movie and you feel like as the film is being dragged unnecessarily. Then follows the confusion of so many names while narration. It does not help viewers readily connect and brings uncomfortable feeling to understand the movie. The cinematography is great. The locations chosen give the real feeling of coal mines at jharkhand.When in interval, you get to know there will be a sequel to it, it is all frustrating. One whole song is devoted to the dying of manoj bajpayee which is funny. Attention seems to have been given to extra marital affairs.Plus, where are the Gangs?? It's only Manoj Bajpayee from the Pathan sect? No any strong image countering Bajpayee. It becomes all messy by the time the first part of the movie ends.I wont suggest people to go for this movie with high expectations. If you expect 10, I bet the movie wont give you even 5. Choice is yours..There cannot be any comparison with Jha's Gangaajal.. In front of Gangaajal, this movie turns out to be a dwarf.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pathetic. If IMDb allows me, i would rate it 0/10. So many vulgar dialogs which makes no sense at all which includes the movie soundtrack as well and it was totally unnecessary. I guess that is the attraction for many viewers. Manoj Bajpai acted well and the direction was good but the way the story was presented was disgusting. The movie has been added with too much Mirch Masala and the worst part about it was the crowd in the theaters. Due to some sensitive issues, people were fighting in the cinema halls itself. The movie can't be seen as an entertainment flick. Really disappointed with the overall hype about it.</fullReview>
