		<shortDescription>A gem hidden in the forests of the Pacific Northwest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this in Sundance earlier in the year, and was captivated by the storytelling, acting and cinematography.The story follows Ben (Viggo Mortensen), a father of six, living deep in the forests of the pacific northwest, far from modern life. All six children, from seventeen year old Bodevan to seven year old Nai are fluent in philosophy, history and quantum theory (!), and can hunt and fend for themselves in the wilderness. At least that is until the suicide of their mother forces the family to clash with modern society, and then Ben realizes that he has in fact not prepared his children at all for what lies outside their forest. Bodevan, for example, accepted in a swarm of the top colleges and adept enough to kill a deer single-handedly, cannot bring himself to talk to a girl without immediately proposing to her.The family's ideals further come under stress when his late wife's father (Frank Langella) who hates the life Ben has created for his family comes into the picture, and forbids Ben from attending his wife's funeral, threatening him with arrest. In what could have easily turned into a one-dimensional harsh/rich character, Frank Langella also projects empathy and deep grief over his daughter's death. When Ben and his children visit his sister's much more conventional family, and her smart phone-obsessed children, Ben criticizes their upbringing, only to have his sister bring his own parenting skills into question. Director Matt Ross skillfully presents both sides here without picking favorites.Acting-wise the film is captivating, with Mortensen fitting the renaissance profile of Ben like a glove. He projects all the arrogance and hardheadedness of Ben together with his warmth, adoration for his children, and respect for his wife's wishes with grace and subtlety in one of the most seemingly effortless performances I have seen. He is also surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, from the children to his in-laws and sister.In summary, Captain Fantastic is a rare case where family dynamics, with their controversies and dilemmas are not oversimplified to a preaching doctrine in the finale; the film allows the viewer the space to find their own balance on what it means to raise a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nuanced commentary on modern society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set against the beautiful Pacific Northwest backdrop, Captain Fantastic is easily one of the most nuanced films to come to mainstream cinema in the last few years. It's main plot addresses the struggle when everyone has the best intentions but not the same values. Additionally, the film makes honest and straightforward comments on controversial issues in today's society that are often taboo in the media such as mental illness, the hypocrisy of children's exposure to violence and sex, religion, and the flaws in the American education system. This sounds heavy and uncomfortable but these issues are paralleled in such a way that parts of the film had us in tears; from laughing so hard. Director Matt Ross says the project started as an exaggerated exploration of the difficult choices that must be made in regards to raising children in today's society. I think the film goes a step further and awakens an internal dialogue in each of it's viewers about the way that we live our own lives based on societal influences. Furthermore, the performances given by the perfectly arranged cast enhance your investment in the story in a way that will cause you to question what right and wrong really are when you're only trying to do your best and do what you think is best for those that you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a clash of philosophies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. There seems to be no end to the theories on how to be an effective parent and raise kids who are productive, well-adjusted and successful. Writer/director Matt Ross offers up a creative, entertaining and thought-provoking story of one family's unconventional approach in a world that seems to expect and accept only the conventional.We are first introduced to Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six kids as they are stalking a deer while deep in the Pacific Northwest forest ? only this isn't your buddy's weekend deer hunting trip. Each family member is covered head-to-toe in mud and other means of camouflage, and the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) takes the lead with his knife in what is presented as a rite of passage into manhood.The family carries out a daily ritual that includes extreme physical conditioning, lessons on survival and living off the land, and advanced education that includes reading such diverse material as Dostoevsky and Lolita. Each evening is capped off with an impromptu musical jam. It's evident that self-sufficiency, intelligence and family loyalty are crucial to Ben's approach ? an approach that is challenged when circumstances require the family board their Partridge Family bus (named Steve) and take a cross-country road trip into a civilization that doesn't know what to make of them (and vice-versa).The film is jam-packed with social commentary on education, parenting, societal norms, societal influences, and even grief. Who gets to decide what is best for a family or what's the best method for education? Sometimes the dysfunctional family isn't so easy to identify. Director Ross proves this in a gem of a dinner table scene as Ben and the kids visit Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn and their two sons in suburbia.In addition to the terrific performance by up-and-comer George MacKay, the other actors playing the kids are all very strong and believable: Samantha Isler as Kieyler, Annalise Basso as Vespyr, Nicholas Hamilton as Rellian, Shree Crooks as Zaja, and Charlie Shotwell as Nai. Screen vets Frank Langella and Ann Dowd bring presence to the role of their grandparents and provide the greatest contrast to the off-the-grid existence of the kids.Viggo Mortensen truly shines here and gives a performance full of grace and depth as he displays many emotions (some of which aren't so pleasant). He even goes full-Viggo for one of the film's many humorous moments ? though the comedy is balanced by plenty of full scale drama. His best work comes in the scenes when he begins to question that there may be some flaws in his plan ? the moments of self-realization are stunning.Many will note some similarities between this film and Little Miss Sunshine (2006), though this one carries quite a bit more heft. It's beautifully photographed by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine (A Prophet, Rust and Bone) and captures the danger and solitude of the forest, while also capturing the more personal family dynamics. It's a film that should generate plenty of discussion, and one of the questions is ? will Noam Chomsky Day ever match Festivus in popularity?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain Fantastic is a very amusing look at trying to find a balance between two different worlds.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mortensen plays Ben, A father of six children, whose wife suffers from mental illness and Ben thought it would be good for her and the kids to live out in the wild, living off the land and tossing the rules of our society out the window. However, Ben's wife did not get better.Captain Fantastic mostly focuses on the children. On a road trip towards their mother's funeral, they get a culture clash with the rest of the world. It lays out all the info for the question of weather these kids were raised right or raise wrong.Captain Fantastic starts off showing you the children's lifestyle, were organic met growing and hunting your own food and made their own clothes and were home schooled.Then they come into society where everyone looks at them as if they are freaks, but why is it weird that these kids don't know the name brand of sneakers? The look on their faces when they experienced Street Fighter for the first time makes sense when your not use to such things. Besides, it's a shame on our Society that an 8 year old can comprehend the Bill of Rights better than those older than her.Watching these kids tackle the woods than watching them adapt to society was a bit of an eye opener. Some times the movie punches you in the gut, like when the talk about religious "organizations" and how Fat everyone in the city seems to be, but the blow is softer cause it's coming from children.But Captain Fantastic is not all one sided, detailing some down qualities of living in the wild , like the eldest son's overzealous first encounter with the opposite sex or the fact that It was the parents choice to live out in the woods, not the child's.Mortensen played the part well of a man who sometimes got too clouded by his beliefs of doing the right thing by his family and who sometimes went to far to prove a point.Also like Frank Langella's character, the father who just lost his daughter and blames his son-in-law. It's was good cause you really know people like the character he plays.Steve Zahn and Kathryn Hahn were also terrific in the movie playing yin to Ben's yang, as parents who don't fully see eye to eye with what he's doing.Overall, everyone has a upbringing different from everyone else and Captain Fantastic takes that statement to a different level, but at it's core, he's just a parent who loves his children and is trying to do the best he can in a difficult time. This theme radiates from Mortensen and the rest of the cast, which is what makes it so Fantastic.http://cinemagardens.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply the best movie I have seen since Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of a family living in the wilderness who are forced to face modern society. Its funny, with a pinch of sad, and a huge dollop of thought-provoking.Matt Ross is a genius who has found his voice and style in this film. The direction is just incredible. The script has all the fluff stripped out so it moves along at a great pace. It is edited to perfection so every scene draws you further in. It feels like "Into The Wild" as directed by Clint Eastwood. I have been going around telling random people about how great this movie is and how it will clean up at the Oscars.I don't see it appealing to everyone however. That is what makes it such a great film because no one left the screening ambivalent. The open-minded Austin, Texas audience was vastly in the Fantastic camp, but I can see this film is not going to go down well everywhere with everyone. If it did, it would be some fluff piece and not the classic it is destined to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem of a film. Great feels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic begins with the death of a boy and the birth of a man. What a gem of a film! We had to sit at the front row because of a full-house screening, but the punishing ordeal was but a breeze as 2 hours whizzed by. Viggo Mortensen plays a Renaissance man Ben who is out of this world, but never out of his depth. He is a father to six children and they live off the grid in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, eating off the land. Every day he home-schools his children in jungle survival skills, hand-to-hand combat, vertical rock-face climbing and pushes their fitness levels to way off the charts. The children, ranging from an 8-year-old to a 17-year-old, are fluent in philosophy, history, literature, foreign languages (including mandarin!), music and even quantum theory! Their mother's death forces the family of 7 to board the family bus named Steve for modern society. Ben and his posse of 6 aren't quite ready for the cruel world and the world aren't quite ready for Ben, Bolevan, Kielyr, Vespyr, Rellian, Zaja and Nai - all original names lovingly created by their parents because they feel their names should reflect the fact that each one of them is unique. OMG I want one too!The film is superbly written, acted, musically scored, shot and directed. It is suffused with social commentary on the education system, parenting techniques, societal norms and the handling of grief. Writer-director Matt Ross never pushes one agenda over another, allowing a scene to play out nicely. It takes a lot of restraint to present both sides of the argument without screaming in your face what you should do. In so doing I start to question the different ways of upbringing and which side of the fence I will sit on. Watch out for a pivotal scene at the dinner table where two families gather. You know a WWIII is about to happen as the youngest girl asks to taste wine and the man of the house is trying very hard to explain how did Aunt Harper, Ben's wife, die. The scene is hilarious and thought provoking as two schools of thought on parenting come into loggerheads with one another. There is another scene that rings emphatically true for me. Being an educator for the longest time, I have always felt teachers in classrooms predominantly emphasise the "how" and "what" in lessons. The "why" is usually treated as a cursory by-line because the "how-s" and the "what-s" will get a student through the huddles of exams and tests. Ben notices Vespyr is reading Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, a book way ahead of her Literature curve, and proceeds to ask her what she thinks of it. An ubiquitous "it is interesting" comment rings out and in Ben's family mantra "interesting" is a non-word. He coaxes out more depth and analysis from her and her reply will put pride in any parent or an educator. The film rests on Viggo Mortensen's shoulders and he is perfectly cast. He embodies all the attributes of a father - authoritarian, hardheadedness, arrogant, eccentric, kind, warm, understanding and respectful. All through it, his grace, love and adoration for his children shine out like a beacon in a dark place. This is flat-out effortlessly one of the best performances I have seen this year. The rest of the kids are also captivatingly natural and raw. I read in an interview that Ross would linger the camera on the kids to capture them in a natural state so as to bring out the best in them. If their antics and love for learning don't hit a raw nerve in you, it probably means you have already been molded and indoctrinated by the society. The last act feels a little too neat and tidy for my liking but it doesn't take away the fact that this is one of those rare movies that truly engages your intellectual mind, endeavours to question societal norms and dares to "stick it to the man". How it does all this without being high-handedly preachy is FANTASTIC! I particularly love the last sendoff scene. To me it means our lives don't have to be someone else's idea of what we should be. We can be what we choose. And if anyone is ever in a position to take our lives away from us? We should do something about that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAPTAIN FANTASTIC (2016) **** Viggo Mortensen, George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks, Charlie Shotwell, Trin Miller, Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahan, Elijah Stevenson, Teddy Van Ee, Erin Moriarty, Missi Pyle, Frank Langella, Ann Dowd. Mortensen gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the paterfamilias of a decidedly dysfunctional family he has raised with '60s hippie values that comes to the head when his wife dies and sends the brood into a major turnaround with some life lessons along the way proving blood is thicker than water in this well-conceived drama. Written and directed by actor Matt Ross the film falls on the capable shoulders of Mortensen whose deeply soulful and effective low-key performance anchors the story with gravitas, heart and solidity with a remarkable cast of newcomers as his children facing off his estranged father-in-law (Langella who thankfully shades his character as an all-too-easy-to label a villain). Funny, poignant and one of the best films of the year; a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Into the Woods and Off the Grid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ixnay on the title, which makes it this sound like the tale of some hippy-dippy nonsense. Actually it's the tale?a fairytale--about a rigorous, home-schooling, off-the-grid family: two gorgeous parents and a passel of gorgeous kids, all of them whip-smart and wonderfully fit (one attains manhood by killing a deer single-handed with a knife); all can skin and cook game and harvest edible plants; and none knows anything of the 'outside' until the sudden death of the mother forces them out of their home deep in Oregon's forests and into the strip-mall-supermarket-superhighway world of the southwest, where manifold conflicts arise. Yes, it's a fairytale, but remarkable in several ways. There's little caricature and no smarminess or gooey sentimentality, and even the 'villains' are decent people who have some right on their side, not to mention a wider view of parenting. There are leaps of faith (how do people who live primitive lives with no modern conveniences managed to look so clean and coiffed ALL the time, except when they apply mud camouflage as an aid to assassinating deer?), but you just have to accept them (even the utterly incredible ending). If you do, this good-hearted story will entertain you and earn your respect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it worth the price of a movie ticket? Yes!I felt that this film was captivating in all aspects of story-telling. Especially in it's acting where all characters in the film did a superb job with special mention to Viggo Mortensen (Ben - Father) and George Mackay (Bo - Eldest Son). This film depicts the difficulty of parenting at the highest level as Ben has to raise his 6 children in the wilderness alone in the way he thinks will be best for them. Bo shows the rational side of this story as he accepts who he is, how he was raised, and who he wants to become in the future. We clearly see the struggle of a young man who will take care of his siblings yet long for a life he has never known. This was my first time seeing George MacKay on the big screen with a big part and he certainly did not disappoint. His performance along with Viggo Mortensen was the perfect balance for the film.The realness and rawness of this film aligns perfectly with Ben's choice in parenting and survival instincts in the wilderness. We are easily immersed into the idea that civilization and it's systems of government are toxic and that we as a people who take part in it are living the wrong life. A film that can manipulate at such a high degree is a great example of a film with a genius plot.The cinematography was beautiful as to be expected. Our setting for most of the film is in the Pacific Northwest and it was a pleasure to see that they didn't saturate the screen with wide aerial shots of the forest and mountains throughout the film. Instead they focused more on the home within the mountains. Details highlighting living spaces indoors and outdoors was a beautiful contrast to the another setting later in the film. Kielyr "This house is a vulgar display of wealth" Vespy "and an unethical use of space!". I believe the cinematographer &amp; director chose not to concentrate on details of the luxurious house as they did with the home in the forest. Mostly shot on wides to display its enormity and that was all that was needed.The soundtrack I felt fit perfectly with the film. Times of quiet were also used very well here. The editing was seamless and kept the story moving perfectly.I take my hat off to Matt Ross for a genius script that focuses on ideas of socialism, the complexities of human relationships, and coming of age story. With his role as director, he was able to execute the overall emotional effect of the viewer with the film's well balanced blend of comedy and pathos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hippies Encounter Outside World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben and his large brood are living the hippie dream: they have totally withdrawn from the consumer ratrace, and are living on their own in the mountains of Western USA, sleeping in a teepee, hunting and gathering their own organic food. The children are homeschooled to a very high level, can chat in many languages, and are as fit as athletes. There is no TV, nor TV dinner here.But there is trouble in paradise: it's driven the mother crazy. We never see her: she is away in a mental hospital. Ben explains that post-partum depression has led to bipolar disorder, owing to low serotonin levels. It's a mark of the children's education that they can all understand this.The idyll comes to clash with American civilization when a family funeral forces the kids to encounter 'normal' America. They are fascinated and horrified, and the dream begins to give way....This is a very interesting film which raises lots of questions. But it has flaws. Winters in the Montana mountains are long and harsh. What do they eat? We see them hunting, but not farming, so where do they get crops to preserve?The eldest has been accepted by all the top US universities. They would be fighting with each other to give him scholarships. So Ben would have no need to seek help with tuition.Ben's training regime reminds me of the Trapp Family at the beginning of'The Sound of Music'. But no Maria comes to teach these kids the 'Do-Re-Mi' song.The photography is good, but the shots are held overlong, which seems to be a universal flaw in modern films. If viewers these days have short attention spans, why do editors give them such long takes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth watching even with its flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review per se, but a discussion of certain aspects of the film. As a teacher I was curious to see if Ben had discovered new ways to excite his kids about life and themselves. The jury was still out when Ben takes them into civilization and teaches them to steal food from a supermarket. What great life lesson was gleaned from that act I wonder? It didn't fit into any other principle or idea they were learning. It's OK to take things from others if you need them without paying. I didn't look at the movie the same after that. And then he sends his daughter on a Ninja mission that almost cripples her . . . . one that was bound to fail anyway since her goal of capturing her brother was unrealistic since he didn't want to be captured. After that the kids come to realize how valuable their father is to them and they sneak away with him. OK, I'll buy that. Question: Won't the grandfather come after them? So are they hiding out? Using aliases? "What the Flick's" Matt and Alonso praise the movie for not painting either "side" as having all the right answers . . . . for being brave. I can see that point of view but I was hoping for one side to be the clear winner. That just didn't happen. Enjoyed the ride anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had wonderful child actors and a great family story. Yes it is a unusual family but that is why I liked it. The story is believable. You will laugh and cry. A great story of a family that you will grow to love. You will like the scenery. It is thought provoking and shows all different aspects of family life. There is a small short scene of male frontal nudity but other then that it is fine. You will enjoy the full two hours of the movie. I think the child actors should be nominated for Oscars. They were very believable. It makes you think about the different ways we raise our kids. The dad may seem strange in his beliefs but that is why I liked the movie We are all different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious granola fantasy world flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a resident and lover of the Pacific Northwest and pretty far left on the political spectrum, so this should have been a film for me. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's well acted and nicely directed. But I had problems with its heavy handedness and Utopian pretentiousness.Perhaps if I were younger, with a more absolutist worldview, I'd have been able to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy this film without reservation. But it fell flat for me in a number of ways.First, there are too many things that don't add up, from having a magically fueled bus available at all times despite a lack of that terrible capitalist green stuff to a balanced and varied diet supportive of an extreme training regimen even though living as hunters and gatherers without taking the time or energy to cultivate crops. Everyone manages to stay clean and well dressed despite a lack of electricity or running water. The children are educated to be philosopher-scholars, musicians, theoretical physicists, linguists, endurance athletes and survivalists (all at the same time, as if any one of these challenges would not be a full time endeavor reserved for ones of special gifts and talents) while handling every aspect of their fully self-sufficient lives in their idyllic nature preserve. It's never explained how the family manages to purchase a huge tract of old growth forest or manages to squat without consequence on public land. Setting aside all of that, I found the political/philosophical point of view of the film heavy handed to say the least. The father inculcates the children with his westernized quasi-Buddhist spiritual philosophy and Marxist ideals; fine. But the film seems intent on antagonizing everyone who doesn't share such views -- though the themes are softened here and there, I guess in an effort to make it seem more open-minded and, thus, palatable to a broader audience.Personally, though not a Christian, I see no need to belittle and offend those who are. While projecting a supposedly tolerant and nuanced worldview, with some tips of the cap to broad-mindedness as the father realizes he's been perhaps a tad extreme, the film is actually quite intolerant and demeaning of conventional values. Why, for example, is it a good thing to educate the children on how to steal? I've no issue with a nudist lifestyle and have in fact spent time on nude beaches, so I have an understanding of the ways in which removing clothing can strip away pretensions and leave people open and vulnerable in good ways. At the same time, is inflicting one's nudist philosophy on others a good thing? It's also worth pointing out that among the most extreme of contemporary fundamentalists, Wahabi Muslims have this habit of bulldozing the shrines of Sufi Muslims and erecting public toilets in their place as a means to belittle and humiliate. This film, which tries to embody themes that are open and tolerant, in a very real way commits the same offense as the Muslim extremists of Saudi Arabia with a gratuitous scene set in a public toilet.At the end of the day, for all the messages the film seems to want to carry, it's really a rather thin and hypocritical gruel, blind to the irony of its own intolerance, offering little of lasting value (except a nicely nuanced nutshell review of the Nabikov novel "Lolita").I've still given the film six stars because it's well crafted and for its efforts to be thought provoking. Those are laudable goals even if the effort ultimately falls far short.</fullReview>

Henry David ThoreauI just happen to be reading Henry David Thoreau's book Walden for a philosophy club. When I saw this trailer I told myself I had to see this before it left my city. The similarity between the book Walden and this film are pretty high. With similar topics of arguments against commercialism and full industrialism. Then throw on top a yearning for spiritual truth and self-reliance. Still, this isn't just a stick your middle finger at the system film. It's way more than that.Matt Ross has an interesting meditation on what it means to live outside society in America. He shows a couple reasons why someone would do this and show the pros and cons in a very interesting way. The views evolve as the story moves on. Such is life eh?Viggo Mortensen acting is amazing in this role. With that said, don't overlook Jack (Frank Langella) acting in the film. For a good portion of the film, we only see the point of view from the family and mostly Ben (Viggo Mortensen) at that. But later in the film, you see Jack's motives too. I can see why he acted the way he did and I may have done this same if I was in his spot too.Bo (George MacKay) gets a couple good scenes too. It's great to see him fumble through interactions throughout the film and to discover what he wants out of adult life. This may or may not conflict with what his dad wants.I highly recommend this film and can't wait to see what Matt Ross does in the future. If this film comes to your town do yourself a favour and see it. Clever films are rare and need to be supported.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Captain Fantastic" is well FANTASTIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In only his second foray into directing, Matt Ross has created an award-winning film that is catching the public's interest across the country, and which I highly recommend. While loosely based on his own upbringing, he has managed to shine a light on the struggles faced by individuals who attempt to live according to their own values and beliefs which differ from society's norm.The plot revolves around a father, Ben Cash played by Viggo Mortensen, who's lost his wife and his battle to have the family attend her funeral and carry out her final wishes, which differ from her family's. Mr. Mortensen's performance is stellar, as usual. He states that this was one of his favorite roles and it shows. You can really identify with his existential crisis, when he's forced to find a balance between his former extremism and conventionality. The family appears very bonded and the child actors are well-cast and very accomplished for their ages.Some people thought the movie was too long, I wish it had been longer. I would like to have had more backstory. How did Ben and Leslie meet? What drew them together? How did they come to hold their values and beliefs? What led them to adopt such an extreme lifestyle? What part did mental illness play in their relationship? Those are all questions I would have liked to have answered by the movie. Any chance of a prequel Mr. Ross?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of the year so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Captain Fantastic" (2016 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Ben and his 6 kids. As the movie opens, we are looking onto the breath-taking landscapes of western Washington. The camera then zooms in on a deer, and before we know it, the deer is killed by a brutal knifing (with audible gasps in the theater audience). It turns out to be Ben's oldest son. Ben exclaims proudly "today a boy is dead, in his place is a man!". We get to know Ben and the 6 kids, ranging from 17 to about 7 or 8 in age, as they live completely off the grid. As we wonder "where is Ben's wife/the mom?", we learn that Leslie is in the hospital due to bipolar disorder. One day Ben drives into town to call the hospital to see how Leslie is doing... At this point we're not event 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature length from actor/writer/director Matt Ross, who previously directed the under the radar "28 Hotel Rooms". Here he brings something completely different, and a social experiment at that: what if you raise a family completely off the grid, in a utopian but clear anti-capitalistic setting, without any interaction with the "real" world, and what would happen if at one point those children are forced to confront the "real" world. Fascinating idea, and one that Ross examines quite nicely. The movie excels even more due to the performance of Viggo Mortensen, which is out of this world, but truth be told: the six kids are quite outstanding as well. The movie is pretty much perfect for the first 90 min., but then struggles to come to a reasonable conclusion, regretfully. There is also an outstanding score for this movie, courtesy of Alex Somers and performed by Somers and Jonsi (of Sigur Ros). Apart from the score, there are a number of other good song placements throughout the movie (but not Elton John's "Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy", if you were wondering). Can't wait to check out the soundtrack."Captain Fantastic" won Matt Ross the best director award in the "Un Certain Regard" showing at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The movie finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, I am happy to say. It seems that, other than the gasps in the opening scene of the movie, the audience really enjoyed the movie. I know I did. If you are interested in a very solid family drama with a unique social experiment, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. "Captain Fantastic" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic: Not Fantastic, but Pretty GoodCaptain Fantastic, starring Vigo Mortensen, taught me a few things. However, it wasn't the revelatory, ground breaking film it could have been. Nor was it advertised as such. Its advertising makes the film seem like a custody battle film like Kramer versus Kramer but with step son and granddad fighting over the kids. However, that wasn't the main point of the film. The main conflict in the film was between the human past and the present, human utopian society versus the human dystopian present. The film shows us the downside of modern society, something they could have done more of to bring the idea home and to help us understand protagonist Ben's anti-capitalist, anti-modernist perspective. Sure, they show us shots of a Walmart and various big box and big chain stores. But those are shot from a moving vehicle at a distance. Why not have some shots of people entrapped in the shopping experience, buying ridiculous items they don't need. There was also the opportunity to show conspicuous consumption and the damage it does in various locales, grandpas house, grocery store, a diner. Speaking of things we don't see: where are all the minorities that we know live in California? The family goes to a diner, a church, a housing complex, a grocery store, a trailer park, and in none of these places was a non-white person seen. In SoCal? I haven't seen a film this white since seeing Boyhood. But unlike Boyhood, this film dealt with important themes such as consumerism, capitalism, greed, entitlement, a persons desires after death, mental illness, personal autonomy versus group and societal responsibility and so on. The problem is that when the film makers had the chance to bring these home, they dropped the ball. The family, because of their status and background were not actually on the brink as they appeared at first. They have a network of well off people who can rescue them. I don't mind that, but in a family that is so aware of philosophy and the political economy of Marx and others, educated in historical materialism, should have also known something about race. It would have added a lot to the film if the racial differences in class opportunity had been dealt with. What these portrayal ended succeeded at was highlighting the myopia of the American left. Since the family is so fond of quotes, why not use a quote from Malcolm X, Frederick Douglas, Black Lives Matter, Medgar Evers or use this one from Angela Davis to point out that race affects economic status and is a tool capitalists use for domination: "Racism, in the first place, is a weapon used by the wealthy to increase the profits they bring in by paying Black workers less for their work." Then Ben could have pointed out, This has been true of Mexicans and other cultures, look at Cesar Chavez's struggle. And what of the stolen land and the Native Americans. In fact, there are several moments when the family could have honored Native Americans and shown respect. The director and writer didn't go far enough. Not only would these quotes and acknowledgements have been in the spirit of the film, but it would have helped to break down the race barrier the film creates. That, and showing some non-white people in the film would have been great. For example, if Ben's oldest son had fallen for an African American, Native American, Latino, or Asian girl in the film instead of a the whitest girl in the state, race would have come to the forefront and the race/class quotes could have been utilized when people outside Ben's family overreacted to his son's attraction. So utopia and socialism is presented as an only white concern. But don't we have enough of that already in film, pure white views of life? On the plus side, the film shows many views on the consumerism versus collectivism scale, it's not boring or drawn out, and the end works well. Unlike "Swiss Army Man", the director didn't run away from the challenging ending. The acting is stellar from the youngest child to Vigo Mortensen and the scene vacuuming Frank Langella as well as Ann Dowd playing grandma. The shots are adequate and the editing works fine. The use of wide shots and close ups, the variety of framing, helps us learn about the characters and the family. For example, as tensions rise between family members as well as Ben and his step father, we see the characters in close up. As the tension wanes, the shots become wider. The music was okay, and I especially like the use of a classic heavy metal song. Only now do I realize how well written it is. What I learned was Vigo Mortensen is good looking with or without a beard, but more importantly, he's a great actor. I had not fully appreciated his talent before. I also learned that the issue of Hollywood so white is much deeper than I had known. If a film addressing progressive themes can be so blatantly white, what hope do we have for racial equality in the media, let alone the nation. The nation is racially segregated; there is no reason to make films that are even MORE segregated than society as a whole. Rating: Matinée. I recommend the film for the acting and themes. It is well paced and doesn't draw out the ending. And the ending works. However, the film for all its introspection only touches the surface of theses issues. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic lives up to it's name in being truly fantastic. It's a heartfelt story, written with so much attention to detail and character emotion and development that I wouldn't hesitate to call the screenplay brilliant. The wonderful work of director &amp; writer Matt Ross is very present in the way that he perfectly creates the scenes like a painting. The cinematography is wonderful. I wide variety of shots that perfectly focuses on the most important little things. The story is about a rough around the edges story of a family that lives out in the wilderness, until there mom dies. Almost all of the actors were jaw dropping. Viggo Mortensen appears for the first time in forever, and he does a absolutely wonderful job. It's a sad one folks, but it will sure make you feel so, so, so, so, extremely happy that you saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CAPTAIN FANTASTIC': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Indie drama flick; about a family, that has lived in isolation in the Pacific Northwest forests (for a decade), that's forced to reenter society when tragedy strikes. It was written and directed by actor, turned filmmaker, Matt Ross. The film stars Viggo Mortensen; and it features small supporting turns from Frank Langella, Steve Zahn, Kathryn Hahn and Ann Dowd. It's been a small hit at the indie theaters, and it's also received mostly positive reviews from critics, and fans alike. I went into the movie knowing very little about it (having not seen a single trailer), and I really enjoyed it.Ben and Leslie Cash (Mortensen and Trin Miller) had been living 'off the grid', in the Washington state mountains with their six children, for close to ten years. They taught their kids very strict survival skills, as well as the benefits of a socialist society. When Leslie suffers from severe bipolar disorder, and kills herself because of it, Ben decides to take his family to her funeral, in New Mexico, despite Leslie's father (Langella) strongly discouraging him against it. The family's new experiences, in the conventional world, challenges all of their staunch views on life (especially Ben's). The movie is a great examination of extremism verses conformity; it does a very fair job of weighing the pros and cons of each. It's also an excellent character study, that's filled with involving performances; especially from Viggo, but the child actors are all good as well. It's equally funny, heart breaking and thought provoking. It's definitely a film that will leave a lasting impression on me, and I wouldn't mind revisiting it, at some point in the future. I look forward to seeing more from Matt Ross.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9.5 of 10. It's tempting to give it a perfect rating. This is the kind of film that should win an Oscar. Genius story telling combined with perfect social timing.With grunge-era people now in full family mode or just escaping it, it fits that there should not only be a film set in a grunge utopia but complete with the filthy, tragic, painful aspects of life that grunge art is in large part dedicated to portraying.One of the few drawbacks was its placement of Bikini Girl's "Rebel Girl". It's a great song that should be in the soundtrack, but they missed a few more ideal places for it. Otherwise, the soundtrack is a key part of keeping the film moving along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aesthetically on high-level, questioning the most important points of human life and importance of verbal, mental, physical, social, emotional development and the inability of developing them all on the same level. There are so many factors that influence on one's development. And there is space for many mistakes.High quality acting. Viggo Mortensen gives one of his best performances, a devoted father that wants only the best for his kids, an authority, a leader, a teacher, loving, loyal husband, a grieving human with tough, determined, honest attitude he transmits to his children. Kids, from the youngest to the oldest, act with such naturalness that you simply dive in this masterfully-made journey.Film doesn't show how one should live and not live because both sides are flawed. Internal and external conflicts make you question the reality of the present, giving you space to find your own balance of how one should live.I personally started thinking of how there is a massive space for improvement in every field of our lives. An example is school. And how devastating it is that one could neglect the knowledge at that extant. Kids need to be inspired and motivated to learn. And more important is that they have to build inner-motivation that will make them interested and ambitious as they improve the world around them. And of course kids can't be accused for not wanting to learn if the professors don't show them how and why to love their subject. And of course parents to support them.This (above) is just one point of where this movie has taken my entranced mind.This is a movie for every generation. It needs to be noticed, it deserves to be talked about, and discussed. Because that is the point of Captain Fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fantastic Lesson on Compromise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those 'wow' films I see once every blue moon. I walked into this film with no idea of the plot, and it was money well spent. The story centres around a married couple who decide to have, raise and school their children in the wilderness far from the consumerist Culture of modern times. When the mother (who was very ill and seeking help in her parents' hometown) commits suicide, this drives the husband and children out of their comfort zone and into modern America to attend her funeral, and to make sure her dying wishes were fulfilled to the letter.The children find themselves often out of place and slightly alien in this new environment, despite being incredibly knowledgeable and critical thinkers. This movie is extremely touching. What amazed me is the number of issues they managed to work into this beautiful story line, including how to raise your kids, honesty to children, children leaving the nest, compromise, achieving a balance between your own belief system and the real world, interpersonal vs logical intelligence, and coping with grief. Despite the emotional tsunami, the movie is light and funny at times, and it achieves that delicate balance so that it doesn't veer into either dismal depressive drama or callous careless comedy. There isn't one single actor in this movie who did not do their job to absolute perfection. Viggo Mortensen should get an Oscar for his role as Ben, and I think this will probably be one of his most remembered roles alongside Aragorn. The dialogue is down-to-earth yet excellent with some very memorable scenes. The soundtrack is very carefully chosen with some very fitting numbers and a surprisingly good folk cover of a heavy rock classic. I won't tell you which. This definitely ranks as one of my best cinema outings. A big chapeau to the makers, cast and crew behind this gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matt Ross ("Silicon Valley's" - Galvin Belson) steps into the director/writer chair here, presenting a unique look at off the grid and home school living. Viggo Mortensen ("The Road") graciously and cautiously leads his family of six (George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Nicholas Hamilton, Shree Crooks and Charlie Shotwell) in the wildness, away from the confines of all things materialistic. In good times, the family is self-sufficient and happy. However, when forced back into the real world, the stark differences of their way of life become more apparent. Mortensen is great in these type of raw roles, as the camera eats up his casual approach. The kids are great across the board, with Mackay and Hamilton giving that little something extra that keeps one glued to their characters. "The American's" Frank Langella and Ann Dowd, team up again as the parent in- laws, and it's easy to see why they work so well together, and Steven Zahn and Kathryn Hahn make a great couple who have very different way of raising their child, and thus walk a fine line when interacting with Mortensen's character. Helping Ross's excellent direction and storyline along is the excellent soothing music by Alez Somers ("We Bought a Zoo"). There are no explosions, gun battles, ships from outer space or funny animated creators here. However, "Captain Fantastic" is filled with family appreciation and the struggle/desire to do the best one can do with a given situations and for the betterment of the children. This could be one of the sleepers of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Struggles to Make Its Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late in the film, our protagonist Ben (Mortensen) grief stricken and woebegone, reads a letter from his belated wife Leslie (Miller). By this revelation we're at the lowest point of the hero's journey; the point something inside Ben is supposed to ignite, something is supposed to change, something is supposed to happen. "We are raising philosopher kings out here," she writes in a moment of clarity. A few scenes later he sulks further; hanging his regret and loss in a Jesse Jackson '88 t-shirt.Years before this moment, Ben, his wife, and his half-dozen kids found paradise in the rural isolation of the Pacific Northwest. They live as subsistence hunter/gatherers and keep a tight ship training their bodies and minds with intense physical exercise and fireside reading. When we first meet their oldest Bodevan (MacKay) he's covered head-to-toe in mud and just stalked and killed his first deer. Their youngest son Rellian (Hamilton) can understand theoretical physics and their eldest daughter Kielyr (Isler) can analyze the themes of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. Yet despite their accomplishments, they've rarely ventured outside their insulated existence and are growing concerned over their mother's absence. Leslie dies in a mental hospital in New Mexico, forcing the rest of the family to take a cross-country road trip to say their goodbyes. What's worse, the in-laws are threatening legal action if Ben shows his face at the funeral.Captain Fantastic is supposed to be about grief and largely succeeds in creating moments of genuine pathos and honesty. Viggo Mortensen's natural charisma lends itself to a never-ending sea of emotion while still holding to the stoic gruffness that the character requires. The illusion is topped by a somber but good-natured rictus, a Walt Whitman-esque beard and a life's philosophy of "action not words." The children fair just as well, playing their one-note like their little hearts depended on it with Hamilton being the standout as the familial Judas whose grief has taken a self-destructive dimension.Yet the film doesn't get passed second gear largely due to it's sanctimonious utopian proselytizing. The film spends and awful lot of time humanizing Ben and his "alternative" lifestyle to the detriment of any respectful and authentic ruminations on death and grief the film is trying to highlight. The children helpfully parrot his thoughts on proto-fascistic-capitalism, Maoist-Trotskyist dialectic, Noam Chomsky, beret-wearing, cigarette puffing existentialism etc., making their little commune seem like a harmless byproduct of their quirk. Outsiders such as Ben's sister- in-law (Hahn) and grandpa Jack (Langella) look like intolerant a**holes by comparison because they don't let their kids have wine at dinner and are agog that their nephews and nieces don't know what a pair of Nike's is.Liberals will likely be consumed and delighted by Captain Fantastic's positive feedback loop of self-reliant leftism; as if Ben's land of milk and honey could be the reality of only we had a Bernie Sanders presidency and we all "stuck it to the man." Yet I ask, would a film like this be as readily accepted if it were a gaggle of fundamentalist Christians? How about a Warren Jeffs-type cult? Take away the pseudo-Partridge Family, father-knows-best noise and replace Frank Langella's disapproving mug with the Federal Government and you got yourself an ultra-left version of Waco.Thankfully I think director Matt Ross knows this and tempers Ben's absolutism with a dollop of compromise by the time the film reaches its final coda. Additionally the thematic crux of the film does reach a conclusion, the satisfaction of which is sure to divide some audiences. Bolstered by great acting across the board, Captain Fantastic could have lived up to its comparisons to Little Miss Sunshine (2006) but settles with being a neo-hippie version of Swiss Family Robinson (1960).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly I am not the best audience for this film about a family that subsists independently on the land in the Pacific Northwest (Washington State?), which is why I boosted my rating up to 2 stars. I have never gone for the type of communal existence that lives off the land and which shuns and despises civilization. I like my espressos too much and enjoy the cinema...The father (played by Viggo Mortensen) and his five or six kids live and hunt and exercise in the rain forest. He is a really despicable father with an extreme ego and extreme distaste for any whose opinion differs from his. He plays God to his children who simply adore Daddy ? and have hardly the backbone to confront Daddy Dearest. Does that make any sense? Hardly! I raised two children and there were confrontations and arguments on a daily basis. These kids are not normal. I could never buy into this phony family with their contrived sappy dialogue.There were many other irritations. Noam Chomsky, Karl Marx are quoted ? as if these could help one in living in the rough outdoors. This all became so pretentious and tiresome ? and then boring ? it was like Daddy and his children were script reading and promoting an agenda. And where was the money coming from ? when father and children set off in a cross-country gas-guzzling jalopy bus which must consume tremendous quantities of fuel? So much for not leaving a carbon imprint on the environment! Where was the money coming from for these rock climbing ventures? This was also a form of child abuse.I really became tired of whatever message it was that this film was spewing out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic was fantastic (sorry, had to be said). It was no the movie I intended to see today, but on a whim, I decided it was the movie I should see today. So glad I did. The film really resonated with me as a parent, an intellectual, and a Socialist!Viggo Mortensen played the father, Ben Cash, of six children, whose mother had recently take absent for reasons which are disclosed later in the film. He and his wife decided to raise their family in the Pacific Northwest mountains of Washington, completely forgoing all conveniences and entirely off the grid. Far from being ignorant hippies, the entire family, is extremely well versed in a wide variety of subjects and skills from philosophy and quantum physics, to language and music, to first aid and hunting. What they lack is socialization in the world that most of us inhabit, which they discover quite abruptly when they find themselves immersed in it unexpectedly. True to form, dad tries to make it into a learning experience, but it is he who does the learning in the end."Captain Fantastic" might have gotten bogged down in overbearing preachiness, but thanks to its frank dialogue and charming wit, it remained a pleasure to watch; eliciting both hearty laughs and heartfelt tears in equal measure. Not all of the details are particularly plausible, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, it is a film that will leave you with more than a little to ponder. My only regret is that I didn't come up with Noam Chompsky Day first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captain Fantastic: When Worlds Collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Cash and his six children live in a world beyond time, beyond modernity, beyond common American ideals.In the extended opening shot, we soar leisurely above towering evergreens. This lush green landscape is unmarked by man: the kind of place Sierra Club members dream of hiking.We sail lower, settling on an intimate closeup of a deer munching leaves. The idyllic scene is shattered when a knife-wielding killer leaps upon the deer, subdues the panicked animal and swiftly slashes its throat.The killer, we now see, is a young man smeared with mud like a third-world tribesman, panting beside the bloody tableau. Out of the woods, six other mud-smeared humans of various sizes emerge and circle the deer-slayer and the deer. The elder male administers a kind of communion commemorating the death of this boy and the birth of the man he has become. In lieu of a communion wafer, he offers the young man with the deer's liver to eat.Thus we are introduced to the Cash clan and their world. This first major motion picture from actor-writer-director Matt Ross stakes out fresh story-telling territory and has won early praise that may foreshadow future Oscars.Ben Cash, the father (Viggo Mortensen, in a thoughtful, restrained performance) teaches a home-schooling curriculum like no other, based on "healthy mind, healthy body" and administered with a healthy dose of survivalist knowledge and anti-consumerism.The children's day consists of reading and study time, balanced by a rigorous physical fitness regime that includes climbing, fighting, running and strength training.He tutors his unplugged brood with books and dialogue, requiring them to not simply read and recite, but to comprehend and communicate their own thoughts about the books he assigns them, largely from the literature of left-wing thought.Every opinion is on the table for discourse and communal votes. So, although Ben Cash is father and mentor, he is no dictator. He is developing "philosopher kings," not subjects.The clan hunt and gather what they eat. For money, they make wooden bird houses and other products. They sew their own clothes from animal skins. They have no cell phones or TVs. They exercise by climbing, fighting, running and doing strength training. Consumption is bad, self-reliance is good.Ben tells the truth. Eight-year-old Nai (Charlie Shotwell) asks what sexual intercourse is, and Ben answers with a mechanistic explanation that leaves Nai wondering why a man would want to do that. Ben explains that it is pleasurable and creates babies. Later, on the family-created holiday, Noam Chomsky Day, Ben gives Nai a copy of "The Joy of Sex" as a little joke. The real gift is a super-cool 7" hunting knife.The children are all thrilled to receive serious knives, fit for serious survival. But it becomes increasingly obvious that survival in the larger world requires more than woodsman skills.If only the family could live in the woods forever. But these young philosopher kings are bound to encounter modern culture in all its garish superficiality. Eighteen-year-old Bodevan (George MacKay), the eldest, wishes to attend a good college. How will that work, he wonders, when all he knows is from books, and none from living in the modern world? MacKay's performance perfectly captures the both the manly confidence of the survivalist woodsman and the timorous uncertainty of a stranger in a world he simply can't comprehend.The Cashes are driven into modern-day America by the suicide of Leslie (in flashbacks, Trin Miller), the children's mother. Finally receiving treatment in a facility for long-term bipolar disorder, she was unable to fight her mental illness any longer. The arrangements for a Christian funeral by her rich father, Jack, played with smooth stolidness by Frank Langella, enrage Ben, since his Buddhist wife had specifically requested a cremation and toilet-flushing of her ashes in her Last Will and Testament.Stubbornly, Ben devises a plan to steal her body and carry out Leslie's final wishes. So the family sets out for civilization aboard Steve, their adapted school bus, to carry out the corpse kidnapping plan. On the way, in a travel trailer campsite, Bodevan has a squirmy humorous encounter with an average American girl which ends in humiliation and shame, and he blows up at Ben.A dinner at the home of Leslie's sister, Harper (Kathryn Hahn), flares into a screaming attack on Ben after he tells her two boys the stark truth: Their aunt didn't "die from her disease," she killed herself. When Harper angrily challenges Ben's tutorial methods, Ben administers a pop quiz on the Bill of Rights to her two sluggish, Xbox-addicted preteen boys, then to a much younger Cash child. The Cash kid leaves the young louts in the intellectual dust. Point made.The struggle of wills between husband and father over Leslie's funeral ratchets up when a couple of the children are injured in physical challenges, and Jack threatens to take the children away from Ben. The injuries, and Leslie's suicide, raise Ben's doubts as to whether he had done the right thing after all by bringing the family to the wilderness. The corpse-stealing plan turns out to be ill-advised, pitting him against an equally stubborn man with far greater resources. Not to give the rest of the story away, I'll just say that in the end, the resilience of the Cash clan prevails.The questions this film raises are not deep, but at a time when many question the capitalistic foundation upon which America is built, it is intriguing to see what plays out when that foundation is seriously questioned, and none of the answers are definitive.In "Captain Fantastic," a family lives either an idyllic life or a dangerous fantasy. Perhaps both. This film gives you food for thought, as well as entertainment for an afternoon, and it is a most satisfying meal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Raising 6 children, three boys and three girls, in the wilderness would be hard enough. Training them to be skilled hunters, gifted at self defense and schooling them effectively would be beyond the skills of most parents. But this Dad isn't most people. His oldest son speaks 6 languages and is accepted to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown and M.I.T. His youngest girl can recite or explain the Bill of Rights. All six children are able rock climbers and very fit. In keeping with the politics of the day they are followers of Noam Chomsky and more than just a little left of Bernie Sanders. All of this already strains credulity and is it really necessary? So, when the children and their father decide to leave their retreat in the woods to attend their mother's funeral, we are sure that there will be a culture clash. The excesses of this clash are to be expected after the excesses of the characterization of the children. The mere fact that these children grow up in the wilderness does not mean that their parents would have failed to provide any social skills whatsoever. This makes the culture clash setup less believable and true to life. If there might have been any issues that the audience is expected to think about, the way the characters are drawn detracts so much that any serious issues that could have been raised are no longer relevant.Perhaps this is the reason this movie is listed BOTH as a comedy AND a Drama. But it succeeds at neither. My long car trip to see it was really not worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Asian-American wife had a two-word response to this movie: "White people." Opening with a hunting scene that mashes together "Last of the Mohicans" and "Apocalypse Now," the movie at first seems like a kind of liberal survivalist fantasy, a story of a family of free spirits of apparently Nordic extraction gone militantly native somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. But the mom is absent--getting treated for depression in a far-off place--and the dad seems dangerously strict, making everyone go for long bouts of running and calisthenics, and quizzing his children by firelight on the individualized, college-level curricula he has assigned each of them. The oldest child is college-age, and, it turns out, has gotten accepted to all of the Ivies, knowledge he discovers and then hides from his father while accompanying him on a supply run to town. The father too acquires a secret on this same supply run: he learns by phone that his wife, staying with her parents in New Mexico, has killed herself by cutting her wrists. She did this the night before, while the family was improvising a raucous folk-instrument jam around the fire, initiated somewhat aggressively by the black-sheep middle son, a short-haired 'tween who simmers with tension. It is this boy who, when the father breaks the news to the family in their yurt, lashes out angrily while the others wail in sorrow. He is angry at both his mother, for leaving them, and at his father, for somehow causing her to. The audience can sympathize with his rage, because we know the father is more than just a little strict--he is a criminal, apparently, since his father in law threatens to have him arrested if he shows his face at the funeral. Is he a draft dodger? A spousal abuser? Did he make terroristic threats to the government? We never find out, but we do learn the children are slightly imperiled by his zeal to turn them into physical as well as intellectual warriors: they are all covered in bruises and scratches from their forced exertions, and further tragedy seems imminent. The kids want to crash the funeral and handle their mother's interment as she specified in her will (cremation followed by the disposal of her cremains via a flush down a public toilet). Riding back from a training excursion in Steve, the family's converted school bus, they plead with their dad to head to New Mexico where her memorial is to take place. The father first protests, but then agrees, unable to resist an act of rebellion against his father in law. He points the bus down the mountain and towards their fate. There are some moments of humor as they enter the built environment; the children pretend to be zealous home-schooled Christians to repel a policeman who boards the bus; the father fakes a heart attack to create a diversion while the kids steal groceries; the oldest boy makes out with a goth girl at a campsite and proposes to her after their first kiss. Are they in a cult? No, but it seems like it. They celebrate "Noam Chomsky Day" spontaneously with their stolen food, gorging on grocery-store cake and singing a special song to a Shepard Fairey-style poster of his image. They are free thinkers, but how free are they if they can't relate to anyone but each other?The family warms up for their big comeuppance at the funeral with a stop off at the father's sister's house, where worlds collide and the children fail to bond with their cousins over violent video games. The father comes on too strong during an argument with his sister and brother and law about about his parenting choices, but then softens when he realizes he is a guest in a world of more-or-less well-meaning people. This softening is what the movie turns out to be about, we discover in the long-awaited climax. But it is not the compromising of ideologies that drives the narrative, but rather of gender roles: the strong-willed man must learn how to take the place of the children's compassionate mother, lest he drive his children away or "ruin" their lives, as he himself puts it in a believable moment of emotional reckoning. The fact that the only thing close to a person of color in this film is Frank Langella--playing the hostile father in law ensconced in a gated community-- tells you a lot about its intentions. It isn't social commentary. It's not trying to show us how other people live or think. It doesn't want you to question your politics. No one will feel transported by this movie into someone else's shoes, or brain, or heart. It wants you to think about fathers and mothers and children, and how families make their own worlds and support each other when the wider world intrudes. In this way, the plot and the sentiments evoked are beautifully matched, and the film is emotionally convincing even as it strains credulity with hackneyed details. In the final moments of the film, we see the father bathed in soft morning light, contentedly silent instead of barking orders. He watches his children absorbed in their books around the breakfast table as they wait for the school bus, having just brought in eggs from the chicken coop that's become of Steve, the vehicle that took them out of the murky forest and into a happier life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longing for Eden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic begins in a paradise based on Plato's Republic. Ben and Leslie, attempting to escape from Leslie's mental illness, have retreated into the wilderness of the Northwestern United States, where they and their children live isolated from the rest of the world?isolated from greed, ambition, and deceit, from all that is broken in the world. There, in the Eden they've created, they live out what they think it means to be truly free, giving their children an intense physical and intellectual education and teaching them to live off the land.But Leslie's illness isn't cured by paradise, and while in a hospital being treated for the only brokenness she and Ben could not escape, Leslie commits suicide. Leslie's father forbids Ben from attending the funeral, but Ben is quickly reminded by his daughter Zaja of the highest ideal in their Eden: human freedom.Together, he and his children venture back into the world from which he and Leslie escaped, and in the clash that ensues between Ben and Leslie's (extremely wealthy) family, Ben questions both his ability to parent and the education that he's been providing his children in the wilderness. Ben even comes to question the wife he thought he knew when he learns that she helped their oldest son Bodevan apply to elite colleges like Harvard and Stanford.Devastated by the loss of the Eden he thought he had, Ben agrees to leave his children in the custody of Leslie's parents and goes his separate way. But when he discovers his children have hidden away on his bus, holding fast to the education their father had given them, the vigor returns, and together, they dig up Leslie's body to give her the burial she always wanted.The movie ends not with an escape back to Eden, but with a newfound acceptance of the inescapable brokenness in our world. Immediately following their "burial" of Leslie, Ben and his children bid Bodevan farewell as he heads off to college. In the end, Ben returns his family to the broken world from which he and Leslie had tried so futilely to escape. They no longer live in the wilderness, but a rural suburb, where they still grow their own food and survive off the land, but are educated in the public school system.As a theology student at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, I interpret this film with a uniquely Christian perspective. In it, I find God's voice. I hear the Divine awakening of the desire in our hearts for the Eden we lost so long ago, for a world freed from greed, corruption, deceit, and illness. But I also hear a stern criticism of the Church for not speaking out against (and even joining) the greed, corruption, and deceit that plagues our world and our politics. Christians who claim to have been transformed by the good news that Christ brought seem to live no differently than the rest of the world. They've lost a sense of the in-breaking Kingdom of God, the very essence of which is to redeem our world from the brokenness that Ben and Leslie so futilely sought to escape. Rather than hearing in the voices of people like Ben and Leslie the longing for what Christianity promises and joining them in their efforts, like Leslie's father we have dismissed their ideas as "far too liberal" or "out of touch with the real world." We have sold out to the brokenness of our world, and in doing so, have forsaken the very Kingdom we claim to preach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is everything a movie needs to be. First Vigo was amazing. He absolutely killed this role. The screenplay was just beautiful and perfect. This movie roasts the world, politics, and religion. This movie opens up the truth about everything. It has so much love and learning's that your IQ grows after this movie. The kids acted perfect. There were no major plot holes. It does start a little weird and clueless and it really changes throughout the movie. At first you think its the lot of peter pan but it changes and becomes this deep and philosophical movie that it really puts you to think. If you don't like this movie you have no sense of what life means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Right movie, wrong title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic may not be the best title for the audience this movie is looking to attract. Outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially the young kids are a highlight. Hopefully it will be remembered in award season.The movie drags a bit. You know it is going to drag as the opening scene of the forest from a helicopter is too long. Get past the deer killing and things settle down. There are a few to many shots of the star staring into space that could have been cut to tighten things up.Even with it's flaws, it is a good story told well. There are plenty of close-ups that are too close for the big theater screen. The movie is in limited release but will stick around with positive word of mouth. It will be equally enjoyable on a home platform.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a lot of people will like it just because of the theme. it was very well acted but there wasn't much of a plot. it was also too long and drawn out. there was very little character development (which I will say is hard to do when you're following the life of a whole family) . i saw it on 6 dollar Tuesday and to be honest regretted my decision afterwards. its one of those movies that's decent but not good for the theater. which is a shame because it has a ton of potential. 6 stars. it was a good idea but could have been executed way better. be wary of the high ratings and good reviews by people who just like the "everything ends up OK in the end" films. there's more to cinema than that \|/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mainly Hits The Mark - Both as a Compelling Drama of an Unusual Family &amp; a Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an almost first time director (his second), Matt Ross, did a fantastic job with Captain Fantastic, appropriately nuanced without being cloying, anti-establishment without being absurdist, interesting multi-dimensional characters without caricatures, and different yet being sufficiently mainstream, skillfully steering the difficult edges between realism, satire, and drama. In lesser hands, it could have become another Jason Bateman or Robin Williams type of one-dimensional comedy or pretentious drama - which unfortunately the likes of The Family Fang (acted and directed by Jason Bateman, whom I like as an actor, but doesn't yet have the director's chop) fell into despite its initial promise of being a Wes Anderson type black comedy.Matt Ross is also an accomplished actor - I remember him as the shallow conniving yet cowardly Alby Grant from Big Love some years back. So effective was he in that TV series, that I find it hard to accept that such a low-down 'character' could bring such warmth and empathy towards Captain Fantastic as a director - which could have in lesser directorial hands become affected and pretentiously clever rather than the effective portrayal of an unusual non-mainstream family.The casting is excellent, including the mother who we only see in brief flashbacks or as a dead body - but everything about her face and the way the others interacted and talked about her fits in like hand and glove, providing the believability that is required to carry the movie forward given the unusual premise the family is in. The children and of course the father (Viggo Mortensen) played their roles very realistically without under or over-playing it, which they could easily have done, which would then change the whole tone of the movie to something plain, loud, crass and boringly overly showy and dramatized or 'comedied'.Kudos too to the director's sensitivity in not turning the grandfather into another one- dimensional white selfish righteous rich buffoon. It almost went there, but pulled back just in time.There are of course some inconsistencies (e.g. how did the girls have nicely coiffed tresses, or the kids ever learning things just sitting down and reading 'deep' books, etc) and un-explained fast forwards (e.g. how could all the children hide beneath the bus floor for so many hours, and why the grandparents did not alert the police of their absence, or why digging up a grave by the whole family did not raise any alarm, etc) - but at the end of the day, they mattered somewhat, but not enough to mar the flow, impact and enjoyability of the movie.Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review i have done on IMDb and its because i had the misfortune to see captain fantastic at a preview screening in the uk this morning.I probably see about 200 to 300 films a year and don't think i have ever felt so angry and sick about a film such as this.Some people walked out but i just kept watching to see if it could introduce more and more ideals of living this lifestyle. As has been previously mentioned how was it OK to steal food from a supermarket using the kids.In England we call that shoplifting and you are arrested and then go to court and usually have to do community payback of some kind.So much in this film is smugly aimed at how much better a lifestyle Ben had for his kids.Well Ben its not real life as much as you think it is.Who pays for your over the top gas guzzler of a coach?Where do the books come from to teach the kids blah blah blah</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Captain Fantastic was far from it. Hippy father raises six kids, in the forest of course, to conform to his way of thinking. Home-schooled to be anti-business, anti-police, anti-Christian and anti-conservative. I think the prop department must have run out of the standard Che Guevara t-shirts because this nut wore a "Jesse Jackson '88" shirt instead. The kids seemed well-schooled in the leftist arts: they were very proficient at robbing a grocery store while the father diverted attention by pretending to have a heart attack. Take that, you capitalist pigs! I suppose there are people who approve of this film's message; I just hope they don't elect the next president!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Progressive Leftwing Hollywood Utopia Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Should we dispense with analyzing performances? I was impressed, as you were, by all the child-actors, including Viggo, who is always good with whatever script he's handed. It's not that hard, is it? You stand there and recite lines painstakingly written over 10-year period, in some cases, and play them off like they were your character's immediate reactions.Maybe that's what I should focus on, the writing. What is the story? It is a Progressive's wet dream. A masturbatory turn at experimental utopia in the beautiful American wilderness, where all the best of America is at once enjoyed and cursed. Noam Chomsky is "god" and his "bible" quoted frequently by a man who has created an enmeshed existence in a lush PNW forest. But if they need it, a giant coach-like bus named Steve is always dieseled up and ready to drive the family around so they can criticize free market capitalism. In this Progressive Utopia, all Progressive theories about child rearing, religion, government and life, are auto-proved true through the magic of film making. Profanity, discussion of sex, the painful truth about everything, and nudity, are general among the children of varying ages. Never mind that the same Left crucified The Duggars when their son molested his sisters in a similar enmeshed situation. Progressive Utopian siblings coexist nudely without issue, because humans are animals, and all the rote. Conveniently, Man's desire for spiritual connection outside of himself is tossed aside. Everything works perfectly in Progressive Utopia. That is, until outsiders introduce Christianity.Where other films show the truth of such experiments, that Man's efforts to create a world unto his own ego will implode; that his offspring will depart from his ways which he never successfully passes on; that it "takes a village" to socialize children; this film disagrees. Yes, the man's world did collapse, but only with the help of Christians who blindly follow superstition and send children to mind-dulling public school, the two magically combined, though traditionally Christian families prefer home or private school.Progressive Utopia doesn't work anymore than Christian Utopia, which I gladly concede, and neither one needs help failing as long as they have human ego, pride, and a measure of dysfunction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not what you might think it is as it is really a story about a gross bunch who do a disgusting thing at the end of the movie so do not wast any money on this. Even so it is well acted and directed but so what! If you think that this is a movie to take kids to see then think again. Who needs to see this horror story masquerading as a regular flick. how disgusting can you get. I Would tell you what this disgusting thing is but then I would be in violation of the spoiler policy of this web site and rightly so. Be advised that such a thing is just not something you subject a dog to let alone your own children. Seriously? Give me a break! How can anyone think that is not just something that is atrocious and grossly offensive. Couldn't they have thought of something else like you know anything for a quest or what ever that is (mission?) Good such folks should make fun of Christianity.Who the hell would care?I sure as hell don't!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in the woods may not be all it's cracked up to be, as Ben and his Free Range family find out. Their idyllic life in the great outdoors comes to an impasse, as the mother of the family has committed suicide in a mental hospital after several episodes of depression. Now Ben has to make arrangements with her parents for her funeral. She wanted to be cremated, but her family, which has always been opposed to their alternate lifestyle, refuses and they say she will have a church funeral and then a burial.Their training and learning have been interrupted, the 2 boys and 4 girls arrive for the funeral and then learn they are completely unprepared for normal suburban life. Ben, however, has already lived in civilized society and gave it up for the forest primeval. Played by Viggo Mortensen, Ben exudes a smug self-assurance but cannot compensate for the eye-opening revelation his brood experiences; Video games? Frosted Flakes? Slowly Ben learns you can't put the toothpaste (another discovery) back in the tube, so to speak.Ben is a disciple of Noam Chomsky and so, then, are his children. They endorse any religion except Christianity, and truth to tell, are exceptionally bright and scholarly (in addition to survival skills) - 'home schooled', says Ben when asked. In the 60's they would be called 'hippies', and it takes an entire picture to uncover the folly of such a movement. Couple this unsavory lifestyle with an unsatisfying ending and you have a picture that fails to meet expectations, especially given the lofty rating it presently enjoys.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Concept Poorly Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts off really slow and proceeds to get even slower. There is no real character development, and frankly, no likable or even compelling characters. The places where there were slight shifts in the story line were predictable and telegraphed.At one point in the film, one of the characters says "Jesus Christ...we get it. You've made your f*****g point." I had the same thought about the movie 10 minutes earlier.While technically just shy of two hours, the movie feels about 4 hours long.In short, the movie feels like it was written by a philosophy major who didn't graduate and filmed by a film major who skipped the classes on the need for an editor.</fullReview>
