		<shortDescription>Just Like Old Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at an advanced screening in Long Beach and I must say the Jackass crew is back. This movie is exactly what I was expecting it to be. My friends and I debated whether or not the guys were too old but apparently they were offered enough money to not care much. This is just like Jackass Number 2 in that they got a big budget to do the set piece stunts. There is still the low key, sneak up on people pranks, but now in glorious slow motion.The set piece stunts are in bright and crisp 3D that really adds to the effect of whatever they are trying to do. As others have stated the intro is pretty cool but I was actually left wanting just a bit more. Note the paintballs though, in amazing 3D. This is Johnny, Ryan Dunn, Steve-o, Pontius, and Weeman's show. Dave and Aaron end up getting hurt as usual but are awesome sports.There are more gross out and insane, painful stunts than pranks on unwitting public people, but a few of the funniest skits fall into the latter category. The midget couple at the bar is the funniest in the movie by far. These guys are as funny as always and their genuine friendship is really quite nostalgic at the end. Its been nearly 10 years since Jackass went off the air and these guys are really still at the top of their game. The entire theater was crying with laughter the entire film. I was invited to stay after for a post film discussion and one of the other people summed it up nicely by saying he felt that not a single skit was a misfire. Matt Hoffman, Jeff Tremaine, and Spike Jonze were in the crowd.Of the 25 or so people that stayed after the film, 22 thought it was the best of the trilogy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass 3D has intentionally done something I did not expect it to do. It purposely tugs at your heart if you have been watching the show since it's original inception in 2000. Seeing these guys at their age now and how well their chemistry is evoked on the screen makes you long for the early 2000's so this crew can always be around.The purpose to see this film is to be grossed out of your mind right? Well rest assured you will laugh hard and be extremely grossed out. The film flows with a great pace just as the predecessors did.As I said before, if you are a huge fan of the show, like I am, the closing credits of the film unexpectedly tugs at your emotions. It really is nostalgic to see this cast at their current age. Though they are all still in good physical shape, you can't help but wonder how much longer their bodies can handle the abuse.Heres to more good times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Goal on an Empty Net</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does one review "Jackass 3D"? The tertiary installment in MTV's prank and stunt franchise is basically immune to criticism because you get exactly what you pay for. Love it or hate it, "Jackass 3D" accomplishes just about everything it sets out to; in effect, Johnny Knoxville scores a goal on an empty net.I am the anomaly, but I'd wager next to no one is 'on the fence' about whether or not they should see this film. They either contributed to the massive $50 million opening weekend box office cume, or they immediately dismissed it. In my case, however, having never seen the "Jackass" films wasn't a conscious snub. Believe it or not, there just always seemed to be something better to watch.But mine's not a high horse. I sought out and watched "Jackass" and "Jackass: Number Two" the week prior to my first theater experience with the series, and I'm glad I did. After all, I grew up on "America's Funniest Home Videos" and throughout high school religiously followed the English hidden camera show "Trigger Happy TV." "Jackass" is not as clever as the latter, but by measure of unbridled chutzpah, Knoxville and Co. are the reigning kings.Like a Victorian freak show or museum of oddities, the often self-destructive experiments of the "Jackass" crew are the guilty pleasures of our generation. There's something almost gladiatorial about watching the elaborate dangers these brave idiots subject themselves to. Man vs. bull, man vs. mule, man vs. man?our fascination with competition, spectacle, and injury is nothing new."Jackass 3D" being my first chance to observe others' response to these shenanigans, I was most amazed by the two-pronged reaction the audience had to the physical trauma the performers sustained. A given stunt would be executed, typically resulting in its participant doubling over in pain. The crowd laughed, as they'd been cued to. The film would then play back the moment in slow motion and suddenly everyone would groan or sharply inhale. Though we paid to laugh at people injuring themselves, what's more interesting is our ability to empathize with the depiction of human pain. That the "Jackass" films achieve both is not an insignificant feat.This isn't the definitive "Jackass" experience, however. Having watched all three films in the span of a single week, I did discern a distinct arc that left me somewhat letdown with Knoxville's most recent effort. "Jackass: Number Two" improved upon the original with a more polished, professional look, and more elaborate and inventive stunts. It gave the genuine impression that the crew was pushing its boundaries and trumping itself wherever possible. That same sense of pioneering is largely missing from "Jackass 3D." The glasses- gimmick seems to supplant genuine innovation in their routine, and on the whole it feels slapdash in comparison to the conceptual genius of its prequel.But what survives in "Jackass 3D," and what ultimately endeared me to the franchise is its creativity. Where it won me over was not in the painful payoff of each trick, but rather in the setup. The use of the camera to disorient, spotlight, and surprise is what really makes the series sing, and the trilogy is full of epiphanic moments of hilarity. "Jackass" has and always will be a potpourri of comedic elements, not all of which directly appeal to my specific sensibilities, but the variety is essential and the whole is somehow more than the sum of its parts.I only wish "Jackass 3D" had more of the entrepreneurial spirit that so distinguished the second film. It may not be ambitious, but hey, a goal made on an empty net still counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1928, Charlie Chaplin wowed audiences by appearing on screen with a real, live lion for his celebrated film The Circus. A lion! Real! On screen! Audiences were mesmerized by this fascinating new art of cinema, an art made all the more engaging for the fact that the plastics of its image had roots in reality; that somewhere else in space and time, Chaplin had actually stood next to this lion and the reality of this image was now available to them for their own viewing pleasure.For a contemporary equivalent, I give you Steve-O launched through the stratosphere in a PortaPotty full of dog poop. In 3D.Jackass 3D appeals to cinema's time-honored capacity for ontological testament, and makes an equally compelling case for the camera's potency as an empathy machine: We see the setup of a stunt, we endure its execution, and we then either clutch our balls or puke in our mouths, depending on what the stunt entails. Cinema is reality, and their pain is ours.Jackass isn't simply effective in the art of its performers, however, as there is a genius to the framing and editing of each segment as well. Many of the film's laughs are built in to its premises, and the crew smartly eschews over-explanation. We see a tee ball, we see the path this ball is on track to take, and we see Steve-O's nuts--as an intelligent and discerning audience, it is left to us to piece together the narrative before it unfolds, resulting in our increased engagement and a far greater potential for humor upon realization. And we then hang in that moment of anticipation, until the situation's potential energy is quickly and cathartically rendered kinetic.Jackass 3D is notable as well for its use of stereoscopic 3D cinematography. In one scene, Johnny Knoxville fires a projectile toward the screen in slow motion to great effect: shallow depth of field slowly reveals this item to be a dildo, and 3D reveals the dildo to be humorously close to your face. Elsewhere, stereoscopy is employed in the service of some truly excellent model work; the scene's genuine beauty makes its ultimate subversion all the more effective.Needless to say, Jackass 3D will not appeal to everyone. But as the film so effectively marries the ontology of outrageous stupidity to so many facets of cinematic expression, it's definitely worth seeing if you think you can stomach it.

		<fullReview>First of all, if you don't know about Jackass, you need to be prepared for a movie with no point at all. Jackass is the third movie installment based on the popular MTV series with the same name that ran from 2000 to 2002. The cast includes Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn, Jason "Wee-Man" Acu?a, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Ehren McGhehey. Therefore, even though the show was only on TV for three seasons summing to 25 episodes, the antics did not end there. In 2002, Jackass: The Movie was released, followed by Jackass: Number Two in 2006 along with numerous TV shows created by different cast members including Viva La Bam, Dr. Steve-O, Wildboyz, and Homewrecker. Four years after their last meeting in their second film these crazy men are back together in the latest Jackass movie in 3D! The film follows these characters as they beat the living hell out of each other while performing a series of hilarious, disgusting, disturbing and dangerous pranks. This is the first film that has used 3D in a way that makes the film worth seeing in 3D. The implementation of 3D adds to the party and along with another dimension to the film. It allows all of the pranks to be bigger, better, funnier and more entertaining by immersing the audience into the world of Jackass. The opening and closing scenes of the film abuse the use of 3D especially well through slow motion effects and exceptional cinematography (yes I did just say that). The stunts in the film are at a whole new level that the TV series or the previous films have not been able to capture. The stunts are so crazy and ridiculous in the film that they will leave the entire audience wondering; How are they all still alive? While no sane human being would be attempting these stunts in the first place leading to the fact that all of the actors mentioned earlier and especially Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Wee-man and Steve-O are all one of a kind maniacs that prove that they are four of the craziest and most entertaining men in the world (or are they just stupid?).There is no plot at all to this film and contains a specific type of humor that isn't for everyone. There are a lot of sexually oriented pranks in some shape or form. The film targets a very small audience that includes males ages 18 to 35 and even in this demographic the movie isn't for everyone. The film is extremely disgusting to the point where multiple scenes are unwatchable to the extent of gagging. Nothing is off limits in the film and therefore there is no limit to how gross the film gets and no limit on how long the scenes last. The disgusting aspect of the film ranges from scenes with male nudity to other scenes with different forms of bodily waste. Jackass has always been this way and when it comes to male nudity there is significantly less nudity in this film than in Jackass: Number Two, which was more of a male nudity fest. Just be prepared for what you are getting yourself into before seeing this film.The Jackass TV series and Jackass 3D in general takes an acquired taste and the right mood to enjoy. I cannot recommend this film because you already know if you want to see it or not. Therefore, I recommend that if you want to see it on the big screen in 3D see it now, otherwise, don't see it if you think its going</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass 3D is the latest from the group and as the title suggests, it's in 3D. Stunning 3D if I dare say so. No matter how old I get I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching these brave men launch various objects at their genitalia and ignite a wide variety of explosives while standing far too close for comfort.I'm sure most of you have seen the trailer so I don't have to go into the stunts and pranks performed in the film, but what I will talk about is how amazing the film looks. 3D has been reserved for large scale action films and animated features. Here is essentially a documentary being shot in 3D, the first of its kind (though Werner Herzog's upcoming documentary Caves utilizes 3D technology as well).The compositions on screen are so bizarre yet so simple. They make the most immature acts a work of art. Rather than finding out the harmful effects of being stunned by a stun gun or cattle prod, they turn it into an event whereby several members of the group run through a hallways with various types of these devices hanging in the air.These daredevils or "trained professionals," as they disclaim in opening credits, have gone from punk rebels to cultural icons. Their outlandish pranks and inconceivable stunts are a testament to our society's consumption of the obscene and the absurd. We watch these hooligans abuse themselves for our enjoyment. We laugh at their pain. The only reason we laugh is because we aren't the ones feeling their pain.What really makes this film funny is the groups approach to their work. I can imagine how many takes of each segment introduction their must be. The men are either dying from laughter at what is about to unfold, or they can hardly keep their composure for fear that this next stunt will be their last. Regardless, we get a sense that what we are seeing on camera is what these people are really like. They laugh, scream, and gasp for air like we would, though perhaps with a little more courage.This carefree approach comes through in the production as well. The melding of the crew with the cast is like watching a dysfunctional family's home videos. The cameras capture the action both with the cast and behind the scenes with the crew. It's a fun, slightly off atmosphere. To help create this atmosphere, we are fortunate enough to listen to a great selection of songs, my favorite being Roger Miller's "You Can't Roller Skate in a Buffalo Herd," played over Johnny Knoxville being chased after by a herd of buffalo. Oh yeah, he's also wearing roller skates. How fitting.I don't think I need to tell you all this, but this film isn't for everyone. I can think of several scenes which some will find offensive, others will find revolting, and maybe a few of you will deem as unfit for human eyes. Still, those who are fans of the show or if you're looking for something new, look no further. This film is a raunchy, laugh riot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some big laughs, but parts of it are completely contrived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, you know what you're getting into when you walk into a Jackass movie. You're going to get nutshots, potty humor, vomiting and "interaction" with other bodily fluids. There is plenty of this in Jackass 3D. What you don't expect to get is forced laughter, fake set-ups and really, really BAD acting. I get why they laugh at the stunts. It's marketing. The harder they laugh, the harder you laugh. It's easier to laugh at something that someone is already laughing at. But the laughter is just too loud, too forced and goes on WAY too long for the "severity" of some of the stunts. The vignette with the *fake* -- and I MEAN FAKE -- gorilla in the idiot parents' hotel room was just beyond the pale. The "mom" has the worst fake reaction of anybody I've ever seen in Jackass. She is so unbelievable that she ruins the whole "gag." And then, supposedly, the "father" had the sh!t scared out of him -- literally. Give me a break. You will find yourself laughing at the stupidity of their reactions. You might also feel a little insulted that they think you're so stupid. It's also obvious that some of the people in the "street" gags are acting. They're just not good enough to pull it off. People know what natural reactions look like, and this just ain't it, people. There's also a scene where Johnny Knoxville (or Steve-O, I can't tell which) drives a scooter through a plate glass window. Just coincidentally, there is gas in the scooter INSIDE the dealership (never happens; big no-no), the path to the window was completely clear even though every single inch of the other windows in the dealership were cluttered with product, AND he goes through the 10-foot plate-glass window without being cut to shreds. Not even a scratch. C'mon, people.Don't get me wrong; there are some big laughs in this movie. Big hits, big injuries and BIG falls. But I left the movie with a bad taste in my mouth. Thank GOD my movie wasn't in 3D or that taste could have been something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the last Jackass movie, because there was an intelligence at work there, beyond just a desire to be shocking and gross (though "shocking" and "gross" is being too mild). And this was just a lot more of the same.The film is not for the squeamish, especially due to the delight taken in excrement. Excrement here is treated like confetti on New Years Eve. I don't want to get into details, because much of my enjoyment of this film is due to the shock factor. There were a few scenes that I was just too scared to watch.I won't get into trying to describe or give a list of what's shown here. Let me just say that if Thomas Edison had ever thought his invention would show something like THIS, he'd have destroyed his camera and killed himself. But for about 80% of this film, I was howling with laughter, though terribly embarrassed I was carrying on like that.The only thing I can say specific to a scene in this movie is that the Midget Bar Fight has got to be, no doubt about it, the most hilarious "Candid" scene I've ever watched.I had major qualms about going to see a film so crude, gross, violent, and obviously marketed to an audience about 40 years younger. I saw it. I loved it. I'm so embarrassed. And I saw it in 2-D. Which was at least one D more than I needed. The idea of watching some of these scenes in 3-D . . .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know a lot of people think this stuff is too lowbrow, or too gross. But it's really compelling. You have to watch -- it really sucks you in. And when it's over, you leave the theater thinking, "That was the greatest thing I've ever seen." This is maybe the most cinematic movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. I know they used to be on TV, but this is stuff that really wouldn't work in another medium.So while on one hand they seem like a bunch of dopey guys punching each other in the nuts, on the other hand, they're out there displaying a really solid understanding of the medium. It's sort of like, there's Tarantino, and Johnny Knoxville, and everyone else has to get in line behind them. Maybe other people tell stories that are more important. But these guys really understand how film and brains mix it up.I would also say that they're probably the only famous performers in Hollywood who don't get paid enough. I don't know how much they get, and I'm sure it's a lot. But it can't possibly be enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun film of 2010.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, if you are not a Jackass fan, then this film is not for you. It is full of crude and disgusting stunts, profanity, and shots of male genitalia. If that's not for you, then you won't like it. I, for one, happen to be a Jackass fan. Over the years of watching these guys beat themselves up for money, it almost feels like they became my friends. So, Jackass 3D was like a reunion. Hanging out with old friends in 3D. (The 3D definitely sold the film.) It starts off with a bang and doesn't let up until the very end. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, and I didn't want it to end. A worthy installment in the Jackass series, and the most fun at a film this year. Sheer stupid fun. So, if you like watching nut-shots and "poo cocktail supreme's," then definitely check out Jackass 3D in theaters. See it with friends. And see it in 3D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If "Poo Cocktail Supreme" and "Sweatsuit Cocktail" piques your interest, then run- don't walk- to see the most revolting entertainment on the big screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Jackass" isn't a movie that you can review by conventional standards. Heck, it even isn't a movie in the strictest sense of the word; rather, it's a feature-length version of the stunt and prank show that debuted originally on MTV and has since found its way onto the big screen. Three times I might add, with director Jeff Tremaine and the rest of the Jackass cast proclaiming with each movie that it would be their last. Tough luck they will have retiring- if you haven't already heard, the movie smashed the fall opening weekend record when it debuted in the United States. Clearly their steadily growing fanbase keeps clamouring for more. If you, like this reviewer, haven't actually watched any of the Jackass-es at work (or play, really) before this movie, then it's better you take this example as a litmus test of just how much you'd enjoy "Jackass 3D". In one of the stunts proudly named the "Poo Cocktail Supreme", Jackass regular Steve-O is strapped in a sitting position inside one of those mobile toilets filled with excrement. The Porta-Potty is in fact bungee-corded between two cranes and on the mark, is set flying upwards where it subsequently bounces up and down. I'd rather not describe what happens inside the cubicle- suffice to say that it is as hideous as you would imagine, perhaps even much more so. How much you are willing to stomach such scatological humour and revolting gags really determines how much you are going to enjoy this. There isn't a plot, there isn't a purpose, there isn't any continuity. Basically, this is no more (and no less) than a countless string of stunts, pranks and skits featuring leader Johnny Knoxville (who introduces himself at the beginning of each segment) and his band of merry idiots. You're better off looking for some maturity amongst a herd of cows than amongst this group of overgrown mischievous buffoons. Not to say that there's nothing to admire about their buffoonery. One can't help but be impressed by their willingness to sacrifice for their art, even if the art is clearly made for the lowest denominator. Who would readily put themselves in front of an oncoming ram or a few buffalo? Who would readily place his genitalia in harm's way by tying it to a flying toy helicopter (the stunt is called Helicockter, I kid you not)? And who would dare drink another's sweat collected in a cup while exercising on the treadmill wearing plastic wrap? You're not likely to find people as ready or game as Knoxville, Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Chris Pontius, Danger Ehren and Dave England. You're also not likely to find the same kind of camaraderie elsewhere. Whenever one of their stunts goes awry, or one of them bends over in agony, the rest standing around will almost immediately huddle around him, offering words of encouragement the way frat-boys would. None of them would be here without the other- indeed, there wouldn't be a Jackass without the fun and derring-do of each one of them- and it's heartening to see the Jackass team displaying a keen sense of friendship and solidarity. As with any circus act, not all the parts are equally interesting- e.g. the one where Margera's parents get ambushed by a guy dressed up in a gorilla suit when they check into a hotel room, or the rather repetitive Evil Knievel-type stunts on jet skis and mini bikes. But there is really more than enough to keep appreciative audiences thoroughly entertained, e.g. the Lamborghini Tooth Pull, the Beehive Tetherball and the Tee Ball, each one of which are self-explanatory by their titles. And what of the extra dimension? Well let's just say that in the same way that "Avatar" was made for 3D, the same way that dance movies were made for 3D, and the same way that horror movies were made for 3D, "Jackass" is one type of entertainment that was made for 3D. Indeed, when a prosthetic sex toy flies in slo-mo through several different iconic landmarks and finally shatters a glass of milk, the joy of seeing it in the additional dimension is enough to convince you that "Jackass" was meant for 3D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A giant 3D penis flying at your face, a man lying under a model train track defecating in volcanic fashion and a midget fight in a bar it can only mean one thing, Jackass is back.Johnny Knoxville and his merry pranksters returned to the big screen this week, its been 10 years since they made there first appearance on MTV and what a roller-coaster ride its been, ten years and three films later the franchise looks like its going out with a bang.The ageing stars of the film still manage to put themselves through immeasurable torture for our amusement and still 10 years on manage to create new and original ways of making each other wince in agony.The duck shooting and the Santa up the Christmas tree were perfect examples that the crew are not running out of ideas.One thing Jackass has always managed to succeed at is offending and it does a damn good job in this instalment as well, with an old man groping his granddaughter in the middle of the street being a prime example, even my friends, 18 year old lads were questioning the morality behind it.An element which is brilliant about this film however is the fact that if you don't like a gag, you only wait for a few minutes for the next one.Obviously the movie is not going to be everybody's taste, with no doubt health and safety Nazis among other's crying in protest over its unsafe and distasteful nature, but let them carry on, because no-ones going to take away the fun from this flick.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disgusting. Appalling. Very funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen Jackass before, let me enlighten you. Take a group of men of enduringly puerile persuasion, all of whom are old enough to know better, and set them to inflict mayhem on themselves and each other in a series of what Jackass itself refers to as "stunts" but which are a mixture of pranks, practical jokes, assaults, and elaborate mechanisms for causing pain and possible - probably, even - injury. Factor in a preoccupation with bodily functions and genitalia and voila - Jackass. Oh, and a key element is that after each episode of revolting, dangerous, disgusting mayhem which leaves one of the group damaged, in pain, humiliated (or all three) the rest of the group collapse in helpless laughter.You know those party favours which squeak and extend when you blow into them? The 3D in Jackass 3D is used in order to have one of those extending to the camera lens. By virtue of someone expelling flatulence into the other end. And this is one of the more sophisticated episodes. Most are hardly repeatable in a public forum, and those that are repeatable involve things like mistreating midgets.There is no story. No plot. No scripted dialogue (what dialogue there is is coarse). No subtlety. If you are easily disgusted you're going to hate it. If you're not easily disgusted you are still going to wince and want to look away quite often.But, dear me, at its best it is very funny indeed. I laughed a lot, and felt ashamed every time I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewing a film like Jackass 3D is harder than it looks even though this is the third installment in the film franchise, which came after a TV series that lasted for three seasons. Nearly everyone can recognize the franchise by name yet the people involved aren't actually actors (everyone is listed "as himself" in the credits) and a coherent story is nonexistent. With Jackass, you know what you're getting up front; a bunch of guys doing nothing but the most stupid and idiotic things for an hour and a half that usually involve their own genitalia or feces or both. You either think it's hilarious or downright hate it and judging by the packed theater a few nights ago, there's still a craving for Jackass.Jackass 3D utilizes the 3D effect very well. That credit can go to the film actually being shot in the format rather than it being shot conventionally and converted to 3D later on. The opening and closing of the film are the best 3D examples; all of the explosions, paintballs, dildos, and God-knows-what flying at your face. As inane as it was, it was still nice to see the effect put to good use rather than just tacked on to make an extra $3 a ticket.The more ridiculous and senseless stunts in Jackass have always drawn more interest on my end in comparison to the more crude bits involving bodily fluids. While Jackass 3D does have the honor of not only being the only film but the only film presented in 3D that features a bungee outhouse and a man drinking the sweat of another man, it's things like Electric Avenue (which features stun guns attached to strings and a spinning cattle prod), Bam's version of the Rocky films, and the Wee Man segment in the bar that features other midgets that are the real high points of the film.Jackass 3D is exactly what you're expecting, but there's something about it that's intriguing. Once you start watching, you can't look away. You have to see how far this imbecility will go. Never has the phrase, "like watching a train wreck in slow motion," fit so well. While the film is certainly far from brilliant, there's a bit more creativity to it than what most give it credit for. Creative, shocking, and filled with more puke than you can shake a stick at, Jackass 3D is able to utilize 3D in ways that haven't been seen before while providing a few laughs and grossing you out all at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, the fact you're even considering to watch this movie is because you want to see one thing. A bunch of dudes basically hurting each other in creative ways! And Jackass 3D comes back to hit the ball out of the park for a third time.It's everything you'd expect, stupid, rude, disgusting and just plain dangerous, and it does it FLAWLESSLY! This is the brilliance that is Jackass. It's a film you're not sure about before you put it on. You'll know whether you'll like this or not which is why if you ask someone what they think of Jackass they'll either give you a 0 or a 10!The film keeps the stunts fresh too! Full of new material all hilarious pranks so don't worry if you're thinking you'll find "Jackass...again....oh yeah we got 3D too". Speaking of which, the 3D isn't great or even necessary to watch but it's much better than most of the films with 3D so it does it's job.Overall, this film is brilliantly vile. It should be sent to hell, just save me a seat down there and I'll bring the popcorn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass is childish . Jackass is stupid . Jackass is sick . Jackass is right up my street!In this latest instalment Johnny Knoxville and the boys go all three dimensional on our arse and although i only saw this in glorious 2 D it still looked amazing.The contents are much the same as what we're used to. This time we are exposed to stunts such as " Super Mighty Glue" where Wee Man &amp; Preston are super glued together. . "The High Five" , where a giant hand springs out and hits people unexpectedly and " The helicockter" well , Use your imagination on that one!. My only disappointment is that i didn't get to see this in 3D as i think it might have looked great.I'm not sure how much longer these guys can keep doing these stunts because sooner rather than later someone is going to get seriously hurt or failing that they will get too old but while they can i will still enjoy watching them.</fullReview>

The poop, as others said was kind of a bit much in certain parts though.The 3D wasn't a gimmick, it actually showed depth like another user said and gave life to the movie, especially the ending. I like how we also got to know each of the people int he movie and it was actually kind of heartfelt.By far the most funniest thing was the billy goat or whatever, movie was non stop funny and would definitely see it again or even buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and the gang return for a 3D installment. I personally didn't see it in 3D. I'm sure the flying dildo looks great coming directly at the audience. The best prank is the first one, High Five. It's fun. I love the surprise to its victims. It's a great way to start. The part with the jet plane exhaust seems fun. It's something I want to do. Then there comes the most disturbing model train set. I'm sure Jackass fans would find it hilarious. I found it revolting. I could almost smell it. It's stomach turning. It follows it up with a rather silly dwarf fight. It's not until Electric Avenue before I recovered and that's mostly for the song. This is a lot of the same stuff from the gang. If you're a fan, you'll like what you get.</fullReview>

I'm not a huge fan of the Jackass gross out comedy, I generally alternate between laughing, saying "no way" and wanting to puke (which I guess is the general idea). I have watched all the movies though and did find the first couple really funny, Jackass 3D has its moments, but it lacks the ingenuity and hilarity of the previous films.With this one we watched the jet scene several times, OMG funny, but I almost vomited with the "sweat suit" stunt (I can still barely think about it). The shi!!ing train eruption and duck hunting was pretty funny too.Sad to see Ryan Dunn in his last movie. Remember him with that matchbox car up his ass in movie #1. 07.11</fullReview>

		<fullReview>90 more minutes of 9 likable and entertaining guys performing dangerous and utterly hysterical stunts and pranks. That's what we were promised. That's exactly what we get. Adding 3D to the franchise, this carries on the formula from Number 2 (Still haven't seen the first) with great enthusiasm. The jokes, screams, laughs, groans, gross out humour and jaw dropping stunts just keep coming. Like the 2nd this is a strong piece of documentary filmmaking. Cinematically, some of the shots are pretty good and it's edited very well. The actors are all just being themselves which makes the unique and more interesting, and they are all very funny. The film also seems to be a nostalgic tribute to when the show first started, so there's absolutely heaps of stuff for long term fans to enjoy. In general, Jackass 3D is the equivalent to being hit in the face by a heavy ball launched from a catapult.Despite the high fun factor, Jackass 3D can feel like a step backwards. The stunts feel less bold than they were in the second one and it's not quite as funny. I watched both on the same day and while the stunts are bigger, they're not quite as funny. The novelty does wear off eventually, but most of the time this takes the comedy genre to surreal, delirious and disgusting new levels. J3D is one of the most insane films ever made just like its predecessor but in the best possible way. It is once again adults only acquired taste viewing and will disgust many. If you haven't seen any Jackass before and you decide to watch this- brace yourself. I enjoyed this movie overall even if it felt like the Jackass team are beginning to slightly run out of decent stunts. They've still got plenty of style and plenty of gross out fun up their sleeves. Jackass 4 anyone? 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass 3(D) was humorous, disturbing, and urged you to vomit. Oh, and there was also a lot of d**k. Ladies, if you feel that you have seen a plethora of "the girls" in films and want to see some more manly parts, go see J*ck*ss 3. The decision of whether it impresses or not, I will leave up to you.Most films in theatres have some sort of plot accompanied by rising action, crisis, falling action, etc. J*ck*ss 3(D) is essentially a bunch of clips pasted together, lacking a story. Depending on what you look for in a film and what you expect out of this movie, your opinion will vary. Although, I must say, it was nice to get out and see something that was straight humour ? it made me leave in an upbeat mood with nothing to think about but which stunt was my favourite.What I regret is seeing the film in 3D. You would think it would make a difference in a prank movie, but really, there wasn't anything that did. The three bucks I spent (again) on those 3D glasses (because some f***ing assholes will not let you reuse your old ones, prompting you to buy them every time) would have been better spent on a day pass for parking (whilst being the owner of a parking pass).Since it's almost impossible to review this movie without revealing some of what happens, be aware that what follows is considered as spoiler alert, so don't read it if you don't wanna hear about it before you see it. But even if you do, I won't reveal that much. SPOILER ALERTSo really, what would a J*ck*ss movie be without a real j*ck*ss? With the classic game of pin the tail on the donkey morphed into a Jackass stunt, Chris Pontius endures the pain of a donkeys hooves whilst practically naked. Ouch.Another ouch in the movie involved waxing. Midget (as referred to in the movie), chubby guy, superglue. That's all I have to say.Speaking of midgets, have you ever seen a whole army of them? No worries, J*ck*ss 3(D) has got it covered. I desperately want to tell you what kind of "army" this is, but you just have to see it for yourself. Though pretty much everything in this movie is painful either psychologically or physically, it's nice to recall that you aren't the one experiencing the discomfort, or at least not the pain. This brings me back to a point in the movie where Steve-o was buckled into a porta-potty and plunged hundreds of feet into the air. Oh, did I mention the porta-potty was full of dog sh*t? Mmm, tasty.With plenty of animal feces and animals themselves, this is one nasty and attention- catching J*ck*ss movie. If you've viewed previous J*ck*ss movies and did not enjoy them, you will probably not enjoy this one. If you have never seen a Jackass movie, I encourage you to try this one out. But if you've enjoyed Jackass movies so far, you will definitely love J*ck*ss 3(D).</fullReview>

I wasn't a huge fan of the first two, so I was quite surprised by how funny this was. It still has its misses, but many more laughs than the first two. A lot of them are there for the sake of shock value, but many of them manage to be quite funny. The pit of snakes and the beehive teatherball are just two of many funny scenes. Actors such as Sean William Scott show up as well. I can't really tell you if the 3D augmented anything because I saw this on DVD a couple years ago, but I can tell you that it does have a surprising amount of laughsFinal Thoughts: Best in the series by far, but that doesn't mean I want any more sequels coming out.

Knoxville and crew perform so many hardcore stunts that you will be left with your mouth agape at many occasions. The sequences are ingenuous and vomit inducing and those with a weak heart and stomach should stay away from this. All the others are welcome to see this and be amazed and repelled at the same time. Had a great time. 4 out of 5. Delivers more, much more then what its premise promised. no wonder it went on to earn 117 million dollars which is kind of amazing considering there is not a single star or story.

		<fullReview>Jacka 3 (2010)*** (out of 4) Needless to say this movie isn't going to be for everyone but if you enjoy watching people torture themselves while you sit comfortably on your couch then this is a must see. With Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O and the gang are back in this latest installment and after watching it you really have to wonder how low they will go if they want another one released. This one here reaches pretty high on the foul and vile department especially a sequence towards the end with Steve-O flying and coming down with something that I won't spoil. If you've already seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about and I really don't see how they're going to top something like this. There are some even crazier moments including one skit where grandpa is making out with his granddaughter, which is priceless and especially the reaction of the man witnessing it. One of the most memorable sequences has the guys using super glue to rip off each other's body hair. I'm really curious to what these guys get paid to do this. Either way, obviously this film isn't going to be for everyone but if you can put up with the abuse these guys go through then you're going to be in for a good time. I would argue that the first two films were a tad bit better as there are a few gags here that don't work all that well but for the most part the film still delivers enough to make it worth viewing for fans of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You already know the jist of this: crazy aging skaters take turns participating in some of the dumbest stunts imaginable, on a constant quest to one-up each other. The squad is beyond trying to convert any non-fans, if they were ever interested in that to begin with, and at this point are just indulging themselves while there's still a shimmer of spotlight left to enjoy. It's definitely their most expensive endeavor to date, which opens the door to some outrageous stuff, but by its grand finale the joke has worn pretty thin. I had a constant smile on my face from start to finish, though a few recycled gags from previous episodes made the belly-busters less frequent than before. Since I don't own a 3D TV, I can't comment on that aspect of it - the few instances where the technology is put to use are pretty obvious, though, and while they'd be a cute addition in one or two scenarios I'm not exactly mourning their absence. There's nothing new here, for better or for worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lack of ideas but still funny in places - 67%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case you're wondering whether 3D movies are here to stay, you might want to consider this which is arguably the most useless use for the technology we've seen so far (and I'm including "The Last Airbender" in that thought). The chances are that by the end of the decade, 3D will be dead and buried until the next time the fad comes around. For me, it's little more than a gimmick that they charge you more for and honestly, I can't imagine it improving the majority of movies anyway. Take this film - how much gnarlier would it really feel if you felt like you were being covering in various disgusting liquids in the same way these guys are? In case you're wondering what the hell all this is about, allow me to introduce you to the Jackass crew (Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Wee Man, a newly sober Steve O, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Chris Pontius, Preston Lacy and the late Ryan Dunn) who like nothing more than indulging in a wide variety of crude, sick and disgusting stunts. But this time, they are letting 3D cameras record the results which usually involve someone puking, getting covered in faeces or urinated on. If you're a fan then this will be right up your street but if not, this won't do anything to convert you.The trouble with "Jackass 3D" is that it doesn't really offer anything different to the others, besides the 3D effects. The other issue is that it's extremely inconsistent - sometimes, it's frankly hilarious such as Ehren trying to pin a tail on a real donkey (blindfolded) but others, such as the Pee Cam sequences, don't really work. And this issue seems to plague this entry in the series more than others because some of the skits feel very familiar. The Old Man make-up gets yet another outing and pranking Bam's parents also makes another appearance. It gives the film a sense that they were running out of ideas and just decided to revisit old material but in 3D. It feels lazy and half-hearted, as most jokes do the more you hear them.I was actually looking forward to this, even though I wasn't going to bother with the 3D side of things (as I never do). While it wasn't a disappointment, it did exactly what I thought it would do - churn my stomach occasionally, make me laugh occasionally and make me a little grossed out occasionally. It's childish, stupid and everything a fan of "Jackass" could ask for - assuming you still have the appetite for this sort of nonsense. Personally, I'd have liked a few new ideas from the boys and less reliance on old gimmicks such as Pontius's penis and Preston's wobbly bits. It feels time to close this particular chapter of light entertainment, especially after Dunn's tragic demise but part of me wished it would have been far funnier which would have been a more fitting epitaph.</fullReview>

Since their main target is men, they could avoid showing their nude bodies all the time. Beyond having to see all that disgusting scenes, we have also to see their genitals the whole time.

		<fullReview>I fancy myself as being more of a 'high-brow' audience member. However, I have seen some of the Jackass humor in the past and I know what it involves. I don't see it for educational purposes. Like the three stooges, you don't watch them to learn the history of the world. So when I went to the movie, I expected nothing intelligent. And I was correct in my predetermination. But with that aside, I don't know if it's me?I'm not homophobic?but are these guys a little 'gay' or are they at the point of what can we do to raise the shock value? J/K. It just seems odd that they do a lot of their stints in g-strings. I can see that one guy who always runs around shocking people and dancing in front of them in his g-string?very very funny. But how can they do all those stints in a g-string? Personally, I'd be covered like the Michelin Man from head to toe in protective gear. However, these guys are out there with little and sometimes no clothing at all. They still got balls...somehow! Now I know this is probably incorrect on some PC level, but I couldn't control my laughter when they did the little person moment at the bar. If it was regular size people, it wouldn't have been as funny. What made it funny wasn't the actual actors but the people in the bar. It was just so slapstick keystone cops by the end, and the people in the bar were just so confused by the event, it just really made me laugh. I guess that was the point of Knoxville and his crew, the shock value once again. It worked. Overall, the movie is just a bunch of idiots doing really stupid dangerous things in which, at times, they have absolutely no regard for their own safety?Goal accomplished. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Collection of WTF from the JACKASS Team</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes I wonder if the JACKASS crew will stop before one of them dies. On their third film, the team bring their usual antics (insane stunts and stomach-churning pranks) to a whole new dimension: 3D. I'm sad to say I wasn't able to catch the film in theaters for the 3D experience, but many of the reviews I'd read claimed the JACKASS antics were perfect for the rising medium. Still, even watching the film on DVD, there were plenty of laughs and the gross-out moments still had me retching at points. I know it's nothing but 90 minutes of juvenile humor but I never get sick of this series. It has never failed to make me laugh; these films are the equivalent of daring your drunken friend at a party, except these guys have the budget to make their stunts more extreme (such as utilizing cranes to bring to life the "poo cocktail supreme"...an update on one of Johnny Knoxville's earlier stunts in which a garbage truck flipped Knoxville upside down in a fully load porta-toilet). As I'm sure I stated in my comment for JACKASS NUMBER TWO, these films are targeted at a specific audience and those who aren't into bathroom humor and watching people hurt themselves for our amusement probably shouldn't bother reading any further about this movie.These guys have been doing this for over a decade and I'm glad to say their age hasn't slowed them down. Johnny Knoxville's still willing to jump into the middle of a buffalo herd on roller skates or ramp out of a wading pool on a jet ski. And it certainly hasn't stopped Chris Pontius from being as nude as possible as often as possible. Seriously, I have to question why more and more of the JACKASS stunts/gags involve full nudity. I'm sure this movie squeaked by with it's R rating with as much full frontal as we're exposed to here. Aside from the abundance of male nudity, there is something else that stood out as I watched the film: you can tell Steve-O's gotten sober. I'm not complaining; I'm glad the man's been to rehab and gotten himself on track. It'd have been a sad day if Steve-O had been reported dead of a drug overdose. I could just tell that his common sense had kicked in by this movie and he was not excited to follow through on some of his stunts. There's a scene where Ryan Dunn bats a tee-ball into Steve-O's crotch and, in the introduction, Steve-O laughingly whines "Why do I always have to be Steve-O?" and flinches in preparation for the hit. In the old days, Steve-O would probably bear his manhood proudly at the inevitable beating for the sake of making others laugh. Again, not a complaint, merely an observation that Steve-O's coming to his senses a bit (though it didn't stop him from agreeing to the "poo cocktail supreme" despite his claustrophobia and fear of roller coasters).As much as I'd love to see this series continue on forever, I can see it's got to be reaching it's end. The team's getting old and I can't imagine they'll keep this up forever. Johnny Knoxville is now in his 40s; pretty soon he won't need extensive make-up for his "really bad grandpa" routines. As he gets older, how many more ceiling fans can Steve-O launch himself into? These guys have had a great run and I think JACKASS 3D was the perfect closure point for them. I wonder if the crew felt the same, as the end credits have a nostalgic feel when photos from the team's youth remind us how far they've come from a couple of idiots running into each other with shopping carts. It was a bittersweet send-off concluding a fun (and often sickening) movie. JACKASS fans will surely enjoy it, but I think it's time to retire the franchise and give the team a chance of survival.</fullReview>

This is the only experience I've had to see a whole movie, much less actual TV episode of the Jackass franchise. But I can tell of my first encounter in Johnny Knoxville's world that this is just another day out of the office.Jackass 3D's only attribute, as far as I can tell through poo, is that it was filmed in just that: 3D. Now, I didn't see it in the third dimension, but I doubt that really added to the already infamous group of below-the-belt (literally) nitwits.Admittedly, I laughed at some scenes. Such as the plane's exhausted power (ALL BUT the already tired skit of "Is it real or is it Memorex" part ? I mean, really, that's like doing a spoof of Brokeback Mountain?try to keep it up to date, guys) or the midgets in the bar or Johnny doing the dance when the buffalo roamed. And the soundtrack was good ? seriously, it introduced me to a (now) 40-year-old song: "Brand New Key" by Melanie, that I really liked.That all said?and believe me when I say, I'm a newcomer to all this, despite seeing various skits from time to time?most of the stunts looked sooo staged. Some people were puking before any action or SMELL happened. Or laughing hard before the target was humiliated.I understand that it was a difficult task of filming these stunts (you should NEVER EVER EVER try ANYWHERE) for 3D, but aren't we supposed to have the slightest belief these are truer than the established fake reality shows on TV? Okay. Fine. Leave your brain at the door and be prepared to look away from the screen from time to time, such as if you're offended by male nudity ? uh, that's one of the only reasons I watched this, hardy har har ? or people needlessly having their teeth pulled or their excess (body fatted) sweet drunk.Even though it's mindless fun at points, if you're not into (very soon to be or by-now) middle-aged men doing stupid stuff for a buck, there's absolutely no reason (ZERO, actually) to see this, other than witnessing Seann William Scott before he checked into rehab. Otherwise, have a good time at watching America once again humiliate itself, much like Jersey Shore did on a weekly basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same random nonsense you know and love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main argument against Jackass is that it's stupid, juvenile and lowbrow. I love it because it's stupid, juvenile and lowbrow. Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Wee Man, Steve-O, Preston, and the rest of the gang are back, channeling their inner Wiley Coyote on more of the same random nonsense you know and love. But the question begs to differ: On the third installment, how are these guys still alive? Of course it's not for everybody. And that fact needs to be stated. Sure, Johnny Knoxville is a hilarious master of ceremonies for the crew, and Bam returns still playing elaborate pranks on his unsuspecting parents April and Phil - but this time around Phil actually gets in on the action, evidenced in the "Super Mighty Glue" bit. The rest of the crew goes for stunts ranging from the hilarious (Preston and Wee Man playing a visual gag on an unsuspecting dog watcher) to the insane (Bam barreling through a hallway of live stun guns) to the gross-out (the appearance of Knoxville's old man alter ego Irving Zissman) to the really gross-out (Dave England's infamous poo volcano). Sure, the guys are starting to show their age (and Preston and Wee Man, their waistlines) but that doesn't mean the insanity doesn't stop. Just don't take anything they do or say seriously in the movie and you'll enjoy it. Like the last two, there's no plot whatsoever. Like the last two, they constantly one-up the random insanity. It's a turn your brain off for 90 minutes and enjoy it flick. If you start asking questions like "how are these guys still alive?", you're watching the wrong movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Complete and Utter Dumb Fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the great Mike Patton once sang: "It's always funny until someone gets hurt, and then it's just hilarious!" These appear to be words to live by for the "Jackass" crew, who are back for a third round of shenanigans in "Jackass 3D." The guys that hurt themselves for laughs so you don't have to are back in full form and if you think age has tempered their appetite for danger and potty-humor, then you are sorely mistaken.Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Wee Man, Preston Lacy, Chris Pontius, Dave England, Ehren McGhehey -- all the names and faces you've come to know over the years -- make their return (with a few stragglers left behind, naturally) to the feature-length film format to abuse 3D technology in ways that would infuriate James Cameron. Flying feces? Check. Unnecessarily exposed male genitalia? Check. The ever-reliable vomiting of a now-sober Steve-O? You bet. If you thought the envelope had been pushed as far as it would go before, think again. This "Jackass" is a full three dimensions of dumb and disgusting.Tastelessness aside, there's something both cinematic and slightly sentimental about this installment. Maybe it's all the slow-motion shots and Rocky references, but for the first time it appears as if director Jeff Tremaine is taking his craft a bit more seriously. The over-the-top opening and closing of the movie are nothing short of epic (at least by MTV standards) and if anything, it's the finest looking "Jackass" to date. Likewise, the cast seems to be stepping it up a notch; not only are they going to the extreme here, but they seem to be enjoying it more than ever. The film just so happens to mark the tenth-year anniversary of the franchise, so it's no coincidence that the sense of camaraderie is tighter than before. For the first time, it appears as though the guys are having as much fun laughing at themselves as we are.There are plenty of memorable stunts -- from an updated porto-potty gag dubbed "The Poo-Cocktail Supreme" to a stinker of a man-made volcano and a scene involving bees that rivals the hilariousness of Nic Cage in the infamous The Wicker Man remake -- and just as many laughs to go around. Cameos from the likes of Sean William Scott, Weezer, Rip Taylor, and Beavis and Butt-Head are along for the ride, but the true stars remain the main crew and their non-stop disregard for their own well-being. Dumb and reckless, yet unrelentingly amusing, this third installment in the unlikely franchise is guaranteed to have you giggling mindlessly while simultaneously squirming in your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've seen the other Jackass movies prior to this then you know what your getting into, if you haven't seen them the crude and raunchy humor may be to much for you. The 3rd installment - and hopefully not the last- tries something new and adds 3D into the mix, which makes for an in your face, over the top comedy with the occasional scene where you cant help but cringe at the fact the these our real people in real stunts. This movie may not appeal to all ages or demographics, but the fans of the previous movies and the TV show then you'll love this, from the slow motion opening montage, to the ridiculous final stunt, your sure to be on the floor laughing from yet another classic Jackass film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly entertaining, but often gross and disgusting. I am amazed at some of the concepts they come up with. Lots of genitalia, poop, and other humiliating ideas abound. They certainly seem to gross each other out to the point of throwing up a lot. I guess there are millions to be made hurting each other and looking like idiots. I would not pay to go to the movie theater or even rent this movie, however since I had nothing better to do I watched someone else's copy. I am sure someone will try one of their stunts or try to make up some of their own and end up killing themselves or seriously hurting someone even though there are disclaimers at the beginning and end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackass 3DThe best thing about performing stunts with your buddies is that if you're seriously injured, you can count on them to get your footage to YouTube immediately.Unfortunately for the extreme exhibitionists injured in this comedy, their antics were shot in 3D, so their footage needs to be sent to a lab.Besides a preamble provided by Beavis and Butt-head, Jackass 3D opens in the same over- the-top fashion as its predecessors.From there the Jackass cast (Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Preston Lacy and Wee Man) adhere to their usual agenda of self-abusive stunts, including a game of beehive tetherball and porta-potty bungee.Based on the groundbreaking MTV series, Jackass 3D pulls out all of the stops; unfortunately, the penis pranks and sleazy sketches detract from the boys more ingenious gambles.As for other three dimensional jackasses, you can usually find them walking around or driving cars everywhere.

		<fullReview>Unfortunately I didn't see the movie in 3D. I'm sure I didn't lose much. Some tricks were still specially made for 3D though. But it's OK. I still laughed my socks off. It was extremely pleasing to see the crew back in action. Although I must admit, they have gone older. Fortunately not much wiser which means they still make you laugh so hard that you are going to pee into your pants. They are still disgusting, they get hurt, yet they enjoy all this merry-go-round. And why not? They are not just a group of people who came together to make some pranks and stunts, they are friends who like each others company and revel collective time.Everybody has some kind of specialty. Johnny Knoxville likes bulls. Bam hates snakes. Dunn gets hurt. Dave England shits. Preston is stupid. Chris Pontius likes to play with his dick. Wee Man does pranks. Steve-O pukes and is just insane. What a fruit they are together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest I was afraid to see this movie. I'm a huge Jackass-Fan. I own every Season, Movie, Spin-Off and Outtake that was ever released on DVD or the internet. Never the less I have to admit that I didn't think they still had it. I also thought that, because of the 3D-Feature, I would just be treated with 1 1/2 hours of skate trick bullshit with the idiots flying towards my face But boy, was I wrong. Jackass 3D is just what a Jackassfan expects. And perhaps even more. In my mind it tops the first one that in my mind is below the Second one because they did a lot better in the second. So at this Point I would say from the best to the "better" it would be "Number 2", "3D" and then the Original Movie.But than again many of the stunts are recognizable if you saw the other stuff of Jackass. So many (by far not all) of the stunts copy a kind of stunt out of the second movie and just make it better (or worse ;) ) and of course in 3D. The 3D itself was not used throughout the whole film but only in specific scenes where it made sense. But than again in these scenes it's just awesome and at times even very art likeOver all: No, it's not a movie for everyone. No, this will never be a Must-Have-DVD in every Collection. But hell yeah it is awesome for everybody who even remotely thinks it's funny. And by the way, I watched it as a 4-Hour Triple-Feature so maybe my only negative argument won't be that significant to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Jackass films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the MTV show, and of the first two films, I have to say that I had a damn good time watching Jackass 3-D last week (I didn't get ID'd :D), and I have to say it was a very funny movie. For those who are not aware of what Jackass is, it's pretty much a comedy that tries to make you laugh using shock value. It's separated mostly in 3 parts: dangerous stunts, crude stunts and hidden camera pranks usually involving random strangers. For those who weren't sure how much the 3-D is used in this film, I'll give you a small hint: it's used a lot. The Jackass movies are known for their incredible opening and closing sequences, and I can assure you that the 3-D is abused of in all the ways possible in the opening and closing sequences. For the fans, you might want to stay around during the credits, for you will have a special treat.As for my personal opinion, it's hard to say really anything constructive about this film, because it's hardly a movie. It's a bunch of skits thrown in together in a 95 minute long movie. Just like the first two movies, this comes out as a longer version of the TV show, only with nudity and swearing. Just like Korey said on Spill.com, you can't walk into Jackass 3-D expecting nothing less than excellence, and that's what I did, and I enjoyed it. I have to say some stunts did gross me out, and I have a pretty solid stomach, such as for example ''The Sweat Cocktail'', ''The Apple of my Ass'', and one which involves Steve-O being launched in the air in a portable potty filled with crap. But then again, I can't say I didn't laugh myself silly during this film: All movie long, people in the theatre (and I was pleasantly surprised to see a full auditorium) were laughing and applauding. I found myself laughing out loud to all the stunts, though some of them like the ones mentioned above grossed me out more than they made me laugh. The only problem I can really think of is that some stunts we already saw (either from vol.1, vol.2, vol. 2.5 or the TV series), and while they still make us laugh, the comedic effect is lowered quite a bitAll in all, it's not a movie for everyone, but it almost comes out as a thank you to all the fans for having stuck with these guys for 10 years now. And frankly, the scene with Weezer's ''Memories'' almost brought tears to my eyes: Tears of joy. This is the part we realize the guys really wanted to offer a good time, and where we realize what the guys meant, a huge thank you. And honestly, I just felt like doing a standing ovation. Mission accomplished guys: I hope this is not the last we'll hear of Jackass, but if it is, it was a pleasure to stick around with you guys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a constant barrage of painful, hilarious, dangerous stunts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say: it's Jackass. In 3D.It's also a different movie than the previous Jackass installments in some ways. The guys are noticeably older and fatter, although Knoxville just looks older. There's a more polished feel to it as well. It's got a clean look, great production, great stunts and the crew work really well together. There's a real sense of camaraderie among the gang. They genuinely look happy to be together. The previous two films had moments when it looked like they weren't happy to be with each other or doing stunts. This time around, they know what they're doing, and they walk into it with a grin.There's plenty of slow-motion parts, which look great on the big screen. There's less disgusting parts, but still enough to satisfy. The 3D really doesn't get used much. The opening and closing sequences look great, but when you're filming Ryan Dunn being headbutted by a ram, or Danger Ehren getting kicked in the nuts by a donkey, what can you do? That latter skit, by the way, is pure gold.Not every skit is great, but there's more than enough to make up any lag. There's less unfunny parts (I always found the old man skits to be generally unfunny) than the previous two films. It's a constant barrage of painful, hilarious, dangerous stunts. I'll also add that this movie has far more hardcore skits in it, from getting balls fired from slingshots to the head, to the ever entertaining spectacle of watching Knoxville get charged by a bull. Just about every scene makes you cringe. I don't know how they do it.There does seem to be less innovation overall, and the stunts are quite simple. Jackass 2, for instance, had Bam getting branded and a brilliant stunt with Danger McGhehey as a terrorist, whereas this time around it's slow-motion boxing-glove punches and a teeball directly to the groin. It's simpler, but it's gold.I give it 10 out of 10. The Jackass crew have created a masterpiece. It excels over the previous two films without overshadowing them. It won't change the world, it won't lift the human race higher (in fact, it might take it back a few notches), but it will make you laugh and I can't think of a single reason not to give it 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Grotesque and Effectively So....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by admitting from the outset, I ain't a Jackass kind of guy. Whilst I enjoy crude humour that pushes boundaries, the entire Jackass concept and' imitation culture' just irritates me, and I had never given it the time of day before this viewing. I watched Jackass 3 perched upon a high horse?Lead by the charismatic Johnny Knoxville, the team engage in the typical risky, gross-out and painful stunts one would expect, given the reputation that precedes them. From a poo volcano, to fart bubbles?from a dildo bazooka to a tooth pulling Lamborghinis?the film contains a diverse cocktail of gross out filth and traditional slapstick 'ouch' moments.**SPOILER ALERT** And speaking of cocktails, the 'Poo Cocktail Supreme' is perhaps one of the more memorable things I've seen caught on film recently. For those who haven't seen it, the skit involves rigging a port-a-loo to bungee cables, strapping Steve-O inside, and thrusting it into the air to send an explosive poo spray all over the poor fool inside. Such moments carry a certain power; one which manages to induce a gag reflex and a chuckle simultaneously.I didn't watch the film in its 3D presentation, so the potency of the gross out may have been lost on the small screen. The added dimension would have provided a fun atmosphere to enjoy the shenanigans, and I can imagine watching the film in a packed cinema (of which I hear there were many throughout the $50 million opening weekend in the US) would be a unique and unforgettable experience. One thing that really irritated me about the film was the excessive laughter by the Jackass team. I know laughter is infectious, but I found it forced, disproportionate to the events, and ultimately grating.With no narrative, no point and no character, Jackass 3 is a curious film to give a rating to. It is just good ol' fashion grotesque. Whilst I can't claim to have been impressed with the standard of film making, I fell off my high horse, and if gross out slapstick is your cup of tea (or cup of urine?), then rent Jackass 3 for a heady swig.</fullReview>

In the third one they are more cautious and less "extreme", perhaps a sign of age and stardom in previous films they were bolder and way more careless. To much of nice guys and good ol chaps in this one.. And lots of scenes were forced and not funny at all. The gorilla scene is probably the most lame and fake reaction scene they ever made... It's a good movie for some laughs, and is typical Jackass does not bring anything new, but it's always good to see these guys for a fan since 2000 like me.I give it 7 out of 10, but was expecting something more risky.It is clearly the weakest one from the 3 movies...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most humanistic portrayal of the jackasses to date.The movie is packed with the same stunts that make you cringe, want to vomit, gaze helplessly in awe and laugh out loud... all at the same time.One of the biggest differences in the latest installment is the nostalgia conjured throughout. With the gravity of the consequences of the crew's lifestyles coming to public attention recently following a harrowing documentary on Steve-O's rampant psychological and drug problems, audiences entered theaters this time wondering more who the f*** these guys are instead of what new types of insanity they will attempt.The end credits sequence reflects this sentiment as we see vignettes of the main crew's beginnings with the show from over a decade ago as well as childhood photos, all of which portray them in significantly healthier condition.The stunts are hilarious as ever, but the most captivating part of this movie manifests itself through the visible on-screen changes in behavior and appearance of of our familiar stuntmen/pranskters, much older, and severely jaded.Now, we can only hope for "Sons of Jackasses."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a big follower of the TV programme Jackass, but I enjoyed the first film very much.And even though it was far from reaching the level of the first movie, I also liked Jackass 2.Now, Jackass 3D disappointed me; not only because I expected more from the 3D, but also because Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Bee Man and the other "artists" (or louts in a desperate search of fame?) seem to have lost the enthusiasm in risking their lives for delight of their fans.Do not misunderstand me...they keep risking it, and it is a miracle to find them still alive after 10 years of doing things like these.I simply did not find their stuff to be as spontaneous or subversive as in the first movie or as in some episodes from the TV programme.The scatological exploits or the "stunts" which show the limits of the human body in front of the gravity or the fury of some animals did not make me laugh very much.The moments which made me laugh were those surrealistic ones, such as the one where the midgets ask for a beer in a bar.So, Jackass 3D kept me moderately entertained, but I expected much more from it.Nevertheless, I think I can give it a slight recommendation only to those people who know what kind of things they can find in this movie, because this is not a film for sensitive or easily offended people at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2009, the 3D gimmick came to pass. It started a line of movies that would start adopting the elements of "things that fly at you." After a large number of disappointing "3D" films such as Alice In Wonderland, Toy Avatar, and Saw 3D (to name a few), Jackass 3D uses the 3D element to perfection for the first time since the origin.Jackass 3D completely throws feces, sex objects and other things at the camera and really make you throw your hands up or cringe in disgust. But, leave out the 3D elements and this movie is still rocking with awesome! Jackass stuntmen went all out with this one, not only with daringly wild stunts like "high-five!" and "port-a-potty bungee jump" but made it outrageously hilarious with things like Wee-Man's bar scene. There's not a dull moment. If the producers, writers and stuntmen are up for it, I'm very excited for a FOURTH Jackass film.If you enjoyed the first 2 films, I guarantee that you will like ?perhaps even love? this one just as much. It's a definite "don't-miss-it" film of the year. It falls into the category of mature audiences...but anyone old enough, shouldn't miss it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Jackass 3D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Pitch: Johnny Knoxville takes one step closer to not needing that old age make up? The Review: If the thought that it's more than ten years since Johnny Knoxville and his pals burst onto our screens, then have a thought for them. Could they have really imagined that after all this time, they'd still be attempting to find cruel and unusual ways to tease, torment and torture each other? There has, of course, been a long break since the last installment, even if you include the deleted scenes which escaped onto DVD under the pretence of being a separate movie, so it is it really worth the wait? For that matter, is it really worth the trouble? The excuse for this dip into the well of human depravity, of course, is the opportunity to affix a D to the 3 of the title. Always looking to do things properly where it counts, they've got some proper 3D kit, then set about finding ways to use it. This isn't to say that every stunt requires the use of 3D; indeed, more of them than not would be absolutely fine in 2D, but there are undoubtedly some memorable moments. What actually works better here is the other new innovation, the high speed camera used to capture the moments of heavily inflicted pain; watching the moment of impact in crystal clear slow motion adds to the feeling of awe and sense of fascination as you watch the slow-motion convulsions, and also to the empathy you'll feel for each one on the receiving end.Of course, Jackass has never been about purely sadistic pleasures; the intent is to make us laugh, and a lot of that is dependent on the camaraderie and interplay between the various Jackasses. Most make a return, only Raab Himself and Brandon DiCamillo not present from the core cast and the rest might look a little more creased, but are still willing to give their all in both the physical and the just plain daft. Knoxville might be the figurehead, but the most telling contribution is that of Steve-O, who has discovered sobriety since the last movie and enters into most of the stunts with a new found sense of self-awareness, giving him much more of the expression of a rabbit in the headlights, about two seconds before it's about to connect with bumper.It's not all about the physical, of course, and Jackass is as smart as ever in the execution of some of its high concepts, such as a bar fight played out by Wee-Man and a few of his friends. April and Phil, Bam's put upon parents, get put upon again although it's sometimes more of their own choosing now, and stalwarts of the series from Spike Jonze to Rip Taylor all pop up in their well-worn roles. So to answer those earlier questions, it was worth the wait; absence has made the heart grow fonder and the technical innovations add an element of freshness to the familiar. As to whether it's worth the trouble, that's one you can only answer if you've seen and enjoyed Jackass before; it's always gelled in a way that its contemporaries have struggled to do, and it remains consistently funny throughout. If Jackass is your (sick) bag, then there's little this year that will make you laugh as hard or as long.Why see it at the cinema: For anyone even slightly inhibited, the company of others should allow you to truly enter into the spirit. (And by that, I don't mean you should urinate on the row in front. Just to be clear.) Why see it in 3D?: Where else can you expect to see a giant pink dildo being fired out of a cannon straight at your face? IN 3D?The Score: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass have outlived their existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed the Jackass series on MTV. It felt new, fresh, cool and shocking. The fascination you felt for these cool dudes (who didn't wanna be Knoxville?) combined with the novelty of shock value on TV was irresistible. The first movie was a nice extension to that. The scene where the guy poops in a toilet store remains one of the funniest bits I've seen in this genre.Now, however, both me and the Jackasses are older. These "dudes" are pushing 40, some probably over 40. Nothing wrong with that, but what we see here is the opposite of what made the original Jackass irresistible: The guys are old, the stunts have been seen before, some of them have drug/drinking problems, etc. There is a sadness to it all. Its mildly entertaining but also somewhat embarrassing. I understand the "dudes" need cash but i would really want to see them come up with something different that just wearing a ballerina skirt and punching each-other in the face. That was fun 10 years ago, not so much now.The midgets in the bar was indeed a nicely made candid camera scene. So was the simplicity of the fat man leaving his dog with a guy on the street. None are movie-worthy though, there are funnier TV-shows that do the same.Nah, guys, don't ever grow up but please..re-invent yourself for the next one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass At It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who have never seen, let alone heard of, the Jackass franchise, the best possible way to describe it is to explain what its not. Its not a family orientated form of entertainment, its not for the weak hearted, and most importantly, its not something that disappoints and Jackass 3-D is no exception.Each hilarious stunt looks as if the writers took great pride into thinking them up...which also makes me ponder...what were they thinking? If someone were to tell you that Jackass' methods of merrymaking were crude and unorthodox they would be 100% percent right,However, as the film industry has changed over the years, it seems as if vulgar behavior is what most people desire for good amusement. So, if dropping a duce or getting hit in the groin is what the people want, then let there be Jackass.This film personifies humor, and will leave you in stitches on the way home, I give Jackass 3-D the best possible score it could receive, an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Same Great Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Knoxville and company return for the third installment of their television show spin-off, where dangerous stunts and explicit public displays rule.Due to Steve-O going through rehab, these were all sober stunts (or at least stunts done without alcohol on set). That takes some respect. I once slammed into a fence going down a water slide. It hurt for weeks, and had I not been drinking at the time, it would have been traumatic.While you would think they had done every painful or gross stunt possible at this point, you would be wrong: some, such as beehive tetherball, really raise the stakes.Dan Kois described the film as "a touching ode to male friendship at its most primal". That is a fair assessment. This is, underneath it all, a group of buddies having fun. Maybe not the kind of fun you have with your friends (or maybe you do), but fun just the same.</fullReview>

Being British, and having never been fond of American comedy because it is so simple and childish and dumb, I have to say this film is GOLDEN. Obviously most of the jokes are about poop and the like, but you HAVE to give RESPECT to these people who are doing it. I laughed through the entire film, even in the grosser scenes. DUDE. RESPECT THESE PEOPLE. Who else would be willing to go through with something like bungee-jumping-in-a-dog-sh**-filled-public-bathroom? THIS goes out to all the haters, all the boring people out there who are all like "THAT'S JUST WRONG". These guys have always been about this. Don't take it so seriously. Pee against the wind, as kn0xville says in the film. Eff it. Watch this movie. You will laugh, unless you are a stuck up ***** with a stick up your a**. Also, midget bar fight. Probably the best thing in the movie. Never written an interview, but I thought this movie deserved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT the best Jackass at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an underage viewer the first time round on the MTV series way back when, I was smiling and happy beyond belief in the sheer delight of seeing the (censored) stunts and pranks of these delightful people, who were just so funny.Now, I am no longer 11 and 21, and old enough for the target audience of this movie. I have watched every single Jackass thing ever, and without a doubt this is the most uninspired, dull, staged and cringe worthy of anything they have ever made.Back in the MTV days they made a TV Special where they participated in the Gumball 300 rally and this proved that Jackass could be entertaining, witty and funny without relying on toilet jokes and crude humour. The best thing about the TV show in general was seeing people hurt themselves for the first time ever on TV, it was refreshing and great and most of all, the explicit bits were censored so we didn't really get a grasp of how gruesome the things they were doing actually were.___________ SPOILER ALERT ________________Now what this movie has here is an uncensored UN funny mess of a movie. Every single 'prank' or 'skit,' relies heavily on nudity/sh*t/pee/gross out humour. This is not the Jackass we fell in love with. When they are not pooping on each other , peeing on each other ( also on themselves in the air plane scene,) or drinking each others sweat, everything in between is staged, not as daring as anything in the TV show, and dulled down because of the casts ages. _______ END OF SPOILER _____I remember a time when I could watch them skating, push each other over in shopping carts and that would be enough. The first movie was more like the TV show, and I enjoyed that much more than this. The imagination is gone, The creativity is gone, and most of all, the fun has gone.Not worth watching, watch the first 2 not this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning There's a surprise appearance from two of my old comedy heroes at the beginning of this third instalment of the Jackass franchise (in the shape of Beavis and Butthead) which was a pleasant surprise seeing them at their old antics again, but see them again I never did. The big spectacle here, of course, is that this time around you can see Johnny Knoxville and his gang getting up to their mischief and mayhem in 3D! But since I had no 3D specs to see it with, this was a bit of a lost novelty.The formula here is exactly the same as the last two films, with an endless onslaught of Knoxville and his cohorts getting up to their various imaginatively gross pranks and dangerous stunts, so essentially if you enjoyed them there's no reason you won't enjoy this. Except, there sort of is. While all the antics of the gang are as puerile and gross out as they ever were, only a very few of them really get you chuckling, being as predictable and samey as they are, and the format (which always worked better as a TV show, anyway) really feels like it's been stretched to the limit. This series really needs to pay heed to De La Soul and note that three is the magic number. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to watch Jackass 3D on opening night. I've always enjoyed the Jackass films and as per usual I have no idea what to expect (aside from people getting hurt).I believe this final installment is the most creative and interesting of the 3. It always surprises me how they time and time again come up with new ways to hurt each other. I would recommend this to anyone between 17 and 40. This film has some rotten stuff in it too so maybe not the best to take you Grandmother to.All in all, Jackass 3D is worth every cent.

		<fullReview>First off, I am a casual Jackass fan. I did enjoy the MTV series from time to time (back in the late 90s after Beavis and Butthead). I saw the first movie on DVD and haven't seen the 2nd. I haven't seen a movie in 3-D since Superman Return (and the 3-D effect was only short segments in the movie where you take off the glasses). The 3-D effect works very well here (The theater I went to offered 'Real 3D'). And I loved that there was Beavis and Butthead short intro in this as well. There was many segments where I literally couldn't stop laughing and in a packed theater people were laughing harder than in your typical comedy club. While mostly appeals to the frat style young adult male, some others may like it if they enjoy physical comedy. One word of suggestion, do not eat before seeing this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny for about an hour and then moan-fully gross and eventually boring, this latest 3D installment with the wacky jackass boys just extends the straight dude diarrhea humor and phallic obsession - not to mention all the fun of each other's anuses and what can go in and out of them, JACKASS 3D views like randy sailors on shore leave who cannot stop their pranks they like to play on each other when isolated and alone. So they just do it in public. Like a wet underpants club ANIMAL HOUSE for gay guys, JACKASS 3D is all the nude crude and penis-anus fun straight guys accuse gay guys of enjoying... so here they just enjoy it themselves and let us all in the multiplex in on their explicit bum-fun antics. JACKASS 3D might eventually be a man-club sociological sexual experiment somewhat like the Kinsey report on the sexual humor of the American male, and could easily be a University Psychology course in itself. One gleefully nude member called Steve-O might also soon succumb to toxic waste poisoning.. and if you see what he imbibes in this film you will fear for his future health. It's sorta funny a lot and occasionally very funny but mostly startlingly faux-homosexual, pretending to be straight guys romping about enjoying each other's body orifices and functions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is exactly what you expect from guys that love to hurt and humiliate each other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going in to this film, you have to be aware that it is immature, gross and possibly damaging to braincells but that is exactly what it is meant to do. It has no pretenses, illusions or even aspirations to win awards. It's just chalk full of demented, hilarious and vomit inducing gags. It's not meant to be highbrow and anybody that doesn't like it because it isn't Oscarworthy cinema just doesn't have a sense of humour. That's not to say that everyone should like this movie. It isn't for just anyone. It's just that everyone should understand that it can appeal to a wide variety of people that want nothing more than to see how far someone can go in the name of shock-and-awe humour.The gross-out gags are, in my mind, worse than the 2nd movie. Especially, the one with the porta-potty launcher and Preston's "sweatsuit". I felt like throwing up during the former.The 3D really doesn't do much for the movie but the starting and ending are loaded with some decent effects. Plus the phallus they should out and flies across the screen is just magnificent.Many hilarious but sometimes overplayed gags are the ones involving Chris Pontius' wang. He obviously is very proud of his "junk" and is, as usual, always showing it off. It's about the only time I ever look forward to seeing male genitalia other than my own.It's worth seeing it in theaters as this will definitely be the last time it hits theaters. If you've seen it you will understand, if you haven't it has a very nice cap-off reminiscent of Lethal Weapon 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, Knoxville and crew are back.I'll start off by saying that I wasn't a fan of Jackass before I saw Jackass: Number Two. My cousins and their friends tempted me, so I sat down and watched it with them... and within seconds I was on the floor, crying from laughing so hard. I was instantly a fan, and days after, I rented the first Jackass and laughed just as hard.Today I went and saw the third strike at the theaters, and in Real D 3D. Of course I got hassled for my ID, 3 times actually, as it's R here in Canada meaning admittance restricted to people 18 and over. Apparently they had a real sneaking problem!! That said, I had a total blast with this movie. If you just switch your brain off at the door, you'll laugh to the point where you're croaking!!!! There is not a single unfunny moment in the movie.The stunts are outrageous, grosser than ever, and out there as hell. All stops imaginable are pulled out. Of course if you are faint hearted or squeamish you will want to avoid this film at all costs as it contains some truly disgusting stuff!!! Without a doubt the funniest stunt is "Electric Avenue", a stunt done in the style of a jailbreak, where the crew try to get through a hallway with beams in the middle, tires on the ground, and dangerously high-volt tasers dangling from the ceiling!!! Of course, as stated above it is absolutely NOT for kiddies under 18 or the faint of heart. This got its R here in Alberta for a good reason. The "Sweatsuit cocktail" scene alone pretty much solidifies that right there.The 3D is great!!!! Before the movie is a nice little short from Beavis and Butthead explaining the 3D technology, which is truly hilarious. The 3D just ADDS to the ridiculousness, not only is it more lifelike, but there are a few startling "pop out" moments too and it's just hilarious!!!! They take full advantage of the 3D and therefore it's totally worth it.In short, It did kinda make me sad that this may be the last Jackass. Hopefully it isn't, because they may be getting old but they certainly aren't declining in quality. Definitely as good as Jackass: Number Two, check it out!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 9, probably would have been an 8 if it was not for the 3D effects. The 10 rating is something that I save for movies that are the best in their category, and the best comedy mockumentary I have ever seen is Midgets vs Mascots. Of course, Hollywood black balled it, so you have to buy it on Amazon or at Best Buy and we'll never know how it would have done in theaters. Shame. If we get to see the Jackass crew in 3D, there is no reason not to give some smaller indie comedies a chance at the same type of success and give the true comedy fans a chance to support the movies that they want to see. In any event, I highly recommend Jackass 3D for all of the fans out there that appreciate the fact that it is OK to make a movie for people that just want to laugh and have fun for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Comparison to other comedies, this film outdoes nearly all of them for laughs. it's like watching an adult version of America's funniest home videos, and knowing the result every time and laughing even before someone reaches for their family jewels.The boys are back for one last round (I think) and are putting out better than before. Johnny Knoxville goes butt-first against a dog (the still is on this page) Bam Margera Faces his fear of snakes (even though he really didn't want to) Steve-o took a ride in a porta-potty, Chris Pontius Tied a toy Helicopter to his Penis and let the chopper go. Dave England created a poo volcano, and Danger Erhen Went to the dentist. The Dentist being Bam Margera and his $250,000 Lamborghini.This movie was totally worth the 12.50 I paid to see it. The 3-d gimmick was cool like always, and it totally lived up to the hype. unfortunately, the boys are ageing (you can already see it in johnny's face) but they love each other like brothers, and they will always be jackasses, no matter how many times they try to kill each other.10/10. I'm buying this when it comes out.</fullReview>

Obviously if you are looking for any type of meaning or political statement, you should go to see a documentary.

		<fullReview>I saw the advanced screening last night at 10 P.M. and the entire theatre and I literally CRIED laughing! It was the best Jackass by far! It also pulls at the heart in ways, since I've been a lifelong Jackass fan, making you nostalgia a bit. I believe this is their last Jackass film, (hey, 3 is a charm and I don't think the crew could survive a 4th! loljk) and the bond of friendship they all share is really something amazing(ly chaotic). The stunts are so incredibly outrageous (didn't think they could get anymore so) hahaha I did notice there is a lot more applauding when they land a stunt, or immediately going to see if their comrade is okay after they go down... I don't really remember a lot of that in the past 2 Jackass's, but it lets you know they care. haha I do warn you however, there is a gross out factor with some of the stunts (and there is included, and not limited too: Feces, Male Genitalia, and a lot of throwing up) but what would a Jackass film be without the shock factor? One thing about the Jackass crew is that by themselves, they're each incredible people, but together they're indescribable. You just got to love them. Each always has something to unique contribute. It's like each member is a slice of one kick ass f**king pizza! ::::::::::::::::::POSSIBLE SPOILER::::::::::::::::::Like I said, I had major nostalgia at the end, it does this montage of early clips of their stunts along with a baby photo of each and it really brought back memories. These guys are just the coolest. :::::::::::::::::END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER::::::::::::::::::::::I think I'm definitely going to get the boys over tonight and have a Jackass marathon with Jackass 1, 2, and 2.5 before going to see 3D again.In other words, I LOVED it! I will definitely go see it multiple times this weekend. Thank you Jackass crew, for the memories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe I enjoyed the classic, MTV series' made movie Jackass 3D a bit too much if that's possible. This is the third installment in the Jackass franchise, and while not the best, it has certain stunts that really put a smile on your face and ones that make the film itself memorable in it's own special way. It's been eight years since the first film went to theaters and ten since the series got it's start on MTV. Jackass 3D celebrates the occasion by having all the same characters back and doing the crazy, no limit stunts they're famous for.Who needs plot? Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Jason "Wee-Man" Acu?a, Preston Lacy, Dave England, and Eheren McGhehey perform hurtful, injury filled, and pointless stunts for our enjoyment. I know how much people have looked forward to this film and I won't ruin any stunts, or so which ones I favor. But I will say, this one is male nudity filled and laugh infested.I will say the opening sequence to this film was probably the weakest yet in Jackass films. The first movie, they ride down a bridge in a giant shopping cart; I call that my favorite opening. In Number Two, they are being chased by bulls on a suburban street; pretty funny and amusing. A worthy opening. This one I won't spoil, but nothing special happens. Some of the people I've talked to enjoyed it, but I didn't really. It had it's perks and different levels of amusement, but overall, it's just average. Though the fun filled ending scene makes up for the bland intro.It seems too they gave characters who didn't have a name more stunts to perform. I swear I've seen Preston, Dave, and Eheren more than I have ever seen in a Jackass film or TV show. They were there once in a while, but they do various stunts in the film; most notably Eheren who's name is now "Danger Eheren". We also see Dreamseller author Brandon Novak get hit a few times which I enjoyed. Him and Joe Frantz are both underrated and I think seeing Novak in the film will get him some support.I will say that the gang may be forty, but they perform stunts like they're in High School. No matter which way you look at it, when Jackass came on it was an iconic series, nothing like that had really been done before. Guys doing stunts and getting injured for audience amusement? "Gnarley dude!" Johnny Knoxville and Steve-O have stood out to me has Jackass' best. Though the whole cast never ceases to impress, they've stood out has the true jackasses. Once I head Johnny Knoxville say "Hi. I'm Johnny Knoxville an' welcome to Jackass!" I knew oh yeah, I was back.The last thing I want to touch on is the 3D and keep in mind the star rating isn't effected by the 3D's performance. The 3D is nice for a few scenes, but overall, if rated, it would get a two and a half. It's nice in some scenes, but it's not as in depth as it should be. I know it's live action, so it's without a doubt harder to do than most animation, but Avatar's three dimensional performance was great even in live action, while not being a mind blowing film. The most awkward thing about 3D is when it comes to DVD or TV in 2D, it'll look odd having many things bouncing out at the screen since it was clearly shot for 3D purposes. All movies have an odd 2D transfer if shrunk down to 3D.Jackass 3D may not have surpassed the classic series, but it did impress a bit more than the second film did in that matter. The film has memorable stunts and little quirky things that make the film special in it's own way. To reflect on Roger Ebert's Jackass: The Movie review it's like we are watching a series of outtakes, not a real movie. Jackass 3D is 94 minutes but it goes by ridiculously fast even in RealD 3D. Nothing left to say, but "stupid is as stupid does".Starring: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Jason "Wee-Man" Acu?a, Preston Lacy, Dave England, Eheren McGhehey, Spike Jonze, Jeff Tremaine, and Brandon Novak. Directed by: Jeff Tremaine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legacy Lives On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knoxville and co. bring you their 3rd installment in everything we the viewer have come to love, now in glorious 3D. The boys are definitely starting to show age, but these kindred spirits show a nostalgic epilogue as they have had 10 years of memories, and being best of friends. Now let's get to the film.The film opens with a brief introduction from Beavis and Butthead, which leads into arguably the best opener of the three. Super slow motion antics such as being punched with giant boxing gloves, and leaping into ceiling fans, all in crisp clean 3D. The film opens with a familiar bit most people are likely to be aware of, The High Five. This is "The Valentine" of this film. Unsuspecting Jackass cast members meeting their demise by a giant hand slapping them to the ground. It's one of the film's best. Fast forwarding we get jet skis jumping fences, band member square offs with an angry ram, golf shot ricochets, suspended tazer obstacle courses, and a pig eating an apple out of Preston's butt.Jackass 3D does have it's fair share of gross outs, such as the Poo Cocktail Supreme, and the Sweatsuick Cocktail. Prepare for poop, pee, and vomit, because it has it all.Now let's get to the 3D. Does it work? Well for the most part. It wasn't necessarily needed, nor did it truly enhance the film to a "wow" degree, but certain scenes embraced the aspect and it played out nicely. The picture was crisp and clean and was one of the best looking movies I've ever seen.So where does Jackass 3D land in the trilogy? I personally would have to say in last, or maybe just inching out the first. Number Two reigns supreme by a long shot. This movie did feel uneven at times, and stripped away some the amateurish style the show is known for. That being said it has indeed evolved with the higher budgets, encompassing craftier set pieces and opportunities to get good bits. To conclude, see this movie opening night with a large audience. It truly enhances the experience when you have a full theater nearly dying of laughter at certain parts of the movie. Bring a large group of friends so you can share all the "oohs" and "ahhs" and hilarity. I won't be surprised if the critics pan this one, but hey, it's Jackass. It's not. Academy material anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass 3D is the best 3D movie of all time, if not the best movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Utilizing state-of-the-art 3D cameras and high speed slow-motion, Jackass is considerably the best 3D movie of all time, if no THE best movie of all time. Unlike other 3D movies which use the technology as a gimmick to have things appear to fly out at the audience "whoa, that hand looks like it's coming out at me!" Jackass does not. In Jackass, there is more play with perspective and depth of field. Making object appear either closer or further away than they actually are. That is how 3D should be treated. Have you ever wanted to see someone getting slapped in the face with a mackerel in super slo-mo? I have. Have you ever wanted to see someone get knocked over by a giant hand? I have. While much of the movie is filled with childish stunts and immature gags, there is a deeper meaning. Spreading a message of good natured feelings, there is no hate, nor malice anywhere to be found in this movie. It is filled with a childlike innocence and brotherly love. The Jackasses are retaining that innocence of childhood, playing as we all did as children. It is the paramount of escapism that we as a society desperately need. Harmless fun. There is no conflict, no great task to undertake, no damsel to rescue, only laughs to be shared and fun to be had. They bring us back to a simpler time, when we were children. Playing and laughing together as we pushed our friend down a hill into a questionable nasty pond or frolicked naked through a field. I did these things, and you did too. It is the embodiment of the never grow old mentality. Not in the sense that you should never mature and live your life. We've seen these guys when they're not goofing around, leading normal lives, many of them are very successful in their careers outside of Jackass. No, what I mean, is that you should retain your childhood innocence in some way, whether it be goofing around with your buddies or just doing something nostalgic and meaningful to yourself. That is what Jackass is really about, Memories of a better time. I highly recommend this movie. And don't give me that crap about imitatible acts. When I was a kid I did much of the very same stuff, and that was long before jackass was around. I will not lie, there is a lot of peni in this movie, and you should take caution if you're uncomfortable around that, but lets be honest. By this time in your life your bound to have already seen at least one. Go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't meet any logical criteria as a movie and wasn't shot on film. It's a series of video clips of mostly crude stunts. If barfing is your idea of fun this is for you. No animals were harmed except perhaps the morons doing the stunts.There is something for everyone if you enjoy things usually performed into a toilet performed on screen.There's a fun jet engine mega fan segment. The s**t is the only thing that didn't hit the fan, but it hits almost everything else. There are a few laughs and perhaps a weird touching relationship between the performers.Segments that are supposed to be spontaneous come off looking staged, especially, the grandfather/granddaughter segment. Some of the material appears not to be recorded in 3D. Super-imposing a 3D title doesn't make a scene 3D.Rather then see this piece of work; it should be placed into a time capsule as a reference to the decline of western civilization.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackass 3D -- Crew ages but jokes are fresh out of the locker room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackass 3D has been dubbed by my peers as comic-genius as well as the bane of humanity. Whichever way you look at it, Jackass 3D steps up its game from previous chapters of its tome of avant-garde humor. So is it worth the pricey ticket? The simple answer is yes and no.Yes: If you are a male between the ages of 13 and 69, please consult your doctor about any pre-existing heart condition you may have before watching this movie. The amount of laughing in which you will partake cannot be healthy.Yes: If you are a female between the ages of 13 and ...(the average age of menopause?) and would consider yourself as one or more of the following: skater-girl, girl-next-door, that one girl who guys feel like they can talk to, the "cool" mom, cougar, or possibly Betty White.No: The weak-stomached, non-fans of previous Jackass endeavors, that one guy who gets a headache from the 3D glasses, and those planning on not going to hell.In my honest opinion, Jackass 3D was the perfect end to an amazing trilogy (not including Jackass 2.5) of bottom-of-the-barrel humor masterfully crafted for the young and the young at heart. It was worth every cent, every penny being a belly-laugh or gag-reflex. Some stunts will even keep you chuckling on the car ride home.A+ from the 21-year-old college student.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HILARIOUS MOVIE!! 3D made it even better!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GREAT MOVIE!! NEVER LAUGHED HARDER IN MY LIFE!! "For the most part very funny - some gross but overall entertaining" OF COURSE ITS GROSS. ITS JACKASS, JACKASS! "3D, It wasn't necessarily needed, nor did it truly enhance the film to a "wow" degree, but certain scenes embraced the aspect and it played out nicely" I couldn't have watched this movie any other way! It was awesome! "More often than not, this third installment in the franchise, directed as always by Jeff Tremaine, doesn't take full advantage of its visual potential" So because you weren't as impressed with the 3D as you thought you might be (remembering only the animated films get the full affect of 3D) you have decided to rate it a 6 out of 10? The movie was hilarious and keeps it audience the entire movie! That's what a film is really all about. So crap on your rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two and a half stars and one dildo (Out of Five)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'JACKASS 3D': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Ryan Dunn, Steve-O, Preston Lacy, Wee-Man, Chris Pontius, Dave England and the rest of the gang are back for another bunch of crazy and vulgar stunts and pranks and this time it's in 3D. Once again this third film is directed by Jeff Tremaine and this time written by Preston Lacy (whom my friend Erika says she knew back in her home town). The 3D is pretty effective at times with certain things flying right into your face, although maybe a little underused. The movie itself is more of the same; if you've seen one 'JACKASS' movie you've seen them all but it's still extremely funny and amusing, as well as of course disgusting.For those of you that don't know the MTV TV series 'JACKASS' was created in 2000 by Knoxville, Tremaine and Spike Jonze. It ran for three seasons and featured Knoxville and fellow 'Big Brother Magazine' (a comedic skateboarding magazine) collaborators Pontius, Dave England, Wee-Man, Steve-O and Tremaine as well as skateboarder Bam Margera and the crew from his popular stunt / prank 'CKY' movies (including Dunn). After the show's demise it was quickly followed by the first theatrical film (featuring most of the TV cast and crew) in 2002 and then a sequel in 2006. Despite the dangerous nature and severe self inflicted bodily harm of the stunts the crew continues to make films due to their immense popularity.Fans of the TV series and previous films should get exactly what they expect from this third film and be mostly satisfied, I was. The movie is once again hilarious and you can't help but feel a part of the enormous fun, that you can tell the crew is having. I could have done with out all the male nudity, flying feces and other crude spectacles in the film but my stomach has gotten a little more used to it over the years. I enjoy the pranks a lot more and of course the crazy stunts. I'd say this installment isn't really inferior to the others in any way (and it does have that added 3D visual effect) but it is getting a little old and a little less original and less inspired in some ways. Due to the fact that it's made up of a bunch of short gags, stunts and pranks it does drag a little (as with all of the films) and seem much longer than it's 94 minute running time. Even so I have to admit I still had a lot of fun and I pretty much got exactly what I expected. If you're a fan of the series this film should definitely not disappoint.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_gpux8_tZ4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning ~ Just a heads up to parents.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family and I just got back from seeing the movie. We love all the movies and the show on MTV. This movie is very funny. It was really great to hear the entire theater laughing hysterically. We need more of that especially with the problems today. I do want to warn you that a couple of the guys show their penis on several occasions. My 21 year old daughter was shocked as she has never seen even one and she just saw several. We all loved the movie and is just what the doctor ordered.Another warning !!!!!!!!!!! Pee before the movie starts or you will have an accident, it's that funny! Enjoy !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a detailed review that spells out the horrors of this poop and vomit filled "movie", go here: http://tiny.cc/m73b1 -- Read that review and hopefully save yourself the psychological damage of watching this garbage. Even in my hardest partying college days, I cannot imagine that I would enjoy this level of toilet humor. If you think you are going to see some idiots in shopping carts crashing into each other, think again. Instead you will find a movie that involves feces over and over again, as these morons try and gross each other (and you) out so bad that everyone throws up. I just read this movie made $20 million in one day, I am once again embarrassed to be an American.</fullReview>
