		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've done extensive reading and research on Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and this era. With that as a start, let me continue.The roles of Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp were well-cast and portrayed. The actors bore reasonable physical resemblance to the real men. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was superb; I thought his portrayal was more accurate than that of Val Kilmer in "Tombstone", his personality and his appearance.... although with friends, Doc Holliday was a pretty affable gentleman.The story was a nice story, although there were significant problems with some of the historical accuracy. First, Morgan and Virgil were NOT shot on the same night... actually 3 months apart. Things like that bother me when seeing a supposedly historically accurate film. But what I considered the weakest part of this movie (and "Tombstone" as well) was the very incomplete and weak buildup to the gunfight. There was so much more that happened, so much that affected the relationship between the good guys and the bad, so much missing that both films almost made the fight look like a spur of the moment battle... which is far from factual. What many people don't realize is that Bat Masterson spent time in Tombstone during this era, although not directly involved in the "action"; also, Luke Short was a major ally of Wyatt's throughout this time.I very much liked that Wyatt's young life was shown... his time as town constable, his marriage to Urilla Sutherland, her death and his resulting devastation, his pony stealing in Arkansas... all things that most folks never realized.I would very much liked to have seen more of Wyatt's revenge ride and subsequent deaths and scattering of the Clanton gang. Also, the absence of any sequence involving the robbery of the Benson stage and the killing of Bud Philpot and Peter Roehrig is regrettable, as this was a major factor leading to the battle. Also, as a result of the stage robbery, we should have seen a sequence regarding Wyatt's agreement with Ike about turning in the robbers. Finally, how Behan backed out on his deal with Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film. If you're not a stickler like I am for total historical accuracy, you should enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent script, beautifully visualized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As epics go, this film ranks high on my list. I attribute this mainly to the screenplay, which is compelling, visual, and rich. The film follows the life of Wyatt Earp, from his boyhood, through the fight at the O.K. Corrall, and beyond.Unlike other adaptations of the same subject (namely, Kurt Russell's Earp in 'Tombstone'), this film deals with the famous gunfight as merely a step in Earp's life. Rather, the film focuses on the man behind the legend. To do this, it looks at Earp's life in two stages: his life before, and after, a major transition.Contrary to what some may think, Kevin Costner does a very good job portraying the lawman. His character experiences a wealth of emotion, but the script is so well written that Costner does not need to stretch himself to portray Earp effectively.The film comes together so well because of an excellent musical score, visually stunning cinematography, and strong acting by the supporting characters. It draws the viewer in, so much so that you do not feel you are watching a film, but are experiencing a moment in history. The direction by Kasdan is quite low-key, allowing the viewer to be drawn into the story, rather than simply showing it to us.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys epic stories, wonderful acting (particularly Dennis Quaid, although Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen are excellent as well), and visually compelling shots. Do not let the length dissuade you: Kasdan's film is well worth the three hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very misunderstood and under-appreciated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nothing counts more than blood... the rest are just strangers," speaks Wyatt's father at the beginning of the film--the most important line perhaps in the movie, with the exception of Wyatt's own at the end "Some say it didn't happen that way," commenting upon a flashback recounting his brand of law and justice in the wild cattle town of Dodge City.I wholeheartedly admit the film is long--but so are many other great films. I also admit that it is not the shoot 'em up Tombstone is, but this film is a far greater one, a character study of a man whose innocence is laid to rest by the harsh wilderness of both the American West and human nature. By the end of this movie, Wyatt is a used up and bitter man, and I would argue that this film was never meant to be a heroic portrayal of an individual, only a dark and complicated one. It reminds me thus of the greatest of character portrayals, Raging Bull--though I'm sure the parallel isn't obvious. I probably am more forgiving of this film since I like Westerns, dark dramatic stories, and admittedly uneven plots, because the characters usually are so great in them. This one is no different, and was likely made for a viewer like me, and not the mainstream audience.It's very ambitious, and successful, I believe, on its artistic merits. Whether it's "entertainment" for the masses, well that's another story altogether, and that story's name is probably "Tombstone."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kasdan and Costner's Lyrical, yet Uneven Western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WYATT EARP, the second of the epic films about the legendary lawman released between 1993-94, lacked the commercial values that made TOMBSTONE successful, but was a far riskier film, with higher aspirations. Writer/Director Lawrence Kasdan, whose previous Western, SILVERADO (1985), had paid homage to Hollywood's Western clichés, wanted, with WYATT EARP, to cut through the myths, and create a film that would honestly examine an all-too-human Earp's life in the 'real' West, set against vistas of that were nearly overpowering in their immense size and beauty. Unfortunately, the result was a mixed bag; while the film is beautiful to look at (with one of the most majestic film scores of recent years, composed by James Newton Howard), the characters (with the exception of Dennis Quaid's 'Doc Holiday') lack charisma, with Kevin Costner's portrayal of Earp so flat that it is difficult to arouse much interest in him (it would be nearly ten years before he finally 'got it right', in OPEN RANGE). The film ultimately comes across as overblown and overlong, with it's memorable moments nearly lost amid panoramic views of the West.I still think, however, that WYATT EARP has a few redeeming qualities which make it worth viewing. Foremost is Dennis Quaid, giving the performance of a lifetime as the dying Doc Holiday. The actor lost over forty pounds to play the role, and is physically the closest in appearance to the dentist-turned-gambler/gunfighter of all the actors who have ever portrayed him. Gaunt, dripping sarcasm with a Southern accent between hacking tubercular coughs, Quaid seizes each scene he's in, and certainly deserved Oscar consideration. It is ironic that his performance had to follow TOMBSTONE's flamboyant 'Doc', Val Kilmer, who created such an over-the-top, audience-friendly character, that Quaid's more realistic portrayal would be forgotten.Another reason to watch WYATT EARP is it's presentation of the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and it's aftermath. With the exception of John Sturges' HOUR OF THE GUN, no Westerns before TOMBSTONE and WYATT EARP had told the full story of the events, from the brief but deadly shootout, through the subsequent murder trial against the Earps, and Ike Clanton's vengeance, afterwards, resulting in Morgan Earp's murder, and Virgil Earp being crippled for life. Wyatt's bloody vendetta against Clanton and his allies was a grim reminder of 'frontier justice' and his ruthlessness even appalled Doc Holliday. The film doesn't attempt to gloss over or glorify Earp's actions, but does try to explain it, as an obligation to his family, who were the cornerstone of his life. Unfortunately, it took WYATT EARP nearly two hours to finally reach Tombstone, by which time audiences were fidgeting in their seats!Uneven, but at times powerful, WYATT EARP was a major box office failure when released, and it never achieved the 'Classic' stature TOMBSTONE has, over the years. But it isn't a bad film, and Kasdan should be credited for his willingness to take an original look at a Western legend. It will be interesting to hear his comments, if a 'Director's Cut' DVD is ever released!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kasdan's epic Western proved absorbing?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Law and Order" (1932), a film starring Walter Huston and Harry Carey, had blazed the Earp screen trail with a brave version of the 0. K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never named? "Frontier Marshal" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and "Wichita" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the story? To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's "My Darling Clementine" (1946), John Sturges' "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," (1957), Sturges' "Hour of the Gun" (1967), and George P. Cosmatos' "Tombstone" (1993). But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology? Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorful? Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each other?In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gambler? Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignity? Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealist? Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosis?In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief? He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best moments? His character has his own form of ability? Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosis? Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degree? Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need arise? The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurys? The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the Corral?Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touch? While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyond?The film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old age? The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well told? But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualities?for the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the way? This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magic?"My Daring Clementine" was a film of touches?Fonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors dance?Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriage? Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll Take This Version Over The Rest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best, and underrated, westerns ever made. It was a very intense, interesting character study of a famous lawman, showing flaws and all. In fact, this is the only version, I believe, that really shows the sadistic side of Wyatt Earp, and what made him a bitter man. To be fair, it also shows his good traits. It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action. Even the music grows on you after several viewings. There is no humor in here: this is a serious story. Unlike the more popular "Tombstone," this Earp story has a lot less profanity and almost no usage of the Lord's name in vain....but there is rough language and some crude sexual remarks, so don't watch it with the kiddies.At rate, the movie is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. (All nationally-known critics but one panned this, as far as I know.)Kevin Costner performed one of his better acting jobs. It was nice to see Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore as good guys. That's not seen in too many films! They were low-key characters, too. Dennis Quaid did a nice job as the fascinating "Doc Holliday." It's generally conceded that Val Kilmer's "Doc" in "Tombstone" was the best-ever, but Quaid version is just fine, thank you, and gets better and better with each viewing. This is a long movie, but it's never dull and it never overdoes the action, either. The cast is deep so you see a lot of familiar actors. As mentioned, this film is extremely underrated. I know most people prefer "Tombstone" but I'll take this version of the Earp saga any time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I usually am indifferent about Costner,however</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in some people's criticisms of the flick I usually see "he was dull" or "he didn't give the character life," and I have to disagree. In actuality he gave the best rendition of the real Wyatt Earp and his life. The movie is a biopic, and for historians like myself it served its purpose, in showing the life and true personality of a figure Hollywood overglamourized. Wyatt Earp was not the type to dance in the snow and was indeed a cold hearted SOB. I prefer this to Tombstone and no doubt Costner was better than Russell. And actually Quaid was the better Doc. I wouldn't say it was a classic movie and spaghetti western versions of the story might be more "entertaining," however the darkness of Costner's movie is chilling and is the version that gets more replay value from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly long and deliberate but a fine story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt grows up a young man who loves the law. When his wife dies early in their marriage he goes off the rails and becomes a drunk and a thief. When he is offered a chance at redemption he takes it and becomes a deputy. His legend spreads and he is offered the chance to be the deputy for Dodge City. He has great success but is removed from the job for being too brutal. When his replacement is killed as the law falls away in Dodge, Wyatt returns before moving on to Tombstone but finds his initial run-in with the Clantonhas left harbouring resentments.When I saw this in the cinema, it was hassled by the fact that another, more multiplex-friendly version of the story had just been released shortly before. Viewed separately years later it fares better without the comparison to Tombstone, which is, in fairness, more of a fun bang-bang affair, although now it struggles because Costner's reputation is not even at the level it was when this film was released. The plot is good and is supposedly a true telling of the legend, although the film is careful to pepper the running time with hints that stories get changed with the telling.The very honest and respectful telling of the story means that it gets told in a very deliberate and careful manner. This means on one hand that we get a good picture over Wyatt's life as opposed to the events in Tombstone, however it also means that the film itself is a little dull and overlong. It is overly deliberate and doesn't flow as well as it should - flowing more like syrup than water at times. Where some three-hour running times fly by, here it does feel like at least three hours - not always a good thing! The filling out of the characters doesn't always work either - I knew more about Wyatt but I didn't understand his character much more, also I was surprised that I was none the wiser about why he and Doc became friends considering how long was spent with them. A big failing of the film is that it assumes the status of an epic rather than earning the status. What I mean by this is that it tries too hard to be an epic - with constant sweeping music where it didn't need it. I still thing the film has an epic sweep to it, but it didn't need the cinematic tricks to achieve it; in fact, it could have down played it and let the sweep of the film do it for itself.The cast is pretty good and also pretty deep. Costner may not be seen as a star anymore but that doesn't mean he can't act and can't hold the attention. He is a reasonable Wyatt but he suffers from being too deliberate and too shut off at times. I understand he needed to do it for the character but it contributes to the film feeling slow. The other brothers are played well by Madsen, Ashby and Andrews. Maybe it is because of Costner's drab Wyatt, but Quaid really lightens things up as Doc Holliday. His colourful character stands out easily against the old west types. The support cast is deep and includes faces such as Hackman, Fahey, Harmon, Pullman, Sizemore, Rossellini, Williams and O'Hara.Overall this is a film that requires patience - if you prefer your films to contain action more than story then Tombstone may be more for you - but, for all it's failings, this is still a solid western and a good telling of the legend with more emphasis on background than action and fluidity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wyat Earp" had the misfortune to be released not long after the classic "Tombstone," which told the same story. Nevertheless, "Wyat Earp" is a laudable effort and well worth the time to sit through its three hours and fifteen minutes running time.The performances were uniformly good, with a skeletal Dennis Quade particularly fine as the doomed Doc Holliday. In fact, I thought that Quade's funny and moving performance as Doc Holliday was in the same class as Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in "Tombstone." The women playing the Earp wives, Catherine O'Hara, JoBeth Williams, Mare Winningham, and Betty Buckley, were also very effective. The beautiful Joanna Going was a pleasure to watch as Josie Marcus, the woman who Wyat Earp spent the last 47 years of his life with. Unfortunately, her acting skills did not match her beauty.The thing that makes the film rise above the mediocre to me is its stunning visual and aural beauty. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital soundtrack is world class, and its outdoor photography is evocative.Recommended, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reassessing an underrated masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to thank Kevin Costner for taking me West. "Wyatt Earp" led me to pick up a copy of the early Earp bio by Stuart Lake while working in Canada, and I was surprised to find photos of the actual historical people tipped inside. The resemblance of the actors to those they portrayed impressed me.I continued to research. I went to Tombstone and stayed at a nearby ranch. The town itself declined Costner's office to rebuild it with accuracy, preferring the leave things as they are (very touristy). The gunfight was actually held in the street, etc. My research matched at least striking physical/type casting for 17 characters, from major characters (the Earps and their wives/women) to the Cowboys, Beehan, Doc Holiday, his Kate, and Bat Masterson. Linden Ashby is the most striking doppelganger; indeed, he seems to be a physical reincarnation of Morgan Earp. Dennis Quaid lost some 40 pounds or so for the role of Doc Holiday and his resemblance to the TB-plagued gambler from Valdosta, Georgia is eerie as well.Costner caught a lot of flack for this film; in fact, few critics noted the historical sense that he achieved. Granted, some cuts are made in time frame/continuity to speed plot along (i.e. timing of attacks on Morgan and Virgil), and the film is lengthy. I learned that the Cowboy/Earp feud was not mere ill-will, but that the strife represented political differences and clashing economic interests, as well as the "theft" of a lover. The old diaries and biographies are fascinating! I learned that Morgan Earp told Allie Earp something like, "I want to leave Tombstone and never come back" moments before he was shot to death.Of note, Johnny Beehan's partner in the Dexter Corral in Tombstone was a man named "John Dunbar". This was Costner's character's name in "Dances with Wolves". Go figure. Read more about it! Granted Lake embellished Earp's image, but the place, the times and the issues are fascinating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Tombstone* is better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see the debate is lively here as to which was the better 1993 take on the Earp legend, Kasdan's *Wyatt Earp* or Cosmatos' *Tombstone*. If you prefer the former, fair enough, but I'm about to demonstrate why you're mistaken. But the main thrust of my proof is against those here who are petulantly declaring that the two movies shouldn't be compared.Ah, but if you're presuming to form a critical opinion about this movie, they SHOULD be compared, because the comparison lays bare the fundamental problem with Kasdan's approach to the material. Namely, the director -- who, by the way, I respect, believing him to be a more accomplished director than Cosmatos -- is trapped by an overlong, meandering script whose entire first half should have been redacted with red ink. Okay, here's the problem: after an anticipation-building introduction on the morning of the O.K. Corral gunfight, we're primed for action . . . or at least, we're primed for the build-up leading to the incipient gunfight. But, NO! -- we tumble back all the way to the Civil War era, in which a teenage Wyatt Earp tries to run away from his home to go join his older brothers in the fight. A forceful Gene Hackman as the patriarch nips this in the bud, and furnishes frontier-spun mottoes to the precocious youth that are supposed to explain Wyatt's conduct and personality later in the film. The movie meanders on. We see Wyatt as a young man driving stagecoaches. He travels all around the West, but is saving his heart for a genteel lady back in Missouri. We see him court the young lady. (For 10-15 minutes.) He marries the young lady. Who, by the way, we know from the get-go is going to drop dead. Finally she does, followed by Wyatt going on a tear as an alcoholic horse-thief. We await for someone to bail him out of jail (after all, how can be in Arizona 15 years later if he's going to get hung in Arkansas?); someone does. We're not done. A somewhat surlier Wyatt spends some time as a buffalo-hunter in Kansas, hiring the Masterson brothers as skinners. We sit watching all this numbly, waiting for him to finally get deputized in Dodge. Finally, he does. After which, Kevin Costner's mullet gets trimmed and petroleum jelly is applied atop his head. Uh, we're still not in Arizona, yet. We watch Wyatt keep the peace in Dodge for a while. He calls Bill Pullman's Ed Masterson "affable" several times (this is meant to be an insult). Wyatt's brothers, or some of them anyway, show up with their wives, who resent his high-handed manner and his insistence on moving them all to Tombstone, Arizona with the intention of striking it rich on mining claims. We MUST be getting close to the action, because the characters are talking about Tombstone, but . . . nope, we have to wait till Wyatt is fired by the Dodge City fathers for his head-bashing tactics, which impels him to work as a U.S. Marshall for awhile, the purpose of which is to enable him to meet Doc Holliday (a splendid, emaciated Dennis Quaid) for the first time. The latter, when speaking to Wyatt, ends each of his sentences with "Wyatt Earp?" -- as in, "Do you believe in friendship, Wyatt Earp?" or even "How are your teeth, Wyatt Earp?" This goes on for 5 minutes or so.Cut, cut. Take out the red pen and swiftly slash lines through all the preceding material. If you're going to tell the Tombstone episode of Wyatt Earp's life, then we don't CARE about any of that other stuff. We don't CARE why Wyatt is the way he is; we'll accept his legend at face value, for God's sake. Sheesh! If you want to tell a story about Young Wyatt Earp, Old Wyatt Earp, or some other aspect of Wyatt Earp, then tell that story. Compare how Cosmatos handled this material in his *Tombstone*: after introducing us to the principal villains, we see the Earp brothers step off the train in Tombstone. See? Simple! I mean, Kasdan tries to make the most out of all the unnecessary material -- that introduction scene, for example, between Costner and Quaid IS kind of funny -- but you just can't cram a mini-series into a 3-hour movie. If we're doing the Tombstone stuff, then get to the damn point, already. As it is now, the movie has wasted so much time with irrelevancies that there's little space left to show why the Earps and Clantons are heading for a showdown in the first place. Wyatt's girlfriend Josie pleads, "Why? I don't understand it!" Neither do we. The movie can only come to rickety halt with an unexciting final shootout in the desert, followed by a tacked-on denouement on a cruise ship.Finally, Kasdan is not helped any by Kevin Costner. As the young Wyatt, Costner unconvincingly portrays him as a slightly retarded rube. And once the petroleum jelly makes its appearance, Costner falls back onto his Surly Mode: grumpy, expressionless, tending toward psychosis. He's always saying things like, "For two years I've been in a bad mood", or "I'm not in the mood", or "I don't care anymore", or "I'm Wyatt Earp -- it all ends now!" Jeez, what a dour hero. Compare this with Kurt Russell's take on the man: a genial guy looking for a good time, tempered into toughness by the lawlessness of the Old West, but still able to smile. Costner's stern Puritan interpretation belies much of what we see Wyatt actually doing, such as dealing faro in saloons in which he owns a quarter-interest, or sharing his bed with former prostitutes and traveling showgirls. His performance is all wrong for such a man. I, for one, couldn't care less about this sourpuss.3 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long let his legend be told. Worthwhile western epic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Lawrence Kasdan gives us three hours of wild west adventure, rugged romance and plenty of gunfire. An almost excellent script from Kasden and Dan Gordon that is put to the test by a talented ensemble cast. The life and legend of Earp and his family proves very interesting, although taking a back seat to the film TOMBSTONE.Kevin Coster does a good job as the famed lawman, but seems a little less powerful compared to the image of Earp in our minds. Dennis Quaid gives us a different slant on Doc Holiday. One of his better roles. Other fine performances are logged in by Mark Harmon, Catherine O'Hara, Gene Hackman, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Tea Leoni, Martin Kove and Joanna Going.Maybe a half hour too long, but this movie is more than your average western. Relax and enjoy a very good version of the life of Wyatt Earp.</fullReview>

There are so many shoot-outs, so many relationships between an assortment of gun-fighters and their women friends (usually referred to by well known descriptive words) that after about an hour we lose track and could care less.By the time the second DVD disc was in, my spouse was ordering me to hit fast-forward and I readily concurred.

		<shortDescription>Not OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Tombstone was released a few months earlier, it was shorter and more action packed. It was also a better film.Wyatt Earp clocking in at over three hours is too long. It marked the beginning of Costner's decline at the box office. The audience frankly had enough of his epic and half baked films.Wyatt Earp wants to be a thoughtful ambitious biopic. It emerges as dull, bloated, uneven and about as truthful as many other pictures of this famous lawman with added overbearing score by James Newton Howard.Kevin Costner looks uneasy playing the younger Wyatt as an overgrown boy scout getting daily lectures on the importance of family by dad, Gene Hackman.After the sudden death of his first wife, what gradually emerges is a cold hard man who enforces the law his way, that way being by the barrel of the gun with his brothers as fellow enforcers.Director Lawrence Kasdan is shackled by Costner wanting to be the star of the show. The actors playing the brothers Earp do not get much of a look in as they are in the shadows of Costner, their wives come across more forcefully as they stand up to Wyatt for putting their husbands in danger. Rightly so, they all get shot and a few of them die.Even Dennis Quaid who lost weight to play Doc Holliday is underused and to me was largely a cameo. I can see why Val Kilmer overshadowed him in the rival Tombstone.The film is simply not compelling enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to Tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just say this to get it out of the way. This movie is inferior to Tombstone.We rented this on Blu-ray thinking it would be a masterful classic, one that we would love so much that we would eventually have go out and buy it.It was clear in the first five minutes that the movie was trying way too hard. For example, the score was maddening. Every single sequence (no matter how utterly insignificant) had dramatic orchestral background music over and over and over without a break. You know, a decent movie doesn't need an orchestra constantly playing to keep the viewers attention. This reminded me of the old silent movies where someone played a piano live in the theater throughout the film to help dramatize the silent events on the screen. It did not help this film, trust me.Secondly, you are constantly teased with the end of the movie, only to find out that you have to endure more and more face time with Costner. By the end of the movie you are more or less sick and tired of looking at him.I was sorely disappointed in the Doc Holiday and Kate characters. uninteresting, unlikable, contrived and again, the acting seemed noticeably forced.This movie felt extremely long-winded and more a statement of Costner's ego than an entertaining reproduction of historical importance. It was really hard to sit through this whole thing and all four of us kept laughing about how it should go ahead and end for God's sake.Tombstone, by comparison, was very tight, entertaining and generally interesting with much better acting and vastly more interesting characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially good film, mishandled by the director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of the most popular figures of the mystical Old West, Wyatt Earp has been dramatised a countless number of times on the big screen and on television. His notoriety as a no-nonsense lawman, his friendship with the drunken and dying Doc Holliday, and his participation in the legendary gunfight at the O.K. Corrall, has made him the stuff of legend. Of all the portraits, this 1994 epic, directed by Lawrence Kasdan is possibly the most accurate and detailed, following Earp's childhood amongst his many siblings, through to his old age heading to strike lucky during the Gold Rush. It's just a pity that for all it's trying and accuracy, the film isn't at all very good.The film begins on the Earp farm where the young Wyatt is taught the words of wisdom by his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) - 'blood is thicker than water' - which stays with Wyatt throughout his life. It's clear that his family are important, and he and his brothers are soon grown up and are making a living out on their own. Wyatt is refereeing bare-knuckle boxing matches and is soon making enemies. He romances an old flame who dies tragically, causing the recently-married Wyatt to lose his ways and becomes a drunkard, stealing from good Samaritans who offer him food and shelter. After a visit from his father in prison, he changes his ways and finds himself appointed Deputy Marshal in Wichita, after bravely shooting down a violent drunk when the cowardly sheriff watches. As his reputation as a good lawman grows, he is offered a job in Dodge City along with his brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen) and Morgan (Linden Ashby), where his reputation starts to take a turn for the worse.After the huge success of Dances With Wolves, this film seems to take a similar approach - epic, sweeping storytelling as opposed to the more action-packed angle usually taken when filming an Earp biography. Yet the majority of the film is handled with such a ham-fisted and amateurish approach by Kasdan that the film is nowhere as good as it should be. Kasdan, whose films have mainly consisted of Kevin Kline vehicles, had directed a very young Costner before in a western in the very enjoyable Silverado. It's a strange performance by Costner, who in the first half seems to be sleepwalking his way through his role, delivering his lines like a nervous primary school kid finding himself cast in the lead role. The second half, when he becomes the more Republican, violent Earp, is very good. He can do brooding very well, and even though Wyatt Earp is portrayed as a complete bastard, with Costner playing him he remains an engaging character.Even with all the star actors on show - Madsen, Hackman, Bill Pullman, Tom Sizemore, Jim Caviezel, Jeff Fahey, Isabella Rossellini, Catherine O'Hara, and the excellent Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday, the film does begin to drag. I almost feel bad saying that, as I have a lot of respect for a director when he takes his time to develop a good story and fully- realised characters, and clocking up a long-running time. But around the 2 hour 30 mark, I found myself wanting the film to end. After the infamous O.K. Corral gunfight (which is refreshingly low-key), the film carries on for another 40 minutes as Earp begins his vendetta against the 'cowboy' gang. In a better directors hands, the last segment could have been a way to portray Earp's fall from grace and his descent into blind blood-lust. But instead it just becomes a long, drawn-out manhunt.Perhaps I'm being harsh, but I feel this was a missed opportunity. Personally, the definitive Wyatt Earp film is John Ford's magnificent My Darling Clementine, and although it may not have the historical accuracy of this, it is a typically mystical, moving, and surprisingly dark masterpiece, featuring a great Henry Fonda performance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp - Quiet Burp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just viewed this movie on the History Channel and the commercials were somewhat better than the movie. I couldn't wait for the breaks, but I kept on watching it anyway. That should tell you something. Perhaps I am a glutton for punishment.You cannot rate this film as great, but it is rather interesting and intriguing. Rather than calling it an historical adult western, I would attach to it the description of dark, drawn-out,"Dancing with Wolves" type of Western. I will not say, as others have, that the film is boring. It can only be boring if you haven't had enough sleep. The film has much going for it, i.e., good acting (esp. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday), action, excellent photography, and philosophical dialog...probably too much of the latter.The one memorable moment, that I can recall, is when young Wyatt (with his companion riding "shotgun", is driving a wagon at break-neck speed, trying to outrun a band of outlaws. As in real life, it is almost impossible to shoot a man off a galloping horse from a moving wagon, unless you happen to be an Annie Oakley. Wyatt, shouts to his companion something to the effect, "For crying out loud, shoot the lead horse. You can shoot a horse, can't you!" He does shoot the horse, and the chase abruptly ends. Think of all those old movies where the wagon or stage coach goes over the cliff when all you had to do was shoot the outlaws' horses...easy targets.At any rate, all that was going through my mind during this entire movie was the the theme song from the 1950's Wyatt Earp TV series starring Hugh Obrien:Wyatt Earp, Wyatt Earp,Brave courageous and bold...Long live his name and long live his gloryAnd long may his story be told.Marvin Cohn</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of.Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all.The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable.Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp.No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that.Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining at times, but couldn't be more inaccurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Tombstone and every other movie ever made about Wyatt Earp and the OK Corral shootout, this movie is basically made up fiction. I simply can't understand why someone doesn't just make a movie about this incident and this man's life based on what really happened. It's MUCH more exciting than this silly movie attempted to portray.First, there are too many historical/factual inaccuracies as well as geographical ones. I'm sure it's expensive to film a movie in the exact location or to move the sets around the country to accurately portray the locations. However, showing mountains in the background in Kansas, Illinois or Iowa is just silly. Either make the movie in the right place or make sure the camera isn't focusing on a mountain range behind a corn field where it couldn't possibly exist.The guns used at the beginning of the movie are not from the correct time period, nor are the holsters. How can simple things like that be overlooked? Why not just show them shooting Uzis or Glocks? Sheriff White was shown as an old man in Tombstone in 1881. In Tombstone, the actor (Harry Caray, Jr.) was even older. However, when Fred White was shot and killed by Curly Bill Brocius, he was only 31. These things can be found in the very available census records from 1880. There is simply no excuse to have people so incorrectly aged. Even Wyatt was only 32 in 1881. Kevin Costner could no more pass for 32 in that movie than having Sam Elliott play Virgil Earp in Tombstone, who was only 36 at the time! The shootout occurred on 10/26/1881. In the movie, Virgil and Morgan were shot on the same night and apparently right after the shootout. However, Virgil was actually shot (and in the left arm, not the right) in December of 1881. Morgan was shot and killed in March of 1882...almost five months after the OK Corral shootout and three months after Virgil. Why couldn't they show those simple things correctly? Just stupid! Josie was living with John Behan and even was taking care of his son. The story of her interaction between John Behan and Wyatt was disjointed and didn't make much sense. Instead of spending so much time on Wyatt's childhood, the movie (in my humble opinion) should have focused on his adulthood and taken the time to be at lease somewhat accurate.Why not show the Bat Masterson was in Tombstone too with the Earps and Holliday? Seems like that would have made sense.Anyway, this movie is only loosely based on reality and should be watched and enjoyed accordingly. To watch and think this is how it really happened is a joke. To read a good book about how things actually went, including the subsequent trial that is almost nonexistent in the movie, read "Murder in Tombstone" by Steven Lubet!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essential Western Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp if nothing else is the Western of all Westerns. It's epically enormous and tells a story of a man that could only be fiction and yet was a real person. There isn't anything that a lover of Westerns won't find in this film. It has absolutely everything. It is a very, very long film. It was originally meant to be a whopping six hours so thank goodness it was cut to only three. Without a doubt I think this is director Lawrence Kasdan's best work although he did work on another Kevin Costner vehicle that was very good, The Bodyguard.Costner plays the lead role of Wyatt Earp. Now one thing is for sure Kevin Costner is an acquired taste. No matter what he's a commanding presence on screen and his portrayal of tough as nails, take no prisoners Wyatt Earp is awesome!! Sure sometimes he is a little dry in his acting but he has a quiet intensity that makes his roles so watchable. He goes from loving husband to grieving, to drunk, to Marshall, to protector, to the executioner flawlessly and seamlessly. The supporting cast of this film is incredible and too numerous to mention everyone. They have such an incredible ensemble cast and everyone adds to it in different ways. Gene Hackman makes a cameo as Wyatt's father, Michael Madsen as his brother, Catherine O'Hara as his sister-in-law (Madsen's wife), Bill Pullman as Ed Masterson, Isabella Rossellini as Doc Holliday's woman, Tom Sizemore as Bat Masterson, Adam Baldwin, Téa Leoni, Jeff Fahey...and I could go on. The film is a virtual who's who of Hollywood A and B movie actors who come together like I've never seen on screen. It's just fun picking out who you recognize as most of them are done up to an almost unrecognizable state with era costumes and set. However the two performances most noted were Costner and the amazing Dennis Quaid who plays the ill fated Doc Holliday. I did feel that they didn't really establish the friendship as much as they could have between Earp and Holliday but nonetheless Quaid's performance was the best in the film and Oscar worthy. A cold blooded killer, dying of consumption and dedicated to his friend. He's barely recognizable, even his voice is different and he's the perfect choice.Wyatt Earp's most brilliant part is the entire setting including costumes, locations, and capturing the entire era of any era it displays. The dusty, dark, gritty world of the old west to the plains of Arizona to the Alaskan coast in the end. It's a visual masterpiece. The costumes are spot on and brilliant. I think Costner has a real love for the western and you can see his passion in this film. As producer he likely had a big hand in it's creation and it shows. I think Costner is a worthy Hollywood star and I've always liked him and this is one of the great films he has done. Any fans of Westerns MUST see Wyatt Earp because although made in the nineties it's the essential western epic and brilliantly done just a little long, that's all. Can't beat the content or performances and familiar faces. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How long was this movie? 10, 15, 30 hours? I felt like it was Wyatt Earp's life in real time. How could so many great actors (not Costner who is the consummate bad actor- the Ryan O'Neal of our time) deliver such putrid performances? Apparently members of the cast were vying to play characters who would get killed early on in the movie, just so by comparison, their lifeless bodies would give a better performance than those actors forced to play characters who were alive. And Costner as a teenage Earp? He sounded like Marty McFly's kid with that horrible forced squeak in his voice. Lawrence Kasdan- how could you allow your name on this POS? Don't even mention the film Tombstone in the same sentence. By comparison, Tombstone is Casablanca, Gone With the Wind and Citizen Kane rolled into one. Costner's Wyatt Earp is the George W. Bush of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp vs Tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both of these movies are about the same time, came out the same time, are about the same guys. And I enjoyed both of them. But Wyatt Erp can be tough to sit through. It's an Epic length film and it's paced that way. Both Costner and Russell play Wyatt as the Pistol Whippin' Sonovabitch that he was. But it's hard to accept Kurt mustache even though its real. And as good as Quade's Doc is Kilmer's is that much better. So it kind of balances out. So if you need epic length, my advice it take the beginning of Wyatt Earp, up until they head out West, and tack it on the front of Tombstone. Best of both worlds! It may be tough to see Costner turn into Russell, but you can put Earp's getting shorter and meaner down to getting older. And you'll get to see Quade turn into Kilmer! You can just put his getting skinnier and crazier down to the booze and the tuberculosis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly under-rated and worthwhile western epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an owner of the Wyatt Earp extended Director's edition I can tell you that I thought the film was neither too long or too slow as some "attention-span-deficient" critics have labled it. Admittedly, I have seen shorter movies and movies with more wall to wall action, but I am patient enough to enjoy the slow enveloping experience of a Tarkovsky film. When this film came out, I couldn't convince anyone to see it with me, so I had to go alone. I was blown away by the cast, the performances, the writing and the movie. The cast was terrific. Even bit characters are well-known actors in this film. Gene Hackman was his superb self as Wyatt's stern but loving father. The film didn't skip over significant elements in Wyatt's life like most of the filmed versions do. His transformation from a young adventure-seeking farmer's son to a fearless and feared lawman is believable and compelling. The cinematography was fantastic and was deservedly written up in an issue of American Cinematographer magazine. On a side note, I think this film works well as an allegory to current events. The United States is represented by Wyatt and the "Wild West" is the world. Like the U.N., Ed Masterson tries to get Wyatt to become less strict and hard-nosed in the application of law. Ed gets killed because he is "too affable". Like France and Russia, the corrupt sheriff Johnny Behan (Mark Harmon) tries to get Wyatt to sell out, because there is "enough money for everybody" if he just looks the other way. Wyatt is too rigidly principled for either of these two men but retains his dignity and honor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Costner and Kasdan come together to make another bad Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week ? Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits.One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable.As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise.In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone.So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.</fullReview>

While it is interesting to review the early life of Wyatt, it doesn't contribute one thing to the picture that the average movie goer would care to spend time and money on. The savior of this film is Dennis Quaid, who did a magnificent job as "Doc" Holliday. I will give the film credit, too, for having the guts to reduce Johnny Ringo to the insignificant character that he actually was in real life. It's too bad the writer didn't put his death and the death of Curly Bill Brocius into the right settings and contexts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicholas Earp (Gene Hackman) is the patriarch of the family. To him, only blood matters and everybody else is just a stranger. The family including Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) goes out west after the end of the civil war. Years later, he goes back to Missouri and marries Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). When she dies, he is depressed and aimlessly roams the country. Eventually it culminates into the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral with Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid).Kevin Costner is fine as a younger Wyatt still searching for a direction. He's not so great as the drunken mess. Later he's OK as the lawman. He has the righteousness but not necessarily the gravitas. It's asking a lot to play this wide range for anybody.The biggest problem is the general long winding life story. This is long, epic, and very long. It's like a biopic from a historian. It is too rambling and unfocused. Director Lawrence Kasdan does a good job filming the movie but this long biopic will always have problems. It's too rambling to create much tension or pick up any pacing. It's just overly ambitious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The timing of this version of the venerable saga was highly disadvantageous, its release being so very close to "the other Wyatt Earp," Tombstone. That said, it's a completely different movie. While "Tombstone" relied on more dramatic license and cinematic bombast, this one was far more historically accurate, right down to the decidedly period dialog. However, it was far too long for most viewers, with a pace that left much to be desired, suffering more from its extended length than any other issue with the film itself. The acting was good, with Costner his typically unemotional self. However, his supporting cast was especially good, particularly in the case of the Earp Women. Dennis Quaid was excellent, in a stunning transformation over his usual roles. Once again, his version will be certainly be compared to the superb Val Kilmer, but once again, in terms of history, one would have to describe it as more accurate. Again, a drastic editing would have made this a far better overall film experience.</fullReview>

The films were made at the same time, and comparisons are just impossible to avoid. Wyatt Earp is a more ambitious film, and it clearly looks to pay more attention to real historical accounts, In the end however, it just isn't paced that well, and it lacks the action that Tombstone delivers consistently.Kevin Costner is quite good as Wyatt Earp. The Earp we see in this film is made out to be righteous as a younger man, then jaded and morally ambiguous once his first wife dies tragically. So much of Earp's life is attempted to be recreated by this film. Trouble is, there are not enough definitive historical accounts of some of these periods of Earp's life to substantiate some of what we see. The events told to us in Tombstone make up only about the third act of this film. Before these events, we see Earp work as a boxing referee, a stagecoach driver, a buffalo hunter, and a card dealer. Also, there is a stint in his early life when he attempts to earn a law degree. Unless you are a true Wyatt Earp historian, a lot of it won't seem all that necessary. As the years pass, we meet Earp's brothers, their wives, and other famous lawmen like Bat and Ed Masterson. The cast is uniformly excellent, and there is not a bad performance in the film. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday deserves special mention because the performance might well be Quaid's best. He reportedly lost nearly 40 lbs to portray the diseased gunfighter. As good as Kilmer was in Tombstone, Quaid just might be better in this film.Most of the film deals with what made Earp famous. That being his various turns as lawman in such towns as Wichita, Dodge City, and Tombstone. Earp is quick to bash a suspect over the head with his pistol, and he always seems to be on the winning end of a gunfight. Eventually, Earp meets Josephine, an actress with whom he will spend nearly fifty years of his life. Their relationship is handled tenderly and honestly. Other than his love for Josephine and his family, Earp is a morally ambiguous man. That is the idea within the script, anyway.Lawrence Kasdan does a very good job as director. The sets look authentic, and so do the actors. The movie bombed out badly in theaters, though. Perhaps word quickly got out about how long it was and that scared people off. Or maybe they all saw Tombstone first, and it quenched their thirst for a good western. Wyatt Earp, as well as being too long, is hurt by a terrible ending on a boat. Were they trying to channel Heaven's Gate with an inappropriate ending on a boat??? Fear not, this film is infinitely better than that one. However, Wyatt Earp is a reminder of what we learned with Heaven's Gate. A western is not a good genre of film for introspection or revision. Western audiences often expect more action than character development. The verdict: Give this film a chance, but pack you attention span. It's a long one! 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp Vs Tombstone - An unfair comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched back to back these two movies and ranked both an 8. Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman Etal made me feel that their movie was closer to history and also brought pride in their perceived honor. The chronicle from childhood to the 20th Century felt complete. BUT Then came Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer, Sam Elliott and Powers Boothe (Deadwood 93) etal and left me entertained to the ninth degree. The sheer pace of this one leaves you breathless. These movies should be seen back to back and not compared as they tell two different stories occurring at the same time and place. Costner as Wyatt was more believable But Russell's Earp was more fun. Quaid was Doc Holiday but Kilmer had a holiday with the role. I will concede that Sam Elliott made Virgil his and nobody is going to take it away. Rent or buy both movies as it a worthwhile investment of your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven but unapologetic biopic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been tons of westerns about the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday saga. The critics are right. The movie is long, and at times boring. Sometimes, I don't think that Kevin Costner is a great actor, but then in other scenes he's is surprisingly good. The movie is a patently machoistic movie about revenge. With these criticisms aside, I have to say the movie was more honest than most of the John Wayne westerns. Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday were admirable, but not likable. Wyatt Earp was a mean man in many ways. His father was a down-to-Earth man (played by Gene Hackman), who brought Wyatt up with a strict sense of morality. The elder Earp taught his son that family is everything, that when you make up your mind about something you have to do it all the way, and that once you go down the road of the bottle and a life of crime the only way out is your death. Wyatt goes towards a life of crime after the death of his wife. His father rescues him and says go out West if you want to not be hanged. Wyatt goes out West, and becomes the famous lawman. He is not nice. He uses a prostitute for sex, but then cruelly discards her when he falls for another woman. He gets his deputies behind him, but they almost all die violent deaths. When a Clanton family gets in a feud with Wyatt, Wyatt goes ballistic when they kill his brother (one of his deputies). In his feuds, he becomes an outlaw by those who don't like his violent approach towards criminals. The West is becoming a land of laws. Ironically, Wyatt helped change the West into a place of laws. Dennis Quaid plays Doc Holliday. Doc Holliday was once a dentist. He only lived to Age 36. Quaid gives a great portrayal as a terminally ill, alcoholic man, who has great character and charm, but has no friends in the World left (due to his lifestyle). You see in Quaid's portrayal a man dying, but yet still being a brilliant gunfighter. In the end, the Clanton family is nearly wiped out. Instead of feeling good about it, you don't find anything to admire. I have to admit that this movie did show the Old West as a tough place. You are left with an anti-heroic impression of the lawmen. You don't like them that much, other than that they are the law. People were lucky to find work in those days. Many westerns don't focus at all on the "boom" and "bust" cycle of the West, and how people were looking for ways to earn a living (all the time). The life was hard and violent. The West was hardly romantic. In addition, you see the evolution of the West. The West didn't stay the same. It was changing throughout the movie. For that I say, while not a great movie, it was an honest, unique portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly long and far too short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw "Wyatt Earp" in the theatre upon its release, I thought it a bit too long; having seen it again several times on video and DVD, most recently today, I find "Wyatt Earp" far too short. Each of the deleted scenes should have been included to preserve the artistic balance of the film, e.g the Arkansas jailing with the Tombstone jailing. Costner, I believe, captures the psychology of Wyatt Earp better than anyone before him. The writing is the first of which I know to set grief as the central motivation of Wyatt's life, leading to a life lived as a "dry drunk". Is this romanticism or good history? I do not believe I am alone in seeing Wyatt as irreparably scarred by Urilla's tragic death and found this film refreshing in this regard. Costner (hardly a favourite of mine) portrays the wounded Wyatt to sad perfection. Of course I prefer Kurt Russell's version, or Hugh O'Brien's, for they are more personable, enjoyable and attractive. Costner's hint of self-righteousness (while living in less than righteous ways) captures something of the real Wyatt Earp who was praised by a Presbyterian minister and charged with pimping. That Costner could successfully portray Wyatt Earp from youth to old age, and do so with such conviction, redounds to his praise as an actor. Quaid deserved an Oscar nomination; Madsen has never been better; Going glows. Story-telling makes for inaccuracies; this is not a documentary. Yet I do wish that some computer whiz could replace the clothing and holsters in this movie with the superbly perfectly accurate ones of "Tombstone".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This epic and beautifully shot western is one of Costner's best films.Following the life of legendary law man Wyatt Earp, this very underrated movie pictures the 'real' man with the 'legend' and gives viewers' a chance to decide for themselves what type of man Earp really was. Costner's performance as the law man is superb. Through the innocence of youth to a moody old man, he fits the role perfectly and proves he is better than Kurt Russell's Earp in 'Tombstone'. The shoot-outs are superb and there is fantastic support from Dennis Quaid as the ill Doc Holliday, as well as Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman. Although a tad long and the the fact that there seems to be no dirt anywhere in this film, I urge you to check this out.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like what has been said before, this movie shouldn't be compared too much to Tombstone, since they carried different story angles. I do, however, think that Costner was more what I have imagined Earp as than Russell was. I've always imagined him as somewhat quiet, and less prone to outburst, but what do I know?The plot carried over very well and pulled at your emotions with real gut-wrenching scenes. The tension between the Earps and the Clantons was very well depicted. You got the whole picture of what went on in the life of the legendary MarshallKilmer vs. Quaid for Doc Holliday? Both were effectively symptomatic of tuberculosis, which symptoms mean more to you? Pale fever and a cold sweat (Kilmer), or just the rapid weight loss (Quaid)? Also, I don't think anyone can't really determine what kind of demeanor was right for the Doc, so I can't say which of the two actors were more inline there. Quaid was great and scored big in playing outside himself, but I have to go with Kilmer who managed the same, and consistently stole scenes with his "cool cat" portayal.As good an historical epic has ever been done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent - not your typical Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a fan of the Western genre, but I found myself enjoying this one. This is not your typical Hollywood Western. It cuts out pretty much every romantic vision of the American west that Hollywood has ever portrayed and just presents a fascinating bare bones account of one of the frontier's greatest heroes. Rather than focusing totally on the OK Corral, there is an emphasis on the events prior to Tombstone that molded Wyatt Earp.This is one of the few Western movies I've seen where you get a feel for how it actually might have been to live in that time. Instead of the usual Hollywood fluff, you get something much different. There are still scenes with stagecoaches and saloons, but they don't seem as romanticized as in other Westerns. And you also get other non-Hollywood visions of the West, such as scenes with buffalo being slaughtered and skinned.Wyatt Earp himself is portrayed as a very powerful individual who, while fighting on the side of the law, could also be cold-hearted, cruel, and excessively violent at times. Attributes necessary for survival as a lawman.Costner is fantastic as Wyatt Earp, with one minor complaint. He's got the attitude, posture and look down pat. It's just that I think his voice is a bit too nasally to carry the power that Wyatt Earp must have had whenever he spoke. As for the other actors, they are all outstanding with Dennis Quaid in particular turning in a great performance as Doc Halladay.A lot of people have commented on this movie and Tombstone. Personally, I enjoyed both, but the difference is that when I watch Tombstone, I feel like I just watched an entertaining story, whereas when I watch Wyatt Earp I feel like I just saw a piece of history. Overall, an excellent and very under-appreciated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>here's a tip, if your going to comment on this, research the topic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say that i will be the first person to step up and defend Kevin Costner. With movies like The Untouchables, Dances With Wolves, and Field of Dreams, this guy has proven himself several times over. Just because someone in Hollywood has the guts to do movies that HE wants to do, regardless of their potential at the box office, we shouldn't slanderize this guy every chance we get. People say Costner has taken a big turn for the worse lately, but i liked Waterworld and most recently, Thirteen Days. I would also like to say that i dont' see any of you people who criticize this guy so much makin movies. With that said i would also like to say that i love Tombstone, and bought it right after i saw it the first time. With two movies coming out about the same true story back to back, and with the first release (Tombstone) being such a big success, comparisons are inevitable. But these movies aren't really based on the exact same events. Tombstone is about, just that, Tombstone and what the Earps did there and immediatly after. Wyatt Earp isn't about the Earps, it's about WYATT EARP, hence the tittle. Aside from that, the movies are totaly different. First of all Tombstone, good as it was, is almost a work of fiction. I loved Kurt Russel and Val Kilmer as the movie's center pieces, Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday respectively. The fact is however, Russel plays a very emotionally open person. Costner plays him as a quiet, almost cold person. Now, alot of people who have made comments about this movie have criticized Costner for that.(Big surprise.) But, you can't blame Costner for this because Wyatt Earp is not a fictional character, he was a flesh and blood human like you, and most importantly, Costner plays Earp much more realisticly. Then there is the much debated arguement over who plays a better Doc Holliday, Val Kilmer in Tombstone, or Dennis Quaid in Wyatt Earp. Well, here's the thing, if you mean who played Doc closer to reality....then the undisputed winner is Quaid. But if you mean who is more enjoyable, well that's a matter of opinion. But before i move on i got a bone to pick with somebody who said Tombstone was much better because Russel played the kind of Earp that "we imagine". Look lady, you can have whatever ridiculous ideas about the way past events took place all you want....but don't ever bring me into your childish little dream world by generalizing your opinions by saying what "we imagine". When it comes to this i don't imagine anything, i actually got the facts. Now i don't want to sound like a know-it-all, because i hate those people, but, as i said in my summary, if your going to comment on this movie, research the topic, or at least now the facts. Then this same man or woman who tells me what i imagine poeple as goes on to say she imagines Doc Holliday as a "sly and witty sort of character the way Kilmer played him" Well that is fabulous, but the fact is that Doc, who was a witty person was witty in the way Dennis Quaid portrays him. For example in a conflict a drunk Ike Clanton tells Holliday that Holliday's day is comin. Doc responds by saying, "My mama always said never put off 'til tomorrow the people you can kill today." Then also in the list of comments for this movie is some total moron who said Quaid is at his worst on this movie. Anybody care what that guy thinks? I didn't think so. In closing Wyatt Earp is a realistic and enjoyable accounts of the life of one of the most compelling characters of the old west.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provocative Biopic On Legendary The Legendary Gunslinger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the old West one of the most heavily milked upon subject that every fan of Western history will always spring into mind was the event that happened on October 26, 1881, that was the infamous showdown at the O.K. Corral located in Tombstone, Arizona. For many years, filmmakers have been making adaptations and documentaries about this fearsome battle that if you've seen enough of these, it's very hard for you to forget about. In 1993 and 1994, two movies spawned upon this topic came out one after the other that were pretty high in terms of budget. Those two film were "Tombstone" from 1993 and "Wyatt Earp" from 1994. In a sheer twist of irony, both films were being made pretty much simultaneously and nearing butting heads around the same locations. And while George Cosmatos' "Tombstone" emphasized on the epic gunfight itself, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" concentrated on the main character of "Wyatt Earp". From his humble beginnings to his deadly showdown and everything else in between Kasdan left nothing out. In 1993, "Tombstone" received a substantial amount of praise and well-deserved accolades and was opened more to big box office success. Warner Brothers had to stall "Wyatt Earp" from its release months later as to avoid from being on a competitive level with "Tombstone". When "Wyatt Earp" was released in June of 1994, it still had the warm reception it had like "Tombstone", but the box office had a lower impact. My guess was that it came out too soon and people were still buzzing about "Tombstone" and just weren't freshening up to this more character driven film. And though it remains the kid brother to "Tombstone", it still doesn't mean this movie was terrible. In fact for a biopic, it is a very engaging film that deserves the humble credit it had. For a movie that crawls over the three hour hurdle, this movie literally chronicles Wyatt Earp from his childhood era as he wanted to free himself from his family life to move onto bigger and better things. We watch as he was vital in the building of the famous transcontinental railway lines even down to his personal life from the loss of his first wife his alcoholic phase from becoming an outlaw to throwing his evil ways away to becoming a lawman which eventually led him and his brothers to the big shooting party at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona. One of the idiosyncrasies that makes this film special was that Kasdan and co-writer Dan Gordon really put a lot of thought and a lot of care for the material and there's never a dull scene and the narrative remains at a steady pace throughout. The performances were really accurate in it portrayals. Kevin Costner who at the time seemed like an aficionado in the Western genre was the perfect casting choice for the role of the titular character. He just felt his comfort zone in this very complex role. Though Costner carries the heavy cargo in this role doesn't mean that the supporting characters were insignificant. Round out the cast Dennis Quaid was equally riveting as another will known lawman named Doc Holiday. He even molded himself to lose 30 lbs. to look like a sickly man who has tuberculosis. Other well known performers include Michael Madsen as Wyatt's brother Virgil, Gene Hackman as his father Nicholas, Mark Harmon as lawman Johnny Behan, Catherine O'Hara as Allie, Bill Pullman as deputy Ed Masterson, Tom Sizemore as his brother Bat and Isabella Rosselini as a hooker named Big Nose Kate. In spite of this electrifying cast Kasdan ensures that no one gets usurped and no one is left out. The cinematography by Oscar nominee Owen Roizman stands out very well too. Roizman manages to make the landscapes look and feel quite authentic. If I was to say there was a weakness, it would have to be the length of this film. I'm not going to whine about the length, but even for a patient man, this film can be quite long and not very comfortable on the buttocks either. My advice, bring a soft cushion to watch this film, it is that long. After all's said and done, "Wyatt Earp" succeeds in being epic and provocative and very rich in both action and character. It displays a crew that enjoyed their work and the heart put into it. The characters were rich and the acting was superb. Sure it was lengthy, but it will still tug at your heartstrings. It's not better than "Tombstone", but equally captivating.</fullReview>

It could easily have been cut down to two hours, and been tighter, punchier and just as character-centric.I am not a fan of Kevin Costner, and this movie didn't help that impression.

		<shortDescription>"Nothing counts as much as blood. The rest are just strangers".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll get on a kick every now and then, and currently it's Wyatt Earp and the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Having just watched "Tombstone" and "Wyatt Earp" about a week apart, the comparisons between the two films are inevitable. Both pictures do a fairly credible job of putting the gunfight in context with the relationship of the Earp's and the Cowboys. So if you don't mind the additional hour tagged on by the inclusion of Wyatt's back story, the latter film might be your cup of tea. Now I don't mind a three hour plus film if it's going to hold my interest all the way through. But let's face it, with a finale like the OK Corral, the sooner you get to the action the better.In approach, the Kasdan directed version here is what I'd consider the sanitized version of the Earps once they arrived in Tombstone. In most respects, the Earps are the good guys, and the Cowboys are the bad guys. For my money, the "Tombstone" take on the Earp reputation was closer to historical fact, that is, they were opportunists who ran the city about as close to a protection racket as you could get. They were involved in gambling and prostitution in addition to their mining interests, and Wyatt's ambition to replace Johnny Behan as Sheriff of Cochise County was also based largely on monetary consideration.Moving the comparison of the two pictures to the principal players, there again it appears that "Tombstone" was better cast. I'll take Kurt Russell over Costner's underplayed characterization of the famed lawman. Dennis Quaid acquitted himself real well as Doc Holliday, but you can't beat Val Kilmer's barroom showdown with Johnny Ringo and all the flamboyance that went with it. It seemed like Michael Madsen was never properly introduced as big brother Virgil, and let's face it, he's no Sam Elliott. Maybe if the Coen's or Tarantino were directing he would have stood out more, but I just didn't get a sense of Virgil's presence here. And it was Virgil who was Tombstone's City Marshal at the time. Bill Paxton or Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp - that might be the only toss up. I could probably go right down the line with the supporting players as well, and the "Tombstone" faction takes it going away handily.If I'm going to give the film some kudos, it's going to be with the actual gunfight. The real deal lasted only about thirty seconds with thirty one shots fired between the two factions. Now it's difficult to keep track of movie bullets flying, but in that regard, "Tombstone" overreached with about fifty gunshots that I was able to keep up with. With the benefit of replay, I managed to count off twenty nine shots pretty consistently each time I viewed that scene here. Of course those two shots I missed could just as easily have been there, it was just too difficult for my human ear to detect.So I guess what it comes down to is 'take your pick'. I prefer "Tombstone" but "Wyatt Earp" is still a good modern day Western that should satisfy anyone's passing interest for the Cowboy era and it's principal legend. Better yet, watch them both and then decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Blood counts the most"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having won the battle of the Robin Hoods, Costner wasn't so lucky with Wyatt Earp: forget Waterworld, this is still the biggest box-office disaster of Costner's career, a $63m epic Western that struggled to make $25m at the US box-office yet somehow managed to avoid being nicknamed 'Kevin's Gate' (although it did earn Michael Madsen's unending animosity when the lengthy shoot prevented him from playing Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction). Originally intended as a mini-series and tracing the famed lawman's life from farm boy, freight driver, law student, drunk, horse thief, buffalo hunter to the aftermath of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, it's an ambitious attempt at an American epic with an increasingly unlikeable main character, but it's more of an occasionally ambitious failure than a genuine success.Not nearly as much fun as the rival Tombstone, it's often at its best in the early scenes detailing the side of Earp that the movies previously overlooked as he goes from idealism to bitterness and misogyny following the death of his first wife. Taking its lead from Nicholas Earp's credo that family comes first and "Blood counts the most," Costner's determination not to play likable is admirable, but it casts a dour shadow over a film with increasingly little lightness or humour to break up its bleak view of an embittered man whose only real talent is for violence and make it more palatable. America tends to like its heroes cut and dried, but Costner's Earp is not so much flawed as downright unsympathetic at times ? more of a 70s anti-hero than one who would find favour in the 90s, leaving a cruelly overlooked at Oscar time Dennis Quaid (stunningly good) as Doc Holliday to carry the audience sympathy.Once the film enters more familiar territory with Earp's years as a lawman, the flaws start to become more significant. Even in the extended laser disc directors cut many of the huge supporting cast tend to get lost and forgotten and at times it feels like its treading water, never really going into much detail about the reasons for the feud between the Earps and the Clantons and the McLaurys, while the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral itself is badly staged ? even the 'walk thing' makes Wyatt, Doc and the brothers just look like a bunch of angry Mennonites - and the film loses momentum afterwards, which is surprising considering the aftermath is in many ways far more interesting than the gunfight itself. On a visual level, Kasdan's direction is somewhat disappointing: despite having huge resources at his disposal, there's a striking lack of long shots to take advantage of them that becomes much more noticeable on the small screen than the big, while despite the length there are increasingly few memorable or significant scenes en route to the contentious epilogue. One of the most misconceived endings of the 90s (at least until Costner's The Postman came along), a clumsy flashback-led variation on 'Print the legend' that seems to be arguing that the legend is indeed true, it does the film no favours and probably did much to leave audiences unimpressed.It's a shame, because for all its faults there's much in the film to admire, from some fine supporting performances among the huge cast ? the aforementioned Quaid, horribly gaunt and convincingly tubercular, Gene Hackman, Bill Pullman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Annabeth Gish - and a superb score from James Newton Howard. Perhaps for once a little less ambition and a little more light rather than constant shade would have yielded a more successful result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Wyatt Earp was authentic,I preferred Tombstone,as it portrayed more of the actual violence and pathos in the old west.Kurt Russell did a better job of portraying Wyatt Earp,as Sam Elliot,Powers Boothe,Michael Behin,and especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday.I am a real aficionado of the old west,and Tombstone was one of the best westerns ever made.Kevin Costner just does not seem to grasp the roles he is given and his portrayal of Wyatt Earp was really limp.And Dennis Quaid seemed like he wished he were somewhere else,Gene Hackman should have been in Tombstone,because he was wasted in Wyatt Earp,as was most of the other actors.Even "The Hour Of The Gun" with James Garner was Better,and it was made in 1967.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Bad as ppl say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this show twice and yeah, i agree that it was kinda long and slightly long-winded. However, it was a good movie overall. The acting was quite effective. Kevin Costner did a decent job as Wyatt Earp and did what was necessary to play the legendary lawman. I was especially impressed with Dennis Quaid who played Doc Holliday. I couldn't recognise him at first but realized that he had actually lost 20 lbs to play Doc, and did it brilliantly. I am sure not many can argue on this point. Gene Hackman was also useful as Nicholas Earp. This movie relates more to Wyatt Earp's life compared to Tombstone, which is more on the gunfights and conflict. Thus, it is unfair to compare these two films with each other. To be honest, Wyatt Earp was an interesting movie which deserves more credit than is given. Even if not for the long and rather slow-moving storyline, I'm sure a many out there have to agree that the acting was quite outstanding. Direction was also decent enough. 6/10?? Crap. It deserves at least a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt drinks HOT COFFEE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie opened with a scene of Wyatt Earp drinking what was probably the hottest cup of coffee imaginable! The steam coming off that mug was so thick that you would think that the coffee was 200 degrees! Was coffee hotter back in the old west? Or was it just so cold in Dodge City that the coffee appeared to be hotter? I noticed that Kevin Costner was not exactly drinking that cup in a fast manner. Anyway, onto the movie.This movie was good, great cast. Long movie though. Kevin does westerns very good. It was nice to see him do another epic. I like to get fed when I see a movie. I left this movie feeling as if I were fed. I also liked the killing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1994, at the time of WYATT EARP's release, the big motto, thanks to FORREST GUMP, was 'Stupid is as stupid does'. Both that film and WYATT EARP deal with historical events in different ways and possibly when faced with a choice of movies, the masses went with the masses in terms of cinema choice.Perhaps audiences weren't quite as ready for a second three-hour western after the phenomenal success in 1990 of DANCES WITH WOLVES from Keven Costner and indeed with George P. Cosmatos's TOMBSTONE already in theatres, it seemed perhaps a tall order to expect this film to do as well with THE LION KING and TRUE LIES proving to be big-hitters at the US Box-office.In my view, this is one of the most accomplished westerns ever made and one which is a perfect choice if you want to introduce a friend to the Western genre. I say this from experience as I am not the most ardent fan of it, save for films like THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.The cast is superb. Gene Hackman's early scenes as Judge Earp provide one of the best performances in a supporting role since Marlon Brando in SUPERMAN and the ensemble acting, notably of Mare Winningham and Tea Leoni's brief appearance as Sally, the prostitute who befriends Earp in an early character-defining moment of the film, are standouts.TOMBSTONE admittedly had more action, however although WYATT EARP'S action is more underplayed for a film that covers the life of the famous hero, it is essential to the power of the film and utilises the cinematography to its fullest. James Newton Howard's score provides good atmosphere and is used sparingly at times during the course of the 190 minute running time.A future cult classic of the genre!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The long version of Wyatt Earp is preferrable to the quick shoot em up of Tombstone. We can understand more about Wyatt Earp from boy to man. It makes more sense. Kevin Costner did an Oscar winning performance of Wyatt Earp. All the actors were excellent. Kevin was supposed to do Tombstone but had already commited himself to the Wyatt Earp version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just about the OK Corrall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lengthy biopic about Wyatt Earp, this splendid film tackles the problem of telling the story of an actual man's life, and does it well.People do not live like Hollywood films in that our lives have no plot. Wyatt Earp does have a plot, but it is not the glamorous rocket ride of an action film. We get to see Wyatt Earp not so much as a hero, but as a man. He had virtues. But he had flaws and shortcomings, and they led to pain for himself and others.Earp's life was not limited to his time in Tombstone and the movie reflects that. He was around for quite some time before and after that famous gunfight at the OK Corrall. The makers of this movie appreciate that. And though today we associate him most strongly with that event, it did not define him. Rather, he helped to define it. And his life kept right on trucking after that.Good performances all around, although I did not believe anyone gave the performance of their career.Often this movie is compared to another film, Tombstone. But Wyatt Earp is aptly titled, because it is not only about Tombstone. It covers decades and brings a sweeping sense of time to the picture. It is also quite lovely. Shot with a sense of honesty, sometimes the characters appear quite unfashionable. They appear real, nonetheless, and don't look like they just stepped out of a Vidal Sasson commercial.Overall, a good biography about a man of the times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocrity as Grandiose as All Outdoors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Lawrence Kasdan movie, only more so: more saccharine than "Accidental Tourist," more on-the-nose than "Mumford," more pretentious and overwrought than "Grand Canyon," even more absurdly sentimental than "Dreamcatcher" and "Big Chill" combined, this picture aims at John Ford and hits Joel Schumacher. While making overtures to brutal realism, this film's most constant refrain is a cloy that would have choked Victor Fleming. However, it offers up some of my very favorite movie gunfights, most of them brief and ugly, several of which involve no shooting at all. Much of the violence is sudden and scary, the only convincing element of this muddled Capra-corn-meets-John Milius concoction. But even this attribute is occasionally discarded. "Wyatt Earp" is perhaps the only Western confused enough about its own intentions to present a gritty double homicide, in which gunplay is revealed as a cold and deadly business, back-to-back with a consequence-free getaway from inept bushwhackers, with dozens of bullets exchanged to a rollicking good-time score and nobody hurt but a bad guy's horse. Also in the grand Kasdan tradition, "Wyatt Earp" features a dream cast doing nightmarishly bad work. They are abetted by dialog straight out of Cliff's Notes. Sure, Gene Hackman has phoned in his share of roles, and Dennis Quaid proves time and again ("Dinner with Friends," "Alamo") that you had better keep him on a shorter leash than he is allowed in this uneven performance. But when was Michael Madsen ever this boring, or Tom Sizemore this limp? Kevin Costner trades the earnest Everyman of "Dances with Wolves" for this stilted, one-note simpleton - though, to be fair, he is much more comfortable as the older Wyatt than as the yokel kid. Some of the women buck the trend: Mare Winningham is appropriately tragic, and Joanna Going shows she deserved a better career, if this spunky, oddly nuanced performance is any indication. But Annabeth Gish embarrasses herself further than her limited screen time would seem to make possible, and Catherine O'Hara indicates that some types of genius are not a movable feast.Perhaps the movie's greatest handicap is its travelogue format, the hack director's traditional recourse when attempting an epic. Every third scene is a poorly disguised excuse for exposition. All the big moments feel small, because no flat, mishandled attempt at a glory-note can stand out among so much dull connective tissue. The whole thing feels like a hurry-up production: few of the actors make more than a shallow investigation of the gravity demanded by the melodrama. You can sense the grips hovering just off camera, ready to break into the next set-up. In an unnecessarily cruel note, all this nothing is accompanied by James Newton Howard, conjuring the pale shade of Randy Newman circa "The Natural." The corn is green indeed.Okay, okay. It's not all bad. Madsen and Quaid have their moments, and it would be a lie to say that the exteriors aren't photographed very nicely. Maybe, as touted, it is a more accurate history of this American icon than "My Darling Clementine." But, and I only bring it up because of the inevitable comparison, it is a far inferior piece of work in every way. I like Jeff Fahey, but he's no Walter Brennan. And I'll say it though it goes without saying: Howard Hawks, Kasdan ain't.Of course, this movie had the more immediate misfortune to be released almost concurrently with "Tombstone," a film best remembered for Val Kilmer's outrageously entertaining turn as the guy who played Doc Holliday better than Dennis Quaid. Most of the rest of that George Cosmotos effort consists of me trying not to laugh at Kurt Russell's mustache. I think "Tombstone" will go down in history as a movie that succeeded because it was slightly less ridiculous than "Wyatt Earp," which, except for the incongruous action sequences, deserves the cinematic Boot Hill where it has been interred. Now, if only Kasdan would follow it... metaphorically, of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why compare Wyatt Earp to Tombstone?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to know why so many people are comparing Wyatt Earp to Tombstone. Yes...both films were made within a year apart, but their objectives are completely different. The titles pretty much say it. Tombstone is about the events that transpired in Tombstone...Wyatt Earp is about the man Wyatt Earp. Therefore, they do not have the same goal in mind and are telling two very different stories. I enjoyed both films for different reasons and allow them to stand on their own merits. Tombstone was more entertaining and action-packed, however, the story was not as historically accurate and the characters were a little over the top. Whereas Wyatt Earp had more of a personal, in-depth examination of the life, but not the legend, of Wyatt Earp.Now, lets get to the intention of this film. Wyatt Earp is suppose to be a story about the lawman, with the convictions and tribulations that shape him as a young boy up to old age. Unlike, Tombstone, which focuses on an array of characters with the plot leading up to a single event, quite historically incorrect, I might add. Yes...Wyatt Earp is cold, unforgiving, bitter, reserved, etc. However, he was not always that way, as his early life traveling with his family to California and marriage to Urella Sutherland, a woman he deeply loved, demonstrates. The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child. Wyatt lashes out and loses all reason to live. He becomes extremely self-destructive and sets about roaming the West with no real purpose at all except to die. His father slaps some sense into him and tells him to move on with his life. Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes. So...okay...Wyatt becomes reserved, quiet, and cruel, but it is not as if we do not know why. He was a man trying to survive in a harsh, brutal land and being a lawman did not make it any easier because he was always a target. He was plagued by external demons as well as internal demons, such as the bottle and a strong yearning, undying love for his dead wife. He was very human and this movie manifests that. Tombstone is fine for those of you that do not care for Wyatt Earp beyond the infamous fight at the OK Carroll or the lawman legend. However, if you can stand a more accurate, in depth character exploration of Wyatt Earp, without any pretensions, than this is a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flawed in so many ways, hard to pick at anything in particular. What's really terrible are the horrible performances by a slew of fine actors and actresses.Every single performance in Tombstone shines above Wyatt Earp. Obviously, this movie was only made to compete with the other. Quaid's Holiday seems to be very fit and spry in comparison to Kilmer's well thought out and researched version. When Wyatt Earp III informs the viewers on the special edition DVD that he believes Kurt Russell's performance will go down in the history of filmmaking as the most accurate portrayal of his Grandfather, you have to listen. I doubt anyone can argue his credentials on the subject!What is really bewildering is the vast number of people on IMDB who really liked this one, one should not tout his/her cluelessness in such a manner.Here's a clue, rent Tombstone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp, has to truly be one of the finest portrayal of a great western hero. I live in the Southwest and here you are closer to the things that took place not that long ago.Wyatt Earp brings to the screen, an insight to each of us just a small understanding of what took place not all that long ago. The west was the last frontier of man, a place where man lived and died by the gun, where law was ruled by the Colt 45.The Gunfight at the OK Corral is one of the last great events that took place in the Old West. The movie brings not only the story of the life and times of Wyatt Earp, but also in showing you the events that led up to the beginning of the end of the Wild West.Any Wild West history buff will enjoy watching and understanding how the puzzle of the Old West fits into becoming a building block of our great nation.This movie will remain as one of my best loved movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mister, I've been in a bad mood for the last few years, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave me alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overlong, self-important and cheesy, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" stars Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp, the US Marshall whose participation at the "Gunfight at the OK Corral" consigned him to a life of infamy.Most films "about" Wyatt Earp glorify and mythologise a mostly unremarkable and at times despicable man. Kasdan attempts to reverse these trends by being "gritty", "realistic" and "factual". He begins with Wyatt as a kid, watches as Wyatt grows up, loses a wife, descends into criminality and then desperately embarks upon various money-making schemes. Tying these sequences together is Kasdan's overriding "theme": Wyatt, apparently, behaves as he does because his father taught him to be "loyal to family". Likewise, Wyatt's more disreputable acts are rationalised as being due to the "death of his young wife". Fans of better Earp films ("My Darling Clementine", "Tombstone") will find most of Kasdan's picture familiar. Compensating for this are numerous excellent sequences. Earp's younger days are interesting, sequences in which he skins buffaloes are original and the film boats fine cinematography by Owen Roizman. The much maligned Kevin Costner is also very good, as is Dennis Quaid as a scenery chewing Doc Holiday.6/10 ? Better westerns from the 1990s: "Wild Bill", "Ride With the Devil", "Dead Man", "Lone Star", "Thunderheart", "Dances With Wolves" and "Unforgiven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Wyatt Earp.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tombstone came out in 1993. The same time Wyatt Earp was supposed to come out. But they pushed it back polished it up and released it a year later. They did themselves a favour. Tombstone is much better paced. Better told. And had generally better actors. But Where Wyatt Earp has the advantage is this. Where Tombstone told only a quarter of the story. Wyatt Earp attempts to tell the whole story. It starts off with a 16 year old Wyatt Biting at the bit to leave home to fight the civil war. His father Nicholas Earp stops him. Gene Hackman creates a strong father figure here and helps set the pace. He stops Wyatt and asks him. "Do you think what you were doing was right Wyatt ?" "Yes " "Well why did you wait till I was gone to leave?" This teaches Wyatt a lesson. And later on Hackman himself delivers the Earp family motto one that does them a great service and a disservice. "Thwere is nothing more important then family. Blood is what counts .everyone else are just strangers " The film goes into depth with Wyatt finding different careers . While trying to save money to get married to the girl he loves Urilla. Not much is known about Earp's only legal marriage. But after his bride dies of Typhoid. Wyatt becomes a drunk and a horse thief. He is simply a man looking to die. After his father saves him from jail and a certain Hanging. He tells Wyatt to go leave and never come back. Tearfully father and son embrace and Wyatt leaves. We then see Wyatt As Buffalo hunter trying to make a living out of buffalo skins. And he hires the MAterson brothers Ed and Bat to be his skinners. This is a friendship that endures . When Wyatt leaves and goes to Wichita Kansas to be with his Brother James. He finds himself in the position of becoming a deputy. Wyatt soon becomes a man with a reputation and he is asked by the MAyor of Dodge city to come work for him. Dodge city is chaotic and lawlessness rules. Wyatt gets the Masterson's and his brothers to become his deputies and they clean up Dodge. Soon Wyatt is fired afterwards for having too hard of hand. And the friendly Ed MAsterson becomes Sheriff. Wyatt gets a job for the railroad tracking down outlaws and meets Doc Holliday and the two become fast friends. After Ed Masterson is murdered Wyatt is asked to come back to restore law and order. He does. And he becomes a victim of his success. Famous all Wyatt wants to do is live a normal life. And get rich with his brothers . Being a Lawman isn't liable to make one rich. Famous sure rich no. Soon after Wyatt hears about the incredible business opportunities in Tombstone. The Brothers leave over the wives objections to create a new future for them. If anything Tombstone is worse then Dodge City ever was. And The Earps along with Doc Holliday get into a blood feud that defines the myths of the wild west. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The Feud between the Clantons and theEarps and Johnny Ringo and Curly Bill Brocus has become the stuff of legend. The Original fight at the O.K.Corral lasted thirty seconds. But it sparked a War that lasted for three years. Wyatt Earp has been both Hero and Villain in this story. But if Wyatt Earp the movie leads us to believe . He was just a man looking to settle down. Eclisped by fame into becoming the greatest lawman of the wild west. And the movie makes it's point very effectively. Kevin Costner gives a strong performance as Wyatt Earp. He carries the film on his shoulders giving us a picture of Wyatt that few have-seen. A dedicated family man. A man struggling to escape his fame. And A man who was too good at his job. To be Honest While Tombstone told that story better. And Kurt Russell was better as Earp. And Val Kilmer created the definitive Doc Holliday. Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp and Dennis Quaid's Doc Holliday Should not be overlooked. They deliver a film full of passion and action. and in doing so tell us a story of Wyatt Earp the man that goes beyond Tombstone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a Long Trial That Has No Turning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective.In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs.The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please.Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy.Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job.Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively.It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst it is true that a lot of Wyatt Earp, in order to shorten the running time, could have been discarded, I advise people to find the time and patience to sit and watch this film in full and to appreciate the different aspects of it that make this film, in my opinion, great. The soundtrack, something I always listen out for, is spectacular, the cinematography; well it looks beautiful on the screen (I am no expert to say the least). Performances are good, especially from Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday, Kevin Costner was a bit bland in some of the scenes with his first wife but generally he was good also.It is lengthy, my copy of the film involves turning the disk over half way through, but it is a biopic that chooses to document Wyatt's life as a lawman right from Wichita to Tombstone and in great detail as well. The film's competitor, Tombstone, on the other hand looks at the events between 1881 and 1884, in particular the events surrounding the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and isn't that something we've seen in a western many times before? Wyatt Earp gives you much more, it is inevitable that the two would be compared, but people must realise that the emphasis of the two films is very different, this film feels much more contemporary than does Tombstone. I can safely say i learnt more about Wyatt Earp from this film, but it doesn't try and educate you, and that is important. In my opinion Wyatt Earp is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp has been a favorite movie of mine since I was younger. Costner makes an interesting Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid made for an excellent Doc Holliday ("My mother always said never put off until tomorrow those you can kill today"):).So I got a surprise when I found out one of my favorite actors was in it and I didn't even realize it until a little while ago. Okay, so call me obsessed (my closest friends do). I happen to be a HUGE Jim Caviezel fan. I think he's a talented, quite underrated actor. I mean, just look at his performances in Thin Red Line, Frequency, Angel Eyes, and The Count of Monte Cristo(I'm still waiting for him to come out with a comedy. He'd be darn good). But what really amazes me is the films he had parts in that I enjoyed before even knowing he was in them! He had small parts in not only Wyatt Earp, but also Diggstown and the Rock(you know you've got a bit part when your role doesn't actually have a name, it's just known as "rear f-18 pilot"). In Wyatt Earp, he plays the small but fun role of Warren Earp. He is actually involved in one of my favorite lines of the movie. And I didn't realize it was him until about a year ago. Well, since this isn't really important to the movie, I'll just say goodbye, and wish you all a marvelous Christmas.</fullReview>

I liked the sweep of it, the lengthy exposition, as well as the action at the end. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for the subject matter--I enjoyed Tombstone and Kurt Russell as well.All that aside, Dennis Quaid should've won an Oscar for his portrayal of Doc Holliday. In my book, he was brilliant. Any time an actor that recognizable can fool me as to his identity for an entire movie he's done some serious acting. (I don't really care who's acting when I go to see a movie and don't study the playbills)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good enough movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was good enough on most of its parts. First of all, the acting was very good and the script was very good. The only problem I had with this movie is that it was a little bit boring. Most of the movie and dialogue was top of the notch excellent but it got a tad bit boring.Overall this movie was very cool and I thought that it depicted Wyatt Earp's life well and Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid are awesome. Rating 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparisons are often apples and oranges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that this film was released so close to _Tombstone_, because immediately the comparisons began. The comparisons are apples and oranges however, because the two films have neither the same goals nor the same focus. The movie _Tombstone_ was good as far as action films go, but any affiliation with historical facts was sorely lacking if that was the intention. The film _Wyatt Earp_ has a completely different focus, which is upon the characters and the incidents which shaped their lives, rather than upon one incident alone. It succeeds in this goal admirably, and does an excellent job sticking to the facts as well, which in Hollywood is often overlooked. With beautiful cinematography and musical score on par with _Dances with Wolves_, the film does justice to show the frontier and its effects on shaping men of the time. People often erroneously judge the 19th century frontier with modern ideas and morals, and thus miss what truly made men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday what they were. In this case, history made the men rather than men making history. Movies such as _Tombstone_ portray motivations as shallow vehicles to effect the mayhem and gunfire which overshadows the characters. Character development is a sidenote, and the viewer comes away with having experienced nothing unique that hasn't already been seen a hundred times previously in different costumes. In _Wyatt Earp_, you *know* the man Wyatt Earp, and understand what would possess a man to walk into an alley to face up to six armed and dangerous men, after seeing the events that brought him there and what was at stake. The most famous 30 seconds of history, the OK corral gunfight, is almost anti-climax to the events preceding. This is proper, for Wyatt Earp lived to be 80 years old, and to judge a man on 30 seconds of his life is quite dishonest when he had achieved so much else. Kevin Costner may not have had the steely glint perfected by Kurt Russell in the same role, but he did possess the humanity and portrayed well the loyalty and friendship of the true Wyatt Earp. Men did not fear Earp because of a steely glint, but because of his convictions which did not waver at any instant. Costner's interpretation also accomplished what Earp did in his life - you either respected and admired him, or you hated him. It is in this that Costner's version succeeds so well. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday, well, he should have gotten an Oscar for this. This is the closest that any of us will get in seeing Doc Holliday in the flesh, resurrected from the grave. Quaid lost 40 pounds for this role, and portrayed the man John Henry Holliday, not the circus clown Doc Holliday of 1950's fame as done so well by Val Kilmer. There is just no comparison whatsoever. Linden Ashby does Morgan Earp, the affable younger brother to Wyatt, very well. His rendition of the happy, admiring and aspiring Wyatt wanna-be is very endearing. For those who aren't big Mark Harmon fans, his version of Johnny Behan is good. Harmon's slick good looks come across very well with the swarmy Behan, whose devious political shenanigans led to the bloody gunfight. Harmon does well the charmer and player, which Behan surely was. Bill Pullman pulls off the best Ed Masterson I think that can be done. The incident at Dodge that resulted in Ed's death has always been misrepresented or completely falsified, but this film has it accurate and again shows how the frontier shaped Wyatt Earp, a place where no minor incident could be dealt with complacently. Although I enjoy Tom Sizemore's many different film roles, I think he slightly misses the character of Bat Masterson. Ditto for Micheal Madsen as Virgil Earp. Both do well, but some little je ne sais qoi is lacking. As for the girls, JoBeth Williams and Mare Winningham are dead on the mark. Excellent job. Isabella Rosselini is also delightful in her role. Joanna Going, while beautiful to watch, misses the sharpness that Josie Marcus Earp was capable of. She still does the role well. It is a shame that the excellent casting for the Earp side wasn't followed with the outlaw side, whose personalities seem to be lumped together as a single one-dimensional bad guy in ten different bodies. When all is said and done, there isn't much satisfaction in their deaths as there was with the soldiers in _Dances with Wolves_. The intensity of emotion that was present in the scenes in Dodge City wasn't as great as the scenes in Tombstone, the only real flaw in the film. As far as historical accuracy, I give it an eight out of ten, with many small details well thought out. Compare this to _Tombstone_, where the only thing they got right were the names. The rest was somebody's imagination. _Wyatt Earp_ is one for the collection, enjoyed again and again. A great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, unlike its counterpart, Tombstone, is actually a good piece of storytelling. The character development of the Costner role is one you rarely see anymore in any genre, let alone an action western. Based on historical accounts that I've read, this movie is very faithful to details and does not necessarily portray the Earps in the most sympathetic light, though they are definitely the protagonists here. Though this is a long movie, it is beautifully photographed and scored and well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate, yet very long version of the Earps.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many movies that have been made about the life of Wyatt Earp and the events that he was a part of in the Historic West. What marks this movie is that it is the most accurate depiction of what transpired in the life of Wyatt Earp. Lawrence Kasdan, the director, did an excellent job in making sure that the film was almost true to life. The cinematography of the movie was top-notch. The first half of the movie is pure Western magic, which had me in awe. The second half of the movie, however, while still highly accurate, was not all that interesting. Overall, the movie did an excellent job in portraying Wyatt Earp the man, not the legend. The acting was pretty good. Kevin Costner portrayed Wyatt Earp, and his display of Wyatt's transformation was effective, although I felt that he was a little too wooden in the second half of the movie. Dennis Quaid gave a lot for this movie; he lost 42 pounds to play the role of Doc Holliday. His portrayal of Doc will be drawing comparisons with Val Kilmer's portrayal in Tombstone for years to come. I recommend this movie, but I give a warning. This is the type of movie in which you should know something about the material before you see the film. If you are not a fan of Westerns or have never heard of Tombstone, AZ, then this is not the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Earp, The Whole Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This particular version of the Wyatt Earp story may be the definitive Wyatt Earp tale. Not that it's the best Wyatt Earp movie although an argument certainly could be made in its favor. It's because this film encompasses more of his life than any other film so far as I've seen.I don't think any historical character even those out of the Bible have ever gotten better and more varied treatment with name stars playing the character. Most Earp films do center around the shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone. There are some others like Wichita where Joel McCrea plays Wyatt Earp and the action centers around his first job as a marshal in Wichita. There are others like Hour Of The Gun where James Garner plays Earp and the action centers with the aftermath of the events at the OK Corral. A lot of that film is incorporated here. Garner played Earp again in Sunset which takes a look at Earp in the Roaring Twenties as a senior citizen in Hollywood. Wyatt was one tough dude in that one.But Wyatt Earp as produced and starring Kevin Costner takes a long view of Earp from his childhood with an abolitionist family in Illinois with Gene Hackman as his father. The action goes to a coda where we see Costner and Joanna Going as his common-law wife as a middle-aged couple at the turn of the last century. Costner plays Earp as an upright man, but one who will not hesitate to back up his play with whatever is at hand. In one of his first encounters with a bad man, he nails him with a thrown wooden billiard ball. It's almost like they were using the same acting coach, but Dennis Quaid in this film and Val Kilmer in Tombstone which came out roughly the same time turn in virtually identical performances as the murderous and tubercular Doc Holiday. You could transplant each other in the different film and not notice the difference. Here Quaid has around him Isabella Rosellini as Holiday's slattern mistress Big Nose Kate. The standard for that role was created in John Sturges's Gunfight At The OK Corral with Jo Van Fleet being abused and nursing Kirk Douglas as Holiday.One performance in this film that set a standard in terms of how close to reality the character was is that of Jeff Fahey as Ike Clanton. By all accounts this one got it right, Clanton was a cowardly bully who usually let others do his fighting for him. He ran out on his pals at the OK Corral including brother Billy Clanton. And Ike preferred not to do his killing face to face. Fahey really hit the mark in a small but well written role.Something tells me we've not exhausted Wyatt Earp as a film subject. Within the next decade and a half, I predict one if not more films will be made to once again interpret the character and events of the life and legend of Wyatt Earp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp is a masterpiece for about 2 hours and 40 minutes. Unfortunately, the movie is around 3 hours and 10 minutes. There's about 1/2 hour that really needed to be cut. It really taxes the audience and doesn't add anything to the character.The first 2 hours and 30 minutes are brilliant and beautiful. The O.K. corral gunfight and the acquittal of the Earps should have been the climax of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie adds a new story about the killing of Earp's brother and Wyatt getting revenge for it. This half hour revenge story is ugly. There are at least ten killings, more than the rest of the movie and Wyatt just shows his mean and nasty side, which he has already done at several other points in the movie. This 30 minutes is unnecessary and it makes the audience forget the wonderful movie that came before and the beautiful epilogue that comes after.The last ten minutes in Alaska with a flashback of Wyatt standing up to a mob is also excellent. It was just the half hour between the acquittal and Alaska that needed to be taken out.Cinematography, acting, and music are excellent.</fullReview>

For that reason only, I'd love to see another one....perhaps based more on Alvira Earps (Virgil's fiery Irish wife, written by Frank Waters)..."The Earps of Tombstone"....George, reenactment actor/director....Tombstone Arizona</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many who come to IMDb and run Wyatt Earp down to the ground, preferring the very cheesy version of Tombstone. For me there is no sense in that. I awaited the release of Wyatt Earp with eagerness and I wasn't let down in the least. It is of epic proportion, very well made, all actors perfectly cast in their roles. Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid are the most outstanding of the two. The cinematography is breathtaking. The story, some would argue, is too drawn out. Not for me. I enjoyed learning who the legendary man was, and how he got his beginning. Go ahead and put your check mark down for Tombstone. I will always prefer the Wyatt Earp version much more. I would love to see a sequel done with this, with all the actors assuming their same roles. I bet there'd be a lot more to tell. Ten plus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an underrated film beautifully realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly, a great film such as director Lawrence Kasdan's (Silverado) "Wyatt Earp" was not properly realized by the audiences of 1994. Possibly because of Tombstone (basically a film on the same point), having been released only a year prior to it. When comparing "Tombstone" to "Wyatt Earp", I have to say that they are both good films, although "Wyatt Earp" has many points that overpower "Tombstone".First of all, we have a great cast of talented actors including Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Michael Madsen, Mark Harmon, Jeff Fahey, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, and Bill Pullman. I strongly have to disagree with the people who hand out the Razzie Awards. They gave Kevin Costner one for Worst Actor. Although it's definitely not his best performance, it is still very good, not worthy of a Razzie. True, he wasn't so great during the scenes of him as a young man, but when he portrayed Wyatt Earp as a famous lawman during the 1880s, he pulled the job off great. Dennis Quaid's performance of Doc Holliday was excellent and one of his best to date.Music was done by James Newton Howard, who is the most underrated music composer of the day in my book. Howard is one of my favorite composers and he created a mix of excellent scores for "Wyatt Earp". The scene where Wyatt Earp, his two brothers, and Doc Holliday walk to the O.K. Corral shootout is a wonderful theme. The film's main score is also memorable.Of course, the one thing that "Tombstone" definitely beats "Wyatt Earp" by is action and entertainment. The gunfights in "Tombstone" are far better than the ones in "Wyatt Earp", keeping the audiences interested. And probably the only other thing is pacing. "Wyatt Earp" is three hours long and in my personal opinion, a half-hour longer than it needed to be. I could have picked out a few scenes worth removing."Wyatt Earp" although receiving some positive reviews from critics, was a box office failure and it won two Razzie Awards (Worst Actor and Worst Remake or Sequel) and it was nominated for several others including Worst Director and Worst Picture. In my opinion, it is a great film that is far too compelling to be worthy for those and it should have been nominated for Academy Awards rather than Razzies. The only Academy Award it got a nomination for was its beautiful cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I much prefer this version of the true life Wyatt Earp than the way overblown Tombstone version. Kevin Costner is the perfect Wyatt Earp lawman. Dennis Quaid is exactly right for Doc Holliday. The way the movie takes its good old sweet time to tell about the man himself is what I like. I enjoy the long, leisurely version. I like knowing the details of Wyatt Earp's courtship with Urilla, her tragic dying while pregnant with their child, his troubles with the law, and his next encounter with the other women in his life. I love the soundtrack to this epic tale. It's catchy and you find yourself humming along with it. I think the cinematography in this picture is some of the best ever. Each real-life personality was perfectly cast. Lawrence Kasdan did an outstanding job along with all involved. I truly wish this had been a front runner in the Oscars. Had it been more appreciated, it would've took top honors, I'm sure. I think it's sad that this movie was so ignored by critics and viewers alike. They sure missed out on something spectacular...and a real masterpiece. I give it two thumbs up and a ten plus. Wish there was a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Better Modern Westerns.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great critical and commercial success of "Dances with Wolves" and "Unforgiven" in the early nineties led many, myself included, to hope that a great revival of the cinematic Western might be on the way. Although those hopes have largely been disappointed, the genre is in better health now than it was in the eighties and there have been a number of good examples. "Wyatt Earp" is one of them.Earp has been the hero of several Westerns, and those that I have seen (I have not seen either John Sturges's "Hour of the Gun" or the more recent "Tombstone") have concentrated either on events in Tombstone ("My Darling Clementine", "Gunfight at the OK Corral") or on those in Dodge City ("Dodge City" itself, which offered a fictionalised version of the Earp story). "Wyatt Earp", however, is an attempt at a filmed biography which gives us its hero's entire life story, starting with his boyhood in Illinois. Most of the first hour or so is taken up with Earp's life before he became a lawman; the famous gunfight, about two-thirds of the way through the film's three hours, only takes up about a couple of minutes of the action.The advantage of showing us the hero's early life is that this allows us to understand many of the facets of his character. Perhaps the most important incident in the film is the tragically early death of his young first wife Urilla; Earp's grief at her death turns him from a quiet, studious young man with an ambition to become a lawyer into a lawless desperado. Facing a death-sentence in Arkansas for horse-stealing (evidently still a capital crime in America in the 1870s, long after it had ceased to be one in Britain), Earp is rescued by his father's intervention and flees to the West as a fugitive from justice. His later career as a lawman is interpreted as an effort to make amends for this youthful foray into lawlessness. Another aspect of his character brought out in these early scenes is the importance to him of family ties. He and his brothers Morgan and Virgil later make a formidable team, with stronger emotional ties to one another than to the women in their lives.In an earlier age, Earp would probably have been portrayed as a clean-cut hero, the brave man in the white hat cleaning up the wild frontier, but in the revisionist nineties such an approach seemed too simplistic and the film offers us something closer to a "warts and all" portrayal. Apart from the horse-stealing incident, Earp is sacked from his job as Sheriff of Dodge City because his methods of law enforcement seem excessively harsh even by Wild West standards, and much of the film is taken up with details of his loveless sexual relationship with the prostitute Mattie Blaylock. There is, however, a limit to the film's revisionism. As with many biopics, the film-makers have selected episodes from their subject's life in order to form a coherent narrative to illustrate a particular viewpoint. In this case the narrative seems to be that of a wild young man who matures into a legendary hero of the West, and any historical details which do not fit in are ignored. For example, the film does not explore the suggestion made by some historians that the Gunfight had less to do with law enforcement than with a feud between the Earp family and their Clanton rivals over control of Tombstone's businesses. On the other hand, the film is sometimes harder on Earp than the historical record might warrant. In reality, there is considerable doubt about whether he was actually guilty of horse-stealing; in the film his guilt is quite apparent."Wyatt Earp"'s main weakness is its great length. It is clearly aiming to repeat the success of Kevin Costner's other epic Western of the nineties, "Dances with Wolves", but does not have that film's staying power, and at times can seem too slow-moving. Costner's acting is not quite as compelling as in the earlier film, but he is still very watchable, and this is one of his better films, much better than, say, "The Bodyguard" or the embarrassingly bad "Waterworld". There is a good cameo from Gene Hackman as Earp's father, but the best contribution is probably from Dennis Quaid as the tubercular Doc Holliday, spitting out defiance of the world in his Southern drawl in between his bouts of coughing.Despite its occasional longueurs, in its latter stages (which deal with the post-Gunfight spiral of revenge between the Earp and Clanton gangs, with Wyatt's happy second marriage to the beautiful Josie and with his final promotion to legendary status) the film achieves a similar epic grandeur to that of "Dances with Wolves", aided by those familiar features of the large-scale Western, sweeping photography of the scenery and a stirring musical score. One of the better modern Westerns. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just caught Lawrence Kasdan's 'Wyatt Earp' hidden away in a late night slot on a minority TV channel. I thought it a fine film; stately and powerful with a 'historic' feel to it, it seemed to be almost a documentary. Seeing the film has prompted me to explore some of the legends of the Wild West, legends which permeated my childhood growing up in a just post-war England. Far better than 'Tombstone', but I've yet to catch any of the earlier films based around the legendary gunfight at the OK Corral. Dennis Quaid was superb as 'Doc'Holliday - so good as to be almost unrecognisable. He must have lost a lot of weight to get the role, so what's the secret Dennis? He walks away with every scene he's in. Kevin Costner is too much of a blank canvas, though I enjoyed the recent 'Open Range'. A real late-night pleasure, much enjoyed with a fine bottle of Merlot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'They put you up there and then wait for you to fall.' Said Wyatt Earp's leading man around the time of the release of The Bodyguard. Brushing the irony to one side, no one knows how to fall quite like Kevin Costner. In the space of a mere decade, he went from Oscar winning director and star of the Academy's 1990 best picture, to Razzie regular and undisputed master of abysmal career moves. In my opinion, to call him a 'schizophrenic actor' with a resume that's filled with an AC/DC of alternate performances would be the most generous description of the once most bankable actor in Hollywood. On occasion you get the comfortably competent Costner, who serves up such awe-inspiring work as his classic portrayal of Jim Garrison in Oliver Stone's JFK. Then the rest of the time complacency sneaks in, and we're left with Kevin playing Kevin in flops like Dragonfly and Waterworld. If anyone was looking for an example of the middle ground between these two opposite cinematic identities, then Wyatt Earp is the place to find the evidence. Although there's nothing particularly heinous about his performance, he leaves the character begging for flamboyance; in fact, he's so damn dull, you could squint up your eyelids and swear it was Jason Patrick sporting a cunning disguise. In playing such a one-dimensional characterisation, Costner comes close to ruining the lawman's legacy by portraying him as a selfish chauvinist with an extreme lack of respect for his friends and female acquaintances. Whether this is true of the real Wyatt Earp is beside the point. Legend dictates that he was the Marshall with a heart of gold; a hero that cleared up the town of Tombstone and saved innocent folk from the evil clutches of wrongful cowboys. That's the way Hollywood has always told it, and more's to the point, that's how it should always be told. I guess it didn't help matters that Kurt Russell had already robbed box offices with his much stronger and infinitely charismatic turn in George Cosmatos' account of the same story, which was released the previous year. Unfortunately for Lawrence Kasdan, comparing the two performances leaves Costner whimpering like a pony that's been nipped by a fragment from a miss-placed six-shooter. It's definitely Russell's turn that will live longer in the memories of fans of the genre. That's not to say that Wyatt Earp is completely devoid of merit. In fact, aside from the on-off performance of the leading man, this is skin-scrapingly close to being a 'spot on' modern day western. It attempts - with a large amount of success - to separate itself from the glut of supposedly biographical accounts that usually start and finish circa the gunfight at the OK Corral, by offering the viewer a full-bore take on the entire life-story of the legendary lawman. As we traipse through his comfortable childhood, two marriages, a spell as an alcoholic horse-thief and his transformation into a top draw peacekeeper, we're treated to an astonishing cast of supporting players that shine an incandescent light on the overall proceedings. Gene Hackman, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mike Madsen and a brilliant turn from Dennis Quaid round up an ensemble to die for, which gives the movie an instant guarantee of allurement. Granted, Lawrence Kasdan is no Howard Hawks; but he's a man with a classic vision of how the Wild West should be filmed, and for a movie that's shockingly overlong in running time (a Costner trademark), he manages to handle the pacing extremely well. Let's face it, if you're going to make a feature detailing the life of a man made famous by one single gunfight, then you'd better make sure you stage that gunfight perfectly. Kasdan does just; and the build up to the actual showdown is as tense as an amphetamine junkie diffusing a bomb on a timer ? pure class! The camera weaves around the four lawmen like a snake in a tunnel as they head down to the Corral for the stand-off. Tumbleweed blows through the location and costumed extras run for cover as the director comfortably ticks off all the clichés that define a classic western set-piece. The only other flaw that prevents this from reaching classic status is the lack of any heavily-scrutinised script alterations. Characters just turn up and disappear randomly (eg Tom Sizemore?), and without following them up to a conclusion the screenplay looks somewhat uneven. But still, ignore these few problems and you're left with a stylishly directed, well researched and imminently watchable slice of Western history. Is it as good as Tombstone? Not quite, but then it offers a much deeper look into the legend's roots and influences. If you can handle Costner at his least expressive, then this might just be your weekend masterpiece. But otherwise, it's a damn fine movie despite its few short comings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this film over and over again for some reason, maybe I could relate to Wyatt? I seen this film a number of years ago but to my knowledge it didn't make much of an impact, maybe forrest gump over shadowed it at the time? If I can make comparisons to the film tombstone, I would say the bio on Wyatt Earp is certainly longer 3hrs in total. But I think both films give a good overview of Wyatt Earp and seen to be consistent with the true story of the legend. I think its important to tell these types of stories again and again, as heroes like this a pretty rare, and in days like these we need them! If I was to pick a favourite I would probably say Wyatt Earp payed by Kevin Costner is probably the better as this film goes back into what made the man, whereas tombstone is about his time in tombstone. I would say to anyone go get this movie or rent it our if you can, as it is certainly one of my favourites. These are the only two westerns I really enjoyed, as I cant watch the other ones as to be honest they are way before my time! And for some people I'm sure most western lovers thats not a problem for them, but these two westerns did it for me, personally speaking as I can be a harsh critic. I like the way both films give comments at the end of the movies verifying the actual events and what happened afterwards. In tombstone I thought Val Kilmer played an excellent doc holiday. And to think I was in Colorado in may of 2000? I would love to go to the places were doc and Wyatt in particular were buried, I know doc was buried in glenwood springs Colorado, and Wyatt L.a(I think). But yes they have inspired me to know more about how the west was one, so go and sen both these films and make your own judgment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, this movie looks very good, and it seems as if a lot of research and attention was given to the details of Earp's life and times. But, the movie failed to portray the legendary man's life in an interesting way (for me at least). While WE may be historically accurate, it is just not very entertaining. Actually, its boring. And I don't know why it should be. If you think about it, Wyatt Earp lived in a time in US history when people were getting away with much more interesting things than we can get away with now. So then why is this movie so boring? Why is it as exciting as listening to someone read an essay on Wyatt Earp's life out loud? How did they manage to make the life of this famous guy who did many interesting things so tedious? It's something to think about anyway.I thought that many of the characters as they were portrayed lacked charisma, and I really didn't sympathize or care too much what happened to them. Also, the movie was just slow at times and lingered too much on the less interesting aspects of the man - such as his personal life - when maybe it should have focused more on other things. Tombstone, the other movie about Earp's life, is probably less accurate, but is a better movie, with more likeable characters in it.I thought Wyatt Earp was a 4/10, because there is no real justification for having a movie be this monotonous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ambitious but not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire the fact that "Wyatt Earp" tries to give the viewer a more comprehensive look at the legendary lawman, however "Wyatt Earp" falls short as a movie. It was worthwhile to show Earp's early brush with the law and his early career as a lawman in Dodge. Unfortunately, most of the events were presented in such a slow, laid back style that rarely the story achieved dramatic tension. This laconic style seems to have muted the vibrancy of the acting performances. There are many good actors in this movie like Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore yet only Dennis Quaid's Doc Holliday was memorable. Long movies need to have a big payoff at the end. "Wyatt Earp" unfortunately just fizzled after the famous gunfight in Tombstone and the murder that causes Earp's ride for vengeance. As a more complete picture of the legendary Old West figure, this is worth a viewing, but someone looking for a dramatic, entertaining movie see "Tombstone" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Close to the Truth as it Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Tombstone, while very action packed, is nothing more than a "cartoon" depiction of the story of Wyatt Earp. The Costner/Kasdan movie is far more ambitious. This movie's focus was on the man Wyatt Earp and how he became a legend, and not about the legend of Wyatt Earp. Kasdan did a tremendous job of researching and understanding what made Wyatt tick and his efforts truly pay off in this film. As for Costner, you get the sense that he thoroughly understood what Kasdan was trying to portray and that he himself had a firm grasp of the life of Wyatt. No, he does not have the growl in his voice that Russell has...but that's a plus. Costner is able to get his point across with a simple statement and subtle look. Wyatt was a complex person, not a "Rambo" type "character". Costner portrays Wyatt with a style that shows emotion without having to say a word (i.e. See the scene where Morgan is shot and Wyatt is backing away from the pool table) as Wyatt was a man of few words. As for Dennis Quaid, his portrayal might be the biggest oversight in history!!! He definitely should have won an Oscar, and NO ONE should ever even mention Kilmer's Holliday again unless as a second fiddle to Quaid's. The rest of the cast was solid with no REAL standouts.As for historical accuracy, there has NEVER been an Earp movie that got it as close to the way it happened than this one! Look it up!!! I suggest you start with Glenn G. Boyer's books!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too long, too slow, too cold despite Costner's fine performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his wife dies, Wyatt Earp, a constable with the Arkansas police force, hits the bottle and drunkenly roams the streets in search of handouts to buy another shot of whisky. When one potential benefactor agrees to personally buy him a meal rather than give him cash to buy booze, Earp takes offense and beats the man senseless before taking his money and his horse. Was the legendary lawman's past really as sordid as the one portrayed in "Wyatt Earp," Lawrence Kasdan's three hour plus biography starring Kevin Costner?Earp finds redemption, of course, but only after his father (Gene Hackman) buys his son's way out of jail and instructs him to turn his back on Arkansas forever. In Witchita, Earp barely makes a living as a skinner but when a local rowdy acts up, striking fear in the heart of the lawman in town, Earp takes charge, apprehends the unruly one and is offered the job of deputy which he accepts. So distinguished is his service that word spreads concerning his peacekeeping skills, and soon Earp is the marshal of Dodge City, Kansas, a rip-roaring town in which he is introduced to his ally and friend, Doc Holliday. The violence takes its toll, however, and when his deputy is murdered, Wyatt relocates to Tombstone, Arizona, where he plans to set up his own business and retire from law enforcement.Tombstone. The name is legend. It was also the name of another Earp biopic, directed by George Cosmotos, that beat the more ambitious Costner-Kasdan film into theaters by six months. The famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral was imaginatively staged in the Cosmotos film, and has been recreated by John Ford ("My Darling Clementine"), John Sturges ("Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"), as well as in an episode of--believe it or not--"Star Trek." Wyatt Earp, having failed as an entrepreneur, pinned the badge to his vest once again and, in Tombstone, and especially in that celebrated gun battle with the Clantons, shot his way into history.At 191 minutes, "Wyatt Earp" lacks the tight pacing and the energy of "Tombstone," but it is more ambitious and thoughtful. "Tombstone" was less a biography of the famous lawman than it was an action film, less concerned with characterization than it was with gunplay. "Wyatt Earp" attempts to dig a little deeper to present a portrait of Earp by focusing more on his pre-Tombstone days, as well as his early family life. Family, his father repeatedly tells his sons, is all that counts. Everyone else is a stranger. It's a lesson Wyatt learns so well that even his second wife is an outsider in his eyes. As played by Costner, Wyatt Earp is a cold, hard man who enforces the law with such determination that he must have been an influence on Dirty Harry. Costner's approach to the role is not unlike Kurt Russell's in "Tombstone," but Russell is a more formidable presence, more muscular and menacing. Costner, lean but too soft spoken to come across as truly mean, must make a greater effort to appear cruel. He succeeds by bringing a hint of psychological turmoil to his portrayal. Costner's Earp has learned, first from his father, then from experience, that the world is a cold, hard place populated by strangers, and, to survive, he, too, must be cold and hard.In spite of Costner's fine performance and the more sophisticated screenplay, "Wyatt Earp" is not a success. It is too long, too slowly paced, and too cold a film to generate much enthusiasm. Although Dennis Quaid dieted to the point of emaciation to play the tubercular Doc Holliday, he is too briefly glimpsed to warrant the second billing (above the title) he receives. Quaid's participation in the finished cut of the film is more of a cameo than a supporting role. The same is true of the entire cast. This is Costner's show all the way, and, good as he is, it isn't good enough to carry the film. The ultimate effect of "Wyatt Earp" is indifference. One is likely to come away respecting Costner and Kasdan's motives, but unmoved by the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very good movie, the biggest letdown is the length! Good lord, I'm reading people saying there needed to be more detail, blah blah--you'd need to make a series on TV! It's already, what, three hours long? Some of the acting seemed a little stiff, what is it with Kostner that he always comes off like he's got his lines memorized, and he's trying to remember them? As for passing judgement on historical accuracy--folks, it's a movie, OK? Not a history course. Omission is not historical inaccuracy, it's expediency, as long as the continuity of the story is intact. I liked Tombstone too. Both entertaining movies, neither is Gone With the Wind.

		<fullReview>Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to Wyatt Earp, his second movie from 1994.It's impossible to talk about this movie without mentioning Tombstone, simply because it was released six months before, and focused on the only part of Earps life people care to know about. The gun fight at the OK Coral. One is a mindless popcorn flick, the other is a serious biopic. Audiences flocked to one, and sadly stayed away in droves from the other.Plot In A Paragraph: a biopic of Wyatt Earp (KC) a man who loved his family, and became one of the Wild West's most famous men.Over long, bloated, unfocused, dull, self indulgent, rambling, too serious and "a flat and uninspired mess" are all expressions I've heard used when talking about Lawrence Kasdans Wyatt Earp. All unfair in my opinion, one review I read said "Wyatt Earps biggest problem is that it isn't Tombstone" what the hell?? When did a movie automatically become a bad one, just because a shorter, flashier version was released 6 months before?? With negative reviews like that, how was the movie meant to have a chance?? With A Perfect World massively under performing and nobody going to see his supporting role in The War, the critics were out in full force to attack KC and they used this movie as a stick to beat him with. It came as no surprise when the movie was nominated for multiple razzie's. Sod the razzie nominations, people often don't realise that this movie was nominated for a single Oscar, one Best Cinematography. I think it should have had more. Wyatt Earp doesn't want to be just one more retelling of the gunfight at the OK Corral. The subject is the whole life span of Wyatt Earp, and is a much more serious movie than the flashier Hollywood pleasing characters portrayed in Tombstone. I don't believe the Russell and Kilmer versions of Earp and Holliday were anything close to real life, I believe Earp was a moody, bad tempered, bad ass like KC plays him, and that Holliday was unpleasant, but loyal like Quaid plays him, not the flashy and fun, but ruthless gambler always ready with a one liner, that Kilmer played. That's not taking anything away from Tombsone and its performances as I enjoy them too, but this movie is more authentic. Whilst it's KC and Dennis Quaid who dominate the movie, from the minute we first see him, KC is in practically everyday scene. Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore all offer solid support, but Gene Hackman is disappointingly under used, and Michael Masden is surprisingly subdued. As well as strong male characters, there are also some strong women too, not commonly found in a western. Catherine O Hara standing out especially. Weirdly though, the only non whore or former one, is the actress Earp falls in love with, and she is often called a whore.I also need to mention the score by James Newton Howard. It's epic.Nobody can accuse KC of playing it safe, he didn't back out of PrinceOf Thieves when another Robin Hood movie was being made at the same time,,and he won. Whilst it would have made sense to pull out here, he stuck to his guns (yes pun intended) but the gamble didn't pay off this time. Despite the negative criticism, scathing reviews and the Tombstone effect, Wyatt Earp still grossed $25 million at the domestic box office (more than the much loved Leon: The Professional) to end the year the 55th highest grossing movie of 1994. Obviously for a movie with a $60 million budget, that was a disappointment. But KC didn't stand still and he was on to his next project before this even opened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meandering Movie with Multiple Endings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Costner can Pass as a Movie Star, once in awhile, but Simply does not have the Depth as an Actor to Pull Off this Heavy Study of the Western Icon. Especially when the Script takes Over Three Hours to put On Screen, the Length and Microscopic Details that Focus on the Life of Wyatt Earp ends up Revealing itself as another Kevin Costner Vanity Project.He is a Much Better Fit in "Open Range" (2003) having Grown Out of His Self Aggrandizement and His Film Projects in the Later Years show a Humble Restraint. Lessons Learned.Mediocre and Inconsistent Director Lawrence Kasdan must take Equal Blame for this Elongated, Episodic Epic. It's Not a Bad Film, but Only Slightly Above Average. Because the Better Parts (the Cinematography, and some good B Actors) are Intruded Upon by way too Many side Stories and a Bloated, Wordy Script that Keeps making the same Points, Over and Over.Overall, it's an Obese Film that seems to Never get any Momentum and even when it Manages some Motion, it is Reined In and Slowed Down by rather Boring and Unwelcome Scenes. The Movie Ends a Number of Times and the Train Sequence in one of the Endings is so Mishandled and Unremarkable as to be Anti-Climactic and Nearly Incomprehensible.Worth a Watch for Die-Hard Western Fans, but Others are Not Likely to be Impressed and may have Trouble making it to One of the Endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom.Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flawed But Beautifully Filmed And Well Acted Epic Western Biopic About The Legendary Lawman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece.Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West.Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film.The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fiancé. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross).The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen.The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard.In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Underrated!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with.Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers.Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do.Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most historically accurate of all the films about Earp/Tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are.Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western That Is Rarely Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham.Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton.This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.</fullReview>

Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible.

		<shortDescription>Great movie about frontier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie told us the life of a western sheriff Wyatt Earp. At the beginning of this movie Wyatt wanted to join the Civil War, so he left his family, but he rejected by the army. After that he went to study law and met his wife. But his wife was died because of the typhoid. Since his wife died, he began drinking and living as a thief. Fortunately, his father forced him to stop drinking, and sent him to west with his another three brothers to hunt buffalo. At there they used the way violence to violence and kicked the bad guys out of the town. At that time he began his life as a legendary gunman. During this time, his love life never stopped, and he also met his best friend. At last, he worked with his friend did the famous "Duel at the farm".This was such a long movie. It looks like a western movie, but I think it's a biography. In this movie the plot is complete, it's tell the whole story about Wyatt Earp. What's happened to him and why he become like that. It also talks about family, love, friend in this movie, but nothing can stop him becoming a hero. I think this is the feature of the movies about frontier. It's a typical movie about frontier culture. Wyatt Earp is the most important person in this movie. He has the typical characteristic of a hero. He can save people by himself. He always alone. He doesn't have a lot friends but the friend he has is the real friend. He never be selfish. Whatever family and love are not the things he cares about. My personal point, I really like the music in this movie, but for me the movie is too long to finish. Maybe it's a little boring for girls, but I believe that this movie must be the one of the most greatest western movie and it also could be the classic movie of western movie fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp was a film I held off watching for a while because of the boring title and the clichéd western screenshots I had seen. I have to say though after viewing Wyatt Earp I believe it to be the best western film I have ever seen.The scenery and the people seem authentic and the acting is solid. Even the outlaws in the movie have a sense of humanity and rationality. I believe they portrayed the time and setting very effectively.The story is about love and life, opportunities and most of all family. A rewarding film to watch if you have the time. I had to pause it and go for lunch but while eating I was intrigued to know what was going to happen next. Costner really plays his part well and does not have to carry the film as other actors also pull their weight and characterize well.Well worth a watch people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an epic western movie and much truer to the real story of his life of than any other. The cinematography is excellent. The sets, props, costumes, characterizations and dialog, all seem so very authentic that, watching it, I felt like I was really there, living it. Everyone does an excellent job in their parts. Wyatt and his brothers are shown in the varying facets of their humanity, as are their women. Wyatt's early life is shown, which sets the inner core of his adult personality. Kevin Costner looks startlingly like the real Wyatt too. If you like westerns, but want yours served up like a banquet, not a slice of pizza, than this is your movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western Drama In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best western drama in many years. It is too long but that is a necessary evil when it goes through a retelling of a lot of western legends, not just a single story. It is a single story of the Earp family, but the Earps touched many other legendary Western characters in their lives that it goes much more in depth because of this. Kevin Costner proves again that he can carry a long dramatic film. He has plenty of good support along the way in this one. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday is an excellent choice &amp; plays the role very well. There are plenty of others too, but I want to avoid making my review too long. You can watch the film itself.More characters are well drawn &amp; given time to develop in this than most westerns. There are more women in this one with more screen time than in many. The costumes &amp; scenery are well done too.Like any western legends, there are most certainly some facts in this one as well as some fiction. The main thing is that the stories are well presented &amp; acted by an excellent cast. This makes it a very watchable film- especially if your as avid a western fan as some people are Tiger Woods fans. This film is almost as long as the coverage of a PGA tourney where Tiger Woods is leading. The story is much more exciting though as it keeps me awake better than the golf does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't even say which one is better, this or Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer's Tombstone of the same era. I'm not much of a Costner fan, but I do love this movie. He is the perfect choice as the stoic lawman who did things that a lot of people, including himself, didn't like, but that had to be done to earn respect from all the crazies in the wild, wild west. As Earp, he delivers two lines in this movie that sum it up.(As County Sheriff tries to arrest Wyatt after the OK Corral incident.)Sheriff: Wyatt! I want to see you. Earp: If you're not careful, you'll see me once too often.And later, when Wyatt is facing down a lynch mob that wants to string up a prisoner.Man in crowd: Who's going to stop us? You??Earp: You're right, I can't stop you. There's enough of you here tonight to overpower me. (Draws his guns) But I'm taking ten or twelve of you with me. So who's first?Even the mighty Gov-uh-nuh never had lines that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should have had more Doc</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that on the whole the movie was good; however, in my opinion Tombstone was better. Wyatt Earp rushed through a lot of seemingly important events, and REALLY dragged on some other parts. Wyatt's sudden lawlessness after the death of his first wife could have been looked into more, as well as his courtship and marriage of Urilla. Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holiday was great (I love Dennis Quaid and Doc Holiday's my hero) and I think that the movie didn't really do Doc justice. Kevin Costner's performance was mundane sometimes. I don't think that he really, and I know that this is excruciatingly cliché, "brought the character to life" the way that the other actors did.</fullReview>

While Costner may not have been my first choice as Wyatt Earp, He with out a doubt out was more beleivable than Kurt Russell's preformance in Tomestone. Russell was far too goodie goodie in this role while we actually see some character development in Costner's version. As far as Doc Holliday goes I enjoyed both preformances from Dennis Quaid and Val Kilmer (Tomestone).So It basically comes down to the details, If you want acurate details and a more rounded story see Wyatt Earp.If you want fun Hollywood fluff go see Tomestone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under rated and very good 90's western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp is film maker Lawrence Kasdan's much overlooked and under-appreciated western epic. Some folks will scoff at the film not being historically accurate, which is a good point. However, at the end of the day Wyatt Earp is still a very good movie. It is certainly well made, the acting is good and has an engaging story of one of the most famous lawmen in the American west. Kevin Costner did a great job here as Wyatt Earp delivering a very good and believable well rounded performance. This project is more of a dramatic piece than an action vehicle, however there is plenty of great action as well. The pacing of the film is fairly quick. While Wyatt Earp clocks in at around 3 hours, it is never boring or self indulgent on the part of the director. Lawrence Kasdan does a hell of a job telling the story and balances the tone of light and dark very well. The film looks great and has an astounding support cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Michael Madsen, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, Mark Harmon, Jeff Fahey and more. I think that the success of Tombstone(also a great film by the way) killed the chance of this project to succeed considering they were released at around the same period and Tombstone came first. That being said, it made audiences choose one film or another, which is a shame because both movies are awesome and have different approaches to the subject matter. I am glad that Tombstone gets a lot of props, but this movie is great also and deserves respect as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How The West Snored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From SIlverado director Lawrence Kasdan, this epic western tells the life of the West's most iconic lawman, from naive farm boy, to bandido to marshal, all leading up to, and past, the fight at the O.K Corral.Despite some absolutely gorgeous cinematography, and a lush, sweeping score by James Newton Howard, Kasdan &amp; Costner's biopic is slow and undercooked. With a thin story, which feels like a series of reconstructions strung together with a lack of development or focus, and characters, most of whom solely spew moral speeches, that never get to do much, it just wears on you. In fact, for a film that claims to be the truest telling of Earp's life, the film takes quite a few liberties, and just like other duds like 'Patch Adams', doesn't use them for any real purpose or reason. For the 3 hours+, all you get is characters either belittling Earp or just giving him some overwritten moral lecture, his father (for all the 10 minutes he's on screen) being just a glorified exposition machine, and no real sense of what Earp himself really feels or thinks about all these things. This is not helped by Costner's stone-faced performance, or flairless dialogue that sounds like it was ripped straight from history textbooks without much thought.A shame as some high quality actors (the likes of Quaid as the destructive Doc, Hackman as Earp's father, alongside Pullman and Sizemore among others) are in those roles, in addition to the aforementioned stunning production values, but this lifeless recreation misuses them all grossly. For those who found, say, the likes of 'Gandhi' or 'Kundun' a snooze, 'Wyatt Earp' will put you in a coma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wyatt Earp" or "Tombstone"? How 'bout BOTH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wyatt Earp" got a raw deal in 1994 when it was released; the film "Tombstone" -- essentially the same story -- came out six months earlier and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films is in their names: "Tombstone" focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas "Wyatt Earp" is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. "Wyatt Earp" runs 3 hours 10 minutes and "Tombstone" is an hour shorter. Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other, or both, depends on what you're in the mood for. Regardless, both are vastly superior to the dull 1957 version of the tale with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral." I originally saw "Tombstone" sometime in the 90s, but by the time I got around to seeing "Wyatt Earp" I had forgotten the former film; hence, nothing was able to 'steal the thunder' from my viewing of Costner's version. I was engrossed throughout. It may not be as great as his "Dances with Wolves" but few Westerns stand equal with that one.I recently saw both films back-to-back on separate nights and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from "Tombstone" wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in "Tombstone" with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating in the role, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but "Tombstone" wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie; although Isabella Rossellini (from "Wyatt") edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate. As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor "Wyatt Earp." I also think "Tombstone" loses too much steam after the gunfight, whereas "Wyatt Earp" maintains better momentum.BOTTOM LINE: Don't listen to the moron critics who undeservedly bashed "Wyatt Earp" upon release in '94. They're wrong, pure and simple (maybe "Tombstone" was too fresh in their minds and ruined the story for them, who knows?). "Wyatt Earp" easily stands with the all-time best Westerns. Just make sure you're in the mood for a 3-hour-plus epic before viewing. And, by all means, catch "Tombstone" too -- they're both great.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of his genre a great adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've done extensive reading and research on Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and this era. With that as a start, let me continue.The roles of Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp were well-cast and portrayed. The actors bore reasonable physical resemblance to the real men. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was superb; I thought his portrayal was more accurate than that of Val Kilmer in "Tombstone", his personality and his appearance.... although with friends, Doc Holliday was a pretty affable gentleman.The story was a nice story, although there were significant problems with some of the historical accuracy. First, Morgan and Virgil were NOT shot on the same night... actually 3 months apart. Things like that bother me when seeing a supposedly historically accurate film. But what I considered the weakest part of this movie (and "Tombstone" as well) was the very incomplete and weak buildup to the gunfight. There was so much more that happened, so much that affected the relationship between the good guys and the bad, so much missing that both films almost made the fight look like a spur of the moment battle... which is far from factual. What many people don't realize is that Bat Masterson spent time in Tombstone during this era, although not directly involved in the "action"; also, Luke Short was a major ally of Wyatt's throughout this time.I very much liked that Wyatt's young life was shown... his time as town constable, his marriage to Urilla Sutherland, her death and his resulting devastation, his pony stealing in Arkansas... all things that most folks never realized.I would very much liked to have seen more of Wyatt's revenge ride and subsequent deaths and scattering of the Clanton gang. Also, the absence of any sequence involving the robbery of the Benson stage and the killing of Bud Philpot and Peter Roehrig is regrettable, as this was a major factor leading to the battle. Also, as a result of the stage robbery, we should have seen a sequence regarding Wyatt's agreement with Ike about turning in the robbers. Finally, how Behan backed out on his deal with Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film. If you're not a stickler like I am for total historical accuracy, you should enjoy the film.Evren Buyruk</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would start to say that the Shorter 191 Minute Version is O.K, but I prefer the 212 Minute Version, which fills in quite a lot of the gaps of the shorter film, I received a Copy of a Prototype Warner Brothers edition, that was turned down for some reason Wyatt Earp focuses more in the beginning of Wyatt Earps childhood and early marriage and Tombstone never covers any of this it starts out with Wyatt Earp as an adult as he arrives in Tombstone In Wyatt Earp there is no mention of "The Cowboys" and Johnny Ringo is not a major character. In Tombstone it tells the story of how the Earps acquired property in Tombstone, there is no mention of his Dodge City days or his employment as a buffalo skinner. There is no Bat Masterson in Tombstone at all In Wyatt Earp Gene Hackman adds considerable weight as Wyatts Father, unfortunately he disappears too soon. Tombstone was made a year before and it is possible that Lawrence Kasdan saw a copy of the script or early cut and decided to change his film to not duplicate Tombstone, why compare the two of them, they are made from the same material, but are from different angles Wyatt Earp in all honesty has more depth, where Tomstone is more stylish, and Wyatt Earp appeals to more low gray matter people, where Tombstone is more sophisticated.I guess if you are going to sit through a 3hr 36min film, that thinking too hard should be optional (***) Out Of (****)</fullReview>

If you want all action try Tombstone.If its a film about family, friends, love and loss which has a real lesson to be learned where the acting is second to none and can be watched with most of the family then this is the movie about Wyatt Earp you want to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kevin Costner in heroic roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with a lot of criticism about the movie, but still I was shocked at how WYATT EARP paled next to TOMBSTONE when they came out around the same time. Kevin Costner embodies great qualities of manhood. He exudes self-confidence, shoulders his inner burdens silently, and takes the responsibility of leadership. He just means business and doesn't give a damn what people think of him. I am female but it gives me something to fall in love with if not to emulate. In this story, you can see that the atmosphere in those times was getting chaotic, and someone was needed to take control. My favorite scene besides the first encounter with Doc Holliday was when the young Wyatt Earp took charge and ran across the street into the saloon to nail the troublemaker guy, and was then offered the job of marshal. Costner has this confidence in most of his films (The Untouchables, Revenge, Dances with Wolves, No Way Out, etc.). His Wyatt Earp was intentionally an unpopular man in a difficult world. Costner his also a great lover. He might be cool as a cucumber, but a woman can make him weak in the knees. He's got this great offhand sense of humor, too. He remains one of my favorite actors.</fullReview>

It has alot of factual information in it, sometimes more then you expect, then right in the middle of it you see costner wearing a buscadero holster rig that wasnt ever made before the B westerns of the 20s and 30s. Costner himself, who seems to like to make most of his money in action flicks firing off lots of firearms, is in real life an antigun extremeist, and I find it hypocritical that folks like this are constantly surounded by a gazillion guns and action in their movies. Wyatt comes off as this dark demented character with no real moral value whatsoever, and the best line in the entire movie has to be edited every time its shown on tv....(the scene at the horse trough where layfolk hear Doc wanting something rebel kissed).... And for the life of me, except for wyatt and doc, and gene hackman, i cant recall any of the other characters, and you can barely remember who they are when your watching them. While not as historicly accturate by a long means, all the characters in Tombstone are easy and familiar to remember, everyone knew who ike ringo and curly bill were and there was no confusing them down the road. Every time i see WE, i ask myself, 'now, which one is ringo??' If you do want to watch this movie, try to get the widescreen version so you can enjoy the scenic panorama.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite western! An epic tale of an American icon. "Wyatt Earp" is superbly written and directed, a sweeping musical score, dynamic acting and character development. Unlike Kurt Russell's version, "Tombstone", Costner's "Wyatt Earp" is an intimate tale of a family's tragedy on the American frontier. Like the story of King Arthur, "Wyatt Earp" has that sense of ending from the very beginning of the film, a loss of innocence and the end of a utopian dream."Tombstone", the film most often compared with "Wyatt Earp", is, to me, a two-dimensional, almost comic book illustration of this man's life. Costner's film allows me to understand Earp and the people around him, to feel their frustrations, their victories, their losses, their humanity. Watching "Wyatt Earp", I feel as if I know these people. And their story leaves me breathless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the search for adventure - but not the adventure itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beyond contemporary newspaper reports and court testimony, there are two primary sources of information about the central moment of the Earp saga, at least as most people find it interesting, the gunfight at the OK Corral. The first book-length memoir of the event was by Deputy County Sheriff Billy Breckinridge, which painted a very bleak portrait of the Earps as thugs and criminals. This was answered by a book by Josie Marcus, Wyatt's common-law wife. Her book is by far the more credible, as she makes no effort to white-wash or hero-ize the Earps - they come across as complicated men with a complicated ethics. The film that came out shortly before this one, "Tombstone," unabashedly adopts the version of the story Josie presented; there are few media presentations of the Breckrinridge version, the most notorious being the poorly received Stacy Keach film of the early '70s "Doc." The interesting thing about "Wyatt Earp" is that it tries to avoid either of these perspectives; that's a mistake, because the middle ground is already held by Josie thanks to her honesty; the legend of Earp-as-hero (e.g., "My Darling Clementine" or the old Wyatt Earp TV show) is actually derived from word-of mouth folk-tales and dime novels, not based on any experience or record, so if you're going to dispel the myth without accepting the Breckinridge propaganda as the basis of your story, you have to resort to Josie's version, and if then you reject that what you need is some theme to define your focus, otherwise you're just going to cram your story with incidental biographical details that never congeal into a dramatic whole - which is precisely what happens here.This film is a mess - it is literally all over the place. One loses track of all the minor characters we meet in locations all over the West. Incidents are framed as though they portend dramatic implications, which never at last come to light. The dialog also fails to make its impact. Costner's Wyatt certainly comes across as dour and enigmatic, but never as complicated or as ethically complex as he appears to have been in real life.Put bluntly: Wyatt Earp was a Puritan (i.e., Calvinistic) atheist, a precursor to the 20th Century existentialist, who committed himself to action (sometimes very violent) and adventures, not because he loved excitement or discovery, but because there was really nothing else to do that would make life meaningful. The 19th Century literary equivalent would be some sort of synthesis of the obsessed Ahab and the meandering Ishmael of Melville's "Moby Dick." Now such a personality could give us a helluva story, even if not completely realized - and while "Tombstone" is a fine portrayal of the basic narrative, there's no doubt that it is too 'Hollywood' to capture the real depth of the character in Russell's Performance.But while Kostner seems to understand how deep Earp's personality runs and in what direction, he seems to keep trying to figure him out, as if he could find the key to this enigma that would open the door to the core of Earp's personality. But Despite the greater superficiality of Russell's performance, Russell is actually closer to that key, which is defined as Earp's apparent determination that any such personality core simply doesn't exist and that the proper response to this discovery is to act rather than question.So think of the Kostner Wyatt Earp as an Ahab without a white whale to hunt, an Ishmael without a Pequod to sign onto. Thus the film "Wyatt Earp" just wanders around the 'wild West' equivalents of the whaling towns Melville describes in the opening of his novel looking for some thematic purpose to focus on. It never gets there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the "Real Man's" Wyatt Earp movie. Lawrence Kasdan out-did his other great western SILVERADO. Wyatt Earp is a well made factual depiction of the man himself. Wyatt Earp is the better quality drama for the Old West fanatics. TOMBSTONE was way, way, and I mean way too commercial. That is a fact! not an opinion. It's fake, the scenarios, dialogues, and personalities are made up to make it a cool, hip, action western. It was corny. By the way, for all you Kilmer groupies out there, "DOC Holliday" NEVER EVER ACTUALLY HAD A GUNFIGHT WITH "Johnny RINGO". Do the research yourself, meat-heads. It was a Dream Match conjured up by Hollywood. And you bought it. One can not, and must not, ever engage in a comparison of the two. It is literally impossible to compare them both. I'm talking two different religions here, buddy. It's like STAR WARS vs STAR TREK. TOMSTONE is an action movie with a great ensemble cast set in the Old West. Wyatt Earp is a biographical, western epic. (yes, I'm afraid there is a big difference between them)Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy TOMBSTONE very much. I like Val Kilmer (THUNDRHEART), as well as Bill Paxton (NEAR DARK). I am a big fan of Sam Elliot (RUSH), and I love watching Kurt Russell (BREAKDOWN) in just about everything he does. Powers Booth (SOUTHERN COMFORT) lead a great cast portraying the Bad Guys. And I'm going to have to be the bigger man and, without shame, admit that I like Jason Priestly too (COLDBLOODED). The main reason I keep watching TOMBSTONE, in the first place, is to see Micheal Bain's (TERMINATOR) portrayal of the ruthless killer "Johnny Ringo". I love that guy.The cast of Wyatt Earp is, in many ways more accurate, and better put together. Of course, there are flaws, as in many casts, but I loved all their performances. Dennis Quaid (ENEMY MINE) was, historically, a better Doc. Costner's (PERFECT WORLD) Wyatt Earp was outstanding. Gene Hackman (FRENCH CONNECTION) is always good to watch. Micheal Madsan (THE GETAWAY), Dave Andrews (GRAVEYARD SHIFT), and Mark Harmon (THE PRESIDIO) were great. Tom Sizemore (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) and BIll Pullman (ZERO EFFECT) as the Masterson Brothers was very very cool. I am a huge Jeff Fehay fan too (BODY PARTS). Too bad the "Johnny Ringo" in this movie sucked. I love that guy.All in all, Wyatt Earp is the better film to watch, if you want to see the story of Wyatt Earp. You'll definitely like it, and appreciate it more than TOMBSTONE for the quality in acting they give the watcher. Then, you can watch TOMBSTONE as the 2nd feature.By the way, in actual reality, "Doc" was no match for "Ringo". He's lucky they never had a gunfight. "Doc" had gunslinging mastered, but "Ringo" had that art perfected. Aaaaugh, Don't cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Intelligent Earp movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grow so angry when I hear people claim that this film was inferior to the rather stupid "Tombstone." Costner actually takes the time and effort to make this film realistic and historic in nature. He surrounds himself with great talent and just makes a wonderful film. Being a historian, I was thrilled to see how much of recorded history was in this film. This film is, dare I say, educational. Which is why I guess it has taken a back seat to the Hollywood Kurt Russell film, which is Rambo goes to Arizona. Of course, people will say "Wyatt Earp bombed, it must be bad." Well, that is not true. Kevin Costner has made an entertaining and intelligent movie that seeks to tell people the real story about what happened in Tombstone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Historical Wyatt Earp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many Hollywood films on the shootout at the OK and the Frontier Marshall known as Wyatt Earp. This is one of the better ones. Yes, this one goes up with the other classics made on the subject, My Darling Clementine and Tombstone. What makes this movie so great is not the cheesy western "clasciness" of John Ford's early masterpiece, My Darling Clementine, nor the sweaty intensity of the bloody "Shoot 'Em Up!" entertainment that is Tombstone. This is the "history version" or as historical as Hollywood will ever get.This movie has been called "boring," and it is due for a good 10-15 minute trim (with already a 3 hr. and 10 min. running time!) however this is an epic and not your typical action western. It is a dark biopic that explores the life of Wyatt Earp, and despite having a few slow patches this is a success. The last true epic western, this film details the life of how the west was settled through Wyatt Earp's eyes, as Kasdan tries to make his own take on "How the West Was Won." As we see the ever changing west, we see a young boy go from happy husband to widower, to horse thief, to buffalo hunter/skinner, to gambler and eventually lawman. Costner gives another great performance (his last in fact) as the cold Wyatt Earp. While not as flamboyant or "showy" as Kurt Russel, he was not trying to be. Instead Costner captures a repressed love and anger that he hides under a deep exterior that reminds one of Henry Fonda (another great Earp).Costner brings this legendary lawman to life and believe me, is fairly accurate (even if they desensitize him a little more for dramatic effect). Along the way on his life journey we meet a large and great array of characters and character actors, including Gene Hackman as Father Earp, Michael Madsaon as Virgil Earp, Linden Ashby as Morgan Earp, Tom Sizemore and Bill Pullman as the Masterson brothers, etc.However, the supporting character who steals the show is Dennis Quaid in a performance of a lifetime as Doc Holliday. Despite being about 15 minutes too long, you can't help but want more of Quaid's Holliday. AFter losing an astounding 43 pounds for the part, he accurately brings the dying and cynical gambler/drunkard/killer/good friend to life. Though once again not as flamboyant as Val Kilmer (a fan favorite) he was not supposed to be. He is instead a much more realistic (still every bit as sardonic and ironic) and much sicker looking Doc. Though not flashy he tells you insights into a deeper character that other films have done less with (even with more screen time for this character).And that sums up Wyatt Earp. It is a large biopic that is about 85% accurate on the life of an interesting man. He isn't the greatest man or hero and it isn't good vs evil (though there is good and evil in this movie) but the dark dramas that befall a man obsessed with family. With a stellar cast Lawerence Kasdan crafts a very good western epic (though flawed). Do not go in expecting the fun lighthearted action of the more "entertaining" Tombstone. This is a drama closer to John Ford or How the West Was Won than the Spegehtti westerns that inspired Tombstone. This is a good movie and if you go in expecting a violent and fascinating biography and drama about one man's life, I promise you'll like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just turn it off after he leaves Dodge City and watch Tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a well known cliché of Hollywood that they tend to release things in twos. Remember Deep Impact and Armageddon hitting at about the same time? How about Volcano and Dante's Peak? Red Planet and Mission to Mars (OK, no one remembers that one). Well in 1994 there were two films made looking at the life of famous lawman Wyatt Earp. The first, George P Cosmatos' Tombstone, looked only at Earp's time spent in the city of the title, focusing on the events leading up to and following the Showdown at the OK Corral. This film, a labour of love from Lawrence Kasdan, fashions Earp's life into an epic story of love and the binds of family in a lawless land.There is much to admire about the first half of the film, the part of me that is still a young boy who grew up watching John Wayne westerns with his father loves the shots of a herd of wild Buffalo, row after row of corn fields, cowboys riding on horseback through parched desert, and saloon shootouts all happening to a suitably grandiose soundtrack. This part of the film is pure western film making. It's nice to see Earp (Kevin Costner) interact with his father (Gene Hackman), see him go from a young law student who "never killed anyone" to a widower horse thief on the lam who bumps into the Masterson brothers, Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) while hunting Buffalo. We see him work as a card dealer for his brother James (David Andrews) and then unwittingly become a lawman after taking down a gun toting drunk. It's kind of cool to meet his other brothers Morgan (Linden Ashby) and Virgil (Michael Madsen), but around now, we are starting to get weighed down by too many characters. I'm still on board as we see Earp get banished from Dodge City and becomes a bounty hunter, meeting Doc Holliday (Dennis Quaid-very good) and then returning to Dodge City with his brothers to clean it up after the Sheriff is killed.And this is really where you should turn it off and watch Cosmatos's film. In the second half, Kasdan gets bogged down trying to maneuver around far too many characters, which is further exacerbated by placing Earp into a love triangle that takes up far too much time and focus, just as the movie is headed towards the climactic showdown at the OK Corral. Following said showdown, things continue to go fairly slowly, we get yet more time donated to Earp's love life while there are far more interesting things going on. From there it's a slog to the finish line, where we get a great flashback scene of Earp talking down a lynch mob. These are the scenes we want to see, not a girl drinking herself to death because her common law husband is sleeping with a prettier woman. Cosmatos was able to convey this without using up as much screen time.It's a shame the film get bogged down in its second half because Costner, Quaid, Sizemore, Hackman, Cinematographer Owen Roizman, and Composer James Newton Howard are all up for this and in fine form. Ultimately though, the film suffers from having too many characters, too much of a bland ,love triangle and being in the shadow of the more action oriented Tombstone, which took a more economical look at the same events. For its first half however, Wyatt Earp is both gorgeous to look at and an entertaining origin story of one of the most heavily mythologized figures of the American Wild West. Costner gives us an Earp that, if not capturing what the actual man was like, captures what he should have been like, while Quaid is not as memorable as Kilmer, but still excellent as Holliday.Wyatt Earp is something of a missed opportunity due to a weak second half, but is far from worthless. Helpfully on the DVD release I own, the first disc ends right when Earp cleans up Dodge City. For viewers this is a pretty good time to take it out and watch Cosmatos' Tombstone instead of disc 2. As a matter of fact, I may do that right now...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's The Best Doc Holiday</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's obvious that the writer of this little piece is not old enough to have seen all of the Wyatt Earp movies. It shows when he says something to the effect that Val Kilmer's is the best version of Doc Holliday. The Val Kilmer outing sucks when compared to Kirk Douglas' rendition. Even Victor Mature's Doc Holiday is better than Val Kilmer's. I suggest that the writer see ALL of the Wyatt Earp movies before making such rash and unfounded claims. As far as who made the better Wyatt Earp, again I'll have to go with the older actors. I'd pick Henry Fonda first, Burt Lancaster second, then Kevin Costner, and Kurt Russell in forth place.</fullReview>

Wyatt Earp born (Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp) March 19, 1848 left home at 17 had quite a few shortly lived jobs but mostly (to this day) is known for being a law enforcement officer that between him and his brothers and a couple of close friends had a heavy hand in instrumenting the taming of the outlaw wild west. October 26, 1881 Wyatt, Virgil &amp; Morgan Earp + Doc Holiday faced down Ike and Billy Clanton + the McLaury brothers at the O. K. Corral (Billy &amp; the McLaury's were dead, 'all' the others were wounded except Wyatt who was unscathed). In what took 30 seconds soon became the greatest gunfight in the history of the West. by Sireadslot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp is probably the lowest rated epic on this entire site. And why? Just because it is not a masterpiece? I consider Wyatt Earp to be a "near masterpiece"--just need of some more polishing in some areas. Let's face it, Wyatt Earp has no little problems but very few big problems which ultimately cost some fans. I would rather see a movie with no little problems and few big ones than one with many little problems and no big one. One facet that made Wyatt Earp a commercial failure was that is to this day still standing in the shadow of the more successful and better-liked Tombstone from one year prior which also deals with Wyatt Earp. While Tombstone deals with Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday's regiments in Tombstone, Wyatt Earp is a 3 hour and 10 minute biopic of the lawman's entire life. This film was originally intended to be a six hour miniseries. I wonder if it would have been better that way or if it would have just added fuel to the fire.Wyatt Earp is without question Kevin Costner's most underrated performance. He is low-key but on the whole, very accurate to the real Wyatt Earp; even more than Kurt Russell in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid steals every scene he is in as Doc Holliday. Quaid lost 43 pounds for the role and was closer to the real guy than Val Kilmer in Tombstone. The first chunk of the movie explores Earp's upbringing. He wants to be involved with the law and we all know his wish comes true. The casting call for young Wyatt was smart since the kid looked exactly like Kevin Costner at age 15. He grows up and marries a beautiful woman, but her early death takes a toll on him. I was really liking the movie a little while after her death. But as the story delves deeper into Wyatt's journey as a law enforcer, the movie really seems to lose its overall balance. From then on, the pace of the movie is very uneven and the subplots are all scrambled that make most of the movie quite confusing. The unevenness and bad pacing of the movie are the only two big flaws that impact the movie as a whole. Other than the pacing and unevenness, Wyatt Earp is a great western that almost anyone will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look, its a western! For those that want to travel back into the wild west days and see how it all came together the film delivers. You can critique anything but why? I enjoyed the horses, gun-play, acting and a bit of history too. Hey, pick a character and pretend its you and have some fun with this. One thing you learn about gun-play is that it can turn out many ways all unpredictable too. All who carry and then pull those smoke wagons believe they will prevail. History proves them wrong and the Earp brothers are not immortal either. However, they had a good run! My favorite line? "It all ends now".. backed by a shotgun and a few tight friends....Have a tasty drink or two, a decent snack and no texting during the movie except during the love scenes. They are standard here...One more thing, having a pal like Doc Holiday well they may not make them like that anymore...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A calm and thoughtful exercise... perhaps Costner's best performance as he evolves from a happy-go-lucky youth into a hardened and embittered man. Featuring solid supporting performances (including an excellent Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday), this is a serious film with few hollywood style bells and whistles. The pacing is slow but steady - Kasden obviously spent more energy on tone and content than he did on thrills for the popcorn crowd.

		<shortDescription>Too coincidental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it too coincidental that this movie was made in the same year Tombstone was. Both were long, tedious and fairly good and the one thing they had in common was the character Doc, played here by Dennis Quaid, who totally outshone Kevin Costner's leading role. I was so impressed by Dennis Quaid's acting that I thought he should've at least been nominated for a Best Supporting Actor (alongside Val Kilmer). Considering the storyline, maybe it was impossible to squeeze everything in within 2 hours but they should've tried, especially if they had Kevin Costner in the leading role. The length was bearable but Kevin Costner was not. He looked so emotionless and blank and his Western accent slurred from time to time. He could do with more acting lessons, otherwise he should stop labelling himself áctor and just call himself movie star (which is what most of them are anyway). The actresses did a fine job, especially Catherine O'Hara, who I hardly ever see in a serious role. They could've picked someone more mature than Joanna Going - she did OK but she looked more like Kevin Costner's daughter than his lover. This movie had content and depth but they lost out to Tombstone in style, direction and all-round acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had never seen Tombstone, I might have given this a 10. Tombstone is one of my favorite movies so I never saw any real reason to watch this. I actually purposely avoided watching this - would skip over it whenever I stumbled onto it while channel surfing. Now it's Winter, and I'm bored so I checked it out from my local library and decided to spend a snowy Sunday afternoon watching it. It was actually much better than I expected. Awfully long - I think the length could have been edited down. And to me it was a totally different perspective than Tombstone to the point that at times it was like two totally different stories. But I liked seeing the story of Wyatt and his first wife. I also liked seeing more about the relationships of the Earp brothers and their wives and their relationships with one another. I'm still not sure about going into so much detail about Josie and Wyatt - I kind of like the subtlety of how it is handled in Tombstone. I had difficulty keeping the bad guys straight - Tombstone delves deeper into each one of them. But I enjoyed watching it - a good way to spend an afternoon. I'd recommend taking a look!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wyatt Earp" is a great film. It's different from "Tombstone" in that it tells you the life of Wyatt Earp. Tombstone is just a part of Earp's life and if you don't know the whole story you can be lost, not knowing where he came from before he went to Tombstone, AZ, and you don't feel you know the character very well. "Wyatt Earp" covers Earp's life from boyhood to his older years after the famous shootout. The audience gets to know the person and feels more compassion and understanding for him. It's too bad this movie was not released BEFORE "Tombstone" as it would have set up the audience for "Tombstone". Randy Quaid is right-on as Doc, not overdoing the southern accent, and Gene Hackman is terrific as always. Costner is at his best which is great, reminiscent of Gary Cooper. The dialogue is very good: to the point, and Easy to understand, unlike some movies of today. The cinematography is beautiful and the direction and editing are great, in my opinion better than "Tombstone", which is also a terrific movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too reverent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wyatt Earp, the sheriff involved in the fight at the O.K. Corral, is logically an inconsequential figure in American history; but his story has endured, perhaps because it's perceived as embodying the nature of the wild west, and the fine line between the law and the outlaw. Here he gets a solemn, lengthy biopic in which thee famous shoot-out is just one incident among many. I find the usually obligatory comedy character a major irritant in most westerns, but I almost wished there was one in this movie, which proceeded with a total absence of humour. What it does contain is a very conservative rendering of Earp's interesting life, it's colourful developments played down as the rather one dimensional tale of a brave and heroic man looking out for his family. Keven Costner is predictably at home playing this boring yet righteous hero; Dennis Quaid as gunslinger Doc Holliday has all the best lines. But in a film this long, they're too and far between, and the failure to develop the political and economic context of the story, in favour of a straightforward celebration of Earp's courage and integrity, leaves the film without an excuse for its length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>never really gets going the way it should</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>three hours and ten minutes long and i didn't even realize i had seen it until there was about ten minutes left. actually there was a lot of it that seemed eerily familiar throughout the film, but i attributed that to the other three wyatt earp films i've seen - tombstone, my darling clementine, and gunfight at the o.k. corral. it gives the most complete, and probably most accurate, picture of wyatt earp of any of the four films. it approaches the story as an epic of one man and those who surrounded him. as a result it invests little in the secondary characters; to me this is one drawback of the film. one of the more interesting duos in film is doc holliday and wyatt earp because their relationship was so unique - earp was the law and holliday was a notorious criminal. holliday was a firebrand and earp was more collected. yet they got along and forged a meaningful and deep relationship. in addition to that, earp is an archetype of western culture and holliday is a timeless character - near death, fiercely individualistic, temperamental, and very capable. "wyatt earp" left most of that potential untapped. costner (earp) wasn't able to fill the shoes and quaid (holliday) didn't get the opportunity to be the force he should have been. we get to know wyatt earp, but i never felt like i was with him in his adventures. i watched him, but i never felt like we were let into his head and for an epic like this that's just unacceptable. it's well-filmed, perhaps a little bit too so. the filming felt too by the book. through most of the first half of the picture the story was told rather simply. daytime scenes would introduce an issue and nighttime scenes would see the resolution to that issue. scenes would alternate very methodically - day/night, day/night, day/night. later in the film things opened up a bit. the cinematography was good looking, but i preferred the photography in "open range." overall the true story and its legend hold a great deal of potential, but this film never really gets going the way it should have. watch tombstone instead.

		<fullReview>This is just one of those films for people who love good stories. If you aren't into taking the time to get to know the characters and understanding what in their lives has motivated them to become who they became, then this is not the film for you. If you're curious, however, to delve into a film that inspires you to invest time in the characters - this is a GREAT choice.Wyatt Earp had me hook, line and sinker from the first scene to the last roll of the credits. The visuals are breathtaking and the musical score by James Newton Howard is one of my all time favorites. Kevin Costner has earned awards such as "Western Heritage Award" I would think because of his work in films like this one. The man can make a moment without any lines one of the most tell-tale moments in a film. Not a flashy over the top performer, Costner loans an integrity to his characters and you watch the weight of someone real being portrayed up on the screen - whether they were real or not. That is not an easy feat but he does it seamlessly - character to character. I think he is a very underestimated talent and he is one of my favorites.That Dennis Quaid did not get recognition for his performance as "Doc Holliday" is indicative of how unfair and biased the whole process of noticing talented work is in the film industry. Had the film been "more Hollywood" or a "box-office hit" I'm sure Dennis Quaid would have a few trophies in his sock drawer because of his work. He was amazing and whether recognized or not he has those moments preserved forever so that many new, unbiased faces can see and acknowledge his work.The script is beautiful and you get to witness the change of this young dreamer into this hardened man that is the Wyatt Earp of American history. Not an easy guy, not an easy life....but loyal...loyal to the very end...to his family, to his carefully chosen friends and to his written in stone beliefs.A very engaging character study brought to life by a tremendously talented actor and team of actors, within a wonderfully written script.Wyatt Earp is an A+...all the way. The DVD is available on May 18th...I'll be watching it again, May 19th.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of reviewers have commented that this movie is long and slow and therefore boring. I agree with the former, but it is hardly boring. A leisurely film, it is slow in the same way as a very good meal or very good sex. It takes the time to develop some sense of the lead character, perhaps helping us to understand why he acts the way he does.Kevin Costner's deadpan delivery was perfect for the role. It's the same character he plays in all of his movies but this time it was right. The supporting cast were also excellent, especially Dennis Quaid as "Doc" Holiday. Oh, and it was great to see JoBeth Williams again.This film will naturally be compared to "Tombstone". Tombstone was a fine piece of cinematic entertainment and it had a lot more fast paced action. So did Starship Troopers. If you want an amusing shoot-em-up, watch Tombstone. But if you want an insight into the life and times of Wyatt Earp, complete with the flavour of the era, "Wyatt Earp" should not be overlooked.</fullReview>

Kurt Russell is a much better Wyatt Earp than Coster. What about Doc Holliday you ask? Whereas Val Kilmer's Doc was an unforgettable scene stealer, Quaid's is laughable. I am a Quaid fan, but his acting in this movie must be his worst ever. He does not do eccentric characters well -- witness his turn in Great Balls of Fire...uh, on the other hand - don't. Back to the comparisons: EVERYTHING in tombstone is better -- the acting, the sets, the clothes, the plot, and most importantly the action. Tombstone is arguably the best western ever. This is yet another Costner floperoo. Why he still gets roles is beyond my comprehension. He ruins every movie he touches.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Tribute to An American Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seldom in cinema does a film capture so majestically the Old West and the men who tamed it. Masterfully directed by Lawrence Kasdan and superbly acted by Kevin Costner, this is the finest biography of Wyatt Earp ever placed on celluloid. Many have tried and failed to convey the violent nature of the time period and the supreme challenges faced by those who swore to uphold the law. In this extraordinary motion picture, the era is brought to life so realistically and with such depth that one almost chokes on the trail dust. Costner delivers his most stunning performance and sets the screen ablaze with his portrayal of Earp. It is such powerful work that he dominates the screen and stands astride the landscape that is photographed so beautifully. Dennis Quaid gives a truly overwhelming performance as Doc Holliday and so successfully brings the character to life that he seems to literally becomes him in flesh and blood. As a Western, this is of tremendous scope yet intimate enough that we grow to know the characters as if we were one of them. There is action but also great truth in this story of Earp the Lawman, a complex and determined man of heroic stature. What we witness with this motion picture is true greatness, uncompromising magnificence, and incredible artistry. It is indeed the ultimate tribute to one of the great men in the history of this nation, a man focused on bringing peace and justice to an uncivilized, savage territory. Not only bullets came from the barrel of his Peacemaker. So did the ultimate meaning of Law. He did not only shed blood. He also spread the seeds of what would be a new society. Kasdan has created a lasting tribute to a heroic figure and Costner has given what may well be the performance of his lifetime in bringing Wyatt Earp to the screen in a way that surpasses all that has come before in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far Better Than Tombstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say that I saw this film before I saw Tombstone but I have to say, upon further review, this is so far the superior film it's not even funny. It's been 14 years now since these were put out and the more I watch them, the wider the gap between the two films becomes. Quaid is a far superior Doc Holliday. Costner, a far superior Earp. The biggest difference though is in the writing. So many of the lines in Tombstone come across as corny and contrived. They are, for lack of a better term, "goofy." Wyatt Earp the film is the grandiose and much more realistic-seeming film. The characters are better developed and the writing is clearly more polished. I don't particularly like either of the Morgan Earp characters in either film, but Virgil Earp again is portrayed much better in Wyatt Earp than Tombstone's Sam Elliott, who basically does his usual and plays Sam Elliott rather than a character. At the end of the day, I've sat through Wyatt Earp about eight times. I've watched Tombstone twice and I've decided there won't be a third. It doesn't stand the test of time at all. Earp does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will the real Wyatt Earp please stand up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent movie with fine direction by Lawrence Kasdan and fine acting ,good score, and great visuals. I am somewhat of a history buff, so I usually look for some degree of accuracy in movies about historical figures. This film did not disappoint me in that regard.For those who would compare Tombstone to this film, I say they are two completely different stories, as is obvious from their titles! Tombstone is the story of the shootout in Tombstone, with most of the action and plot development centering around those few seconds in history. It is an enjoyable and entirely watchable movie, but is more about how good Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer, and Sam Elliot look in those long black coats and black pants.It is a Hollywood version, portraying Wyatt Earp as what we would like our heroes to be.Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp on the other hand is a movie about exactly what it purports to be--the life and character of the man. It tells his whole story until 17 years after the events at the OK Corral. And I have to say it is a very good characterization. I really liked that besides being MUCH more historically correct than Tombstone, Costner's Earp was a flawed hero--if even a hero at all. The incidents in Earp's early life that were less than heroic, and in fact downright illegal were related without varnish. It was made clear to me in this film that Earp was a shady character and a rough customer in many ways--not a larger-than-life good guy.The film even portrayed the fact (well-documented in history) that his sister-in-law and others in the family thought Wyatt could be an arrogant, cold bastard sometimes! The genesis of the love affair between Josie Marcus and Wyatt Earp was told in a much more realistic and much less romantic light. They cheated--she on John Behan, he on the woman he had considered his wife. Even the possibility that the historical portrait of Earp's common-law wife Mattie as a pathetic dope-fiend arose after the fact, to let Earp and his lover off the hook, and to foster the good guy myth, is touched on in this version.I did not watch this movie in the theater, and might have found the length a little hard to bear in that setting, but on DVD, I had no problem remaining riveted to the story as it unfolded. It is an epic version of the important events in Earp's life that shaped the man, and should not be confused or compared with other movies (no matter how great!) that center on 15 seconds in history.Tombstone vs. Wyatt Earp---why not watch them both? Just don't simplistically expect the same things from them, as clearly stated by the titles, they are two different stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Defined.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boring story about the infamous Wyatt Earp (Kevin Costner) and his many adventures. To say any more about this film than that would be quite pointless. It's just not worth wasting time on.I've tried to watch "Wyatt Earp" some two or three times, and only succeeded once at viewing it the entire way through. It's too long, too boring, and too darn dry--Costner's casting doesn't help there. (I mourn for the days of "The Untouchables" and "No Way Out.")2/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Movie is one of the best directed movies of our century! Kasdan can direct. Costner performs Earp genuinely and Quaid's award-winning performance as Doc Holiday is far superior than Kilmer's Doc. How anyone could begin to compare these two movies... it's absolutely mind-blowing.. Tombstone is poorly developed, performed and executed... Any so-called "critic" on IMDb should, at the very least, know the difference between a good movie and a bad movie.6.1? Watch it again and Pay Attention this time! Whaaa.. too long.. does that make a movie bad? Then watch the other half next week! Otherwise, don't waste our time; go watch Matrix or the NEW Star Wars junkies</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NON HISTORICAL GARBAGE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could have titled "Issac Newton" because the story bears about as much of a resemblance to his life as it does that of Wyatt Earp's. Some filmmakers will never learn that the truth or a semblance of it can be just as interesting as their imagination. This movie is a historically inacurate tale purporting to be about Earp and is actually nothing more than a plotless, western soap opera with some shootings. I gave it a 2 out of 10 instead of a 1 simply because the visual effects and cinematography are good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent and famous character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A true story mind you. So it has to be good. It is well filmed, well presented, suspenseful enough. But the general frame of the western and life on the frontier is not disrupted in any way by any unforeseeable element. A few original points yet.To become the sheriff of a city like Tombstone, or any other of the type, is banal for a horse thief who is running away from justice and the recollection of his first wife who died of diphtheria when pregnant. One deserves a second chance.To have two brothers as his deputies is a lot more original. To get into a rivalry with a gang of bad boys is also banal. But to get through without one wound of any sort while one of his brothers is killed and the other one nearly loses his right arm and will be handicapped if not crippled all his life, is rather more interesting.Then to swear vengeance and to just go away and make sure the gang is destroyed one at a time after the first confrontation that killed a few is banal, but to be married happily on the west coast and to be seen last going to Alaska to take part in a gold rush while the gang members are getting killed is probably less common place.What's left at the end? The vision of an original character, of a man of honor in a situation where honor is rather cheap, of a judge who is honest and of a county sheriff or marshal who is crooked, of a second "wife" who is more a fair arrangement to be able to go incognito in the Far West, for both the man and the woman, and finally of the third and last wife who is brought into this western situation as a potential shady lady by a dishonorable male character.What's the most important element is the fact that the three brothers are like one and for them family, and in fact blood is everything that counts, and we could add friendship between a couple of men that makes them absolutely loyal to each other. That's probably what Walt Whitman called the "manly love of comrades."Entertaining though slightly long, but a decent intensity all along.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wyatt Earp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Months after the film Tombstone was released came this film, but it instead shows the full life journey of one of history's greatest lawmen, from Razzie nominated director Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill). It shows Wyatt Earp (Razzie winning Kevin Costner, also producing) growing up on the corn farm with his father Nicholas (Gene Hackman) and brothers Virgil (Michael Madsen), James (David Andrews) and Morgan (Linden Ashby). Then grown up, he marries sweetheart Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish), who soon after died from typhus, while pregnant, and Wyatt burned their house and all possessions inside, turning to a life of crime to survive, forcing him to run away from Missouri to Dodge City. It is there he first makes a living skinning wilder beasts with brothers Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) Masterson, then he builds a reputation as a good lawman, grows his moustache, meets partner Doc Holliday (a near show-stealing Dennis Quaid) who is slowly dying of tuberculosis, and makes sure all townspeople do not have any guns. I kind of lost my understanding of what was going on in the last hour or so, but it was still worth seeing the events in Tombstone and O.K. Corral. Also starring Catherine O'Hara as Allie Earp, Isabella Rossellini as Big Nose Kate, Téa Leoni as Sally, Navy NCIS's Mark Harmon as Johnny Behan and The Passion of the Christ's James Caviezel as Warren Earp. The performances are all good, the story has compelling moments, and all scenes seem beautifully filmed, a pretty good epic western drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and for some reason, it won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple for Costner and any of his three (film) wives. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still dancing with wolves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Costner's films continue without heart or soul. Each is an appendage to the only film he ever made. This episode is more properly judged in the genre of videos, as this film substitutes any plot or character development, and certainly any acting for bland cinematography and overdone music. Discard comments regarding sexism and ignore comparisons to Tombstone, I feel sorry for him and his costars, some of whom actually deliver strong, believable performances. Doc Holliday is always entertaining. I was particularly saddened that the writers chose to trivialize the friendship between Doc and Wyatt by basing it upon a few meaningful looks and friendly handshakes. Showing Doc save Wyatt's life would have made for better watching and historical accuracy. And may I say, I love this legend...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly sexist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wyatt Earp" was where I started to catch on, and the likes of "Waterworld" and "Message in a Bottle" have confirmed it. Kevin Costner considers himself God's gift to women, yet deep down, he has a frightening streak of sexism that affects all his work.I lost track of how many times in "Wyatt Earp" Costner or someone else tells a woman to "shut up." Usually, the men are upset because those stupid, non-blood-relation women are complaining about having to move and/or be shot at all the time.When the women aren't making unreasonable demands like that, they cling to him saying things like "I just want to be close to you." Translation: you don't have to marry me or even treat me well, just allow me to hang around and gaze at you adoringly.Yet "Wyatt Earp" would still be bad without this sexism. It's too long, melodramatic in the extreme.</fullReview>
