		<shortDescription>Legend of Tarzan -- Pulp Poetry With a Beating Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L. Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a little too much. Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan erupts instantly and spectacularly with a combination of physical force and gut-chilling animal sounds and pins the American to a wall, then growls out the words: "They have my wife, and their families." In this single small moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality ? and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart. Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan and Jane (a luminous and effective Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified life in London, where Tarzan has claimed his birthright of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke. He is drawn back to Africa at the behest of George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a black American journalist who is based on the historical figure who led the exposure of the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium. Williams recruits him to assist in Williams' quest to investigate the suspected crimes of King Leopold. Accompanied by Jane, the two men return to Africa where Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has laid a trap for Tarzan that, if successful, will result in Rom delivering Tarzan to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who seeks to deliver vengeance to Tarzan for killing Mbonga's son many years earlier. Mayhem and adventure ensues.When Edgar Rice Burroughs was firing on all cylinders, his pulpy, emotionally infused adventure novels were able to strike a mythic vein that caused him to become the J.K. Rowlings of his day ? the first global superstar pop culture author, translated into 57 languages, his books and characters embedded in cultures from Russia to Turkey and Japan. At the time of his death in 1950 he was the best known author on the planet with his works selling more than the combined sales of his contemporaries Hemingway, Faulkner, and Joyce. Hollywood tried more than fifty times and although the movies obviously met with success ? not one of them ever captured what the grand old pulp master had created on the page. Yates is the first to do it; his Legend of Tarzan stands head and shoulders above the Tarzan movies that came before it?and regardless of how it fares in the crowded summer theatrical marketplace, it is assured of a place in cinema history as the Tarzan movie that captured the heart and spirit of Burroughs' creation.It remains to be seen how 2016 audiences react. Has Tarzan's time on the world stage passed, or is there indeed something mythic and archetypal that can cause the character to come alive in the modern imaginations? Yates and his team have given it an extraordinary "best shot" and have created something of heart, beauty, and lasting value. The editing of the film by Mark Day is taut and streamlined ?not a moment is wasted and the story drives forward with energy and commitment; Henry Braham's cinematography is cool and brooding in London, and lush and earthy in Africa; the production design by Stuart Craig is grand and evocative; and the music by Rupert Gregson Williams is both emotional and pulse-quickening. Special mention goes to screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer who updated the Burroughs material, giving it unexpected historical gravitas, while excavating from the pages of the early Tarzan books the core values that made them unique. And the CGI wizardry is seamless, photo-realistic, and effective on all levels.Give Legend of Tarzan a chance to work its magic on you. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LEGEND OF TARZAN--A Common Sense Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's simple. If what you want is a live-action version of the Disney cartoon, or a remake of those old "Me Tarzan, you Jane" camp fests, this isn't the film for you. If you don't like the character to begin with, this isn't the film for you. The vast majority of critics who thus far have given the movie unfavorable reviews fall into one or both of these two categories. It's disheartening, and it's so obvious they don't really know anything about the character and don't care enough to learn.If, however, you have yearned for the day in cinema when Edgar Rice Burroughs' epic hero is treated with the gravitas and respect he deserves, and if you enjoy epic jungle adventure with a heart, by all means GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is phenomenally good! Think of it like you would a dish of food. Let's say spiced curry. If you don't like spiced curry, you won't like it no matter how well it is prepared. This movie is for those who enjoy spiced curry. For those who love it, this is the most delicious dish you're ever likely to taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but never boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really surprised at the mediocre reviews so far of this film. Honestly when I first heard about the film I had little interest in seeing it, but the trailer was better than I expected, and when has Christoph Waltz been anything short of terrific in every role he has played, but particularly when he is a bad guy. (Come to think of it has he ever been a good guy?) The whole cast is solid, and I really liked the historical setting concerning the Belgian King Leopold and his exploitation of the Congo. I found all the animals and the CGI to be surprisingly cheesy. Undoubtedly the weakest link in the film, but that factor did not subtract much from a constantly entertaining and solid story. Besides the cheesy CGI the rest of the film looked terrific. I would recommend to see it on the big screen. It will probably lose a lot on smaller screens. Good summer popcorn film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan is Magnifique!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just experienced The Legend of Tarzan, and in the immortal words of the Countess Olga de Coude "Magnifique!" is the only thing that I can think. Sadly, I arrived at the theater for the early release of TLOT to an empty theater. I sat alone in the center of the empty theater reading my copy of The Return of Tarzan quietly in wait for the movie to begin. Slowly a few other viewers trickled in but sadly, the theater might as well have been completely empty. The previews for other movies came and went as previews do and then the opening of this long awaited Tarzan began.I sat in rapture as Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan came to life in front of my eyes. Yes, It IS ERB's Tarzan. There are liberties that Mr. Yates took with the characters and locations, but all in all, THIS IS TARZAN as he was meant to be. Quiet, Strong, Passionate, steely eyed... "Magnifique!" The Mangani are Mangani. They are not chimps nor gorillas. They are huge, magnificent beasts. Were Mr. Burroughs alive today, I wholeheartedly believe that he would jump up and down like a young child shouting "YES! YES! That's them!"Kala is every child's mother, protective and loving. The relationship between Tarzan and her is perfectly portrayed. The love Tarzan feels for his ape mother is passed on to the movie viewer to be felt, not just seen.The panoramic views of the jungle are even as ERB described them to be. Dark, foreboding, beautiful and deadly. It is the jungle of Tarzan.This is not an action movie in the vein of Captain America or any of the modern action movies. It is a story. A very well told story of adventure driven by the love of a man for his mate. Is there action? Of course there is action. It wouldn't be Tarzan without action. But first and foremost, it is a very well written and delivered story. It is a story that Edgar Rice Burroughs himself would have told. He would be proud and finally relieved that his creation had finally come to life in a manner that does justice to his creative genius.I sat through the movie mesmerized. Spellbound. It ended just like it should, you won't be disappointed. As the credits began to roll, I quietly stood up, still in a mostly empty theater, and walked out to my awaiting truck to drive home and write this review.If people listen to the critics who did not like this movie, they will be missing out.For those of us who love the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!I wish I could say more, there is so much to say. I'll end this with this. I'll go see it again, and again and when it comes out on DVD, I'll own it and watch it till I have seen it as many times as I have read the books, which is really saying something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend of Tarzan, A Really Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They finally portrayed the Tarzan character more like Burroughs wrote him! This is the best Tarzan movie I have ever seen. The acting is superb, and the settings are beautiful. The movie was so good that it seemed like I wanted it to last longer. It was sheer entertainment!The stars of the film were really excellent in their roles, and I thought the two main characters perfectly played their roles. The rest of the cast were excellent also. The story moves along briskly, and the plot is very effective. I believe people will enjoy it, even if they know nothing about Tarzan. This is a very enjoyable movie, and I recommend it. We are going to see it again this weekend and bring our family and friends!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a painfully unoriginal and unengaging story of paint-by-number characters getting at it in the green room for 90% of the time, go see this movie.The most deplorable thing about this movie - aside from the plot being an incoherent mess - is the way the villains are portrayed as caricatures, and the good guys as saints who can do no wrong. I don't know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the story.tl;dr lots of CG, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How, in this modern day, with such high standards of education and courses on script writing and film making, can a big budget film like this one be so bad? It was only because we watched in it Gold Class, in comfortable seats and with food service, that we didn't walk out.After about fifteen minutes my partner leaned over to me and asked when anything was going to happen (in the movie that is). I couldn't help her.In fact my seat was so comfortable, and the movie so bad, that I fell asleep three times.When my partner told me she thought this was the worst movie ever, and that she was confused, I couldn't help her again - I'd been asleep.I did however witness the butterfly land on Jane's shoulder, then fly off. What a beautiful CGI scene. Totally irrelevant to the plot or story, and I'm still not sure why it was included.Then there was the scene when giant ostriches nearly trample Tarzan and his mate. At last, I thought, something is going to happen. Tarzan's mate asks Tarzan what did the Ostrich say. Tarzan replies something like - "The Ostrich is telling you it can trample you." And then, the Ostriches run off. That's the last we see of them. Confused? I was.The writers and director don't know whether Tarzan is Spider Man, Batman or some other action hero - but he certainly isn't Tarzan.The poor old apes get a very bad rap here. They are huge, aggressive monsters with razor sharp teeth.This movie is a showcase of when bad script writing, bad directing and masses of CGI meet.I can only recommend this film to people watching it on late night TV, when they need to be put to sleep.What would Tarzan say about this movie: AwwwwwwOaaaaaaaaWhaaaaaaOn a side note, it is interesting to see that people that rate this movie high, usually have only one review in their list - this one. This usually means that they have some connection to the film.(Edit 2 days later) I rest my case. After posting this review, 6 positive reviews have been posted after mine, all saying this is the greatest movie ever, and 4 of the reviewers have only 1 review to their name - this movie, and the other two reviewers have 2 reviews to their name. With a ratio of 6 biased reviews to 1 honest review, no wonder it is getting so hard to trust the IMDb rating system anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started off quite well, for a movie I had quite mediocre expectations it caught my interest when it introduces some interesting characters with mixed motives, unfortunately that and a few good cinematic shots is where the praise ends for this movie.This movie had potential which only makes it even more disappointing,we're first introduced to Tarzan as a British politician and is then forced to rediscover his wildness but lacks any real character and only comes across one dimensional with the traits of an angsty teen who's marriage we're supposed to care about but I'm not sure whyThis movie tries to incorporate way to many elements, the overall plot about the enslaving the Congo and getting rich from a mythical city full of jewels that we're not even allowed to see at any point combined with fueds with passed foes that don't really come to any settlement a tribe leader that had his son killed by Tarzan that wants revenge, gorilla brother that wants him dead, trying for a baby and flashbacks of a potentially better film we could have had, they rush through these very quickly without really developing or keeping your interest Some really awful scenes, Samuel Jackson who I'm not sure needed to be in this movie jumps off cliffs only to land unscathed on a branch, combined with a very predictably unsatisfying ending that couldn't of come fast enough and causally wrapped up with all the bad guys defeated, they may as well have froze in the air jumping to the backdrop of a sunset, with the joy of sweet release as the credits rolled to only leave me with a face like a bulldog eating a wasp and annoyed and frustrated that I have wasted time and money sitting through another failed sequel that is sure to fade into obscurity Overall this movie lacks any fun or adventure, poorly directed as this movie lacks any identify, wouldn't recommend this film to anyone other than my worst enemy, all round disappointment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY!!! The Tarzan film fans have been waiting for!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FLASHBACK: 1998? Having tracked the project from pre-production to final release, and with all the excitement and anticipation I'd built up for the film, I entered a dark theater in Little Rock, AR completely jacked UP to see "Tarzan And The Lost City". It was the Saturday noon matinée, first weekend of the release. Having read the original novels as a youth, I was looking so forward to the movie that would do justice for a modern audience regarding the character I grew up loving, dispelling all the silly pop-cultural stereotypes and giving him a proper and fitting introduction. I got the best seat in the house that day, but for the wrong reason as I looked around and realized I was the only one in the room. Optimistically, I later joked with friends that I'd gotten a "private screening" of the film. A few years later, I ended up launching my Tarzan fansite, TARZAN.CC, utilizing many graphics pilfered from the "Tarzan and the Lost City" website to emulate the look. It was my tribute to the film. And I soon began that journey of excitement and anticipation yet again for the new rumored Warner Bros. Tarzan project. I'd love to chronicle that adventure here, but it would distract from this review so I'll sum it up by recognizing the names of the fallen on that journey: Director John August, Director Guillermo del Toro and Screenwriter John Collee, Director Stephen Sommers? I finally lost hope that the film would ever come to fruition.And then, a few years beyond a decade later, Warner Bros. were basically told to get their act together or lose their option on the project. And they stepped up to the challenge in spades with "THE LEGEND OF TARZAN".Just last Tuesday, I was privileged to attend a private early screening with the film's producers, members of the Edgar Rice Burroughs family, several very esteemed persons tightly connected to the Tarzan universe in film, print, art, and fandom, plus a few friends I brought along to see how they received it.On all fronts, "The Legend of Tarzan" was a KNOCK OUT OF THE PARK!!! A state of the art theater on the studio's own lot packed to the brim with eager fans; once again, the BEST seat in the house (depending on your tolerance). I was 2nd row center, with a HUGE screen in front of me and the killer audio rattling me to the bones.The reaction to the film was UNANIMOUS as we applauded straight through the final credits. Finally, a studio who put the money necessary into producing the RIGHT film. Finally, a screenwriter and director who cared enough about the source material to fight hard for their vision of the film, and get the right actors for the job. And FINALLY? a film worthy of the original character of Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs' original novels, with all his power, fearlessness, and without hesitation toward action against insurmountable challenges.See this film expecting to see a fitting representation of real heroism driven by love, dedication, and absolute resolve. This generation has been sorely deprived of these types of positive, character-inspiring role models as marketing peeps have instead perfected the profitable art of catering to and nurturing our more dangerous, self-destructive instincts and childlike demands for instant gratification? and our society has unarguably become weaker for it. It's time for a whole new generation to rediscover their primal drive to love and protect their own, fight for their place in this world, and establish their individuality as leaders instead of followers. This is the film we've been WAITING for, and I'm encouraging people to drop their concepts and preconceptions, see the film, and learn from it. This is an ERB novel realized on screen, a true pulp adventure beautifully brought to life with dramatic excellence, and for new folks it might require the ability to step outside their familiar world for a moment to appreciate. If it doesn't quite grab you the first time through, a second viewing is highly recommended.AAA+++ 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Legend of Tarzan" is joyous.Since childhood, this is the Tarzan I've wanted to see on screen, faithful in spirit to the Burroughs novels. The jungle is raw. The dangers are "real." The villains are badder than bad. The historical period may not fully satisfy the Tarzan chronologists, but it's close enough and serves the exciting story it wants to tell. The gorillas are gorillas-plus (mangani). We even get a glimpse of the gates of Opar.But most important, the portrayals of Tarzan and Jane are spot-on. You believe this couple from start to finish.Is the movie perfect? Probably not, but it comes so damn close that I don't care.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan was really fun to watch. Much more fun than the marketing made it look. There was some romance to be sure but it is much more a bromance between Tarzan and George Washington Williams. Skarsgard and Jackson were marvelous to watch and their scenes together snapped and sparked. Skarsgard is a superb Tarzan and plays the role with restrained abandon if that makes sense. The action/fight scenes were absolutely fantastic. I wish there had been more of them. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The cinematic beauty of the movie is astounding. An crucial aspect of the overall character of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underwhelming turn for David Yates.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here is yet another Tarzan adaptation. This isn't the Tarzan you know from the Disney movie. No, this time we see him start out in England as a gentleman, celebrity of sorts. People all know who he his and his origin. For a moment I thought the film would be smart enough to know that we, as an audience, also know this origin story. But this ain't that kinda movie. Outside of being a "new" take on the mythical man raised by apes there isn't anything remotely new about this movie. It still tells us his origin in laziest way possible and it still follows a three act structure that we have seen a couple thousand times over.As I blankly starred at the jumbled mess I was watching on screen I couldn't think of a single thing I hated, nor a single thing I loved. This is one of those movies that just kind of exists. There isn't anything that is glaringly bad about the movie at all. There aren't moments of unintentional comedy but, what's worse, is that there aren't even moments of fun to be had.The only person that seemed to be committed at all was Sam L Jackson. Who always seems to have a good time regardless of what movie he is in. Which often makes for the only bright spot in some movies, like this one. He alone makes this films dialogue sound almost good. But that is not the case with literally every other actor. All of which just seem to be playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Either exaggeratedly bored or exaggeratedly upbeat. Neither of which works for this retelling at all. This could be due to just poor directing. David Yates looked to be more interested in putting style into his picture rather than making things natural.But his "style" only goes as far the basic sequences of chatting. Any other time the shots are either so shaky that things are incomprehensible or the camera twists and turns so much that nausea will come to all. If there was one thing that was consistently worse than anything else in movie was the special effects.The animals and environments that utilize CG are so obnoxiously noticeable, it's sometimes painful to watch. The second biggest part of the Tarzan tale is the apes and their CG is absolutely the worst. Every time they show themselves on screen resulted in me cringing into the depths of my padded seat.At the end of day I was actually glad we didn't see the story everyone knows. If we got that movie we would've had to endure more of those dreadful apes. None of which have any personality or presence in the film at all. And, worse yet, is the characters. Who are so bland that even when they talked to each they seemed bored with the others lack luster persona. What's strange about this movie is that the majority of these negatives, are met with a near immediate positive. Some of the shot compositions are great while others are very by the numbers. Every time I find myself hating a certain thing in the movie something similar would happen but it would be done much better. This left me feeling nothing after it ended. Other than the straight awful characters there isn't anything in this movie to love or hate. As each was met by something that would negate the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Done Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More and more lately I am discovering a disconnect between myself and the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend of Tarzan. As far as live-action interpretations of Tarzan go, this and Greystoke are the two champs, with The Legend of Tarzan edging out Greystoke by a teeny bit.The Legend of Tarzan is unique in that it's not an origin story. While the origins of Tarzan are explored in a few flashback scenes (reminding me a lot of Batman Begins), the movie is really about John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke (aka Tarzan's real name and title). Tarzan has been living in England with Jane for the past few years and has left the jungle behind him, but when he is asked to help expose a slavery ring in the Congo, he is drawn back to Africa.Harry Potter director, David Yates, manages to breathe new life into Tarzan thanks to the modern technological wizardry that CGI enables. The vast majority of this movie was all shot on sets in England, with pretty much all of the animals and African environments created by a computer. This sells the reality of the story, much in the same way that The Jungle Book did a few months back. Of course what really makes this movie resonant is not the craft on display, but the story between Tarzan and Jane.Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie portray Tarzan and Jane in this movie, and they actually make you care about these two characters. Skarsgard plays Tarzan as a stoic gentleman trying not to be the animal he was raised to be, while Robbie portrays the feistiest Jane you've ever seen. Then there's the charisma and humor of Samuel L. Jackson as real-life historical figure, Dr. George Washington Williams, who joins Tarzan on his quest to save the Congo. Couple that with Christoph Waltz being Christoph Waltz as the bad guy, Leon Rom, and you've got a fun, emotionally resonant pulp adventure that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, would most likely be proud of.When it gets right down to it, don't listen to the critics on this one. Your enjoyment of The Legend of Tarzan all relies on how much you enjoy the idea of Tarzan in general. If you think Tarzan is hokey, then this movie probably isn't for you, but there is nothing wrong with the movie itself. The script is good, the movie is well directed, the cinematography and musical score are beautiful, and there are many well choreographed action sequences. The bottom line is, if you have an affinity for the character, The Legend of Tarzan is the Tarzan movie you've been looking for.I give The Legend of Tarzan a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really one of the top ten worst films I've seen in my life. The plot was paper thin, if there was a plot at all. I knew going into this that it was going to be mostly about the digital gorillas, the babe, and the hunk. What I didn't expect was the flimsy dialogue, scenes unconnected to the "plot" and such miserable drivel coming out of the mouths of the actors. I was also surprised by the pseudo environmentalist doctrine they weave into the plot. The babe is being taken away by the bad guys to her death and the only thing she can say is, "Promise me you wont hurt the animals." Really? The best line in the movie is when the black guy says, "Can we just stop this?" My sentiments exactly. The overly sensitive, crying, cannibal warlord was a bit too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what I've just watched, and trust me, only the freezing cold NZ winter day could have kept me inside watching this dross. Oh, and Alexander Skarsgard's chest. I admit that. Where do I start? I get that we've moved into a world where everything white and male is bad, and everything black and female is good, but seriously? Trying to squeeze the Tarzan legend into that narrative as well? Why not write your own damn stories and leave ones like this in the past. So, we have every single non-white person heroic; every single white person psychopathic (except Tarzan, of course. Even Hollywood can't write the narrative which puts Samuel L Jackson into the actual Tarzan role. Yet). I resent having to pay for this ludicrous propaganda. I studied African history for my degree. Where do you think the slave trade originated? Who stopped it? Yeah, go do some research and answer those questions for yourself. I think at the end of this movie (I don't care if there are spoilers ahead; this film is THAT bad) Tarzan and Jane have opted to stay in a squalid African hut to have their baby because, ya know, who'd want a huge manor house in England with servants and hygiene? I give up. This film makes me want to stop watching movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going Ape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;? out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A conventional approach to the Tarzan story which swings back and forth, without getting anywhere. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: The story of a little boy who goes ape.JIM'S REVIEW: There have been many incarnations of the Tarzan legend, starting with Edgar Rice Burroughs original 1914 novel, Tarzan of the Apes. Our ape man has appeared in magazines, novels, comic books, movies, radio, cartoons, and television shows, all with varying degrees of success. Various actors have filled his loincloth, from the most famous actor in this role, Johnny Weissmuller in the 1940's, to Gordon Scott in the 1950's and Ron Ely taking hold of those vine reins in the mid 60's. His legend lives on once again in this modern day re-boot, The Legend of Tarzan, with Alexander Skarsg?rd as our muscle-toned hero. The story adheres to its source and follows the basic outline of Burrough's novel. Told in flashbacks, we learn of an infant left in the jungle without parents and adopted by the great apes. Tarzan, now John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, lived and thrives in his tropical environs until he was rescued and returned to England. Having difficulty readjusting to British society, he finds a comrade in the beautiful Jane Porter (a beguiling Margot Robbie). Upon his return to his childhood home in the Congo, Greystoke (a.k.a. Tarzan) discovers man's cruelty in the form of Belgian huntsman, Leon Rom (a typecast Christoph Waltz, playing, what else, but the villain). Whereupon Tarzan must takes sides to protect his adopted tribe of primates and protect his homeland.Mr. Skarsg?rd plays Tarzan as an eloquent victim, more at home with his hairy friends than his human species. No "Me Tarzan, you Jane" monosyllabic banter here, and no loincloth either. This Tarzan mixes the physicality and brutishness of Stanley Kowalski with the sophistication and aplomb of a true noble gentleman, no small feat. If only the film matched his interpretation also.The Legend of Tarzan is all too proper and seriously-minded which cuts down on the fun and adventure. David Yates directs his film solidly, keeping the action moving. Yet the production design by Stuart Craig seems too well-crafted for its own good, nothing out of place. It lacks authenticity in its detailing. This man-made jungle is just too pristine, so clean and sanitized just like its story. (When the vines look suspiciously like greenish rubber tubes and the cragged rocks like painted styrofoam, something is a bit off.) The special effects aren't that special either. Except for the primates, most of the animal kingdom is obviously the results of CGI, effective but slightly unreal and unsatisfying.On the plus side, the fluid camera-work by Henry Braham has an acrobatic energy, especially as Tarzan travels from vine to vine, the best part of the cinematic experience. Mark Day's fine editing enhances the effect. The panoramic vistas help to give the film a sense of epic adventure, even if the adventures we witness never attain the grandeur of other epic film tales due to its script.The narrative structure swings from its more interesting backstories (Tarzan's early life and upbringing, his adaptation to his aristocratic England, Jane's personal journey) which are only hinted, to the standard main story dealing with The Great White Hunter's poaching of ivory, diamonds, and the slave trade...granted all important subjects, but the treatment is painted in the most black and white terms with the widest of brushstrokes. That's the problem...there are no grey stokes in this Greystoke's version.None of the characters are remotely real or believable, but the roles are well cast. There is a nice chemistry between the two leads, although their beauty reminds us too often of an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. Both are gorgeous human specimens who fortunately can act, even if the dialog that they are given by screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, is banal and stilted.Given strong support is Samuel L. Jackson as the real life George Washington Williams, a political activist and do-gooder, but his character, as written, speaks in anachronistic modern day jargon. Still the actor brings much needed bravado and is amusing in his role. Djimon Hounsou as the avenging chief does some effective underplaying when Mr. Waltz again overplays the menace angle. However he does bring some interesting human quirks to the part. (Nice moment with the silverware arrangement, Christoph.)All in all, the initial story line remains intriguing, the action sequences entertain, and Mr. S. makes an awesome impression, all swagger, six-pack, and sensitivity in a tight delightful manly package, although his fluent English language skills are never addressed.This Tarzan has its flaws, but it does keep the legend intact, until the next chapter.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful visuals &amp; CGI bring legend to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect with Tarzan. I thought it might be cheesy or the special effects would look ridiculous, but surprisingly a majority of the time, it looked really good! Do you have to suspend disbelief sometimes? Absolutely. But it's a story about a man who controls jungle animals and swings from vines, so its going to look unbelievable at points. However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO) relied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean... they're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but the CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the detail. Personally found the movie very enjoyable, action packed and beautiful to watch. The director and actors did a phenomenal job. I found myself glued to the screen for a majority of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****Potential Spoilers*****lost the plotAs more and more animated films are getting a modern make over, I can say that I was genuinely excited when I saw the first teaser for this Tarzan film. Straight away I was thinking of how my favourite scenes from the previous movie would be brought back to life along with How the animals would look, if they Would talk, At what point would we hear the iconic Tarzan roar and of course how would the vine swinging look with today's cgi technology. In my opinion the animated storyline was a great foundation to work from and should have been ( for the majority at least) left the same. The trailer when released made me almost certain that that was going to be the case. Particularly after seeing The shot of the tree house over looking the ocean and the gorillas discovering Tarzan as a baby. However. . . . This story is being told very very very differently. The entire story I was hoping to see brought back to life has already come and gone. All You are treated to are multiple flashbacks throughout the film to relive certain moments such as how Tarzan met Jane, what happened to his parents and how he became one with the animals etc but they couldn't even get that in the slightest bit right. The first time you see Tarzan in this film you don't see the Tarzan we know and love we instead see a well dressed, well spoken Tarzan ( called John) who is discussing politics and events that are unfolding/about to unfold in Africa. Straight away I felt like I was watching what should have been a sequel to a revamped first film. Then who happens to appear . . . . Drum roll please . . . .who else but Samuel L Bloody Jackson &#x1f62b;&#x1f62b; Playing a character that was completely out of sync and in all honesty laughable. A character who found himself able to jump off cliffs and land safely In trees, stand and watch Tarzan take on a full sized gorilla with not a flicker of fear other than the occasion typical Jackson outburst. A character that if changed into different clothing could have been playing any off his previous roles. There was no adaptation to suit the film. David Yates directing this film reminds me of Roy Hodgson managing the England team during the Euros. Had a good base to work with but ultimately had no idea how to put it together so that it worked. You were only teased you with what could have or might have been. A fight scene fuelled on the loss of loved ones and raw emotion that only lasted a few minutes (with more than an underwhelming conclusion) would be an example of that. The characters had no depth and this was not the Tarzan and Jane I was hoping to see. That being said I think the choice of actors ( Samuel L Jackson being the exception) were the right choices for their parts but were portrayed completely wrong by the director and the direction of the film. Bitterly disappointed with the plot, the characters and also some of the visual affects. I think the majority of people who were expecting or hoping to see what I was hoping to see will be as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dynamic, Sensational, Action-Packed Crowd-Pleaser!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, my husband Martin and I boarded a bus-full of die-hard Edgar Rice Burroughs fans (ECOF 2016) to attend an advanced screening of Legend of Tarzan. These people know the Tarzan universe better than anyone on the planet, and can sometimes be the most nit- picky continuity group I've ever seen. That being said, as we exited that amazing theater, there wasn't a face in the crowd that wasn't grinning from ear to ear.John Burroughs, grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs, reportedly had to wander the empty Warner Lot for a few minutes immediately after the movie to collect himself before gathering with the rest of us, because he was so emotionally affected by the joy of seeing his grandfather's vision finally realized.Linda Burroughs, wife of the late Danton Burroughs, chatted excitedly as we headed to the buses. She, who had attended the red carpet premiere the night before with daughters Jane and Dejah, couldn't praise the film enough.As the curtains opened David Yates delivered from second one with an atmospheric vista of the fog-enshrouded Congo, complete with a haunting tribal melody. Your hatred for Leon Rom is cemented as you see his treatment of the Congolese, and his disregard for their well-being as he and Belgium soldiers seek the diamonds of Opar through Chief Mbonga to pay his creditors for his loathsome plans. Mobonga, whose son was slain by Tarzan pre-Jane, only wants our heroes head in exchange.We see John Clayton III (Tarzan) in a meeting with parliament officials as they practically drool with the possibility of joining King Leopold's crusade through Leon Rom in the Congo. George Washington Williams, who is annoyingly cracking nuts during the meeting, sugarcoats his plan to involve Tarzan. After following him into the rain-soaked 19th century London streets, he explains why he's really there and Tarzan reluctantly agrees. As Tarzan breaks the news to Jane that he will have to return to Africa, she exuberantly begins packing as he tries to talk her out of it.The dynamic between Alexander Skarsg?rd and Margot Robbie is absolutely incredible. You truly believe they are Tarzan and Jane from the start, and as we take their journey along with them, you find yourself heartbroken for the child they lost, weepy as he rejoins the small pride of lions he grew up with, and the emotional greeting a herd of elephants bestow. You will cry out as you see the death-defying feats of acrobatics through the trees with grim determination and not an ounce of fear, while your respect for Jane Clayton grows minute by minute as she tries to escape the hands of Rom.But I don't want to give it all away... This is an absolutely amazing movie. Go see it as soon as possible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who are these people who think this was a good movie. This is just a fashion show, plus showing nothing but a ridiculous plot and terrible clothing choices. The sensitive lollipop kids got this movie so politically correct, it is a horrible and painful movie to watch. As for Tarzan, he even looks laughable in those pants swinging from vines. For over 100 years Tarzan wore a loin cloth. Not this time, the lollipop kids saw to that. A horrible movie on so many levels.What the heck are these positive reviews for.Terrible terrible plot as well.Tarzan is the king of the jungle. Who really cares if he is the hope and ruler of the people in the jungle. I don't. Those animals don't look real. They looked unreal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, he we have another film that looked vaguely interesting on the trailers but turned out to be really boring. Well, there must have been quite a few people wanting to see it though because there were a number of sessions at my local cinema that had sold out, and I ended up purchasing the ticket the night before so I didn't have to waste my time walking all the way to the cinema only to discover that it had sold out again. Well, I didn't waste my time in that regard, but I do feel that I did waste my time sitting in that cinema for two hours watching a film that I really couldn't get all that excited about.The story of Tarzan was the creation of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is about a man who grew up in the jungle among the apes, went back to civilisation, hated it, and returned to the jungle. When he was first in the jungle, and the main reason he returned to civilisation, was because he met and fell in love with Jane. This film, however, begins after he has returned to England and settled down. However King Leopold of Belgium is bankrupt and is looking for ways to get so money, so he sends this guy to the Congo to establish an ivory and diamond trade. The catch is that in doing so he is going to eventually destroy the Congo.There are a number of flash backs to when Tarzan was first in the jungle, and how he eventually meets Jane (and also how he became Tarzan, namely that his parents were killed by apes, but he was rescued as a baby). We also discover that he has made some enemies, namely because he killed the son of a tribal chief so as to protect his ape parents. This all comes together to a grand finale when a horde of wilder beasts run through a Belgium sea port and they eventually drive the Belgians out of the Congo.As I said, the film was pretty boring, and Tarzan himself was actually really annoying. In fact I really couldn't stand the character ? it just seems to be an excuse to have some guy swing around the trees on vines, and run around bare chested. We also had to have the token American Negro (who, if he had fought in the civil war, would probably be in his fifties by the time the movie was set, and he certainly didn't look all that old). Obviously, this was all about how he had come here to expose Leopold's crimes in the Congo, and to also free the natives from slavery.No doubt this film touches on a lot of issues ? such as the rape and pillaging of the Congo by the Western powers. Even though it is a sovereign country, it is till one of the most dangerous places in the world, and that is if you stay inside Kinshasa ? out in the jungle it is even worse. The film explores ivory trade, western imperialism, and of course the exploitation of the natives. However it also has this hero ? Tarzan ? come swinging out of the trees to save everybody. In the end this film was pretty dull, and I think I'll just go back to watching the Avengers movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilariously Bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually, this film looked like it was trying to be a live action version of the Disney animated feature, down to young Tarzan's dreadlocks and Jane's yellow dress. This was easily the best thing the film had going for it.If there were live animals used in this film, I missed them, because I was so busy noticing how absolutely fake the CGI animals (and vine-swinging Tarzan) looked. Even the single blue butterfly that alighted on Jane's shoulder was obviously fake. At one point, even the green lighting reflecting off the green screen used to shoot the film is visible on Skarsgard and Samuel L Jackson.The villain, Rom, is comically bad. Showing the respect for religion that has become fashionable in Hollywood, Rom constantly carries a crucifix with him, made of spider silk and inexplicably strong. He uses this not for prayer, but to choke victims (and Tarzan) as necessary. There is of course a joke about priests and abuse, which will likely be offensive to Catholics (I am not.)The motivation of the chieftain that deals with Rom to lure Tarzan back to the jungle from London so that he can kill him is undeveloped and secretive, until the end, at which point it is resolved rather easily. You'd think that in years of knowing each other, Tarzan and the chief would've had an opportunity to discuss their grievances with one another, but apparently not.By my clock, it took an hour and 50 minutes to get to the first iconic Tarzan yell, a wimpy holler that would've been better performed by Carol Burnett. The yell is a trademark, and it was glaringly absent.Tarzan and his crew -- apes and men both -- swing through the trees in several scenes that suddenly make similar moments in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull appear more believable. These were not thrilling moments, but were comical and bad!In the movie's climactic scene, Tarzan -- who has nearly superhuman strength -- is snared by Rom with his nearly unbreakable crucifix. Unable to free himself with his hands, and somehow unable to fight off the frail and thin Rom, Tarzan nearly passes out from lack of oxygen until ... he SWALLOWS. This action, just enough extra muscle power from a weakening Tarzan, is enough to break Rom's beads, and Tarzan is suddenly free and able to fight! I laughed out loud! Tarzan, one would think, would make short work of Rom thereafter, but this is no Johnny Wisemuller Tarzan, and there are not moral lessons to be learned. Instead, Rom is left to the aggressive CGI crocodiles, who deliver the death bites.There's simply nothing redeeming about this film, and the story, special effects, plot, writing, and acting are all second rate. The title, the Legend of Tarzan is at least appropriate, because the laughs are legendary. It's unfortunate that Mystery Science Theatre 3000 is no longer in production, because this film is ripe for ribbing by that crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film, faithful to the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a Burroughs / Tarzan fan for over 50 years, and have seen all the existing authorized Tarzan films. I've enjoyed them to varying degrees, but few have been truly faithful to Burroughs' character of Tarzan. Until now. This film does by far the best job of capturing the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan of any film to date, particularly the idea of nature (English nobleman) vs. nurture (his jungle upbringing). More importantly, The Legend of Tarzan is a terrific, engaging story, with great characters and pacing and plenty of action, but not so much that it seems like overkill. The story's focus and presentation has been updated from Burroughs' first 104-year-old story, as has been stated in write-ups and interviews. But note that the issue that draws Tarzan back to the jungle in this film is essentially the same one that originally brought his parents there, as described in the first two pages of that first novel. Yates and company have done a superb job of crafting a good old-fashioned adventure, retaining the look and feel of the Africa of a century ago, and combining it with a plot and theme that is relevant today, aided greatly by the addition of real life character George Washington Williams. The scenery and special effects are first rate. As noted above, the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan is beautifully captured. The few detail changes from Tarzan's backstory are minor and serve to support the story. For example, Jane is more feisty than we are used to in previous films and in the earlier books, but in my opinion that merely improves the story. A must see!</fullReview>

The flash backs are random and pointless, there's no real set up or relationship with any of the characters, the story line predictable Samuel Jackson thought it was a comedy Tarzan and Jane thought it was the next transformers. The bad guy wasn't The natives need to lay off the steroids The cgi man last worked in the 90s, man in a gorilla suite would of been better reviews for it !!!! 100% worth a watch just for cringe and wince factor , just as I did. 60s Tarzan movie would show this up</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw "The Legend of Tarzan" today and really enjoyed it! This is so much more true to the books than we have previously seen so don't expect the "Me Tarzan, you Jane" garbage that has erroneously been most of the theatrical history of this larger than life character. The story is well crafted and you will enjoy the scenic views and locations. I have heard from other reviews that there is too much CGI but I do not agree with that opinion. There is not too much CGI and what is there is done very well. It is nice to have a capable villain with whom you can really loathe. Christoph Waltz does a fantastic job as the villain! This make me hopeful for a whole line of Tarzan movies being as there is so much untapped potential and material for them to easily make more. Do yourself a favor and take your family and enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another terrible Hollywood rehash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I know this is a made up story, but the storyline is weak at best, coupled with some terrible acting and CGI. The whole reason for Tarzan going back is quickly forgotten, also skipped over is how he has been able to grasp English so quickly! There is hardly any chemistry between Tarzan and Jane, which isn't helped by fairly wooden acting. Jackson and Waltz try to pull the film up, but both are below par in this remake. There are lots of CGI shots, which may be good in 3D, but don't really work on a normal screen. The story jumps around, and you never really get caught by it. The ending is particularly poor, with animals able to identify the bad people, and and impossible survival of an explosion. I can only think, once again, that when a film is invested in so much they throw money at getting false ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can probable sum it up in one word, but let me give it a try.Wasn't expecting much going in this movie, but I was hoping to be surprised. Unfortunately...This is without a doubt the worst movie from 2016. The acting: Horrible. Not even Oscar winner Christopher Waltz, who was once again typecast to play the same role he always does. Dito for Samuel. And Skarsgard? Sorry to say he's the male equivalent of Kristen Stewart. If he would've had fangs he could've easily been Eric Northman 200 years prior to True Blood. Margot Robbie was probable the best thing about this movie....Or maybe the baby elephant, that's still up for debateThe movie wasn't even visually stunning, tons of CGI, which is understandable to some degree, but this was just ridiculous. I didn't count one real-life animal, and this including a butterfly.The whole plot felt (and was) rushed and important moments where brushed aside as filler. There was absolutely no emotion what so ever between any of the characters, nothing memorable about the entire movie, except maybe for the poorly executed finale which I will only remember as a good laugh.And that's about it...</fullReview>

It's Tarzan king of the jungle . . . the thing that as little boy I was dreaming about . . . what power what agility what a superhuman . . . But wait THIS Tarzan get beaten by almost everybody an he doesn't feel comfortable without his tights.Action packed? We have a girl that we have to take with us or there is no conflict in the movie. She can run away but she wants to spare the Gorillas that were just about to bash her and she comes back. Gorillas don't care about the other guy (he is the bad man and he has to die at the end. My 5 years son would write a scenario that can't be that bad as this one. Pity of the actors. They are good but they have some lines that sometime I was wandering if they changed the tapes when I was yawning.Hopefully after all family members write the reviews some ordinary people like me can say a word. DON"T bother... From beginning to end I was asking myself one single question.... is it really possible to make a movie that bad? I give it a 3 for the actors... not for the acting because no matter how great an actor is he can not act with such lines. Samuel is like a fish on a freeway. Tarzan is a struggle between a Count and thief, being actually none. Margot is just pretty but that didn't help either . . . . What a bad bad bad movie? PEOPLE assuming you are NOT member of the families . .. now really... what movie are you talking about? Not Tarzan because I am sure I didn't sleep it trough as I was curios how bad this movie could be... I couldn't even fall asleep.</fullReview>

I had heard that the CGI was bad, saw no real evidence of this in the movie. On the contrary it was well done. I think that this Tarzan is much closer to what Burroughs had in mind. The critics cannot seem to see beyond the 1912 creation of this character and seem to focus on the relevancy and point of the movie. My wife asked me why every movie has to have a point so that the critics would like it. The point in this movie seems to be a thoughtful handling of an iconic character that arguably spawned almost every other superhero that we have today. Would definitely see this again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is another cinematographic reincarnation of a well-known character, who is supposed to be the hero of children around the world. Like most recent summer flicks, the movie lacks authenticity, character development, and hopeful excitement that most would like to see in a good-feel movie. In return, the moviegoer gets poorly weaved flashback scenes and basically forced to watch a plainly chaotic film. Furthermore, the characters seem to have come out of a sitcom or reality TV show, with no interest for dramatic structure. Moreover, the level of violence is simply too much for small children to watch.Here is the bottom line: This is not a good family movie, but rather an action one with plenty of special effects that many will still enjoy.</fullReview>

The shot-compositions and framing was so confusing, in some dialogues the camera was spinning round and round for no reason at all except making me fell nauseous.The editing, confusing as hell, a character is over there, now it's over here, a weirdly timed close up, suddenly two new characters appear from nowhere.Oh god the animals looked horrible, HORRIBLE! Tarzan turned to rubber-plastic-cgi as soon as he was swinging from the lianas, at one Point he swings on one that seems like it's 300 meters long.The finale is at least so terrible you have to be amused by the awfulness of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start this review by saying that I have never read Tarzan, nor seen any film adaption of him before, cartoon or live-action. I went in with a blank slate and no expectations to the theater hoping to see a fun adventure movie. Boy was I disappointed. A great adventure movie starts with memorable characters. Tarzan is neither a Jack T. Colton, nor an Indiana Jones. He has neither charm, wit or any other adventure movie admirable qualities. Jane is also no Joan Wilder or a Willie Scott, even if she is more interesting than Tarzan. The first part is dreadfully slow paced with about the same passion and emotions as a dead fish. Then suddenly it feels like the scriptwriter got tired of his own script and just wanted it to end. Queue Deus Ex Machina, then the movie is finally over. Worst movie I have seen this year, only a TV rerun of Hale Berrys Catwoman comes close.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY - A Tarzan closer to way he was in the books!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read (or re-read) about twenty of the original Tarzan books. I always wondered why we never saw a Tarzan movie that portrayed the character as he was written in the books.In the books, the adult Tarzan was very well educated and spoke several languages, but in the movies he hardly knew any English and rarely spoke in complete sentences. In The Legend of Tarzan, Alexander Skarsg?rd plays the character much like I imagined him when I read the books. Tarzan's command of language is competent, and his interaction with other people is never awkward or stilted as it had been in earlier movies.Some changes from the books that The Legend of Tarzan makes is the way Tarzan communicates with animals. Instead of using words (as in the books), Tarzan can read an elephant's eyes, and he calls crocodiles by mimicking a mating call. Another change is the removal of many of the more racist elements the books had in the depiction of African tribesmen, and they are not missed at all. One other element missing from the books is the science fiction or supernatural slant that several of the stories had. The Tarzan stories that had those elements were never my favorite ones anyway, so I don't mind that they are absent from this movie.One aspect of Jane's character that was often ignored in the earlier Tarzan movies, is that Jane lived in the USA before she married Tarzan. Earlier movie Janes were often given a British accent and occasionally had a pampered upbringing. It was refreshing to see Margot Robbie's take on the character. This Jane is American, and is feistier than we usually see her.Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson looked like they had a lot of fun in their roles. I enjoyed watching them, but it sort of seemed like they were there as "stunt" casting - nice but unnecessary. They were each good, but every time they appeared on the screen, I never really saw the characters they were playing, I saw the actors.Overall, I liked the movie. At times it was a little more "epic" than it needed to be, but I guess that just added to the fun. Of all the film versions of Tarzan I have seen, this one is my favorite. I think anyone who enjoyed the books would most likely agree that this is the closest to the book character of Tarzan that we have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Was not expecting it to be so spectacular!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was not expecting it to be so good.I did go into it thinking I did not want to see a movie about a white dude becoming King of an African Jungle, and I think the filmmakers themselves tried to be favorable of that opinion. If you have any familiarity with Tarzan, especially movies that came before, this film acts as a continuation of that. It tells the origin of Tarzan, a boy lost in the jungle and raised by apes to become a ghost like figure, but this film more focus on the life after Tarzan left the jungle and joined civilization were his legend became the stories that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about.Samuel L Jackson plays a doctor who needs Tarzan's help when Tarzan gets an invitation to come back to the Congo, the doctor needs to come with him to find out if slavery is being practice there, but it turns out the invitation was a trap laid out by the the villain, Rom, played by the brilliant Christoph Waltz in his element, to deliver Tarzan to an old enemy, also played brilliantly Djimon Hounsou.Jackson's role in this keeps it from being some white dude who saves Africa from other white dudes. This is one of his better supporting roles as he was funny and dramatic when needed. The chemistry between Jackson and Alexander Skarsg?rd works like a charm. I love Djimon Hounson character as an African Chief seeking vengeance with Tarzan's death. It was very Black Panther like (or more like Black Cheetah, as the costume design shows).I like Margot Robbie as Jane as well. At first it seem they tried too hard to to make Jane not just the chick Tarzan saved, but as the movie went on and her character developed , she went on a small adventure herself that was as exciting as Tarzan.It's an action packed adventure through the Congo. The visual effects worked to make the terrain beautiful and dangerous and epic. It's also fun an exciting, it will have you laughing throughout all the action.It still floors me how fantastic this thing turned out. Worth seeing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brief Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't remember ever being introduced to Tarzan of the Apes. Seems that I've known him all my life, probably from watching the old movies on TV and looking at my older brothers' comics long before I could read. Tarzan has always been there. When I discovered the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs at age 13, I encountered a more complex, far more fascinating hero than was ever shown in the comic pages or on the screen.Until now.Warner's THE LEGEND OF TARZAN presents the truest portrayal of Tarzan ever depicted by Hollywood. He's intelligent, charismatic, and savage. Burroughs would be very satisfied, I think, and members of his family have told me that they are delighted with the new film. Its elegant, dangerous atmosphere and thrilling special effects are absolutely mesmerizing (the Mangani apes, especially Tarzan's foster mother Kala, are wonderfully realized and purposely described as *not* being gorillas). This is not only a lavishly produced action-epic, but also a sentimental adventure as Tarzan and Jane return to the jungle to face a relentless evil.As a Tarzan writer, and as a lifelong fan, I absolutely loved it. This is the best Tarzan movie ever made, by far. Five Stars. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan is the Best Version of Tarzan Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered why there are so many versions of Tarzan? I read the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book a decade ago because I wanted to know what the real version was. The book was a Penny Dreadful that was fun as heck, silly as all get out, and pretty skewed from reality (Tarzan teaches himself to read from a book he found in his dead parents tree house and he can do that because he's of Nobel birth) LOLThis new version of Tarzan not only tries to make it as realistic as it can be in the circumstances (it is a super hero jungle guy), it also incorporates history of the time (turn of the 19th Century) by having the villains be the Belgians in the Congo. The Legend of Tarzan takes the legend and makes it a better story.The stars of the movie are all fantastic in their roles. Alexander Skarsgard is beyond buff, beautiful and an amazing Tarzan. Margot Robbie is sweet and tough as nails as Jane. Samuel L. Jackson is always good but this part would be less without him. Christoph Waltz was very villainy and believable.Thank you to all the people who made this movie, for thinking we needed yet another Tarzan. Now I want a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night by myself, and will be going again tonight. Tonight, I am taking family members with me, so they can get a tiny glimpse into why Dad is the 51 year old kid he is today, and why he has never stopped geeking out, collecting and reading all things related to Edgar Rice Burroughs long into middle age, with no intention of stopping. This movie did it, it put on screen the Tarzan (and Jane) that I envision, based on the books and in a way never done before. I hope they all understand at least a little, even if they don't get Dads obsession, its a hell of a movie that I am certain they will enjoy! The movie was not packed, about a 1/3 full, probably expected for an early screening, mostly older people, but some teenagers and some smaller children as well.The movie, all though not perfect was about as close as I could have hoped for in portraying this character, and instilling the sense of wonder and excitement on the big screen, that we all sensed growing up reading the novels and the comics.Yeah, some liberties were taken, some settings and time frames are not exactly as Burroughs wrote them, but that is expected somewhat in a movie that needs to appeal to a broader audience. The main thing, the most important thing, is it was obvious the Director, Producers writers and actors all were familiar with the ERB works enough to want to get this right, in respect to ERB, and all the fans who yearn for a really good Tarzan movie! The movie does not start out quickly as far as action, and that is OK, because we are learning about the relationship between Tarzan and Jane, and why they are living in London, and not their birthplace Africa. We learn a lot about the depth of love these 2 share, and their commitment to each other, which sets the stage for what is to come. This is, a love story at heart ,and that is one of the reasons it works. Burroughs understood the need for romance to play a large part in his novels, and that is an aspect of this film that will be appreciated, and hopefully draw in a larger audience.One of the most touching, and tender moments, is Lord Greystoke and Jane, in their quite moment in a tree on their London estate, just prior to returning to Africa.Tarzan, is played almost perfectly by Skarsgard, quiet, reserved, intelligent, fierce, majestic, yet slightly vulnerable in his affection and devotion to his mate. Robbie, as Jane was amazing in this role, and a force to be reckoned with in dealing with enemies! Of course, Samuel Jackson is always excellent, and here his character serves as the perfect impetus for 2016 audiences, to draw Tarzan back to his homeland. The scene in the coach, just after John is swayed by Williams to return, where John "chuffs" in anger upon hearing what is happening in his beloved Africa, was subtle, but moving.Christopher Waltz, as Rom played the perfect bad guy (as usual) his relatively small physical presence belied a well honed dangerous ability with his small makeshift lasso, which he used to good effect.We see in this film a gradual return to the greatness, the strength and prowess that we expect from Tarzan. He does not return to Africa 100% Tarzan, in strength and ability, but mid way through, and certainly towards the end, he becomes the nearly superhuman Tarzan that we all expected! I do wonder, how Tarzan will be depicted, moving forward in future films(fingers crossed) as I'm sensing we wont see Tarzan Killing Beasts to the extent he did in the novels by way of his fathers Knife. I'm not certain audiences these days want, or will accept a Tarzan that so easily and readily kills as he did in the books to protect others.Most people these days I'm thinking would not connect with someone killing such majestic creatures as Lions, Tigers, Gorillas etc.That blade, that "Long tooth" was what gave Tarzan the edge, against far stronger creatures. Tarzan battling his brother upon his return to Africa, it was very evident, that even with all of Tarzans great strength, and intellect, physically he was no match, he needed that knife.I'm really interested in hearing others thoughts on this point in particular.Finally, huge Kudos to Skarsgard, in playing this role. He completely made me believe in the character, amazing performance!!! I give this movie, a 9 out 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lord of the Apes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Tarzan is so ingrained into the brains of moviegoers that it's difficult to really put a new stamp or add something fresh to something so well-known. While Legend of Tarzan certainly attempts to take a new approach structurally, it never swings off the screen as gracefully as I had hoped.2016 has been a rough year for big budgeted films. So many bombs and duds overshadow some of the great ones we've had through the first half. This film isn't necessarily in either camp. It begins the second half of this year with a formidable installment in the long-running ape-man franchise. David Yates, director of the last four Harry Potter films, does absolutely nothing special with the characters of Tarzan and Jane, but I was nonetheless entertained by the film from beginning to end.Alexander Skarsg?rd and Margot Robbie portray Tarzan and Jane respectively. Both give solid performances but neither brought anything new to the characters. It took me awhile to adapt to Skarsg?rd's more guarded portrayal. In fact, for a good portion of the first half, I found his performance to be quite stiff. Tarzan isn't supposed to be running around cracking jokes, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more lightness to him. Although Robbie is very good as Jane, she doesn't get a whole lot to do as she's tied up by the villainous Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) for half the film. She's far from a damsel in distress, because she's definitely not helpless, but the plot constantly puts her in position to be a device or Tarzan's motivation to do something. I think Robbie could have done something special given the chance.Undeniably good, however, is everything to do with the apes. I've seen the backstory before, but I loved watching his ever-changing relationship with his family of apes and the various flashbacks to what came before Tarzan's venture into home life in England. It's also where the film succeeds the most visually. While some animals, including a pretty bad ostrich, are weak on CGI, the apes are animated tremendously. The cinematography through the jungle and in the African mountains is quite beautiful. However, there are several moments of awful green screen footage. I'm talking cringe worthy background visuals.Having said all this, I was definitely invested in the story they were telling. Tarzan is thrust into a choice to return home and chaos ensues when Leon Rom, a corrupt Belgian captain who tricked him into returning to the Congo in the first place. At times the tone blurs the lines from taking its source material too seriously and supplementing it with some weak dialogue with an average romance. I think that's the best way to describe most of the film, average.I appreciate the filmmakers approach in taking the Tarzan story in a different direction in having it be about his return home and to his animalistic ways. But the best part about this film is Tarzan's relationship to his ape family and the background to that. I would have just liked to see more of that side of things rather than just bits and pieces here or there. Christoph Waltz was exactly what I needed out of a Tarzan villain and Samuel L. Jackson's humorous sidekick to Tarzan worked seamlessly. To me, there's plenty good here, but there was potential for greatness.+Solid performances from the leads+Samuel L added some much needed humor+Apes Apes Apes+Some visuals and fight scenes-Others were too noticeably green screen-Struggles to balance tone at times-Needed more apes7.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Legend of Tarzan" effectively updates a classic character, puts him in a compelling historical context and gives us a fresh story with quality acting and visuals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of a history here ? literal and literary ? when it comes to the action-adventure movie "The Legend of Tarzan" (PG-13, 1:49). The titular "Lord of the Apes", is one of the most enduring and iconic characters in all of literature. Created by American author Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1912, Tarzan has been the subject of about 100 feature films, dating back to the silent film era (and has also inspired pop culture incarnations including TV series, radio programs, comic books, video games, etc.). The 2016 film places the fictional character in the middle of the real-life story of the European rape of the continent of Africa in the late 1800s. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 effectively divided up almost the entire continent among imperialistically-inclined European nations such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and, perhaps the most infamous of all participants in the age of The New Imperialism, Belgium. That country's King Leopold II "only" got one prize in The Partition of Africa, but it was one of the largest and was right in the geographical center of the continent ? the Congo. Most of the Congo River Basin became the "Congo Free State" and wasn't just ruled by Belgium, but was personally "owned" and managed by Leopold. He exploited the region for its natural resources, such as ivory and rubber, and for the labor of its native population. The Belgians (much like other colonial powers) used their superior western technology to subjugate the Africans, brutally oppress them and use them as slaves to enrich their European masters. It took the people of Africa decades to become completely free of this hegemony but before freedom came to pass, about half of the Congo's 20 million inhabitants had died. 2016's Tarzan becomes personally involved in the early stages of this process.This film is an origin story with less origin and more story. We first meet Tarzan (Alexander Skarsg?rd) in his capacity as Viscount Greystoke, a member of the British Parliament's House of Lords. He is happily married to Jane (Margot Robbie), his one true love. He is enjoying the life that was his birthright, inherited from his parents who were shipwrecked and died in Africa, leading to him being raised by apes, until he's discovered and brought to Europe. We see parts of that story in brief flashbacks, but this film's focus is on the "present". The British Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) communicates an invitation from King Leopold II of Belgium, ostensibly to come to the Congo and see all the good things that the King is doing for the natives. Lord Greystoke has no desire to go back to the wilds of Africa, but he is persuaded by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a U.S. government representative who is skeptical of the Belgian activities in the Congo and wants to see conditions on the ground for himself.It turns out that Leopold's invitation was a ruse. The King is not making as much money from the Congo's natural resources as he had hoped, so he has sent Captain Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to central Africa seeking out new sources of income. Rom is looking for some rumored diamond mines when he runs into Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) and his warriors. Unaware of how ruthless the Belgians can be, Mbonga offers Rom access to the region's treasures in exchange for Tarzan, with whom the chief has a score to settle. Hence, King Leopold's "invitation". Upon their arrival in the "Free State of Congo", Greystoke and Jane reunite with old friends, but their joy is short-lived, thanks to Rom's cruelty. Greystoke, quickly returning to Tarzan mode, does what he can to help the natives, protect his wife and stop Rom, while Williams does his best to keep up and help Tarzan when he can."The Legend of Tarzan" swings for the trees ? and makes it! Writers Craig Brewer ("Hustle and Flow") and Adam Kozad ("Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit") do a great job of taking the timeless character of Tarzan, setting him against an actual historical conflict and giving us a story that is interesting and fresh. There's a distinctly modern sensibility to the script (and you won't finish this movie with a very positive impression of western governments of the late 19th century), but Brewer and Kozad remain true to the spirit of the original character and incorporate aspects of a couple different Tarzan books along the way. Director David Yates (he of the last four "Harry Potter" films) brings us impressive visuals and proves himself a master of tone and pacing, giving us both narrative heft and old-school cinematic excitement.Yates' cast simply doesn't have a weak link. Skarsg?rd makes a perfect Tarzan. His well-publicized strict four-month diet and exercise regimen (under the supervision of trainer and nutritionist, Magnus Lygdback) has given him a body that looks like that of someone who grew up among apes swinging from trees and, as an actor, he strikes just the right balance between brooding and determined. Meanwhile, Robbie's Jane creates a modern version of the "damsel in distress" ? desirable and vulnerable, but also intelligent and independent. Jackson seems to be here mainly for comic relief, but maintains his usual strength and dignity, while managing a physicality and a variety of facial expressions that I can't remember seeing from him before. Waltz has carved out a nice Hollywood career playing immoral or morally ambiguous characters and gives us another great one here ? perhaps his most despicable yet."The Legend of Tarzan" effectively updates a classic character, puts him in a compelling historical context and establishes who he is while giving us a fresh story with quality acting and visuals.

		<fullReview>Wow, this is an action packed movie featuring one of the most popular fictional characters of all-time! This is not a re-make of Disney's Tarzan, but one of the closest adaptations of the original Edgar Rice Burroughs stories ever made. The visuals are stunning and the story line is epic. Legend Of Tarzan brings Lord Greystoke back to his beloved Africa. Of course no Tarzan movie would work with out the love of his life, Jane. There is also some historical content added to give the movie even more depth. Samuel Jackson is perfectly cast in his role as the real life George Washington Williams. If you have been a fan of any of the dozens of movies, books, TV shows or comics featuring Tarzan, you will love this movie. Great movie, highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw The Legend of Tarzan on an IMAX screen in 3D and was blown away. It is a beautiful movie, with incredible action and powerful scenes such as Kala's death that are very moving.Where it touches on Tarzan's origins in a series of flashbacks, it is always respectful of the origin material but tweaks the story here and there for the movie. My only complaint would be the fight scenes. As others have mentioned, the way they are filmed leaves a bit to be desired.This is the best Tarzan movie ever, and it is hard to see how anyone could do a better one.

		<fullReview>Okay before I start this review I must point out that my feelings about this movie have nothing to do with if I think Santa Claus wears funny shoes or not. Point being as too many reviews on movies have went up based on what they thought about something that had nothing to do with the movie, example people didn't like Suicide Squad because they didn't like Batman vs Super so this is my disclaimer for the ignorant people that post reviews on films based on their dislikes in chocolate.So to start out, I had High expectations for this movie, the cast seemed to be on point and of course the story isn't a new one so where on Earth did this movie go so wrong? Well let's start with the green screens and the never ending length of the vine when Tarzan swings from one. Now I do remember the old Tarzan shows when of course the vine seemed to be a few thousand miles long as 1 vine could make that swing across the country while he posed; come on guys we have better technology now. The acting was of very low quality and the back story was shot in the foot from the start. I had watched the cartoon version of this film a few weeks before and it was better in story, graphics, and voice overs fit the characters. In this movie featuring real people playing the roles everything that could've gone wrong did, we almost walked out as it was so bad.The Legend of Tarzan (2016) was the let down of films this year and had so much potential; though not one part of it was attempted to make it an entertaining film; it was more like paying to be laughed at for spending the money. I didn't even want to write this review but our following had asked so much that we wanted the clarity known to them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep within us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate Action tale. It is no coincidence that, almost a century ago, when young Hollywood looked to find a franchise for its new "talkie" motion pictures, they turned to the Tarzan tale, and spawned a franchise so successful that it literally outlived the shelf life of its star.In my lifetime I have seen well over a dozen versions, retellings and re-imaginings of the Tarzan story. I have no doubt that after I am gone, producers and writers will continue to be attracted to it and continue to "make their bones" by bending it to their unique style.That said, this one is not especially good. After a great opening scene, there is the filmic equivalent of "dead air" for about 35 minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre editing.Alexander Skarsg?rd has been impressive in other films (a race driver, a superhero) and I think with different material and a different director he could have connected. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson remain two of the most over-exposed stars in Hollywood and, good as they are, they are running out of clever ways to play the same character over and over. And over. And over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, yes, this is why we go to the movies. Entertaining, inspiring, an escape, thrilling and wildly imaginative, "The Legend of Tarzan" would make Edgar Rice Burroughs proud. And I think he'd enjoy the updating of the story by using as a backdrop the horrifying, true story of the many atrocities committed by Belgian King Leopold in the Congo. This movie is likely to go unappreciated by "serious" film critics just as Burroughs was neglected by serious literary critics. Although In a "Paris Review" interview, Ray Bradbury said of him that "Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out ? and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly ? Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world..." Bradbury continued - "...by giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special." This movie couldn't be more true to Burroughs' portrayal of Tarzan, Jane, and the Mangani, the fictional species of great apes that foster and raise Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan is not as bad as some critics/reviewers would make you believe in their writings.Tarzan (like Jungle Book) is a very good action/adventure movie that you could take the family to see. Today's critics raze it because there is no F-bombs floating around, no nudity, no excessive blood and no cussing. It is refreshing to see an action movie that holds to the ideals of the movies of my younger years.The good: the scenery is fantastic. The jungle comes alive and it does not overshadow the film or the performances. The CGI animals look wonderful and the interactions with Tarzan are very well done. The action is filmed nicely and the film has very good action scenes without having to utilize ridiculous feats of prowess.The bad: there is not much that would be considered bad in this film. The beginning is a bit bland, but it sets up the story. The acting is not top notch, but it is sufficient to the film and to the setting. I actually thought that the film could have been longer and had more characterization in it, but that is the only negative that I had seen.I have seen so many Tarzan movies and most were complete bombs. I had expected this movie to be as bad as Greystoke, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was very entertained and will be adding this movie to my collection when it comes to Bluray.Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the same old origin story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is NOT the same old Tarzan. It's the next chapter. Sure we get the origin story through flashbacks that tell enough to update those truly oblivious to Tarzan's story but this is Tarzan on a quest. A mission to save not only his wife but his home and his families (both human and mangani).A breath of fresh air to watch. Action with a purpose and well muscled eye candy swinging on a vine to boot. Plus Jane has gotten a major updating and is not a damsel in distress but a true partner to this Lord of the Jungle. Additionally we've got Samuel L. Jackson to aid in exposition and comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I did not want to see this because of critics on rotten tomatoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie today and at the end the whole theater clapped and cheered for The 'Legend of Tarzan.' I did not want to see this because of low ratings by critics on rotten tomatoes. But the audience rated it higher than critics. So my boyfriend and I took a chance. The critics on rotten tomatoes should be ashamed of themselves for falsely rated this movie so low. Rotten Tomatoes critics are liars, dishonest and unfair especially these last two years. This year there have been many entertaining movies (Batman V Superman, Warcraft, X-Men) that did not deserve extremely low ratings. There have also been average and below average movies (Hail, Caesar, High Rise, Civil War, Jungle Book, The BFG) that did not deserve extremely high ratings. I hope someone investigates this soon. One solution, Rotten Tomatoes gets an in house group of critics to rate the movies. So there would be Critics, In-House Critics, and Audience. It would be interesting to see if it would work.I agree 'Tarzan' seems repetitive, another reason why I did not want to see it. I hated the trailer and marketing, totally was not planning on seeing it. Glad I took a chance, I was blown away. It was different, fun and extremely entertaining. Great story, great cast, great visual effects, great everything. If you are curious about Tarzan, I highly recommend it. An eye opener, you can decide if this movie deserved a 34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I say no, it deserved at least an 80%.A possible reason for low rating is that Disney WANTS TO DO A TARZAN MOVIE TOO. Making a prediction here. When Bryan Singers's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" is released in 2017, critics are going to underrate because Disney paid them too. Even if it's the best movie of the year. Critics will bash on it because it is not a Disney Film. Snow White and the Huntsman, The Huntsman, Tarzan, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. All of them are competing with Disney and being EXTREMELY UNDERRATED. Rotten Tomatoes maybe owned by Disney or they need to find new Critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was fantastic. I was shocked with some of the scenes because they were so real to life. Although I saw Tarzan as a child in the 50's on T.V. with Johnny Wiesmuller and Jock Mahoney, this was so clear and so real it looked like a million megapixels because of the clarity. I did not like the character in the white suit. I wanted to put my fist in his face myself. Saw him before with Brad Pitt in WW-II movie as an SS colonel ("Inglorious Bastards" and I hated him there too. Jane was beautiful and next to Tarzan they would make a nice couple in real life. Loved the movie and it was so real and beautiful that I intend to buy the DVD for my collection. Highly Recommended. 10 stars!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I am painfully aware that the reviews for this film were unkind at best, I want to differ with them.For the first time in my 50+ years of film going I have gotten to see a film based on Burrough's work that was actually faithful to the spirit of his stories. I grew up on these books and adored them. After years of disappointment in the theatre, with the exception of the well intended "Greystoke: The legend of Tarzan" (1984) finally all my time and money has paid off. This film expertly captures both the spirit and the feel of the original novels. It also stays true to the scenarios and characters I'd come to love as a child born before computers and cellphones. In an age where Hollywood spends breath-taking amounts of money on productions, sometimes money enough to feed small nations for a year, all I've gotten from them is Flash &amp; Bang, minimal character development and movies that have relied more on editors than directors to have any sensible plot line.So if you want a film where there is fun to be had, romance that made sense, and visuals that can both endear and haunt, try this film.Definitely a film I will be watching again and again in my quiet hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan still going strong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7/10. In a different take on Tarzan, he is lured back to the jungle after he has settled back into normal society. I was thinking that Tarzan has been done to death, but I was surprised and really enjoyed this. In the safe hands of Director David Yates I found myself drawn into the Tarzan world and didn't find any low points, it was well paced and kept me interested. Alexander Skarsg?rd who normally plays small roles in films, does a decent job as the lead actor. Christoph Waltz is great as usual, and Margot Robbie as Jane also is good, it has been a big year for this up and coming Australian actor. So definitely check this one out, it's a solid fun action flick. Legend of Tarzan #legendoftarzan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan is Back!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan, having acclimated to life in London, is called back to his former home in the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment. The Legend of Tarzan is probably one of the better reboots this year the film has great amount of cgi mostly in the animals and locations that i think it really works not 100% all the time but the CGI at least 90% of it looks really good especially the fight scene with Tarzan and his Ape brother. The humor of the film is kinda the same with the Raimi Spider-Man movies it works always and most of the funny lines comes from Samuel L. Jackson who has a bigger amount of screen time than any of the Marvel Movies, Alexander Skarsg?rd except that his big as hell the man understands the character and he gave a really great performance the same goes for Margot Robbie as Jane and Christoph Waltz as the big villain of the film. I'm glad that they didn't go and did the origins again and again instead they showed Tarzan being a human and doing his thing swinging from tree to tree and connecting with animals or even the flashback scenes with Jane when he meet her it reminded me a lot of the 1999 Animated Movie Tarzan which is amazing also i loved the connection that he had with his Ape mother and his friends. Make sure you check this film out cause it's not as bad as many people said the movie got a 36% on Rotten Tomatoes and pretty much said that the film has a generic plot although a bad movie such as Ghostbusters got a 73% and it was fun for them? Tarzan has more clever jokes and action than Ghostbusters 2016 had and it's a fact that the cast did an amazing job, the cgi was great and the film has many beautiful locations and cinematography i give The Legend of Tarzan an A+ and a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average, empty film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one quite empty, uninteresting film. Honestly, I found old Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film far more better than this. I even found Bo Derek naked breast and bottom version better and to mention that I enjoy low budget TV series "Tarzan Epic Adventures" with Joe Lara in title role? So, what happened here? Directing and writing is just average, nothing that spectacular, intriguing, or investing in the film. It has some, decent story and development in it, but characters are just dull, one dimensional and empty. Tarzan resides in London with Jane, trying to act like nobleman John Clayton in civilized society. And that goes pretty hard for both of them. A man named Rom (Waltz) staged a trap for Tarzan to return to Africa so that Rom could bring Tarzan to a tribe to trade him for diamonds. So, Tarzan must find the way to save himself, Jane and others. The decent story, but it still has that diamond cliché crap. Let's take a look at our title character. Alexander Skarsgard is a good actor. He really is. He was chosen for the role because of his height and already athletic built. And that was OK. His acting was just uninteresting? like he had something else in mind and decided to perform with only one emotion and only one tone of voice. His bright hair and tan just visually doesn't give you a real Tarzan image. Tarzan should have dark hair and distinctive dark tan. I think that director and writer didn't read Burroughs's book. Tarzan is depicted without loincloth. OK, I can live with that, but, where is the knife? The knife is something like a trademark to Tarzan. And he doesn't have it. How come? The Tarzan roar? We can hear it twice in the film, and both are the same (lazy work there), and they are definitively do not comes from Skarsgard? somebody else did this roar. Guaranteed. One more thing? there is a scene where Tarzan shows his hands and how big and developed they are. The thing is? his hands somewhat "mutated" because of his raising with the apes. That was? the depiction of the fastest evolution ever. And it's just ridiculous. Jane is played by Margot Robbie. Robbie was there to be something like a spokeswoman for Tarzan, just to tell the audience hos dangerous he is. She was the emptiest of them all. Yes, they wrote her strong, resourceful and that was just it. There is a scene that suggest that she should act like a damsel in distress. And she wouldn't. I think they made her like that, just not to upset feminists, or something. Samuel L. Jackson was probably the best actor here, but his talents were sabotaged by using him just to be a comic relief spewing around funny remarks about everything. That was just a waste of a good actor. Christoph Waltz plays Leon Rom, basically? I think so many people noticed this, well so did I. He was definitively inspired by two Indiana Jones villains. Waltz is a good actor? but his villainous character of Rom was just not that interesting. I think it's extremely important to make your main villain interesting, charismatic and likable. But Rom had none of those qualities. He has this necklace with a cross weapon? which fate is pretty predictable. Djimon Hounsou plays supporting villain and the leader of leopard tribe from Opar. A good actor, visually looks menacing. But, also? no charisma, or anything interesting. Costumes were good, soundtrack was solid (it has that typical intense violin, which did not change since 2005), there was some of stages built for film, which was OK. Editing and sound effects were good. Visuals of Africa were not that thrilling. And, here is the reason why. CGI. They have CGI-ed every damn animal in this film. Even the most important characters ? gorillas. Why? Was it hard to find some real life gorillas? Was it hard to make a realistic gorilla costume? No matter how fake they look like, at least they are there and they are more interactive with the characters on film. CGI was not that great and it spoiled that good visuals of flora and fauna in Africa. That was just lazy. They couldn't even found any other animal for the scenes. Everything is CGI. So, that's where the all money went. On CGI, Samuel L. Jackson, Christoph Waltz and ? definitively on Alexander Skarsgard's diet and workout for the film. I just can't believe it? that this was the most focal point of entire filming. His hard workout and tough change of diet. They were all worried about Alex, will he be able to look like Tarzan on time? Come on, man? Why not worry about developing characters, better script, better villain, better Tarzan, better acting, better development in characters and story. And less CGI. So, overall, this is one dull, empty film, it's not the worst, nor that bad? it's just not that special. You can watch with the family. At least it offers a decent family fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointment for Edgar's Tarzan lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when i first saw the trailer i was quite thrilling to watch the as Tarzan is one of my all time favorite. but the film is turn out to be a disappointment.i used to read lots of Edgar rice Tarzan books in my college time. its not the same character film brings up. tarzan is a mighty fierce and master of beasts. but so difficult to see him that way in here as script doesn't help to bring such qualities out. its so frustrating to see he fails against apes and humans. thats so unlikely of him. even the story story is not a very strong one. its more of a typical saga you would find in the most of the adventure movies. so don't expect much of a twist. i have 6 because performance of actors and visually its so good. this is a different kind of a legend of tarzan, so this is more suitable for a person who didn't follow the books. but if you are really interact with real of tarzan, don't watch this would be an agony!11</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Abs'olute rubbish.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Hollywood have officially run out of ideas. With the exception of a couple of films, this summer has been one of the worst I've known in almost sixteen years. And films like this, only add insult to the injury...Years after leaving the jungle and settling down with his wife Jane in London, Tarzan is forced to return to the Congo in order to act as a trade representative for England. However, he soon clashes with a greedy Belgian captain who has sinister plans for his old home......Of all the reboots that Tarzan has gone through, this is by far the most expensive, and the most puerile version I've ever seen. And I'm including that turgid CG monstrosity from a few years ago, and even Tarzan in Manhatten.Skarsg?rd may have the monopoly on small screen vampires, but when it comes to the big screen, he has no presence, and here, he just seems to let his six pack do all the work. Honestly, his CG swinging counterpart has more life than anything he does in this.Waltz is on bad guy autopilot, and as much as I think he's a wonderful actor, he needs to stay away from big budget dreck like this, or his reputation will become tainted.Jackson, well he does what he always does, steals any scene he's in with anyone, but puts very little effort into it, as his character is only in it so Tarzan can get to the big fight at the end.The CG animals are okay, but we only saw that a couple of months previous with the phenomenal Jungle Book, so you'll keep referring back to that film whenever you see an animal. And believe me, it happens a lot.So all in all, it's a worthless, cold hollow shell of a film, that will be forgotten in no time.Wretched.</fullReview>

The CGI is so over the top it spoils what could of been a good movie into a waste of time. Sorry but it gets two thumbs down from me.The guy they chose to be Tarzan was built like a weed compared to what you would expect. The camera angles used to hide this got lost in translation. The real Tarzan would of snapped this modern day version into two. The only thing missing from this Tarzan was his pink umbrella. (No offence to the actor - the director is to blame)This classic deserves far better than what this version has thrown at us. FAIL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An over-reliance on CGI lets the movie down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not a bad film, but neither is it a cinematic masterpiece. Not that I was expecting such, but I had hopes for this version that were sadly lacking. Let me explain...Tarzan, for me at least, is one of those iconic heroes that I grew up with as a kid thanks to Johnny Weismuller. Whilst the movies back then did not have the benefit of modern computer graphics and such, they still managed to tell a stirring adventure tale within their limits. Note... The key word here is "stirring".Legend of Tarzan, by comparison, is just a bit... dull, really. It tells an adventure tale that is in line with the Tarzan tales of old, yet fails to make it exciting.A big part of the problem is the overuse of CGI. There is a lot of it here... backgrounds, animals, cities etc. So much that isn't real that you have to wonder why they bothered making a live-action movie at all.What is worse, in plenty of instances, the CGI is bad. Not terrible, but just obviously CGI. And I don't mean in a "Oh, that can't be a real gorilla. because it would be too dangerous to film, so it must be CGI" way either. The CGI in some instances is a terrible and obvious distraction.The most egregious example is with the swinging on vines scenes. I swear they must have gotten the same people to do the CGI there that worked on Van Helsing. In one scene, Tarzan and his buddies swing down on vines onto a moving train. The problem is that the train is moving away from them, yet the obvious attachment point of the vines seems also to be moving with it. In short, it looks bloody awful and fake as hell.As far as the acting goes, no one stinks, but it is an exercise in excesses, for the most part. Tarzan is understated, which is no bad thing, but Christopher Waltz's villain Leon Rom is a one-note cardboard cut-out that is as threatening as a fine drizzle.Also, the movie accepts that Tarzan exists and that everyone knows his origin story. The result is a film that starts off with Tarzan living in London with Jane. Flashbacks reveal some of the origins of Tarzan, but it is very much an afterthought. Whilst I might normally applaud this and hope that other well-known stories take note of this approach (cough...Batman...cough...Spiderman....cough) I can't help feeling that this makes the beginning of the movie a little awkward and disjointed. Have you ever turned on a film half-way through and had to figure out what was going on? This gives you a similar feeling... as if you've missed part of the story.As for the story... Well it is workmanlike, I guess. As I mentioned above, the excess of CGI lessens the impact the film might have otherwise had if those excesses had been curbed. But hey! We live in an age where anything can be shown on film. It is just a shame that film-makers don't understand the concept of "Less is more." Speaking of which... There are a few scenes which serve little purpose other than to bloat the run-time and drag out proceedings. A sharper editing knife could have trimmed a good fifteen minutes off this movie and turned it into what it really should have been - a TV movie. As it is, these extra scenes (often filled with pointless dialogue) are almost as big a distraction as the excessive CGI.All in all, Legend of Tarzan is an okay watch. I doubt you'll be wanting to go back for seconds and I sincerely hope this doesn't generate any sequels, because with this mindset towards the character and film-making techniques, it will only do the IP harm in the long run.SUMMARY: Tolerable but weighed down by too much CGI. Weak dialogue and editing and a rather dull tone to the whole thing make the viewing a little tedious. Not one you'll watch twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite mostly very good production values, this 'Tarzan' lacks swing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Legend of Tarzan' did have a good deal going for it, with talented actors in the cast, entertaining and insightful source material that has been adapted to variable but mostly entertaining effect on film and media and with David Yates as director.Despite not being sure what to make of the trailers/advertising, which indicated a visually beautiful but muddled film, this reviewer saw 'The Legend of Tarzan' anyway because of the above things. Sadly, 'The Legend of Tarzan' is a let down, not an awful film but one where mixed perceptions of the trailers were not improved upon in the film itself. Some very good things here, but a rather bland and dull film without much swing.Luckily, there are some quite big merits here. Mostly, 'The Legend of Tarzan' looks great, with beautiful evocative period detail and even more stunning scenery, while not skimming over the fact that the jungle is also still a place of many dangers, complemented by the wonderful mix of the darkly brooding and sumptuous London and the lusciously colourful and appropriately earthy jungle in the cinematography. A great score was also done with the film's music score by Rupert Gregson Williams, it has energy, whimsy and a cool and again brooding atmosphere.Of the performances, which mostly didn't do very much for me, Christoph Waltz comes off the best. Can't say that I was completely enthused, it is another typecast villain role and character-wise it is one of Waltz's least interesting, however Waltz does inject a good deal of menace and charisma without being too overt or too low-key. Alexander Skarsgaard is at times wooden and a bit too civilised for the title role, but he at least looks the part mostly, does his best with giving energy and feeling and fits within the period.This cannot be said for Margot Robbie, who sleepwalks through her role as Jane and makes her very annoying as well, the snarky attitude really grates too much. Despite looking beautiful and having obvious sex appeal, Robbie has a look far too modern and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Samuel L. Jackson is also out of place and more obnoxious than amusing, with some not particularly funny and often ill-timed comic relief in a role that is like a badly watered-down parody of other much more interesting Jackson performances. Saddled once again with a clichéd and incredibly one-dimensional noble savage character, with a back-story every bit as simplistic and predictable, Djimon Hounsou tries but lacks the dignity and passion needed, it can be one-note at times.Although it has been said that 'The Legend of Tarzan' looks great, not everything in the visual department comes over completely successfully. The editing is too often incredibly choppy and indicated that more was actually filmed but was cut out for time constraints, which accounts for the cheapness of a few scenes and the jumpy incompleteness in some of the more eventful scenes. Particularly bad was the train vine scene, a pretty risible scene in general. The special effects are variable, most are fantastic like the elephants and the gorillas (different to the gorillas one usually is acquainted with but fits the descriptions of the gorilla species from the source material), some like the lions are mostly well-rendered but are hindered by rushed editing and tighter budget constraints seemingly in busier scenes and others like the ostrich, the buffalos and to a lesser extent the crocodiles are so fake-looking and lack the finesse shown elsewhere that it took me out of the film.Scripting was a huge issue here (Jane getting a lot of the worst of it), aside from the story it was the asset that most brought 'The Legend of Tarzan' down. There is a lot of clunky soap opera in the interactions between characters, and it never seems to know which direction to take with distracting shifts in tone, the darker and more tense scenes feel too safe and are too often fatally undermined by comedy that kills the mood, the comedy misfires badly more than it hits and there is a lack of emotional connection. The story gets off to a sluggish start and never recovers, trying too to cram in too many characters and subplots that not only are so simplistic and lacking in dimension but don't make the story as clear as it should be, which does make the film a slog to get through and makes the characters and their relationships not developed enough or as relatable as they should (that's including the one between Tarzan and Jane). Yates shows great technical competence but lacks focus when it comes to the more substance-related elements (story and pacing).Overall, not without its good points but lacking in a lot of areas...including swing. 4/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imo the pace of the story is too slow. a typical contemporary Hollywood adventure movie - no surprise here, no risk taking. Compared to Indiana Jones movies (at least the three first ones) this is at most a mediocre flick. In short: I would prefer ANY Tarzan movie with Johnny Weissmuller over this, the only interesting character plays Christoph Waltz again, but compared to his great roles like in Inglorious Basterds and The Hateful Eight or Unchained even he looks a little "too professional done". This meal misses spice, lots of. A rating of 4 is enough for this endeavor - taken the potential the character and story of Tarzan provides this is a rather weak flick. cinematics and stuff are pro, CGI meh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So far, most disappointing movie of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed to see such an absolute waste of a good idea. The premise was okay. "A Tarzan remake? SURE, (everyone's doing a s**t tons of remakes anyway) sounds awesome, let's join the bandwagon!", and then, people flock to it like the nostalgia hungry things they are. This is not the problem. (Although remakes, s***ty horror movies, sequels, and movies based off books seems to be all there is anymore.) The problem is that they turned this idea into very poor excuse of a movie.Visuals: Visuals were great. Nothing wrong there. Scenes had good atmosphere, lighting, and effects. Some of these beautiful scenes were a little unnecessary but I guess they needed the run-time. Story: Boring. Boring boring BORING. The beginning before the title of the movie was shown was exciting and full of mystery in a way, but after the title, things went down hill. The story started becoming more bland, boring, and confusing. It was hard to keep myself from falling asleep or sighing whenever I expected something exciting to happen but nothing did. Coincidences and clichés appeared very often and just left me sighing and cringing.Characters: Ugh. Tarzan is the cliché brooding hero. Jane is just an annoying character. Washington Carver didn't really seem relevant? The others I guess were..."okay"? I just wasn't feeling any joy or interest watching any of these people. I don't know if that was what the writers were looking for but I didn't like it. I know this review is very broad, but I like short reviews that are to the point. The point being, I just couldn't stand this movie. It felt like a really confusing boring cash grab with good visuals and decent actors. If you want to see it, go ahead, but I highly recommend you don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Version of the Tarzan Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is the epic version of Burroughs' story. Many scenes are similar to the opening scene in "King Kong", with mist and amazing scenery and savage tribes to bring back a mysterious past of little known areas of our planet. The movie makes justice to the raw beauty of the African continent. The script cleverly weaves in historical facts little known about the destructive control of the European imperial powers over the African continent. Even though at times the computer generated imagery and action becomes obvious, if you let yourself carried on by the story you will end up with a wonderful sensory experience rich in amazing imagery and epic music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I am going to start this review off by saying I clearly do not remember the Disney animated movie, if I even did see it, because The Legend of Tarzan was not at all what I was expecting. I enjoyed the action scenes but in terms of the plot I did not really care for it. Starting from the beginning I was thoroughly confused as to what was happening, who the characters were, and what time period the movie was taking place. As the movie progressed I was able to appreciate the characters a bit more but I still didn't care for the plot line. It wasn't until about 75% of the way through the movie I understood what was going on. The action scenes throughout the movie were intense and were able to keep me entertained but I definitely would not go see this movie again. What I enjoyed most about this movie was how realistic the animals were. Being that this movie was not animated I did appreciate that the animals did not talk but were, actually, frightening at times. It took the childlike tale of Tarzan and turned it into something that was more vicious. However, overall I would not recommend this movie to go see unless you clearly familiar with the "Tale of Tarzan".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of the classic adventure tale has been reconfigured and "The Legend of Tarzan" is unexpectedly entertaining. The story is simple enough as the Tarzan fights slave traders to rescue his kidnapped wife, in a full of special effects jungle adventure. Unfortunately David Yates with the mix between present day and flashbacks, can easily disorientate the viewer, but the fans of "The Jungle Book" should enjoy "The Legend of Tarzan". It has the same type of computer generated animals and a dark, exotic jungle that makes boys act like men. Alexander Skarsgard is uninteresting as Tarzan and altogether, "The Legend of Tarzan"may look great and try to take itself seriously, but it's really just a popcorn movie. Treated as such, it's plenty of fun. nikisreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He's back! Tarzan is back! I loved Tarzan movies as a kid. Ron Ely or Mike Henry's 1960s versions were those most plastered across the TV during my school holiday mornings, or sometimes at 6pm on BBC2 (bring back that slot, Auntie Beeb!). I liked the oldies with Johnny Weissmuller, too. Classics. So, even though the trailer induced a worrying indifference in me, I was optimistic about The Legend of Tarzan (2016; 110 mins). It was an optimism shattered early on: this is virtually the least fun you can have at the cinema this summer. For one, it is overly earnest, and this is exemplified in Alexander Skarsgard's solemn turn as the ape man. He's awful, exhibiting all the charisma of a breeze block and little attempt has been made to do anything with the character. Simply blaring Rupert Gregson Williams' unsubtle score over his every movement does nothing to hide that. For two, almost everyone on show is completely one-dimensional. It's a reasonable shorthand, depicting the Belgian colonisers as evil and the Africans as noble, and if the film was outrageous fun I would have revelled in such a split, but it isn't and the archetypes bore, the simplistic presentation of Dick Dastardlies (chiefly Christoph Waltz) vs brave warriors (Djimon Hounsou &amp; co) or loving families leaving me wanting for human complication and wondering if this treatment wasn't, you know, a bit racist? There is perhaps a flash of depth in Samuel L Jackson's true-life historical figure George Washington Williams. At one point he relates to Tarzan that he was not always a good man. It's a moderately decent scene within a short patch where the film has some personality, but it illustrates its deep problems when the most intriguing character is a regretful soldier AND NOT the English Lord who can communicate with animals having been raised by apes! Jesus. Margot Robbie's Jane is okay but as with everyone else around she feels very much like a 21st Century notion plopped into a 19th Century costume. There is little about this world that feels like 1884.Normally I would hope that the technical merits of a big-budget film would help it out but they, too, are lacking. The CG animals are okay; reunions with elephants and lions (both scenes typically po-faced) impress but the effects are off the pace of the Apes films or The Jungle Book. Director David Yates brings with him the cold visual sheen he used so effectively in his Harry Potter films, but here it merely dulls the wonders of an amazing continent. There are fabulous, verdant greens in jungles, and the savanna David Attenborough has sold to me glows gold enough to make a man cry at evening times. None of this is to be seen in this matt-painted land. Just as it doesn't feel like 1884, neither does this feel like Africa (I should point out here that I've been to neither). The editing, too, is second-rate, certain sequences and action scenes making little sense in places. And where was Cheetah! None of my gripes would matter if there was any enjoyment in watching Tarzan's new legend but the dreary sincerity means they all hammered home. I'd rather watch Congo again, and that's rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Known Stars Distract From Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really too bad that Christoph Waltz brought his Inglorious Bastards (2009) Oscar winning performance of his sophisticated Nazi character without more and Samuel L. Jackson brought his typical big screen persona to his luscious period film. Instead of relying on the powerful script and the dominating presence of the lead character played by Alexander Scarsgard and an original evil character, it would speculate that concerned producers and industry backers required some well known actors to help ensure audience turn out. What Christoph brought was a by none a staid and fixated performance while Samuel's screen presence seemed to be his own screen persona that didn't really fit with the period nuance of the times instead of the other way around, Samuel fitting into the movie.The movie suffered slightly from some jarring editing, especially one where Margot Robbie asks a question of Christoph Waltz each isn't never really responded to and likely edited out and later where Christoph Waltz and his crew suddenly appear out of nowhere to confront Alexander Scarsgard later on in the movie. Additionally the special effects and technology or budget limitations prevent the climax of the movie to be truly amazing and authentic.What this movie does bring to the screen is the continuing legend of Tarzan and expanding on the typical Tarzan legend. The director is one of the few who apparently can handle the difficult and challenging use of flashback technique. He also brings a fresh and touching vision of Tarzan to the big screen. While the movie doesn't quite have the extended suspense of Michael Crighton's Congo (1995), The Legend of Tarzan brings a more intimate, and character focused perspective of Tarzan, a more emotionally touching and revealing vision of Tarzan rather than the over-used mystery adventure.</fullReview>

The whole film is vapid, flavorless and inane. Mr.Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom, does not prove being a major actor in this role, anyone could have been in his place. Mr. Samuel L. Jackson is the same in all the movies, eating the bread to thousands of other players definitely more talented than him(I had enough to see him in almost all the movies). Even "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"(1984), directed by Hugh Hudson with Christopher Lambert and Andie MacDowell is much better. And because it is about writing reviews here, somebody from IMDb or other serious writers of reviews, nobody doesn't notices and to tell to those who do nothing than to narrate the film, that doesn't mean writing a review ???????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan! . . . Where to begin? . . . which is apparently the same question Roland Emmerich was asking himself before, during and after the film was over. The first hour of the film is a constant and tiring reminder that there used to be a Tarzan etc etc etc and to be fair, Tarzan was never really that interesting a story.It's difficult to say whether or not there's any spoiler alerts in this quick review because there isn't anything to spoil. In short, the one - star review is basically for the appearance of Margot Robbie's face, even if she is billed FIFTH on IMDb behind five male actors, three of whom are playing the same character.As for the film itself, Christoph Waltz is in it . . . so he's the villain then . . . Alexander Skarsgard is in it cause . . . well . . . someone needs to do be Thor &amp; casting a Hemsworth would probably be a bit on the nose . . . Margot's in it obviously . . . cause you know, why not? . . . and Sam Jackson's in it cause it's a movie.Djimon Hounsou does an admirable job, acting as if his role isn't completely beneath him and for a film that seems to admire the environment so much, the fact that there are no real animals in it, being worn as some kind of badge of honor in the p.r drive, speaks volumes about the overall quality of the production.I could arguably give the film two stars because of Sam Jackson's presence but that's just not enough to qualify this plot less, pointless, piece of boring nonsense as anything other than a complete waste of billions of dollars and anybody's viewing time.So obviously expect the sequel sometime in the next . . . zzzz . . . zzzzzz . . . zzzzzz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope, this is not Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read through a bunch of the 10-stars reviews here glorifying this movie as the bets Tarzan there is. I really had to get into me asking myself if I am so wrong with my verdict. Well, I stick with it. This is one of the worst Tarzan movies I have seen.Let me elaborate a bit. It is not the movie itself that I don't like. The cinematographic craftsmanship is great. Camera, lighting, cut, scenery and great supporting acting (Christoph Waltz is excellent again) speak for the movie. But that is not the reason why I went to see it.I went to the theatre to get a great Tarzan experience. And this movie fails badly. Since a kid I am a Tarzan fan. I saw so many movies including the early ones with Johnny Weissmueller and Lex Barker. They had what I call a Tarzan charisma. Something that Alexander Skarsgard does not have at all. Nope, he is no Tarzan, has nothing of him. A good actor but surely no Tarzan.The story line is very disappointing. I felt fooled. It is so trivial and easy to predict. It is not ERB's Tarzan tale filled with some additions here and there, it is a stereotype action story filled with some Tarzan tale pieces here and there.No, this movie fails badly as a Tarzan movie. There is no "Tarzan" in it and no "Tarzan tale" either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good story, backed by appealing visual effects, impressive direction and solid performance - what more did you expect from "The Legend of Tarzan"..and guys, you are missing the point, the 1st half of the story portrayed a civilized John Clayton who initially refused to go back to the wild as Tarzan. As the story unfolded, John did visit Congo on an invitation (from King Solomon) orchestrated by a mercenary (Capt Leon Rom) hired by King Solomon who was exploiting the Congolese people and the rich mineral resources of Congo. The true intention was to trade Tarzan off to an enemy Tribal leader (his son was killed by Tarzan) and get precious diamonds in return, to fund the King's Army. Tarzan however believed in his instinct and went to Congo to see for himself, the wrath brought upon by King Solomon on his tribesmen and Congolese people. The story takes an interesting turn when Capt Leon abducts Tarzan's wife Zane as a compensation (also as a hostage) after his futile attempt to capture John aka Tarzan. The rest of the movie reveals how John Clayton transforms himself into his wild avatar Tarzan and rescues his wife and eventually saves Congo from slavery and tyranny imposed by King Solomon. A must watch !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do NOT judge this film by Hollywood's past mistakes. For the first time Tarzan is presented on the big screen as he was meant to be. This is a story of a man who has straddled two worlds finally settling in civilization but called back to investigate atrocities in his native jungle.Exactly who is the more civilized? The she-ape who rescues an orphaned infant or the King who authorizes slavery and conquest.This film has adventure, beauty, death, and award winning special effects. It provides laughter, amazement, drama, and questions to ponder.The cast is strong with characters that you care about. Alexander Skarsgard pushes endurance to the limit - a hero who overcomes his primal urge. Margot Robbie is feisty and strong - a mate worthy of a hero. Samuel Jackson provides light moments with thought provoking questions.There is a little Tarzan in us all. Have you beat on your chest today?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Criminally Under-appreciated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Johnny Weismmuller's Tarzan as well as a lifelong fan of film. So naturally when i saw they were making a new Tarzan i had high hopes. When the movie premiered, i was astounded at how bad the reviews were. Some reviews even went as far as to call it racist. I tried to put these reviews out of my mind and watched the movie with an open mind, refusing to believe that the movie could be as bad as the reviews made it out to be. After viewing it, i can only come to the conclusion that some sort of under the table smear campaign has been launched against what in my opinion is a first rate, high quality film. So if you are thinking about seeing this film, ignore the bad reviews because they're not relevant to the film. No matter which way you look at this film, it is not a bad film. There are two things to note about this film, however: 1) this is not the Disney Tarzan and 2) this movie takes place in a racist part of history and deals with slavery and European conquest. The film does not shy away from the harsh realities of its historic setting and even builds the plot around it. This makes for a much more realistic, serious film. Alexander Skarsgard truly took his role as Tarzan very seriously and the result is the most interesting yet human Tarzan yet. His origins story, unlike the other Tarzan films, is portrayed as tragic. He is a confused man who, despite being out of the jungle for ten years, will never fit in as a normal human. As a result, this Tarzan finds comfort in one thing beyond all others, his wife, Jane. And when she is taken by Leon Rom (Waltz) in an attempt to lure him into a trap, we truly see what Jane means to Tarzan and what he will do to get her back. Skarsgard absolutely nails this performance and brings us the most convincing and the most physical Tarzan yet. Margot Robbie's solid modern woman interpretation of Jane is also worth noting. Christopher Waltz plays the same role he plays in every film but that doesn't make it any less lovable. Samuel L Jackson features in the film as well bringing a very familiar humorous air when he plays the character of George Washington Williams but by the end of the movie you realize the true significance of his character. Now in the reviews i saw complaints about the CGI and i have to admit that in the trailers the animated animals looked horrendous. But when i actually saw the film, the animation seemed at the very least average. Almost all the aspects of this movie fit together perfectly. The screenplay is great except for maybe a few scenes where the dialogue got a little unrealistic. The directing of this movie is also brilliant. The sound design was amazing and the score fit the film perfectly. Yes, the plot is not overly original but the film is not being driven by the plot as much as it is the characters and the gradual discovery of who Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan and Margot Robbie's Jane really are. I have never written a review for anything before and i have never been compelled to write one before this movie. I felt however that Tarzan in 2016 was a brave move for all involved and they pulled it off perfectly and therefore deserve some credit that has not been given to them by movie reviews. It makes me mad how little recognition this film is getting for being the amazing piece of cinema that it truly is. So i encourage everyone who likes movies as much as i do to revel around this spectacle. Thank you</fullReview>

Hounsou, Jackson and Waltz are great pieces too. They made Tarzan the legendary APE-MAN that he is. Hope to get a better adventure/story line next time. Although, the plot is not far away on how ERB tells Tarzan.All in all I am giving 8/10 because the movie made me excited, as if I was a boy again reading his adventures.</fullReview>

Was glad to see they got the Mangani right for a change. Even if you know nothing of Burroughs books I think you would enjoy this movie. The actor portrayed Tarzan as he should be portrayed. Not some stupid grunting idiot but a Lord in his own right in London as well as in the jungle. The closest any movie before this came to portraying him as he should be was Greystoke. This movie far surpasses it. The animals were very believable as were the natives. The jungle scenes were breathtaking and I was so glad to see Jane as feisty as she was in the books. Jane is no simple damsel in distress. She is Lady Greystoke, and mate to Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Special effects were believable and the acting was very good. Alexander Skarsg?rd was a perfect choice for Tarzan! His range of being an articulate English Lord to a fighting powerhouse of fury was totally believable. Margot Robbie did well as Jane, but I think a lot of actresses could have played that part with equal skill. Christoph Waltz is so good at playing the evil villain because I think that is the only role he ever plays. And of course Samuel L. Jackson (who is always terrific) as George Washington Williams (who was a real life person true to the character in the movie). The story was different than the normal Tarzan stories so that was a plus too. I would highly recommend watching it.</fullReview>

We finally have a filmmaker who paid attention to the original characters as written and conceived and put them together in an adventure that Burroughs himself could have written. No more "Me Tarzan, you Jane." No more silly Cheetah the chimp. No more weak and helpless mate. This film takes the heart and soul of the "real" Tarzan and brings it into the 21st century just enough to make it appealing to the modern audience. Check it out.

		<fullReview>I can't comment on the movie as a whole, since I walked out halfway through. But I had 3 major objections to what I did see:- Margot Robbie's Jane is annoyingly modern and out of context of the time. Held hostage by the villain, she is unrelentingly sassy and shows no sign of even slight concern for herself or her friends threatened with death. And she's so pure and good the butterflies flock to her.- Making a swashbuckling revenge fantasy out of an historical atrocity borders on the offensive, the prime example being Inglorious Basterds. If they had showed the true story of how 10 million people died in the Congo for Leopold's profit, it would have been a very depressing movie. The real Leon Rom did not pay for his crimes, while here he is a caricature who meets a deservedly gruesome end. Good is saintly and Evil punished. - Sorry, no way a 200 pound human slams at top speed into an 800 pound gorilla and comes out without rib splinters poking out of his lungs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the online photo-stills make "The Legend of Tarzan" look pretty hokey, so I was a little hesitant about paying to sit through it in the theater. Having now taken the chance, I can happily say that this film is definitely not another feeble disappointment like 1984's "Greystoke." Though purists may dislike the fact that it's not directly based on any one of Burroughs's novels, there is still basic loyalty to his Tarzan mythos, and the way it incorporates some true history?King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo Free State, poaching of its game, and horrible enslavement of its natives for profit?adds a great deal of relevance for a modern audience.While it's obviously intended mainly as plain old entertainment, "The Legend of Tarzan" meshes humor and heartbreak very well, and the many action sequences are riveting without going too far in asking us to suspend disbelief. No, it doesn't all make perfect sense, but perfect sense can hardly be expected of a fantasy of this kind. The visuals and animation are quite arresting; most of the animals look real, the one glaring exception being the Mangani apes. But then again, this film reminds us that the Manganis are NOT gorillas or chimps. As in Burroughs, they are a separate legendary species--a missing link of some kind, perhaps? The script is generally decent even though many of the lines sound more 21st than 19th century. Good acting by all the major players, but those who play the native Africans steal the show.Some budget constraints are evident, and it's an ambitious storyline to pack into two hours: The whole pace of the film is a bit hurried. Regardless, anyone who's interested in seeing another Tarzan film in the first place should not be disappointed and may really love "The Legend of Tarzan."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgettable in every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan, the half man half animal with his iconic cry has been immortalized in movies for numerous times, most know for its Disney adaptation. This time Tarzan comes to the movie screen in a live action adaptation directed by David Yates ( know for the later Harry Potter movies) starring Alexander Skarsard, Margot Robbie, Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz. So? What's not to be exited for? Well? a lot.While the classic story of Tarzan might have been adapted many times before, the decisions of the writers to make a story after the well known legend, caught me off guard from the beginning of the movie. Don't go into this movie expecting the classic story of Tarzan because you will only get flashes of it by way of flashbacks (pun indented). While the use of flashbacks may be effective, it seems in The Legend of Tarzan desperately tries to explain certain other actions in the movie by way of these flashbacks, but they come off as off-beat. The real story in the movie is pretty far fetched and the intentions of Christoph Waltz's characters to lure Tarzan back to Africa are almost as ridiculous as the CGI and green-screen effects in the movie. Maybe it is because of the beautiful CGI works as the new Jungle Book, Gravity etc. Recently, but during this movie I was continuously getting frustrated by recognizing the usage of green-screen and CGI. Skarsgard does however succeed at portraying a convincing Tarzan. The other performances are all good to okay: Robbie continues to convince me being a well-rounded actress while Christoph Waltz continues to raise the question if he is only really good in Tarantino pictures. While L. Jackson is fun to watch at, he gave me kind of the impression of just screwing around and making himself have as much fun as possible because he saw immediately that this film wasn't that good to begin with. Basically this movie is another summer blockbuster movie, without having any purpose apart from making money. While the action in the movie does enough to not make fall asleep, it ultimately falls way short. Hopefully Yates doesn't fall short again with the next movie in the Harry Potter universe.5,5/10 Verdict: Forgettable in every way</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is directed by David Yates and stars the likes of Alexander Skarsg?rd, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou, Jim Broadbent, and Christoph Waltz. With a director such as the amazing David Yates, you'd except your fantasy movie experience to be special considering his brilliant previous work on the Harry Potter franchise but you'd just be left disappointed - like me. This movie had it all going for, a big budget, an amazing cast and director all they had to do was come up with a simple script that pushes Tarzan towards his adventure on the jungle, and they failed miserably. The story is so confusing and even worse uninteresting that at a point you're left asking yourself - is Tarzan even on this ? And when we finally do arrive at the ever so expected Tarzan classic sequences such as, swinging through the jungle, it is so disappointing and terribly done that you realize it was not worth the wait at all. Heck, even the fight scenes with Tarzan in it were so poorly shot, with intense shaky cam that makes it nearly impossible to tell what's going on. Then there are a lot of side stories that are just thrown in there for the sake of the story that you do not care about at all. On a more positive note though, Samuel L. Jackson looked like he was having fun on the role and his character gave the film that much needed energy from time to time. Christoph Waltz however was generic to an unbelievable degree, his character's motivation for doing the things he's doing make very little sense, not that anybody even cares about it either way. Even the CGI was mediocre, in a year when we've had movies like The Jungle Book where the talking animals looked almost photo-realistic, Legend of Tarzan just fails on that and many other levels too. There were a few scenes here and there that were fine-ish to look at and slightly interesting but overall I would not recommend this film at all. It is filled with potential but only ends up being a major disappointment that suffers from terrible pacing and a story which is all over the place to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan still going strong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7/10. In a different take on Tarzan, he is lured back to the jungle after he has settled back into normal society. I was thinking that Tarzan has been done to death, but I was surprised and really enjoyed this. In the safe hands of Director David Yates I found myself drawn into the Tarzan world and didn't find any low points, it was well paced and kept me interested. Alexander Skarsg?rd who normally plays small roles in films, does a decent job as the lead actor. Christoph Waltz is great as usual, and Margot Robbie as Jane also is good, it has been a big year for this up and coming Australian actor. So definitely check this one out, it's a solid fun action flick. Legend of Tarzan #legendoftarzan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed the new version of the ape man , Tarzan . all the stories and films that had seen so far portrayed the origins of Tarzan and stories of this jungle . This film deserves a big applause for being one Tarzan return to its origins . I love the detail of the figure female again to screw it up. No Jane , there was film. :) The most negative points are the special effects in fighting with animals and excessive conduct of Tarzan , while English earl . Clayton expected a well dressed but with some animal behaviors , typical of their origins . I enjoyed knowing that the villain was Rom based on a villain even existed and terrorized humanity .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable, but overly simple and flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a sequel of sorts to the old Tarzan, not that it matters since it throws in the story of him growing up all over the place at random points. The film is about Tarzan stopping a slave dealer, pretty simple not gonna lie. The film's start does not give the impression that that is what the film's is about, more like it gives you no idea due to change places without giving some sort of context. Fortunately the film stops doing stop and then starts to have focus. The middle of the film is a simple action filled romp through the forest and Jane dealing with the crew of the slave ship. After that is a fight to stop the villain. Again, very simple, though is not that big of a problem as it does make it easy to follow. Another problem is a string of plot holes, first the "If you do anything unlady like he drowns" rule being ignored, the cage getting open for no reason, and the ship crew catching up way too quickly. Overall, I would suggest seeing it if you like simple films, but skip it if you want something complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missing fantasy world without the beauty of brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Tarzan is more a tragedy in today's world. It is a sad time where we rape nature, destroy balance and revel in our destruction. When I used to read ERB's books, it did transport me to fantasy land. A land where everything was in harmony. In balance. In sync. Where the circle of life was complete. This movie, did remind me of our rapacious nature. It signaled the unstoppable nature of human appetite for destruction. But as a standalone move, it could have been better.I read somewhere in trivia that Tarzan was a superhero. Well, not exactly with super powers, but definitely super human. He was supposed to have these extraordinary capabilities. He had been able to even defeat the great apes. The story teller or the director may have wanted to show the vulnerable or weaker side of him, but to me that was not Tarzan. For him to be defeated physically, his foe would have had to also been subject to character development. Tarzan is a character that is meant to challenge our physicality. If it were intelligence, I would go for, off the top of my head, 12 Angry Men, JRRT's LOTR and Peter Jackson for imagination, Star Wars for effects. I would have really liked to see Tarzan fighting and winning physical fights. At the end of the day, Tarzan won. Simply because of his brute force in the sensitive universe of Africa. Not politicking. I hope the next story stays in the glorious fantasy world of ERB and brings out the physicality of Tarzan with a poignant touch. We don't really need realism here, but brutality. I want to see magnificent fighting. I want a contrast of nature with our modernity. I want the star of the movie to be Nature, her beauty and what might have been. PS. It may have been interesting to see why Tarzan transitioned from nudity to loin cloth/pants!</fullReview>

In addition to the fight scenes in the movie is unwanted;I wished to be a story as it is with these huge productivity.There were also scenes of a fight does not have a goal and a waste of time only.Sex scenes were completely overriding the fantasy scenes in the film and that's what made me feel more frustrated. Very Baaad movie. I hope to remake this film with the usual story without any change&#x61b; Or to change a little of the story, but in a manner consistent with a goal.As part of productivity, I heartily applaud this wonderful and beautiful effort&#x61b; Most of the scenes were fantastic and fun and gave a pretty valuable to see the film.

		<shortDescription>Totally wrong but good graphics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Make no mistake: I gave it a 6 for the graphic work alone. The rest was pure rubbish. I was expecting a dark, cruel and gritty movie and I got something out of Disney for Kids.Tarzan for me is a wild animal, not this "oh, I hurt my little toe now I am crying". He was also overly adept at throwing himself out from huge cliffs into the unknown below, and such. Tarzan does not care about being politically correct. And really: Who was politically correct in the end of the 19:th century? Tarzan showed his body all the time but Jane did not show hers once. Not very fair, is it? Sadly Skarsg?rd was the totally wrong actor for this. They should have found someone rock hard that can kill without batting his eyes. Not this soft type who is smiling as an idiot whenever he sees a baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different tazan story but interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Legend of Tarzan" is joyous. The Legend of Tarzan was really fun to watch. Much more fun than the marketing made it look. More and more lately I am discovering disconnect between myself and the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend of Tarzan. The Legend of Tarzan is unique in that it's not an origin story. I like this movie but Is the movie perfect? Probably not, but it comes so damn close that I don't care.As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Congo is divided up between Belgium and the United Kingdom. The Belgian government is on the verge of bankruptcy, having gone into heavy debt to build a national railway and other infrastructure. In response, King Leopold II of the Belgians decides to extract the Congo's rich mineral deposits, sending his envoy Léon Rom(Christoph Waltz) to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. Rom's expedition is ambushed and massacred, with only Rom surviving. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), offers him the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: Tarzan. In London, the man once called "Tarzan", now called John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke inherited from his father. George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), who recognises John from the stories of "Tarzan", privately reveals to John, Lord Greystoke, that he suspects the Belgians are enslaving the Congolese population, and persuades him to go to Africa in order to prove his suspicions. Later, Jane, Tarzan and George Washington Williams come to Africa to inspect Belgian government. Tarzan, Jane and Williams take their trip to the Congo. There, the trio encounters a tribal village that knew Tarzan and Jane during their stay in the jungle. That night, as the tribe sleeps, Rom and his mercenaries attack the village and kidnap Tarzan and Jane and kill the tribe's leader. They then escape to a nearby steamboat with Jane and several of the tribe's members, but Williams is able to rescue Tarzan. With the aid of the tribe's warriors, Tarzan and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, providing Williams with the evidence he needs to expose King Leopold who enslave Congo people. They also discover that Rom intends to use the diamonds to pay for a massive army to subdue the Congo, and allow Belgium to mine its wealth for Leopold's benefit. As Tarzan and Williams continue onward, Tarzan encounters the adult Akut, who is now leader of the apes. Aware that Akut considers him a deserter, Tarzan challenges him to a fight and loses. That night, as Tarzan recovers and they continue to recues Jane from Rom and his mercenaries. On Rom's steamboat, Jane dines with Rom, before escaping and swimming to shore. Jane stumbles into an ape nest, Rom and his mercenaries killed many ape to take Jane out. Tarzan saves the remaining apes, reconciling with Akut, before pursuing Rom. He is cornered by Mbonga and his tribe, where it is revealed that Tarzan once killed Mbonga's only son for previously murdering Kala. A defeated Mbonga tearfully accuses Tarzan of lacking honour, as his son was just a young boy when Tarzan killed him. Tarzan spares Mbonga, just as Akut and the apes arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom takes Jane and the diamonds to Boma, where he plans to take control of the army. Tarzan, Williams and Akut trigger a massive stampede of wildebeest through Boma, destroying the town and distracting the soldiers, allowing Tarzan to rescue Jane. As Rom attempts to escape by boat, Williams sinks it with a machine gun as Tarzan swims aboard. Rom tries to kill Tarzan, before Tarzan throws Rom into the water, where he is devoured by crocodiles. Williams returns to England and presents the Prime Minister with evidence exposing the slave trade in the African Congo. One year later, Tarzan and Jane, having remained in Africa and settled in Jane's father's old house, welcome their first child, as Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, returns to his rightful place among the great apes as Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so bad I think the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating other than my charitable nature is that I actually managed to sit through it.I love Tarzan and almost every movie I've seen related to the story but not this one. You get the feeling that the director confuses Tarzan with superman or spider-man. The characters are one dimensional and the actors didn't do the production any favors with their mediocre sometimes child-like performances. I love Samuel L. Jackson and his was the only acceptable performance (though definitely not his best, yet still passable). What's really sad is that the movie did have potential, but I guess they had so many different ideas that they got distracted and ended up with events that were disconnected and all-over the placeIt was a waste of money and time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director David Yates, who inherited the beloved Harry Potter characters and brought that series home in its final four entries, makes the wise decision to direct Tarzan remake, however The Legend of Tarzan ends up being a garbled, clunky production that tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing no one. Alexander Skarsgard is more abs than actor as the ape man. In the end, though, it's really just some pretty pictures, and some computer- generated animals. It was a huge disappointment and will bomb at the box office due to no extraordinary responses from viewers. I would go with 2/5 for this poorly remade movie of a famous character in our early childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entirely different take on the story of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aptly named as the song that spoke of his feral legends sung by tribals, it is an above average flick that has been beautifully helmed by David Yates. Even though the style of frame depiction is sheer amazeballs, The Legend of Tarzan isn't exactly all goodies either.DIRECTION OF THE LEGEND OF TARZAN I have a mixed feeling about Yates direction. Bits where he chooses different angles to depict a grim situation, cashing in on the intensity makes every frame powerful. He aces such frames with badass music in the backdrop. However there are moments where his frames tumble into the shoddy territory. Like when he starts rotating the camera around a character who is delivering generic dialogues, it is hard to take him seriously. Action scenes in Legend of Tarzan are very unsteady, and it is almost impossible to focus on what's really happening until it's all over. Either the characters are too zoomed in or not properly shown. There are plenty of areas where this is evident.Music is brilliantly chosen and imparts quite a darker comportment to the movie. Screenplay is kind of okay. There are two to three memorable one liners that will definitely wiggle your ears. The other moments, however, your ears will stay parched in need of some intelligent literary lines.PLOT OF THE LEGEND OF TARZAN Another area where Tarzan scores profusely is the plot. It comes with a good one, beating the clichés of the jungle tale. The only sad thing is that revisiting the old story is like a constant to and fro motion. It is done at awkward junctures, without choosing a proper way to deliver the complete storyline. Visuals are average. Sometimes you see the CGI dwindle too much taking things towards the animated crossroads.Alexander Skarsgard works magnificently in the shoes of the legendary Tarzan. He creates a more silent and darker aired hero who let his grim nature do the talking for him.You will also find humour at weird junctures in The Legend of Tarzan, mostly coming from Samuel L. Jackson as George Washington Williams and his shenanigans but most of it is bland.SPOILERS CLINGING HEREON Conversations between Leon Rom and Jane Clayton are the worst. There is something wrong with their timing, and the fact that Yates is okay with it, will leave you scratching your head. Also, you cannot overlook the constant disconnect there is to the tale. Just when you begin to think that something is going to happen, the frame changes to a different timeline entirely. It is a constant wrestle between the frames that takes out the tangibility from the movie.BADASS MOMENTS TO REMEMBER The Legend of Tarzan is gorgeously blended with moments that resuscitate elements from his past. The first one being the cubs he grew up with. There is a moment where he bows down to grown up versions of lions and lionesses, who recognize him and rub their heads against him in mute affection. Also, the fight between Akut and Tarzan is definitely one of the most theatrical bits of the tale. The mere fact that he fights with someone whom he can't defeat is ballsy per se. When he tries to save Jane by covering her with his body is both romantic and brave. Another one where he beats a box of soldiers to pulp with his bare hands is one helluva eye-candy.THE FINAL VERDICT The Legend of Tarzan has its ups and downs that constantly keep playing with your head. There are flaws galore at the same time beautiful moments to be cherished. I would say go for it, so you don't regret not watching it, if there are future sequels planned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been a struggle from the beginning, its like they tried to put everything in a giant basket and expect it to be okay, the story line is confusing, i had a hard time filtering the romance, revenge, action because they just kept taking us from one theme to another without putting a proper bridge, and the dialog was absolutely ridiculous. i expected more from the director because of his good past record. Maybe i had higher expectations from it because the trailer was so captivating and made me so eager to want see what they were bringing to the big screen.

		<fullReview>Did you think you knew Tarzan's story? Well Warner Bros. is here to prove you wrong. In their new re-imagining of the iconic character the story takes place further down the line: Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) now goes by the name of John Clayton, living as noble lord in London, married to Jane (Margot Robbie). Yet, when Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), trying to conquer Congo for the king of Belgium, invites John down in Congo to set a trap in exchange for diamonds, Tarzan, Jane and his local friends have to find a way to overpower Rom's twisted scheme.I have to admit that I wasn't anyways intrigued by this film, probably because I was never able to grasp or enjoy the story and mythology behind the titular character. Yet, out of loyalty to David Yates, who in my opinion and probably solely in my opinion, made one of the best films of all time in "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince", I wanted to go check out his work no matter what. I came out still believing he is a truly gifted director, but not even he could overcome the boring and empty narrative this film contains.Right from the opening shot Yates manages to create an atmosphere that is unique, different and personal, you are immediately glued to the screen for how he manages to stage visually the movie. There is an immediate tone, I have to admit I was expecting, and it throws you off balance in a good way, my attention was devolved entirely to the film.As always Yates does fantastic visual storytelling and he had repeatedly moments in the film of slow building and quiet pace that were not at all what I was excepting from a Tarzan film and were definitely a great surprise. He then juxtaposes these moments to sweeping camera movements with incredible swiftness in the times of action an running which were absolutely beautiful and riveting from a solely based on the visual splendor value.The film also has to be commended for having its heart in a really good place, the wide use of ethnic actors, location, cultural respect and overall message were all things of primal emphasis and they were most certainly a pleasant and story dictated element that really worked. The intentions the filmmakers have are the most noble and whilst their message of respect for nature and culture doesn't really emerge in the context, you can see where they're coming from and it is a very good place.Unfortunately all of the above is simply undermined by a narrative void of any character depth, interesting theme or coherent structure. It is plainly and simply boring, there is rarely any real danger or stakes, it is full of dull clichés and basically gives nothing to do to any of the actors who almost all appear flat because of it, with the possible exception of Christoph Waltz who does manage to emerge and give the character a beat on screen and a driving cause that you understand.This adaptation of the legendary story fails to deliver anything of note as a filmmaking effort, yet its good heart and redeemable features make it a harmless film that I still can recommend to families if finding themselves short on things to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure we needed this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure that I would have bothered to go to the cinema to see yet another Tarzan movie (even though the last one was 32 years ago) if it wasn't for the fact that I was entertaining my nine year old friend Joshua. What is different this time is the deployment of extensive specific effects to portray an array of wild animals and a politically correct story-line in which Tarzan is allied with the natives against the brutality of Belgian colonialism. Swedish Alexander Skarsg?rd and Australian Margot Robbie certainly look the part of Tarzan and Jane but hardly distinguish themselves in thespian terms, while American Samuel L Jackson and Austrian Christoph Waltz as Tarzan's friend and foe respectively both exhibit far more charisma but can only lift the quality so far, given that the first half of the movie is so plodding and the second half is so predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion on This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly only one of The Autistic Reviewers saw this movie. So only Autistic Jay will be reviewing "The Legend of Tarzan." The story of Tarzan has been told so many different ways...some good, some bad. This one was more on the bad side. Read to find out why: You have the cast of Alexander Skarsg?rd (who was a horrible Tarzan), Margot Robbie (Who was a very fake Jane), Christoph Waltz (Who is actually okay in this film, but the problem is he is really underused), and of course Samuel L. Jackson (who plays George Washington Williams...and he plays him extremely well. Probably the best actor in the entire movie.) The movie starts off with Tarzan in England...years and years after leaving the Jungle. Instead of starting from scratch...the film decides to give us flashbacks of Tarzan's childhood and his family, which would be growing up with the Gorillas. The flashbacks seemed completely off and sometimes it would hurt your eyes trying to see what was happening in the flashbacks. The green screen was so obvious and the CGI was incredibly fake. To whose who said the CGI was better in this movie than in The Jungle Book is dreaming. The Jungle Book was 100% convincing compared to this. The direction by David Yates felt very "Harry Potter." I just believe with the right director, the right use of CGI, the right actors and a better script this movie could've actually been really good, but it had a lot of work that needed to be done.There are entertaining scenes, don't misunderstand me, but it just wasn't good enough. I expected way more, especially for someone who grew up loving Tarzan. 5/10 2/5 stars. Autistic Jay (a member of The Autistic reviewers)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan Isn't The Legendary Flop it Has Been Made Out to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I heard a positive word about The Legend of Tarzan leading up to it's release. It was all talk about how it was destined to flop and the gigantic budget that Warner Bros threw at it. So it was easy to go into the movie with low expectations and hope for the best. I wish I could follow a lot of the reviews on here saying it was the best Tarzan movie I've seen (I'm still partial to the Disney animated Tarzan) but it's not nearly as bad as it's low rotten tomatoes score suggests.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In the late 19th century, some of the land in African Congo region is still being divided up. King Leopold of Belgium is in trouble, he's defaulting on his loans and will have them called soon. His head representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has been sent by him to make a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Honsou) who controls a region where diamonds are plentiful. They're able to locate his tribe but the armed escort is butchered by Mbonga's followers. Leon is able to defend himself however and is able to to make a deal with Mbonga promising to trade him Tarzan (who Mbonga has a grudge against for reasons I won't spoil) for enough diamonds to help Leopold pay off his debts.We then move to England where a committee of Lords including the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) are trying to convince the Earl of Greystoke aka John Clayton III aka Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgaard) to take a trip to the Congo to investigate Leopold's claims of rejuvenated Congo where it is now a slavery free state. Tarzan is the closest thing to a celebrity that the Congo has according to George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) who's an American representative at the meeting, so that's why Clayton got the invitation. John says he's tired of Africa and says no. When he leaves, George follows him out saying that he needs to go. There's strong evidence to suggest Leopold is using slave labour to run the colony and with Williams being a Civil War hero is trying to expose it. John reconsiders and decides to go talk to his wife Jane (Margot Robbie).Jane is a schoolteacher and John finds her in the middle of a lesson at their mansion. He kindly interrupts it and after answering some questions from the children who know he is Tarzan, asks to speak to his wife alone. He tells Jane about his plan and Jane who was essentially raised in Africa is excited to go back. John tells her she cannot come because of her recent miscarriage. She becomes upset and accuses him of coddling her. He finds her the next morning and seeing how upset she is, he reconsiders his position and tells her she can come.All the talk surrounding this movie has been about the big numbers on the budget, not how the movie looks. I thought it was a little disappointing, the closest comparison is the Disney release The Jungle Book and TJB was the better looking of the two. There's a lot of animal CGI and again if you compare the two, it isn't a competition. But on the flip side, the movie did have some interesting looking action. It was fun to see Tarzan swinging through the jungle and dealing with the wildlife. The way the movie portrays the Congo isn't necessarily new but you don't get to see it in the blockbuster season and it was fun to have a different setting. So while maybe the budget should have been smaller, the visual effects were still solid.Another regret when it comes to the lack of success this movie has had is that they did a pretty good job casting it, getting some talented people in the right roles. I don't know Alexander Skarsgard very well but he's very well cast as Tarzan. He's got the physicality for the role and you want to follow him as Tarzan. I think he's let down by the script more than anything. I'm a big Margot Robbie fan and she's the standout again. She's also a victim of the script but through her energy, she makes Jane memorable and interesting. Christoph Waltz was pretty restrained even though it's a lot of his typical villain stuff. I was a little disappointed in Samuel L Jackson, he's a great actor but considering he's actually playing an actual historical character, it felt like he was playing Samuel L Jackson again.I did have 2 problems with this movie. The pacing feels off, there are a lot of important flashbacks and they're well done but they screw with the flow of the plot. The other problem is the actual character development. We know a lot about Tarzan but he's so serious all the time. He barely cracks a smile and with how little fun he seems to be having, it limits how much fun you can have with the movie. We also learn a lot about his past but his attitude and his ideals don't evolve much over the movie. They setup Jane to be a strong heroine but end up stranding her on a boat for a long time. Lastly, I wanted to see more of Chief Mbonga's perspective. Djimon is an underrated actor but he feels like an afterthought.I liked this movie a lot more than I didn't. It offers a perspective on Tarzan that I hadn't seen before and I enjoyed that. There was lots of potential for a new franchise here. I think if they had just kept expectations lower, this could have been a sleeper hit (instead like Batman v Superman, it's not a flop and it's not a hit so no one's happy). Still, the movie was fun but flawed, I'd actually rate it a 7.5/10 but because it has some big stumbling points I'll give it 7/10.</fullReview>

The character arc is, by now, pretty dated, and movies like this need to do more than just update the visuals.Speaking of which, the animation department have done a fairly solid job of bringing the Congo to life. With the exception of a few jarring moments (like the butterfly), the scenery feels pretty authentic on a visual level. That said, some shots of Tarzan swinging on vines feel incredibly weightless, but otherwise it's pretty much the best thing about the movie.The other good thing is Tarzan himself. Skarsgard fits the role very well following his extensive work-out regime, with an impressive physique he is almost certainly proud of! And yet because so much effort was spent on his appearance, very little is going on below the surface. Robbie also does pretty well as Jane - she's far from being a damsel, but I expected a little more fight from her. Waltz is, as always, convincing as the creepy villain until he starts showing off his bracelet fighting skills which completely lost me.The main problem is the screenplay. It adds nothing to the Tarzan legend story-wise, and has some fairly awkward dialogue (especially near the start, with over-elaborative exposition), and a little more comedy might have been a good idea! Jackson delivers a few funny quips but overall the movie takes itself too seriously, which is a huge problem when the ridiculous finale hits the screen.So all in all, Yates has done a brilliant job of making The Legend Of Tarzan a visual treat with great animation and (mostly) impressive camera-work. Shame there was such little development in story, character or innovation. For me it could've done with being a little lighter and more fun, but it filled two hours perfectly adequately, despite the endless scenes of flashbacks.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I went to see the new Tarzan movie as I am a lover of Tarzan since I seen the 1999 classic Tarzan which was distributed by Disney. There has been a lot of Tarzan movies during the years from the Disney one,to George Of The Jungle even there was a film 3 years ago that literally bombed at the box office and now we have the David Yates from Harry Potter fame to direct this sequel from Warner Bros Pictures. The movie opens with a man called Leon Rom played by Christoph Waltz who has set up a scheme to destroy the jungle with his fellow men. Fast forward a few years later and a King called Leopold of Belgium is involved with the jungle scheme as well as Leon Rom and we meet a man called John Clayton III and his wife Jane Clayton(played by Alexander Skarssgard and Margo Robbie) who are living in the late 1800s in London England. Of course as you probably guessed already John Clayton III is actually Tarzan and he has forgotten who he is and himself and the wife,along with a man called George Washington(played by Samuel L Jackson)have no other choice but to go back to the Jungle so that Tarzan can save his mankind from the evil Leon Rom(Waltz),adding some series of flashbacks throughout ranging from Tarzan as a baby who was raised by a monkey to him meeting Jane Porter(nee Clayton)right to the present tense.So will Tarzan save his people and save the jungle?Overall this movie is packed with some very good special effects and the acting is actually fairly good. Alexander was great as Tarzan he was great during the climax scene and Margo was great as Jane who was later kidnapped by Christoph's character. Now my main issue with this film is the story. It actually took me a very long time to get into this thing. Also its very serious and its very dark as there is A lot of violence involved. But still this is the sort of film where you just watch it once and then leave it after that. Also another thing that had me scratching my head for a bit was this King Leopold of Belgium charcther that we never get to see in this movie. I actually thought that Leopold was a Duke of Albany NOT a King from Belgium who died from some sort of disease in 1876? But hey that's just me I guess.Overall its a C+ and a 5/10 rating. Keep an eye out for Ben Chaplin who plays Ella's father in Cinderella(2015)as he is in it for a 10 minute cameo working for Christoph Waltz before he gets killed by the African men,and Jim Broadbent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend isn't specified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite hoping this film was going to be as similar to 1999's Tarzan but wasn't what I expected.The Legend of Tarzan actually starts a year after Tarzan or John Clayton, whatever his name is, leaves the jungle with his beautiful wife (which she is actually), Margot Robbie as Jane. The film started to go a tad slow and was a bit boring. The film is just difficult to keep up with, nothing makes sense and the plot is just sluggish and confusing, very weak also. Alexander Skarsg?rd's portrayal as Tarzan seemed a bit odd and dull though, his character was difficult to understand for me and what he thinks is best, makes him more wounded and weak. But Margot Robbie's portrayal was lovely and understandable. She showed her character as being lovable, caring and very rebellious which I thought was intriguing. Although this film showed many errors in its path, I think it was an average, mediocre film that showed a lot of scenes that were just.. dope. The Legend of Tarzan, a film that isn't as similar nor close to its animated 1999 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They tried way too hard to make this movie worth mentioning. It was dark then comical, then dark again, then suspenseful. It's like they didn't know which way to take the story. Some of the actors did a good job with what they were given, like Margot Robbie as Jane, Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan (although he could've been less cryptic and emotionless), and Christoph Waltz as the antagonist. But other actors like Samuel L Jackson were just out of place and unnecessary to the plot. His character was by far the worse, supposedly the comedic relief, but nothing he said or did was funny. The main plot was decent, but they had potential to take it a lot further than they did. Instead they had like 3 or 4 side plots they decided to play out as well, which left us without any depth to the characters or plot, and left me not caring for Tarzan's past or the relationship between him and Jane. Another big flaw was the CGI. It was bad. 10 years ago it would've been good, but when EVERY SINGLE SHOT of an animal is CGI, then you need to step it up. Which is another grievance I have. It's a movie about Tarzan, and the African Congo, and you can't show one real animal, or even a real jungle? Cmon. That's just lazy film making.Bottom line is they tried to hard to make it funny and dark and should've done one or the other. Another summer film made to just bring in money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During my childhood, I watched many films of Tarzan, with Johnny Weissmuller in the main role and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane. However, even at that short age, I found the Tarzan movies repetitive and excessively simple. And, after having watched The Legend of Tarzan, I keep thinking the same, regardless how much they spent on settings and digital animals. Nevertheless, in order to prove its modernity, The Legend of Tarzan incorporates all the political correction themes related to Africa, including European imperialism, "blood diamonds", slavery, ivory traffic and racism. All those themes, combined with the political intrigue of the governments who wish to possess the wealth of Congo, contribute to make the screenplay confusing, making so many turns that they don't even work as a simple vehicle of the action. Some people are accusing The Legend of Tarzan of being racist due to its reinforcement of the archaic fantasies of the white man as a liberator of the oppressed Africans; but well, the tales written by Edgar Rice Burroughs (the creator of Tarzan) were quite racist, so technically, this new film only emulates the spirit of the literary material which inspired it. It might be more appropriate to wonder why someone thought it would be a good idea to make another Tarzan movie, when all the adaptations made during the last 35 years (Tarzan, the Ape Man; Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes; Tarzan and the Lost City) have been economical failures (with the exception of Tarzan, even though I suspect that its success was more related to its visual innovations than its "disneyfication" of the tale). In the leading role, Alexander Skarsg?rd feels bland and inexpressive, because he isn't able to display any charisma, credibility or internal strength, while Margot Robbie does whatever she can with her generic "damsel in distress" role. As for the special effects, the animals look reasonably realistic when they are still, or in natural attitudes. But as soon as the action scenes begin, their digital origin becomes painfully obvious... specially after having seen the extraordinary effects of The Jungle Book (2016) just a few months ago. In summary, The Legend of Tarzan is one of the most boring and irritating "blockbusters" of recent years. On the other hand, it perfectly fits into the generally poor Boreal summer cinematographic season of 2016, so the problem might be more related to the whole industry than this particular disaster. Instead of spending money on unconvincing digital animals, someone should fix the creative machinery of Hollywood, which once generated newfangled stories and fresh ideas, instead of regurgitating successes of yesteryear without questioning their contemporary validity. We need a remake of that time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie of the year so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The legend of Tarzan isn't the movie we were all expecting it to be. It is a boring film filled with way too many flashbacks and some dialog that just makes no sense. My major complaint coming out of this movie was it tries to be a new version of Tarzan but tries to input the origin of Tarzan into the film. Another major complaint is that the CGI completely sucks. The gorillas don't look real they look as if they're straight out of a ps4 video game. There are two good things and that is Margot Robbe as Jane, now of course she is a damsel in distress but out of all the characters in the film she had the most well written dialog and another good thing is the Sam L.Jackson character. They are the two positive things about this film. All and All this movie is stupid and not interesting by the end of the year this will be in my top 5 worst of the year. It sucks because I was really looking forward to this film and I was let down they should have put more effort in the script. I'll give it two out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Stands Out, Extremely Forgetful,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is a mediocre movie with a mostly well developed plot and a decent cast. It certainly has some great moments, such as Tarzan's brawl with the apes, Alexander Skarsg?rd suited the role nicely, Samuel L. Jackson delivers a performance different to anything he has done before, and plenty of tense scenes from Christoph Waltz, who steals the show as villain Leon Rom, truly bringing him to life. It never managed to feel necessary, it's the first Tarzan movie in years and yet there is nothing that tells us "this is why we needed another Tarzan" there is nothing special about it, nothing you would not see in any other film with this character.As well as that, the CGI is everywhere, making it come across as lazy, the production felt rushed, they should have taken the time to find real landscapes, develop real sets and hire real animals, this would have given the movie a more authentic feel, it clearly relied far too much on green screen and special effects, which did not help in making it any bit more compelling. Not without its moments of greatness, The Legend of Tarzan falls flat as a result of not being any bit unique, it offers nothing new to this franchise and is a forgetful affair, better off giving it a miss. Tarzan must return to his jungle life to save his people from a ruthless tycoon. Best Performance: Christoph Waltz / Worst Performance: Djimon Hounsou</fullReview>

"Life after Tarzan get married" sure many people want to see that. its also have a great cast such as Christoph Waltz and Samuel L Jackson (they kick it). And that's where the problem begin, i think the film think about the cast so much they forgot about the plot and the movie atmosphere.the movie is boring AF, i feel no connection between Alexander Skarsg?rd and Margot Robbie, what emotion and connection they want to emphasize? they went emphasize everything and come out very dull. The ending is a big MEH and the atmosphere? this is where i annoyed the most, i don't feel being drag to a jungle but a big studio with a lot of green props, at the first time Jane meet Tarzan, the lighting not really make it because it hit at the area where emphasize its was a studioand the cgi really? that digital animal just bad, really bad (specially the crocodile one gosh), its like i have been brought back to 00's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Legend of Tarzan' is not as bad as many people have put it out to be, directed by 'Harry Potter' veteran David Yates, is actually a very respectable re-adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs classic character(s). While it's really an original story not borrowed from any books, I'll say for one this film is a accurate in a sense to stand on it's own as well as acting on fidelity of it's source material. I also love the way it defies most the usual conventions of previous Tarzan iterations, and really bring out the big essence of the African landscape as well as the well drawn out nature of it's characters. There's no denying the fact the film is gorgeous to look at especially with such a huge spectacle at play. Though while it's plot may be far from original, that doesn't deteriorate the film from being fun and exciting even when it gets dark, suspenseful and energetically adventurous. The pacing wasn't all too much of a problem for me, as the flashbacks used were to re-establish some of the well known details about the character (How is it any different to the way it was used for Batman or Superman for that matter). The only thing I found to be off-putting was the overuse of CGI for almost 'all of the animals' present in the film, and don't deteriorate from the entertainment factor of this film. For one it's definitely one of the better 'Tarzan' films made to date, a little more respectable adaptation of the character than Disney's 1999 film, John Derek's horrible 1981 film and that 2013 motion capture crapfest for that matter. Finally, the performances from the cast are great, definitely couldn't of picked a better cast for such a picture. If you'd like to take a different look at the character of Tarzan and are curious to see an entertaining and adventurous re- rendition of the character, this film will definitely be worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Legend of Tarzan" Deepens the Tarzan Legacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the current socio-political divisive and racially tumultuous tone of this hot Summer in America, if ever there is a time for healing between peoples of various races and cultures, this is it. While critics pan it and cynics decry it, if one just goes with the flow and enjoys this movie without preconceptions, "The Legend of Tarzan" may be just the summer flick salve needed. As a boy in the 1950s I was enthralled by Johnnie Weissmuller's original film portrayals of Tarzan, King of The Jungle as the orphaned feral wild-child first adopted by the great apes and thereafter by all of Africa. "The Legend of Tarzan" is so souped-up in hyper-drive with the added component of historical and cultural nuance that it is like entering an alternative universe. Edgar Rice Burroughs' pulp fiction novels develop the character of Tarzan, the quintessential noble heroic character who is pure primal man of honor, protector of his woman Jane, his indigenous tribal friends and his beloved natural environment. The Legend of Tarzan is today's perfect family matinée reminiscent of days gone by when one went to movies for escapism, visual beauty, excitement and romanticism. Moreover, there are several important consciousness raising lessons also being offered.Fictional cinematic license was taken with the history and topography of the Congo region. However, to its credit, the plot-line focuses on the private exploitation and enslavement of the Congolese people by King Leopold II of Belgium in 1885. Moreover, the timely integration into "The Legend of Tarzan" of the real-life, but until now, little known American human rights activist hero being, U.S. Ambassador, Dr. Rev. George Washington Williams, (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is seamlessly accomplished and praiseworthy. Williams' life was astonishingly accomplished and remarkable. An African-American free-born in Pennsylvania in 1849, he was a proud 14 year old enlistee into the Union Army and fought in the final battles of the Civil War. Thereafter, Williams went to Mexico and joined the Republican army under the command of General Espinosa, fighting to overthrow Emperor Maximilian and became a commissioned officer. He returned to the U.S. and continued his military career for 5 years in the U.S. Army as a Buffalo Soldier in the Indian Territories. As a contrite wounded veteran he then studied law under President Taft's Father; became the first African-American graduate of Newton Theological Institution; was an Ordained Baptist Minister; published a monthly journal; authored of several notable treatises focusing on African- American history; was the first African-American elected to the Ohio Legislature; President Chester A. Arthur's then appointed him as Consul General to Haiti and was the man who in 1885, personally confronted, investigated first hand and thereafter internationally published an open-letter of condemnation to King Leopold II exposing his brutal exploitation of the Congolese people with a "call and create an International Commission to investigate the charges herein preferred in the name of Humanity ...". These creative liberties actually enhance the fictional Tarzan as a vehicle for change giving the icon an even more compelling, empathetic and politically relevant quality than ever before. The semiotic of the beloved returning prodigal son, as an anti- colonialist European nobleman in partnership with the real life African- American human rights activist at his side together as liberators of both people and animals while organically integrated into the lush wild ecosystem, gives the movie a qualitative spiritual depth that verges on inspirational. The combination of the 3D experience with superb CGI is mesmerizing. The high action fight scenes, the believable Tarzan vine swinging, the muscular physicality and depth of varied emotions of gorillas that is virtually in your face, up close and personal is masterful. The movie is visually breathtaking, spectacular and of epic proportions. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the whole family. It is both great entertainment, humanly heart warming politically astute and thought provoking which may prompt thereafter additional investigation and education by the viewer. What more could we expect or want from Hollywood? Kudos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Entertaining Movie with a Great Tarzan, but with the Worst Editing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Releasing this movie in the summer season was a very good idea, because the locations in the movie and the tone overall ensure a summer feeling. The scenery and photography is really sublime, so I highly recommend to watch the movie in IMAX. 3D would also be good, but not that necessary.PROS: - Alexander Skarsgard is a great Tarzan. He has the physique, the serenity, wildness, sadness, complexity, sensitivity, masculinity..everything that Edgar Rice Burroughs imagined while creating his protagonist. You read it right, the movie is based on a novel written in 1912, therefore it has nothing to do with the Disney version. Forget the Disney version here. You will be up to something new. And better. I have to admit that I imagined this movie being darker in tone and meaning, as it has many light-hearted and funny moments that I perceived as odd within the context. Therefore, I think that children, and families in general would easily enjoy it, as if it is a Disney remake. Margot Robbie's acting is decent. She plays Jane as a very positive and warm-hearted girl, thus impossible not to love. She also has a very feisty and masculine side that makes her more interesting. I liked that balance of her, especially the scenes where she talks in African. Since I'm a huge Jessica Chastain fan, I would have preferred her to play Jane in regard to her acting skills and her age that is close to Skarsgard's(as she was originally attached to the role), however, as it turned out, Margot is definitely a good replacement. I also can't get enough of Jim Broadbent and Samuel Jackson. Loved them in the movie. Jackson, as funny as he is, also shows some emotional depth.I love the story, as it goes beyond fantasy and hints to a more psychological and subterraneous aspect of the human condition. The beginning of the movie takes place in London with Tarzan being a lord who has been living there for 8 years (with his wife Jane). He has to suppress his fierce and wild nature, but when he has to go back to the Congo, he unleashes his real self there, where Jane and him are truly happy and free. They love to be there and consider Africa as their home. The dichotomy between being untamed and civilized is the main topic of the movie, and also the reason why I was interested in it. The scenes where Tarzan is alone and shows his idiosyncrasies by doing the things he used to do in the jungle, as drinking some sort of eggs, making Mangani voices, climbing the tree, etc are really great and memorable moments of the movie.CONS: - The director and studio marketed the animalistic sex scene, but there was none in the movie, so I feel kind of cheated. Tarzan needs an animalistic and primeval love story, so this had to be shown with the sex scene, where Jane also reveals her fierceness. The CGI looks fine, but could have been better, as the vine swinging scenes are not really done well. - Tarzan has to appear real, therefore I would have liked to see Skarsgard having real scenes with animals, as I'm sure that's not an impossible thing to do. We don't see him performing his yell in front of the camera, nor when he imitates animal sounds. Seems like the only thing Skarsgard had to do to prepare for the role was keeping the diet to get into the Tarzan shape, but not pursuing Tarzan's philosophy and becoming part of nature. Christoph Waltz is a great actor, but here he's just a one-dimensional and passive villain. Didn't like him at all. He doesn't seem that brutal and malicious in his scenes, and I got the impression that he actually wants to help Jane to escape or fell in love with her or something like that. All of his dialogs are just odd and awkward. -Where the f''' is John Hurt? I was excited to watch him as Tarzan's grandfather. There is one scene from the 2nd trailer that is not in the final cut, where Tarzan sits in his room in the dark and looks at someone, so I think that's the scene with John Hurt where he tells him something like: "You may not like who you were, and you have enemies there..but you need to go home", but why was that cut?? David Yates' directing doesn't need any positive remarks, as I'm disappointed with him. He has cast the two-time Oscar nominee Djimon Hounsou in his movie, but didn't give him much dialog and background to show his acting skills. The stampede scene at the end is deficient and a rip-off from Disney's Lion King. The plot is too straightforward and the colors used in the movie are too flat and dull. I wanted to love this movie, but somehow the critics were not that wrong about it. Tarzan is considered as the first superhero, but in this movie he is easily defeatable, almost like a wuss. There should have been a flashback of him killing Kerchak, the ape who killed his parents. Tarzan is a savage killer, not just a romantic lover!However, the editing is the worst part of the film. The flashbacks to Tarzan's past are shown between very unfitting and pointless scenes that it just appears absurd. The whole flashback had to be told in one scene, and why does Tarzan's father narrate the first flashback anyway? It doesn't make sense at all. To me it seemed like the movie was shot in 1995 because of the poor editing. With such a high budget, the movie is really not done well and I feel sorry for everyone involved. That's the reason why I prefer watching indie films, where the budget is low, but the editing and acting is central and not the CGI and effects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE LEGEND OF TARZAN': Four Stars (Out of Five) The newest film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary character 'Tarzan'; who first appeared in the novel 'Tarzan of the Apes', in 1912 (it was followed by 25 sequels). This movie tells the story of Tarzan's return to the African jungle (where he was raised by apes), after adapting to a civilized life in London. He's called back to investigate the corrupt activities of a Belgian King there, and then he's lured into a trap by a tribal chief. The film stars Alexander Skarsgard, in the title role, and it costars Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Christoph Waltz and Djimon Hounsou. It was directed by David Yates (who also helmed the last four 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Adam Cozad and Criag Brewer (who also wrote and directed 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN', starring Jackson). The movie is packed with beautiful visuals, and some pretty decent action scenes; it's definitely a lot better than the critics would like you to believe.John Clayton III, also known as Tarzan (Skarsgard), was raised by apes in the African Congo jungle; after his parents were murdered by other (more vicious) primates. As an adult, Tarzan meets a woman, named Jane Porter (Robbie), and the two marry and move to London together. Tarzan becomes totally adapted to the civilized world, but he's later asked to return to his home; by a Belgian king. Initially Tarzan rejects the idea, but an American, named George Washington Williams (Jackson), persuades him to accept the offer. Williams believes the king is enslaving the people there, and he wants proof of it.The movie had a budget of $180 million; and you can see just about all of it, up on screen (the visuals are breathtaking). Skarsgard is a pretty flawless Tarzan (especially his amazing physique), and I really enjoyed the movie's darker (more adult) tone; compared to most of the 'Tarzan' movies I grew up with. The film is a little slow-paced, at times, but it's mostly a lot of fun. It's also a great movie for animal lovers, much like 'THE JUNGLE BOOK' (from a couple months ago). If you really love animals, it's hard not to appreciate a film like this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because who doesn't love a little eight-packed ripped abs on a six-foot-four handsome giant? Though, as my husband claimed, they could have been digitally enhanced. I doubt it, though.All my favorite tropes combined in this film to make one of my favorite movies I've seen this year: wide-screen action, amazing CGI, a love-to-hate bad-guy, cinematic beauty with beautiful jungle, river, and savanna-scapes, and some really hot romance. What's not to love? I've grown up a fan of the Tarzan/Jane love story. I watched the Johnny Weismuller versions as a girl, and enjoyed the cartoon Disney with my kids. But I admit to always hoping for a well-done cinematic modern-take on the story, and this one delivered quite well. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads sizzles, Nick Fury (because he's not really Samuel L. Jackson to some of us) follows through a believable hero, and the back-story of Tarzan's growing-up years was well-placed and smoothly worked in to the overall story.Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite Some Rough Edges, The Legend Of Tarzan Is A Pleasant Surprise... A Good Tarzan Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After decades of trying to bring a successful live-action Tarzan film to the big screen, Warner Brothers and director David Yates have come as close as anyone could have hoped for, with The Legend of Tarzan. This Tarzan has a little bit of extra fat in its script and its big scenes don't fly as high as they could, but The Legend of Tarzan is a solid, old-fashioned adventure that is sure to please those looking for an original, uncynical summer blockbuster.The Legend of Tarzan is set years after the titular jungle man has left Africa and married his one true love, Jane. Having settled into a civilized life in London, John Clayton III, played by Alexander Skarsgard, is called back to the Congo by Leon Rom, an underling of King Leopold of Belgium, played by Christoph Waltz. Rom plans to capture the man formerly known as Tarzan and turn him over to the natives in exchange for diamonds in order to alleviate the King's mounting debt. Tarzan's wife Jane, played by up and coming star Margot Robbie, insists on joining her husband on the trip and is soon captured by Rom, who uses her to lure Tarzan into his grasp. Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson's Civil War veteran George Washington Williams journey across the African wilderness to save Clayton's wife and stop Rom from enslaving the natives of the Congo. Right there is a perfect Tarzan story, bringing a civilized John Clayton back to the wild to rediscover his untamed roots (which we see in a few well done flashback sequences). However, the story gets quite muddled at times, focusing too heavily on the politics of King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo. This political thread is present throughout the film's 110 minute run-time, and it often dilutes the underlying, more adventurous storyline. The story feels unnecessarily padded with politics, when a more straightforward adventure yarn would have been more appropriate.Most of the film's stars all do well in their parts. Skarsgard unfortunately isn't given much to work with in the script. He's neither the untamed wild man nor the sophisticated gentleman, instead meandering in between the two versions of the character. Skarsgard looks the part and doesn't mangle the role, but his performance is nothing special. The supporting characters fare better. Robbie, Waltz, and especially Jackson bring much needed energy to the film. Robbie's Jane is plucky without being obnoxious, Waltz is a pitch perfect mustache-twirling villain, staying comfortably far from a cartoon character, and Sam Jackson is consistently funny and endearing as George Washington Williams. Jackson and Waltz's presences elevate the movie in a big way.The biggest draw of The Legend of Tarzan, the action and special effects, don't disappoint, but don't particularly impress either. Director David Yates, of Harry Potter fame, films the action well and the effects do their job. The animals are all digital here, which is something of a shame considering that while the gorillas, lions, ostriches and more never look fake, I can't say they looked entirely real. There are moments in this movie where action, cinematography, and special effects come together beautifully and we are treated to some brilliant Tarzan moments (any time Tarzan swings through the trees is a real treat). It should be said, The Legend of Tarzan is a good-looking film. Cinematographer Henry Braham does a wonderful job with the African locales. Waterfalls are hazy and mysterious, jungles are lush and wet, and savannas are golden and expansive. The cinematography is good enough that the film works simply as a guided tour of Africa and its diverse landscapes.Tarzan has been a difficult property to adapt in modern Hollywood, but luckily The Legend of Tarzan mostly succeeds in doing so. Yes, the political plot line is too heavy a presence in the film's otherwise great story, and yes, the special effects aren't in the same league as some of Hollywood's other big budget blockbusters, but David Yates' adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's classic stories is far from the flop it could have been. The talented cast and sure-handed direction keep the movie afloat and allow for a good amount thrills. The movie would have benefited greatly from some plot trimming, but The Legend of Tarzan is a solid entertainer and a refreshingly old-fashioned piece of summer fun, nonetheless.70/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan is a fun swing into the jungle, but Tarzan himself is dull and uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something tranquil about being in the woods. I'm fortunate enough to live in an area that has lots of trees and where the sounds of the summer evening consists of cricket chirping, owls in a chorus-like hooting, and the occasional coyote howl. As a kid, though it was troublesome to taking ten minutes to get into town, living out in the countryside and woodsy area made my childhood wonderful. It was an all win situation for the family as my parents got the peace and quiet that helped them escape the stress of work while for my brother and I, we felt like little Tarzans.Okay, we didn't live in tree houses, walk around naked or swung vine to vine (grapevines don't hold people well), but the wild has plenty to call for those that are interested. Today's movie reminded me of that, as Tarzan represents the more animal-side of being human. I've never read the Edger Rice Burroughs stories nor seen any of the older live action movies, so my only experience with the character is from the 1999 Disney animated Tarzan. With updated technology and a darker tone, The Legend of Tarzan. Though we are given the origin story of Tarzan's parents dying in the jungle and being taken in by a family of gorillas, we actually cut ahead to England where Tarzan (played by Alexander Skarsg?rd) has returned to claim his families estate, even calling himself "Lord Greystoke". He's invited by the Belgian government to visit the Congo (where his old jungle was) and to examine all the progress made there, including new towns and a steam engine train. At first he declines, but is persuaded to by an American envoy, George Washington Williams (played by Samuel L. Jackson). He initially plans to go alone, but his wife Jane (played by Margot Robbie) but is also convinced in letting her join. When they arrive, they find the tribe where Jane and her father taught for years and enjoy a little reunion. The happiness is cut short when some mercenaries, led by the Belgium Léon Rom (played by Christoph Waltz) kills the tribal chief, burns several homes, and takes Jane. Tarzan and George head into the jungle to intercept the mercenaries and see where they've been taken captured tribesmen. What Tarzan doesn't know is that León wanted him to follow, leading the lord of the apes into a trap. The jungle is wild and The Legend of Tarzan seems to have the right elements for an entertaining blockbuster. The Africa here is more modernized and yet threatening like it should be. The best element of this movie is the atmosphere, as we get a variety of the country aside from trees. This is a good example on how CGI can replace the necessity of using real exotic animals. The animation on the Gorillas and other African animals looks really good. The scene alone where Tarzan is meeting with a pack of lions should be in the demo pitch for the visual effect artists looking for more work.The acting highlight is Samuel L. Jackson who is playing the only real life figure. I'd say that most of the performance is Sam's personality, but it's a welcome to the films biggest problem; it's main character. Alexander Skarsg?rd is beyond bland as the lord of the apes. Except for a well-built body and his communicating with the animals, he has to be the most boring rendition of Tarzan I've seen. It's a shame because everyone else is well casted including Wolf of Wall Street's Margot Robbie and Christoph Waltz whose always fun to watch as the villain. Even the action is entertaining, but our hero is so uninteresting, that a real gorilla would have been more fun to follow.I'll give this three gorillas out of five. If the rest of the movie is so well put together, why couldn't they found a better Tarzan? Even if this movie had included Phil Collins songs, it wouldn't have helped. The Legend of Tarzan would be pretty good had they taken out Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They wussified Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was somewhat looking forward to seeing a live action Tarzan again,since I haven't seen one,since the ones with Casper van Diem. This one was disappointing though.In the books and comics Tarzan was not some scrawny little kid.He killed his first ape at age 13.It nearly cost him his life, but he was no pushover. I also recall him realizing he was different quite early on, and using that to his full advantage.by teasing the bigger stronger apes,And escaping up into the treetops,where the big apes couldn't go cause of their weight.In this movie none of that happens.What little back story you get is told with flashbacks, in between weak attempts to build a interesting story line,but end up totally disrupting the flow of the film. And who came up with the bright idea to cast Samuel Jackson,as an American agent against slavery? Now isn't that a reach. A few years after the civil war they have black agents working for George Washington,caring about slavery in Africa no less. Cause poor ol washington is just soo worried about slaves in other countries.The movie is suppose to take place during the build up to WWI,but there is nothing to connect it,to any events that took place during the that time period.No Radio news talking about it,nor a glimpse of a paper with references to the build up..The whole thing is very sterile. Either cause they choose to make it a kids movie.And today's kids need to be sheltered and pampered from the harsh reality.OR they just dropped the ball, during production.They also completely missed the point of why tarzan was swinging through the trees.In this movie he runs through the jungle,before he finally get forced to swing thorugh the trees. the ground would be littered with roots and dangers from predators,the trees..Not so much. The even have comics of tarzan within the movie ******spoilers******** ******Spoilers***** *****spoilers********* The Story of Tarzan,is quite simple It was about a man who grew up in the jungle among the big apes,met a dame, Jane Porter,married her,left the jungle to live in London.Hated it and went back to the jungle with Said wife. In this movie however Tarzan doesn't fight apes,he just get beaten up by them, a lot.HE doesn't ride elephants(not even CGI ones) Also quite opposite the books he's quite happy in the civilization/London. And don't mind living there. While in the books that life was very constraining to him,and he missed his freedom in the jungle.Another thing that really bothered me, was when we get to Africa he walks around in his Safari outfit. What would've been a great scene, was if the moment they came to Africa,he'd shed all his civilized clothes except for the standard loincloth,and immediately got up in the trees. But sadly her they don't even allow him that.When he finally shed some of his civilized style, he runs around in long underpants (shants). I guess Disney was afraid of parents suing, for showing a man in his underwear 30% of the movie he runs through the jungle fully clothed in silk shirt &amp; boots without a tear.I get the impression, they couldn't decide between making him totally human(A gym ripped wussy),or sticking with the comic/book version.A Human with superhuman strength.The two fight climaxes of the movie was just really poorly choreographed,and did ERB And johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan ,no justice whatsoever ..Tarzan with a knife,can't beat a chief who throw wide swinging punches at him,like a drunk boxer The end fight was just horrible badly choreographed.The mighty tarzan get his ass kicked by a scrawny elderly white man. How on earth did this tarzan live to become a grown man,if he can't beat a old man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tarzanic version of Avatar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the story was really weak and thrown together. There were quite a lot of scenes that did not make sense or coordinate with the rest of the story, and there was useless fighting for apparently no reason. It was a copy of avatar not only the general idea but small details too, coincidence? Don't think so. Tarzan's abs were clearly drawn in in some scenes. Mistakes like that are clearly noticeable, did the director even care? they just shot a movie because they shot a movie they said we have to make a movie in 2016 or else everyone will forget we exist. It was not an idea that someone came up with one day, the idea of the movie was clearly forced. The script could have been better too.Overall just disappointed want to get my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our cinematic adventure this week was The Legend of Tarzan. We chose this because we had seen the shorts for it when we saw Central Intelligence last week and we saw THAT because Dwayne was in it and my wife is a bit keen on Dwayne and it went OK and I laughed a bit and the wife tittered quite a bit.Tarzan's father buries his mother (she was dead so it's OK) and then get's killed by FBDA's (Great Big Digitized Apes) but Tarzan is just a little baby and a chick FBDA takes a shine to him and adopts him and raises him and teaches him to do FBDA stuff like walk on all fours. As a result Tarzan has ginormous hands and thoughts sprang unbidden of prostate examinations Tarzan sniffs Jane's crotch and so they get married, it being the Victorian era and they being the rules.Tarzan (now known as John Clayton III) and Jane (still known as Jane) move to England and live in a FBH (Great Big House). He is talked into leaving his FBH and going back to the Congo by Samuel L. Jackson who has taken time off from grooming children to ruin their lives gambling.King Leopold is the worst Belgian ever, at least until Mathias Cormann, and he is broke and needs to get money to raise an army to get diamonds so he isn't poor anymore. He has a FBB (Really Bad Baddie) working for him who strangles folk with a spider web crucifix. He (the FBB) knows Gambling Man from 'Django Unchained' and he killed people in that too.To do this he enslaves Congolese to build a railway line and Tarzan thinks that this is wrong and he's right too so he has a fight with his FBDA brother and cops an absolute flogging the like of which I haven't seen since Lenny took onnabear in 'The Execrable'.Tarzan signals his readiness to Jane by hiding and imitating the mating calls of various animals. I kid you not. Most men are simply 'conscious'.Anyway there are fights and Mr Zan calls upon his animal wantoks. Wildebeest (digitized ? Digi-Beests?) are turned into deadly weapons of war. All the animals are digitized and it is abundantly clear that the technology just does not yet cut the mustard. There are Digi-lions, Digi-diles and Digi-potamii. And of course FBDA's This means, I presume, that lots of the acting was in front of blank screens. And it shows.Tarzan's jungle call is pretty cool All in all it's about as plausible as Noah. Jane is pretty cute. Better'n 'Interstellar'. Nowhere near as good as 'Deadpool' or any other good movie you might think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spirit of Tarzan is alive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people today can argue, that Tarzan is somewhat a forgotten character and property. I believe, that kids today, are not all that familiar with the character Tarzan. So it was a matter of time, that one day we would get a reboot. That kids would get schooled on Tarzan, keep it fresh for the people. I believe that this movie does a good job of keeping the character, &amp; the legend of Tarzan fresh.In this tale of Tarzan, we don't get the wild man version at first. We get an older, more civilized, easy going man. Who has left his old lifestyle behind him. But things don't stay this way forever. Tarzan is trying to keep his cool, but Leon Rom played by Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained) has to go around, and mess with Tarzan's homeland. By stealing diamonds, and killing people. At first, Tarzan doesn't seem interested in helping. However, a former civil war fighter, Samuel L. Jackson (According to Ted in Ted 2. If you've seen any movie ever he's the black guy) is basically saying "You have to save them...Motherfu#ker!"From the trailers, and T.V. spots, I was expecting the tone of Tarzan to be very dark and gritty. But, it's not that dark. In my opinion this movie has two very different tones. We have some dark and dangerous visuals of the jungle, and Samuel L. Jackson brings the comedy to this movie. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome as always. He really did a fantastic job at delivering the comedy. I literally laughed like the joker when he said "You want me to lick his nuts too?" (referring to the Gorillas nuts) This was okay at times, but it sort of felt like two different people directing at times.This film has some very snazzy visuals, and beautiful cinematography of the jungle. I'm not sure if they traveled to Africa to film. Nonetheless, if the didn't it is because they really didn't need to go. Everything looked very real, and it really is gorgeous scenery throughout the film.Also, the wardrobe was fantastic. Whoever did, the wardrobe, and makeup design should get some serious praise. Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, Furious 7) looked like a badass, along with his tribe. Even Marvels Black Panther, would look at them like damn, you guys bad.Surprisingly, my only real complaints about the film are the performances by Christoph Waltz, and Jane, played by Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad). I believe that Margot Robbie delivered a good performance. However, the way the character was written, could have been more interesting. She could have been more of a bad-ass chick, like we all know she can be, and not be underused. Christoph Waltz as well, could have been written just a little bit better. In my opinion, he will go down in history as an actor famous playing villainous roles. However, this role, came off to me as a little cartoonish.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the Legend of Tarzan. Superhero movies are very popular at the moment, and this movie does a good job at making Tarzan feel like a superhero. It keeps the character fresh, and interesting. Tarzan is fun for the moment, but sadly I don't think i will remember it a couple of months from now. I would love to see it again, on T.V. or streaming. That doesn't mean it is a bad film; it's just not a perfect film. It has it's moments, and I love the films message. On how know matter what you do, your past is a part of you. At the end of the day it was fun, and as Phil Collins once sang, "You'll be in my heart". I believe The Legend of Tarzan earns a...7/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading/viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan Broods and Swings in the Right Places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "The Legend of Tarzan" this afternoon. Overall I'd say it was a pretty good film. It was reverent in the right places, with probably the best live-action depiction of Tarzan, one that is closer in tone to ERB's literary work than any other iteration. You can sense the backstory in Tarzan's brooding silences, his pensive soul, his concern for Jane, and his maturing acceptance of civilization's capacity for greed and violence. The director treats us with lush African landscapes, sultry jungle ambiance, ambitious tracking shots, majestic animals and fantastic character animation - all in reverence to ER Burrough's source material. When combined with the sensitive portrayal of Tarzan by Alexander Skarsg?rd, this film hits a new cinematic benchmark for Tarzan. Go and enjoy the trip!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Patriarchal Psychopathic Brodeo with One Token "Feminist" Female</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a good example of trying to be all things to all stereotypes and failing miserably. You can almost hear the filmmakers putting together the film...1) "Let's appeal to hypermasulinity by making all the warriors have the unrealistic physiques of body builders on steroids and plenty of scenes of apes going--well, apeshit and devising as many plot points around psychopathic blood baths that we possibly can."2) "Let's appeal to the "modern women" by having Jane say a bunch of really spunky, quasi-feminist lines while she still basically serves the same sexist narrative function of female bait for our hero to rescue to prove his manhood."3) "Let's appeal to black people by making the plot about saving Africans from the slavery of the Evil White Man with Samuel L. Jackson as the Avenging Negro."4) "Let's appeal to all the Harlequin Romance reader females with plenty of beefcake shots of Tarzan being strong and oh-so-sensitive."I'm not sure what's worse, the cartoonish tropes in the film or the filmmakers obvious sophomoric pandering to perceived stereotypes they believe exist in film audiences.If they think this is what really appeals to thinking men, women, and people of color...wow...they need a serious reality check. Try making a work of art next time, not this adolescent propaganda crap.Only in America can we still make a film in 2016 in which a woman just finishes giving birth (you know, that death defying act of CHILDBIRTH) and the song the WOMEN in the tribe sing celebrating the birth is about the "legend" of the FATHER. Really?!?! Yes, forget that woman in the hut who just risked her life to give birth...let's sing about all the cool stuff the dad did.And other than Jane, I don't think there is LITERALLY one other female character that speaks in the entire film in a cast of hundreds of men. Forget passing the Bechdel test. You would have to actually have two female characters who speak for that.And, hey all you gals out there-- "The Jungle" is a terrifying place that can kill 'ya six different ways from Sunday. Yes, it's a dog-eat-dog survival-of-the-fittest world out there, so be afraid. Be VERY afraid. Make sure you've attached yourself to some strong man, ladies, or else you're toast.Patriarchal Psychopathic Brodeo. Do yourself a favor and skip it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was to be a great cinema experience, much anticipated, as I am a life long Tarzan fan. The cast c.g.,and cinematography, and dialogue were excellent. The fact that they took such liberty with the background story of Tarzan in the flashbacks disturbed me, taking Tarzan father's hunting knife away from him was like producing a robin hood epic without a bow and arrow! but then the use of a catholic rosary used as a killing weapon by the villain was deplorable, as Catholics hold the rosary high as a religious object, then the innuendo that the villain had been given the rosary (weapon) by a priest as a child, Jane hinting that the villain had been molested by this priest was a shear attack on my faith, why? Why alienate a large part of viewing audience, and it left me leaving the theater angry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... so maybe some brilliance occurred during the moments when I was nodded off, but I doubt it. The writing is bad enough that I can't really take too much fault with the actors. They were given a dreadful script to work with and this was clearly just a payday for several of them. Samuel Jackson's character as the sidekick comic relief was dreadful, especially when they repeatedly tried to change gears and make him the moral standard bearer. Was horribly disappointed with Christopher Waltz's role. I think he's a fine, fine actor, but again, not much to work with here. As for 'Tarzan' and 'Jane'... meh. Nice to look at, but zero depth, despite the ham handed efforts of the screenplay to provide them with some. I will say that it's a gorgeous movie in terms of sets and costuming, but the CGI got to be way too much. Wait for video. If you have kids, they'll probably get a kick out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark style of Tarzan, but it doesn't work at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I'm sick spending my money on some unworthy remakes of legendary movies. This is one example of movie that impairing Hollywood's charisma. Even making remakes of those which at peer in classics was failed, then how could you make movie with original story which you start it with an empty canvas ? Are those country lacking some ingenious people ? I didn't believe these capricious remakes was just for instant bulk of money. Slowly but sure, it eroding Hollywood's respect for god sake. I starting to feel it too.A long time ago, Tarzan is a movie about enthusiasm, loves, and bravery. Currently, what the hell is this dark, sorrow, shallow, cheap, old-school style movie ? It's like this director reform our beloved classic into 180 degree, making Tarzan character with deep regression and dark haunting memories. Oh cmon, are those necessary ? It's just an illiterate work that make audience feel no empathy at all. It's so cheap, you just force it to become sentimental but the truth is you didn't have a strong reason to feel it. The shape of story is a top hierarchy mistake that the director did, maybe he could impute the writer.The good part of movie comes from this two on fire actors, Samuel L Jackson and Waltz. These two carry this movie too much. Cold blooded villainy of Waltz and hilarious Jackson performance save the day, lucky you got them in rooster. The ending scene also seems symbolic, which Tarzan hold Waltz life in the hand of Waltz's necklace where it was a safeguard weapon to the villain. That was the sole good scene.It's hard to predict what Hollywood want this day. Ruining old classic movie to make money is not wise decision at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We're first introduced to Tarzan here as John Clayton/Lord Greystoke, looking perhaps not quite like how one imagines the King of the Jungle to appear. He's been married and living with Jane for eight years in England, but clearly doesn't feel comfortable in his grand manor. He's talked into returning to the jungle by Samuel L. Jackson's George Washington Williams and Jane's eager to go with him, but he doesn't like that idea. However, she's clearly capable of standing up to him and sticks to her guns, so eventually he agrees on the condition she promises to stay close to Williams. Obviously nothing can go wrong, right? Count on Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom to mess things up for them and everyone else.Alexander Skarsg?rd and Margot Robbie are well-cast in their respective roles as Tarzan and Jane. Skarsg?rd, who I only really know from True Blood and a few movies he did (Zoolander, Melancholia and The East) not only physically embodies Tarzan, but also emotionally. At first he may appear stoic/unfeeling, but it's what's going on *underneath* that matters, and Skarsg?rd manages to convey a lot with just his eyes/looks that he gives and minimal dialogue. He even manages to make the 'Tarzan cry' sound really good instead of mockable. This, along with the different animal mating calls he knows (which Jane has also learned), proves important later on. Early in the film, when he's still dressed and acting 'civilized' in England, there's a moment where he makes this breathy grunt/exhale sound that you're not sure what it's about, but later you discover it's something he learned from the apes that raised him from an infant. Scenes explaining this origin tale, coupled with the first encounter he has with Jane, are told via flashbacks which are enough to fill in the gaps for anyone unaware of the story, but not too much of a retread as to bore those familiar with it. We also get to see the beginnings of Tarzan and Jane's relationship, which manages to do a *lot* with very little screen time. There's some humour to it, but most importantly you buy why they are drawn to each other.Margot Robbie proves a great choice for Jane. Yes, she's got some fight in her, she's no pushover and stands up to those who would treat her with disrespect. No, she's not some 'wannabe tough chick', she's believably strong and Robbie, like Skarsg?rd, embodies her character fully. Both actors make the relationship between their characters believable, with oodles of chemistry. Tarzan and Jane might not share many scenes (they're separated for a large chunk of the film in the middle), but they make the most of their time on screen together. It's important to note that Jane isn't some shrill housewife, she's a teacher and an early scene with her, her students and John/Tarzan is a great introduction to her character/the relationship she has with her husband. Thanks to Robbie's charisma, it's ensured that Jane never comes off as unlikable. Quite the contrary, actually. She conveys intelligence, heroism and sensitivity, but can also give as good as she gets when it comes to verbal sparring (especially with the hissable villain, Rom). Speaking of, the film's beginning with Waltz's character was a tad underwhelming for me, as his villains are starting to all blend together now and nothing really seems to set them apart much (nor do they live up to the one he became known for: Col. Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds). While he does have a few good moments (a dining scene between him and Jane is quite memorable, as is her earlier insult towards his mustache), it does feel somewhat like Waltz could play this type of role in his sleep by now. He does his thing, and does it well enough, but it's possibly time he found a new shtick. Samuel L. Jackson is...well...Samuel L. Jackson, for the most part. Thankfully, he's not as abrasive as he's been in some other movies, though the film almost feels like it's more about Tarzan and George than Tarzan and Jane. Jackson does get a few good lines and provides some of the film's humour, but it does feel as though he tends to 'overtake' the movie at times, and consequently Tarzan himself feels a bit ignored. Screen time would've been better spent on the Tarzan/Jane relationship, I think (and perhaps some of the lingering shots that tended to hold for a little too long could've been reduced slightly). The other important characters in the movie are Tarzan's adoptive family: the apes. His relationship with them is almost as significant as that with the human characters. The animation, for the most part, is quite something and the CGI characters do feel like they're given appropriate depth/development. Some of the film's most emotionally impactful moments are between the different animals and Tarzan (one scene involving him reuniting with lions I found particularly effective, thanks in equal parts to the animation and Skarsg?rd's performance). Even more impressive is the scenery. Once the action starts, there's very few 'slow' moments (though those with short attention spans may feel different). While it might not live up to some people's expectations, those who have been heavily criticizing the film should ease up. The movie has a lot going for it (though an extended cut DVD/Blu-ray release wouldn't hurt, as it does seem as though some stuff is missing). As far as live-action Tarzan films go, this one ranks pretty highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my review for The Legend Of Tarzan (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Alexander Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou, Christoph Waltz.Plot: Tarzan (Skarsgard), having acclimated to life in London, is called back to his former home in the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment.Oh god Tarzan! What have we done to you? Back in 1999 Tarzan was released as a Disney animation and it worked because after that it became a Disney classic, then there was Tarzan in 2013 which became sort of a CGI based live action movie. This has taken the same spot and turned into a live action CGI based action movie tat used to be Tarzan. Instead of being Legendary he is just a normal human with a monkey prowess unfortunately in terms of summer blockbusters this isn't the best and definitely not the most entertaining. It has an immensely beautiful landscape of the African jungle and of the Savanna and is completely surrounded by intense action with okay CGI which is a little bit schlocky at points. But the tepid plot makes this an un-enjoyable ride see that's what this movie is bad for is the plot, and also the irritating villain Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom you'd think that with two Oscars to his name he'd be better well he's not, as much as he tries to be charming and an efficient member of the story but unfortunately as charismatic he is you just want to have less screen time than he really has. Big movies like this tend to have quite a starry cast but they just don't realize that the more people there is in a movie it's not going to be any better, a lot of stars there may be but one them is awful. Alexander Skarsgard maybe in many blockbusters like Battleship (2012) but he's not what you'd call a "god given actor" because he's just emotionless and just dry.As much as English director David Yates tries to make this as good as his few Harry Potter movies it fails in many ways, because it has his traditional directing style but the editing is just unworthy and also the plot is muddled because it drifts between convoluted plot in real life to action packed madness and then flashbacks, which coincidentally are the best bits of the film and also Margot Robbie's Jane, who is okay and delivers the story in her own style but it just doesn't work. In other Tarzan films he is the god of the jungle and is loved by all jungle creatures, unlike this he is loved by other creatures but he feels more human than legendary so Legend of Tarzan was the wrong title for this film. Also in other Tarzan films he only has to stop one villain but in this he tries to stop two villains Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom and Djimon Hounsou's Chief Mbonga who is a vicious war-lord trying to capture Tarzan and well do bad things to him. There is also no character development because it delves into the action pretty quickly so we don't learn anything about the characters unless of course you watch other Tarzan movies.The film adds some funny dialog mostly done by Samuel L. Jackson's George who is Tarzan's trusted adviser but as much as his charisma and enthusiasm changes the films atmosphere it doesn't make it better. There is one point where the action is really well done with the final act when all the animals come raiding through a town to try and stop Leon Rom, that bit is especially gorgeous because it just adds so much tension to the film but again the film fails to deliver on that action. It's a real shame because the film is exceptionally pretty with beautiful landscape but the fast paced which would be an easy distraction is just a desperate attempt to make the movie better. Even with added slow-motion moments the film is still a disastrous catastrophe and is another summer blockbuster that will be added to the film purgatory this year, to which there are many. It's not awful it's just disappointing and is not worth your investment even slightly. Verdict: Visually impressive full of fast paced action but is riveted by such a bland plot. Even Samuel L. Jackson cannot save this it will just make you want to scream Aaaahahaahhha at how bad it is.4/10 another disappointing summer blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been a fan of Tarzan since childhood when I read the stories in those Whitman Book editions. While I was a big fan of the Ron Ely TV series, I never felt that the Tarzan movies ever captured the essence of the iconic character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs.Until now!What a wonderful film filled with adventure, romance, and morality that works on so many levels.Kudos to director David Yates and his team for doing such a marvelous job of distilling ERB's vision in such an exciting and entertaining way. Alexander Skarsg?rd reminds me of Ron Ely and Margot Robbie joins Maureen O'Sullivan as the ultimate Jane. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz provide outstanding support.I cannot praise this film enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Reboot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Legend of Tarzan", starring Alexander Skarsgard-True Blood_tv, Straw Dogs_2011; Samuel L. Jackson-The Hateful Eight, Jumper; Margot Robbie-Focus, Pan Am_tv, and she is going to play Harley Quinn in the up-coming Suicide Squad; Christoph Waltz-Spectre, The Three Musketeers_2011 and Djimon Hounsou-Guardians of the Galaxy, Amistad.This is a reboot of the Tarzan movies and a very good one, too. It's directed by David Yates, who directed several of the Harry Potter movies. Although the Edgar Rice Burroughs created hero, Tarzan, has been around for a while and had lots of adaptations made over the years-I fondly remember watching the Johnny Weissmuller ones as a kid-this one is based on the Dark Horse comic book version. Alexander takes on the iconic role of Tarzan and Margot is his Jane. The story starts as Alexander is an adult, living in London as the sophisticated Lord Greystroke, and not Tarzan, the man raised by apes in the jungle. Alexander is called upon by Samuel, who knows all about his past life in the Congo jungles as Tarzan, and needs his help on a situation, involving Christoph, the villain, just trying to make a buck, as villains do from time to time. Djimon plays an African chieftain that wants Alexander's head on the end of his spear for killing his son. Of course, the chief's son had just killed Alexander's ape friend so Alex just had to do what he does best, open a can of jungle justice on the son. During flashbacks, you learn how Alexander became Tarzan. If you are a Tarzan fan, rest easy. Alexander swings through the trees, fights apes-and assorted natives &amp; other humans-and does the Tarzan yell, although it is similar to the original one, it is slightly different. Oh yeah, when he is in the jungle, he wears pants-no shirt of course- instead of the traditional loincloth. If that is not a deal breaker, then you should enjoy this movie. I did. FYI: The name Tarzan means 'White Ape', since he was raised by apes. It's rated "PG-13" for action, violence, sexual content-including brief nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 49 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan (spoiler free)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fun ride of a film seems to encompass "The Beasts of Tarzan" and "Tarzan the Terrible" with a bit of a time shift. If you are new to Tarzan - it won't matter. We get a heroic Tarzan and Jane hellbent on helping their closest African friends, we get tremendous Mangani as graceful as colobi leaping through the upper terraces. Revenge, redemption, and retribution play out in a fast paced cinematic treat. We has a true to life evil villain doing horribly bad things, we had an equally good historic witness interact with Tarzan and Jane to stop it. Filmgoers see Tarzan and Jane as a believable couple in love with each other. Their good natured friends are equal to the tasks chosen. And even though the animals are CGI - I was happy as I could watch this adventure without worrying if animal actors were harmed in any way. I like how Tarzan communicated with "friendly" animals. I was happy to suspend disbelief as we saw lions and elephants visit. One has to appreciate submission posture for these gorilla like "pan sapiens robusti" that the Mangani must be. I was curious if these "Apes" were swimmers. Maybe we'll see that in the sequels. I think this film works on all levels. When the grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs says this movie is a winner - I'm going to agree wholeheartedly. I'm going to endorse this as the Summer movie you must see at least twice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alas, Tarzan lovers rise to the continuation of this legendary story, but take a seat because this film is disappointing. The film covers Tarzan's life after he left Africa to live in England as John Clayton and returns to Africa to help his country. After a series of dangerous obstacles and captures, Tarzan fights to save his love Jane. I found the film's plot so confusing and disconnected that it was difficult to give a thorough summary without looking it up. The film stars Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan who, in the movie, is quite civilized, British and sophisticated despite the fact that he was raised by gorillas in the jungle. This disappointed me because it is one thing to make a bad movie but it's even more disappointing when the film has a template to follow and doesn't. In the original film, Jane is British but in this adaptation she is American. This really confused me because of its inconsistency with the original story. Another disappointing aspect is that the apes in this film were not his friends. They were his enemies. The back story of Tarzan is all about how he was raised by gorillas and how they are his family. I did not enjoy seeing Tarzan fighting the creatures that are supposed to be his family. Looking past that inconsistency and hard-to-follow plot, on the positive side, the film has impressive visuals that make it quite entertaining. The characters are not ones you get attached to or gain a bond with and, me for that makes the movie lack the emotional connection it needs to really draw in the audience.I feel as if the film doesn't focus on appropriate things. It focuses a lot on business schemes to get money rather than the emotional struggles and journeys in the jungle. The film has little details and aspects that are alright, such as the casting, but I just did not find the movie compelling. I think it would interest people that like historical fiction and recommend it for tweens and teens. People between the ages of 30 to 60 would also enjoy it because of its complexity and historical background. I would not go out of my way to see this and rank it 2 out of 5 stars because I was so disappointed in it. Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jane is always pretty in Tarzan movies and this one was no exception. She is beautiful, graceful and witty. Other than that the film was mediocre and the American comic relief(Samuel Jackson usually a master of rhetoric like the actual "soon leaving" American president ) was pitiful. I had great expectation for this remake: Tarzan riding an elephant, battling Lions, using his knife and so forth... What we saw was a King Kong/planet of the apes with a Tarzan in "bermuda". Waltz was a classy good villain ( his rosary pseudo presence was cheap and the supposed to be funny mention of him and his priest relationship, wasn't "no one in the full packed IMAX movie theater laughed") Well, the only positive thing was that my wife liked the romantic connection between Tarzan and Jane</fullReview>

Underwhelming performance by Christoph Waltz (see Django and weep folks) Threw in Opar, but there is nothing of the fabled city in there. The Tarzan we know and love is invincible, no evidence of "mighty thews" in here - he gets snuck upon and beat down by almost everybody - you end up thinking however did he survive to manhood in the jungleAnother Tarzan movie that will drown in its own hubris...they tried though....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of an English aristocratic son who is raised by animals in the forests of Congo. He grows up and goes back to England, only to go back to Africa to help the people who are getting enslaved by the Belgian king."The Legend of Tarzan" is so much better than the trailer. It has very little scenes of Tarzan growing up in the wild, and concentrates on his civilised adult life. He maintains a deep connection with the nature and the animals, which is a beautiful message that can be translated to everyone being friendlier to the environment. The story is engaging and at the end beautifully poignant. The two leads Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie are both very visually pleasing, which adds to the charm of the film.

		<shortDescription>Not the best version, but entertaining enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far from Africa and already an adult "civilized" in the ways of a proper Englishman, Tarzan (played by Alexander Skarsgard) is lured back to Africa by an American played by Samuel L. Jackson (is there any movie this guy isn't in?) in order to investigate rumors of Belgians enslaving the inhabitants of The Congo. Margot Robbie, playing Tarzan's wife, comes along for the ride because she's not about to be left behind like some helpless woman ? in this movie, Robbie is very much a fighter and familiar with Africa.Once in Africa, Skarsgard and Robbie are barely getting reacquainted with friends and relatives (the two-legged and four-legged variety) when a mercenary group led by Christoph Waltz kidnaps the couple. Why? Well, it turns out Waltz wants Skarsgard so he can deliver The Legend to a tribal chief who wants revenge against Skarsgard. What's the tribal chief's beef? It's revealed in one of the flashback sequences ? more on this later. Why would Waltz do this for the chief? Waltz would get lots of diamonds from the chief. And what will Waltz do with the diamonds? Waltz would buy an army of 20,000 mercenaries for his king (the king of Belgium) so that the king can keep his hold on The Congo. But?the kidnapping goes awry thanks to Jackson's help and a bunch of angry natives. Robbie gets taken though, and where she goes, Skarsgard is sure to follow. And follow he does, running into gorillas, wildebeests, Africans, Belgians, crocodiles, lions, and ostriches in order to save his wife and pretty much all of Africa.Now, with all this going on, you may be asking if Tarzan's origin story is here. Why, yes, yes it is. But not done in a good way. First, the origin story of Tarzan is told like a recap. Save for one poignant scene, the origin lacks depth and detail that fans of the Tarzan story crave. To make matters worse, the origin story is told in flashback sequences all throughout the movie. This is called non-linear storytelling; and under the guidance of a competent filmmaker, it works. Not so in this case. The transitions from one timeline to the other lacks a connection, making the jumps jarring and confusing. It ultimately leads to a movie that never finds its stride. Technically, the pacing is off. And this is the biggest problem of the movie. It's like a jigsaw puzzle: it doesn't matter how beautiful the picture of the puzzle is ? if it's assembled wrong, it just doesn't work.My most memorable, movie moment of "The Legend Of Tarzan" is the scene when Skarsgard's gorilla "brother" approaches Jackson. Skarsgard tells Jackson to bow down and get into a submissive position. The gorilla stands before Jackson, and Jackson tells Skarsgard "I'm not licking his nuts!" "The Legend Of Tarzan" is entertaining enough to be worthy of your time. But for die-hard fans of the Tarzan character, I suggest you watch "Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan, Lord Of The Apes," which I think is the best Tarzan movie ever made.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an enjoyable film with a well played Tarzan by Skarsgard. He'd obviously done a lot of work to prepare for it and it showed. There's a lot of cgi, so if that's not your thing then you might be thinking to give it a miss, but I'd really suggest giving it a chance. Some of the scenes are really breathtaking! You have to remember this is the Legend of Tarzan, so don't expect tons of character development, but I think they made a nice balance. The film was really enjoyable to watch and I left it wanting to enthusiastically discuss it with my mate. What more can you ask for? If you grew up reading adventure stories, then this just brings those stories to life. Waltz was excellent as the faithful servant of his nation willing to do whatever it takes, and I know I wouldn't want him against me. Nor Tarzan either if truth be told, his ferocity in some scenes was startling. All told a fun jungle adventure, just don't take it too seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have a good time. Nothing more than that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into The Legend of Tarzan, what did we expect? Stunning visuals, a good love story and a coherent plot that makes you love the heroes and hate the bad guys, and that's exactly what you get. In a time when you constantly feel like you've been deceived by marketing strategies that promise you a certain movie and you end up getting a flop, it feels nice to leave the theater satisfied. Sweden's Alexander Skaarsgard stars in this live-action remake of the story of an English boy raised by a family of gorillas in an Congolese jungle. The Swedish does what is asked of him, going through a ridiculously tough regime to get that eight-pack that is frankly admirable. He does own that strong and intense look that we always associated with Tarzan. For most of the time, he's trying to rescue his wife Jane (Margot Robbie, in her typical grace) from the hands of Leon Rom, played by a Christoph Waltz who seems doomed to play either the villain or a coo coo crazy German guy for the rest of his life. Nothing new here. But it's David Yates who shines, giving us flawless shots of the African jungle and ridiculously credible visual effects that really make you feel like you are among all that stuff. Between some lame lines and less competent performances, The Legend of Tarzan ends up getting the job done, never trying to be more than it is: a Disney action movie. And that's OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful in the sense of a matinée.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** May contain strong spoilers ****First off; I really like and enjoy the fact that the whole production team included the writers Craig Brewer and Adam Cozad (and, of course: Edgar Rice Burroughs) has tweaked the story into a continuing saga for the "King of the jungle Tarzan". From the boy to a sophisticated man, and yes.... so very, very well trained (as talked and marketed about), athletic and realizing the bodicifation of "sexy-ness"... to a social man in a relationship. There it starts and Tarzan will go back to the jungle. Interesting and appreciated. However, I doubt that the psychiatric movements and experiences had the ability in the ages this story takes place to "recreate" a man with speech and social behaviour as described, especially in just a couple of years.At the very beginning of this motion picture, I can feel a touch of over-explicit enhancing to the fact that they want this to be an epic adventure and movie. Just the fact that Christoph Waltz and Djimon Hounsou, two of the great actors in the movie business, confronts each other after 5 minutes says a lot. I have my strong concerns about this being a epic one or just a plain failure in trying to be one... let me now see if I stand corrected...Every time Alexander Skarsgard is speaking, I can hear his fathers voice... oh, so brightly.... Stellan Skarsgard. It seems that Stellan has been an great inspiration to his son, as I sense a lot of the personality within the characters that Alexander is portraying coming from Stellan.The visual creations and animations of the gorillas is just about approved. Sometimes the artwork is showing flaws, and then the whole magic disappears. At one point, the arms of a gorilla in only one second went from strong and thick to a little thinner one, and that in the same moment with the gorilla standing still. Watch the first chase for the boy of Tarzan, about 20 minutes into "The Legend Of Tarzan".George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) is after about the half of the movie kicking things up being a solid balance of sarcasm and humour to the solemn love story from Tarzan to the jungle and Jane. I appreciate Mr. Jacksons perfect tone in his voice deliver such as "What I wouldn't give for a horse right now...!" and "Zeebra, zehbra... tomato, tomaato..."One of the most sophisticated death threats I've ever heard (58 minutes and counting, of course, delivered by Mr. Waltz): "It can also serve as an necklace..."... and a little flirtation with "The Jungle Book": "Eating ants?" "Taste like bacon..."All the time I was watching this one, I just wondered were all the realism and authentic touch were, coming down to the blood that should have been spilled and poured out in some moments. One almost ridiculous thing were the alligators tearing a man apart... blood? No? Come on! Think "The Legend Of Tarzan" were wrongfully produced in that way.. and some other ways... oh, well.Can it be that the audience in the world is beginning (or already is?) to be divided into three very clear and specified groups; one of the children with animated "cartoon movies", one with more "solid" viewers claiming and anticipating very high quality and authentic realism (see movies such as Prisoners, Nightcrawler, Whiplash and such astonishing pictures) to the group of youth that X-Men : Apocalypse, Hunger Games, Divergent and films such creates. And in the last mentioned group I place "The Legend Of Tarzan"... maybe is that group the biggest and most profitable at the moment?If you like cinematography and the feeling that youth based "teen" movies is providing, then check this one out. Then I highly recommend it. If you like more intense depth in an authentic way, then maybe look the other way a little bit.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The special effects and the animated environments such as the tress in the jungle (49 minutes into the movie) is just approved. It gave me the sense of a totally animated movie, which is a whole different thing... a little bad and odd. Splendid cinematography! Great lighting, sound effects with fair work behind, very good microphone pick up in the close up shots (as when Tarzan is breathing after been tied with rope about 42 minutes into the story) and a wide perspective speaking of the soundtrack with heavy inspirations of Africa and the jungle. An orchestral open flow pushes that music further. - The actors : Christoph Waltz is good, and that man can besides that deliver so much more. In fact, I believe he wants to be pushed to the limit by the director to give an top notch performance; herein he and/or the director leans too much to his earlier success. Alexander Skarsgard is... well... approved. Samuel L. Jackson, is this really the best you can give... or was the director to lazy? - Entertainment : As the title of this review gives away; a powerful matinée of adventure... good or bad? Well.... - Age : 115,9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Tarzan save Jane...again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: Here we are once again with Tarzan saving the beautiful Jane. A story as old as time, or at least my time. Skarsgard is utterly shredded in this movie, so for ladies who wanted to see that, you wont be disappointed. For guys who wanted to see the future Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), sorry she's in a 19th century dress the entire time.The good points of this movie are thanks in part to the great Sam Jackson, providing some great comic relief, and a couple great speeches. Other than that, this is your typical run of the mill action movie, with the typical bad guy, or two. I'll say it, Christoph Waltz has run his course as the villain. While watching this movie, all I saw was the same villain he has played but just in a different movie and time period. He comes off with a smooth calming voice, but his subtle movements and gestures suggest otherwise. Djimon Hounsou(Who?(Guardians of The Galaxy reference anyone?)) plays the second villain, hell bent on revenge against Tarzan.Overall, the plot is pretty simplistic, and there is quite a bit of action, but not all of it is great. The glaring problem with this movie is the CGI. Although there are a few scenes where the apes look absolutely great, it looks like that's where all the money went to. When Tarzan and the apes are flying through the trees, it is blatantly obviously, and quite distracting, that they are CGI, and pretty bad to say the least. One of the cooler effects that does look good, is Tarzan's hands. If you look closely, you will notice that they are overly developed, a symptom of him being raised by apes! Recommendation:Wait for the DVD(rental)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend Of Tarzan: "Your Tarzan! Tarzan?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: 6.5, OK Movie* Imagine if you will, that Hollywood is a science lab and its movies are all elements. When you mix the Director of 4 Harry Potter Movies (David Yates), the story of Avatar (8.5) and the characters of Tarzan (8.7) you create and unstable element. Tarzan is my favourite Disney movie, let alone animated movie due to it's heart warming story, characters and most of all Phill Collin's Music. However The Legend Of Tarzan tries so hard to be something it's not, a jungle of a conflict.* Characters: - Tarzan: Is this movie called The Legend Of Tarzan, or the legend of John Clayton? I understand what the directors are going for with his character, but while Alexander Skars'gard has the body of a jungle man, he does not suit the character of one. BTW, isn't Clayton the villain in the original Disney movie?Jane: I have many mixed feelings about Margot Robbie's Jane, at some moments I rather like her boldness and in other scenes I just find her rather annoying. Robbie is talented but she is not Tarzan's Jane.Leon Rom: Ever since I watched Django Unchained (9.5) I have absolutely loved Christoph Waltz, as he can play a good and a bad guy, and he does demonstrate this well in his new character, Leon Rom.George Washington Williams: I love Samuel L. Jackson, no matter what movie he stars in. His character does lighten the mood in this movie as he delivers the comedy and action this movie was in desperate need of.* Plot &amp; Design: Honestly I do like the movie's plot, as it does try to establish the themes of conflict, racism and colonisation. However they do travel off the main story line of John Clayt.... I Mean Tarzan. The landscapes are beautiful, however there more grasslands then jungles... The animals CGI is decent but no where as good as The Jungle Book's (8.5).* I can't hate it because Tarzan is my Childhood, but at the same time I don't like it. I do appreciate it's unique twist, however this adaptation lacks enjoyment and magic, particularly when it comes from the Director of Harry Potter? Its OK, but don't expect too much, its removed too many key features, especially Phill Collins! Regardless, the story of two worlds and one family will forever be in my heart.Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for you apes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new Tarzan movie is an interesting take on the character but lacks the spark of the remake of Jungle Book. Creator Edgar Rice Burroughs was probably inspired by Kipling's Jungle stories to create the pulpish hero Lord Greystoke, who is brought up in the jungle by apes (Kipling opined the Tarzan books were deliberately badly written by Burroughs to see what he could get away with in print).Burroughs himself was self-effacing. When academic Queenie Leavis wrote to him for her investigation into fiction and the reading public, he confirmed her worst fears by admitting his work did not aspire to great literature. Tarzan also draws on mythology (e.g. the legend of Romulus and Remus bought up by wolves), racist ideology - a white man lording it over a jungle kingdom (seen again in The Phantom comic strip). and ideas about the duality of human nature. The new movie intelligently places Tarzan in his historical context. Unlike the Jungle Book movie's weirdly decontextualized Jungle, here we are firmly in Belgium occupied territory, the colonial context that would later provide the setting for that other adventurer, Tintin. the look of the film is painterly, particularly the Jungle scenes which recall the work of Frank Frazetta while the ferocious fight between Tarzan and his ape brother recalls the dynamic work of Joe Kubert on the Tarzan comic strip.All the right elements are in place, Alexander Skarsg?rd makes for a convincing Tarzan, but the story structure falters . The final act pulls a Belgium battle fleet out of the hat and the sudden arrival of Tarzan's army of animals too closely recalls Jumanji. It also smack of over kill - the villainous Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) is eaten by an entire bask of crocodiles. A dramatic need for commentary, exposition and dialogue means Tarzan is saddled with an American envoy, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson). Jackson's character allows the movie to address issues of colonialism and slavery but I found him anachronistic and his interjections intrusive.The cinema where I saw the picture was almost empty, a nostalgic reminder of cinema going in the Seventies, a time when Tarzan was still on TV screens (I grew up with a fear of quick sand which seemed all pervasive in TV's Tarzan and Western shows). But while this latest adventure may not be the Summer blockbuster that was hoped for, it is a creditable take on the hero. Burroughs wrote 27 sequels. This movie seems to draw some of its inspiration from Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar. However, I doubt we'll be seeing any more adaptations for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While it makes very little (if any) sense logic wise, this updating of Edgar Rice Burroughs seriously silly famous loin cloth wearing jungle man Tarzan or as his preferred to be known as here John Clayton/Lord Greystoke, is quite a bit of big dumb fun if you go along for the rope swinging ride and is an event that rollicks along at a neat pace not often found with modern day blockbuster of this type.Foregoing the usual origin story that has plagued remakes for many a moon, director David Yates uses his skills honed from his work on the final 4 Harry Potter films to deliver a $180 million dollar Legend of Tarzan that finds the big handed, muscle covered hero living a life in London with his beloved wife Jane (yes gentleman Margot Robbie is in this film) only to be drawn back into the worlds he chose to leave by a comic relief spurting Samuel L. Jackson (ramping up the street sass to 11) and yet another tiresome villain role from Christoph Waltz who is quickly becoming a self-parodying joke sadly.The actual plot of The Legend of Tarzan is entirely forgettable and wholly unnecessary and those seeking a more rags to riches tale of Lord Greystoke may be sorely disappointed but Yates keeps the action flowing and the visuals rich in airbrushed CGI encased goodness and there is simple joys to be found from Tarzan going toe to toe with a much bigger and stronger gorilla or watching on as Samuel L. Jackson dives headfirst into an oversized tree that keep the film watchable and enjoyable even though we really should know better.In regards to the films leads it must be said that Alexander Skarsg?rd doesn't exactly romp home with his role as the man monkey, body wise his clearly cut out for the gig but charisma wise and delivery wise he leaves much to be desired. Skarsg?rd's turn does increase a few notches whenever his on screen with Robbie's Jane however and the Australian actresses turn is another win for the rising star whose likely to reach all new levels of love when Suicide Squad bursts onto our screens in a few weeks' time.It won't be winning any awards and it most certainly won't be on anyone's end of year Best of Lists but The Legend of Tarzan is what it is, a fun, preposterous adventure based on downright ridiculous source materials that have been the bringer of many joys to various generations of those seeking a break from the run of the mill everyday grind. Something that we all need from time to time and something this newest Tarzan offers to all those willing to accept it for what it is.3 ear lobes out 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great summer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is the first major Tarzan movie made by a big studio in almost twenty years. Not including Disney's animated Tarzan, the last few Tarzan have not done very well commercially. Unfortunately, The Legend of Tarzan seems to be following the same pattern. With an enormous budget, the film is unlikely to turn a profit in the U.S., which is a shame since, while not perfect, The Legend of Tarzan is a whole lot of fun, and way better than I was expecting.I didn't see The Legend of Tarzan in 3D, but I wish I had because the action scenes are among the best I've seen all year. While director David Yates initially relies too heavily on slow motion shots in the beginning, the middle act and the finale are full of beautifully filmed sequences of Tarzan fighting both animals and a bunch of henchman. Every single action scene is exciting, well choreographed, and most importantly, coherently edited.In terms of action, what separates The Legend of Tarzan from the most recent crop of blockbusters is that, given the time period of the story, there's obviously no car chases or endless gunfights. While there is the occasional gunfire, it always seems to serve a story purpose, and doesn't seem thrown in just to get an action beat to keep the audiences awake.Those with shorter attention spans may find the movie to be a slow burn, as it's somewhat leisurely paced when compared to most movies these days. David Yates, along with screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, have taken time to develop all the important characters in the story, and every character is played almost perfectly by a very strong cast. Alexander Skaarsgard makes for a great Tarzan. He could have gone over-the-top or seemed too moody, but he finds just the right balance between man raised in the wild and earl of Greystoke. Margot Robbbie is given much more to do than Jane usually does in Tarzan movies, and makes what could have been the typical damsel-in-distress role. Christoph Waltz plays his usual villain part, but does it well. The standout of the film is Samuel L. Jackson as George Washington Williams, who becomes Tarzan's partner/friend throughout the course of the movie. Jackson is almost always the highlight of whatever he's in, and that is especially true here. This easily could have been a sidekick role, but Jackson steals the spotlight away from Tarzan in his own movie. It's one of the best, most entertaining performances of Jackson's long career.The only disappointing part of The Legend of Tarzan is that it isn't slightly longer. While I'm appreciative that Yates didn't make the running time a bloated two and a half hours like almost all big-budget blockbusters are today, there are little moments where there seems to have been cuts made to the story, most notably during the flashback sequences contained in the film. Although it seems unlikely a longer cut of 'Tarzan' will surface given the disappointing box office receipts, it's something I'd love to see released. In its current form, The Legend of Tarzan is as close to a great summer movie that has come out so far this year, and everything a fan could want in a Tarzan epic. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true 'sequel' to "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan," 32 freakin' years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2016 and directed by David Yates, "The Legend of Tarzan" stars Alexander Skarsg?rda as John Clayton (Tarzan), Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as Tarzan's American friend. The events take place a decade after Tarzan &amp; Jane leave Africa for England with brief flashbacks to the ape man's origins. Christoph Waltz co-stars as the villain, Rom, who enslaves blacks in the Congo to mine the diamonds of Opar. Tarzan, Jane and Willliams (Jackson) aim to set things aright."Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes" (1984) was the best modern Tarzan movie, and one of my favorites despite a somewhat lethargic second half (and an irritating overuse of the "Ooo, ooo, ooo"ape vocalization, which this movie thankfully only does once). Unfortunately, they dropped the ball with the sequel, 1998's "Tarzan and the Lost City" with Casper Van Dien in the title role, as it was just half-baked, a quickly-thrown-together "sequel" to presumably steal some of the thunder of Disney's animated version that was coming out the next year."The Legend of Tarzan" comes across as the true sequel to "Greystoke," albeit with an altogether different cast and understandably so, seeing as how it's 32 years later. The portrayal of the lost city of Opar is different from the books. There's no hot High Priestess La (a blond white female) or ape-like denizens. The Oparians in the movie are just an intimidating black tribe covered with white body paint, but this is no big letdown because changes are to be expected when transferring to a different medium and, besides, Opar doesn't play that big of a role, at least not the city itself.In any case, I found this to be a solid Tarzan movie with a serious adult tone mixing drama, jungle adventure and unbelievable action. I was thankful for the thoughtful lulls in the story, which shed insights on the characters or conveyed the wonders of nature, like when Tarzan communes with an elephant at night or when Williams honestly confesses about his past mistakes as a youth where he feels he's not so different from the odious Rom. Moreover, Margot expertly brings Jane to life and is easily one of the better Janes in the movies. The CGI animals are great, especially the powerhouse apes.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in England with aerial shots done in Gabon (West of the Congo).GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fresh and clever new take on the story of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After settling down and getting used to life in London Tarzan must go back to the jungles where he used to live ,along with his wife and friend, to investigate strange goings on that have been occurring near there.Many of the reviews for this film have been fairly negative and I hadn't seen any trailers for this film so I didn't know what to think when walking in but as always I went into the film with an open mind. And what I was greeted with was a fun, fast paced, inventive and imaginative, fresh new take on Tarzan. The plot of the film is really clever and I like the idea of seeing what happens to the character of Tarzan after the story that we all know. The action in the film is very good and it adds to the large amount of tension that the plot already holds. The acting is also very good from all and the way the film is shot you feel as if you are actually there in the world of the film and that you area character spectating all the events that are happening and this leads to the fact that the film is a lot of fun, I genuinely had fun watching this film which is something that can't be said for a lot of films that have been released recently. If there is one major problem with the film it's that the CGI animals are very clearly CGI animals as they aren't very realistic and the way they look also shows how very clearly computer generated they are. One other small problem is that the films could be cut a tiny bit just because it does seem to drag in the last five to ten minutes and the entire audience do seem to get a tiny bit restless near the end just because of length but the film is still fairly fun and because it isn't for that long and the film wraps up quickly this point is mostly ,but not completely, excusable.Lot's of fun, imaginative and inventive, fresh and filled with fast paced action The Legend Of Tarzan is a fun new take on the famous vine swinging character. **** &lt;-- Four Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. While it was predictable in most places, the level of acting ability by the entire cast and the scenery (both natural and CGI) were all very well done and believable.Sometimes when I watch a film, I'm not looking for some great pseudo-cerebral answer to life's mostly metaphysical questions manifested in a trendy Indie flick. Sometimes I just want to watch an engaging film that makes me smile in the same way other old school adventure films do (Star Wars, the Indiana Jones flicks, etc.).This unique adaptation of Tarzan is the best one I've seen even if it doesn't follow Edgar Rice Burroughs's series. Anyone claiming they've seen this before is silly. It's literally nothing like any Tarzan tale to date. It's better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan Yells In Anger Through The Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the man of the jungle will always have a place in modern film. After 104 years of to know the story created by Edgar Rice Burroughs about "Tarzan", David Yates (he directed the last four films of the wizard more famous of the history), Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer reinvented the classic keeping the origins intact, but transfiguring the future of the character of a form gloomy and dark; many products have been inspired in the legend but none like the of Tarzan in the 19th century.Alexander Skarsgard interprets to a different Tarzan, who poses in each frame, it gives some elegance to the film, but reduces the coarseness of the masculinity of the original, nevertheless, it is a good renovation. Jane (Margot Robbie, our intrepid Harley Quinn of "Suicide Squad") portrays the essence of a woman of the 19th century, refined, frank and fearful, although Robbie impregnates it a pinch of feminism, something very characteristic of our time; I can only say that Jane is not a damsel in danger, perhaps, it is she who save to Tarzan. Comical integration that can not miss is called Samuel L. Jackson, Washington Williams is the companion in the long trip to the Congo. And the best for the end, I have always been a lover of the villains of Mr. Waltz ("Spectre") and with Captain Rom adds an interpretation a little more burlesque with trace of his previous performances, but with a new face, a spectacle in every word, in every dialogue, in every shot.With a not very frequent prologue in the current Hollywood, the film puts us in the nineteenth century, where John Clayton (name of the king of the jungle) converses with national congressmen in order to travel to Congo to prevent the extermination of a tribe very dear to him, he clearly accepts and after a short love affair, where Jane wants to go, but Tarzan refuses in order not to lose her, Jane, Tarzan and Williams initiate the perilous trip through the wet and dangerous jungles of the Congo. Hours after they settle in the tribe (with a implicit sex scene, Yes, Tarzan has needs too), they are ambushed by Waltz. Tarzan plays James Bond for a few minutes, but he is aggressively hit and remains unconscious for a few seconds, ideal period time to kidnap some members of the community and Jane - the goal was to capture Tarzan, not to Jane -. I do not why Hollywood wants to invade each story with romanticism, Tarzan and Jane have romantic potential, but no more love, it already was enough.There is a beautiful and insightful component, in addition to the chases, fights or stampedes. We have witnessed a long trip in which illustrate the beginnings of a child grown in the jungle, an expedition that goes back to 1918 with "Tarzan of the Apes"; series, films, TV films, comedies, animations, dramas and even pornography have been based on the story. It is implausible not knowing the foundations of the guy and "The Legend of Tarzan" knows very well handle that past, Yates was intelligent and objective by omitting the beginnings that no one in the movie theater was willing to return to see, subtly positioned are found flashbacks that objectively elucidates the origins and they added the first moment in which the wild man met Jane. Support plots, which are accommodated with total convenience and complacency.The film respects the parameters imposed by the story, it does not require millionaire special effects nor technological artifices, however, it avails itself of both. Fidelity of a work towards to its reference is essential if you don't have a sufficiently unusual idea to eclipse the original, this time they decide to leave the past behind and projecting a Tarzan that continues with the same ideals of earlier, Jane is fresh and determined and Jackson is the humorous part, despite this, the loyalty and novelty to be injected in the film are underestimated by the somber harmony of the final result."The Legend of Tarzan" suffers from many shortcomings, nevertheless, it executes action scenes with total perfection. It has long I do not saw a film with so much excellence technical. The best thing the reinvention of Yates was the majesty of his scenes. Shot perfectly positioned - just in case, Were Tarantino or Spielberg involved in this? -, angles geometrically precise, focus thoroughly outstanding and a shocking visual landscape. While many of the few animals on screen are executed by CGI or animatronic, the film retains the same perplexity of "The Jungle Book" by Jon Favreau.Technically, one of the best movies of the 2016 and an of the more innovative and dark stories of the man of the jungle, "The Legend of Tarzan" is a good escapist entertainment for put a side superheros, animations or catastrophes. A professional cast, memorable action scenes and a near-perfect cinematography are intimidate by generic long scenes, clichés of the genre and a sluggish pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would I look for in a Tarzan movie? Beautiful landscape, for sure, fascinating animals, breathtaking scenes of Tarzan 'flying' through the jungle, some action, a little love, a main actor embodying both the English aristocrat and the wild man who grew up with gorillas well. Maybe a little thrill from time to time and a bit fun. Well, easy to tell it was all the above. Plus great music, S.L. Jackson and C. Waltz on top. I truly enjoyed every bit of it, I liked Skarsg?rd, in my opinion he acted very well especially his 'animal-like' expressions were great.What I would not expect in a Tarzan movie is a complicated story line full of twists and deep conversations, completely unexpected over the top performances or anything. Obviously this is not what the movie was like. Anyways, unlike many other reviewers, I did not have the feeling of watching too much green-screen-action at all, though I am sure no expert in detecting those.One needs to keep in mind that this is an adaptation of a children's book. Still, the movie was not meant solely for children, but real fun and excitement for adults as well. I recommend watching this. It was better than I hoped and I had so much fun and was truly amazed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan Is A Fantasy. This One Delivers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend Of Tarzan was a long time coming and I'd say it was well worth the wait. For the first time since the silent movies have we seen Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic character so faithfully brought to the screen. Tarzan is a fantasy. Like any fantasy film, CGI is necessary. Using CGI, director David Yates was able to have his characters interact with the wild beasts of the jungle, rather than resorting to using stock footage of animals, as they did in the old Tarzan films, just to add screen time. The negatives for this movie, in my mind, are minor and mentioning them here would constitute spoilers. This movie boasts a solid, original story with plenty of drama and lots of action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all the disaster you might expect!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very often don't listen to critics or audiences and find out things for myself. However, I'm not exactly a "Tarzan" fan and I didn't expect that 2016 was ripe for a remake of an old story like this. I just wasn't very interested. But I am nothing if not a movie fanatic and decided to try it anyways after reading a woman's comedic review that was hilarious. Now I wish I had ignored everything and saw this first thing. This would have been a great summer adventure in the theatre maybe even in 3D. The Legend of Tarzan is fun, intense, thorough and original when you consider how they approach the Tarzan story with Tarzan returning to his jungle to save it. It almost tries too hard with a complex political story but it makes sense overall. Flashbacks to Tarzan's origin story feel very empty and hollow unfortunately but it is a good way to tell a new story while still doing the origins. The effects in the film are...good...ish? Sometimes I felt like the CGI was horrible and then other times it added to the style and quality of the film to see the lush greenery and CGI animals. This is a very different side of Tarzan with some strong performances and good action.Alexander Skarsg?rd takes up the lead and unfortunately he doesn't quite have the strong screen presence necessary to carry the film. He plays the role well, looks the part, his physique is obviously mind blowing but the brooding and angry Tarzan is too underwhelming to feel heroic. Still he does decently. Hollywood's up and coming latest It Girl, Margot Robbie steals the show as Jane. She is very very good but her chemistry with Skarsg?rd is lacking definitely. Still the story focuses more on her and she plays the strong damsel in distress well. Christoph Waltz as your villain? OK well immediately that makes this watchable. The man is amazing and he is the perfect villain for any film. His chemistry opposite Robbie in their scenes are fantastic. He is also a scene stealer obviously. Samuel L Jackson...in another movie...and once again I can't say anything bad about him. He is just...Samuel L Jackson and he plays this role well and has a good part and he doesn't overshadow anyone and how are we not sick of this man yet? He is that good! Djimon Hounsou is an amazing character actor has an unfortunately small role in the film that I think they could have done more with but much like Waltz and Jackson, he ups the ante of any cast.Maybe The Legend of Tarzan wasn't what people wanted or expected. I had no expectations or had low expectations but the film was a lot of fun and serious and well filmed. It had the feel of a superhero film but also a period piece, romance (although the romance was lacking), and I think it probably lived up to the Tarzan name. David Yates is a fantastic visual director. His Harry Potter films were some of the best and I think he really loves to tell an adventure. He shot this really well and the scenery is something to behold. The film is really entertaining for the first hour and a bit but then absolutely takes off when Tarzan returns to full...swing...ha! Let's be clear, the ape looks awful. A full on animated Ape like George of The Jungle would have looked more realistic and it sort of ruined certain scenes especially the kick butt battle between the two of them. If you can get past some of the disgustingly awful special effects then you see a lot of heart in the film. When it's all said and done, have fun with this, enjoy it! Give it the time! It's not Oscar worthy but it's thoroughly entertaining and that fills the need. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect...I went to see it with my father-in-law and we both thought it was spectacular. Alexander Skarsgard was chilling, relentless and breathtaking. It was obvious he trained hard to be in tremendous physical condition for this role. Jane was beautifully played by the stunning Australian actress Margot Robbie. The chemistry between the two was undeniable. In addition to Tarzan's role to help determine the impact on the Congo of the Belgian presence, his "side-kick" Dr. George Williams (superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson) lent even more credibility to the evidence they gathered. They saw first hand how ruthless the Belgians were to not only try to gain full control of the Congo and enslave thousands of natives in the process, but how greedy they were to get their hands on the diamonds. The scenes with Tarzan and his animal friends were stunning. Christopher Waltz was tremendous as the villain Rom...any time an actor can make you "hate" them, they've done their job very well. Overall, we were truly taken by this film. I hope there will be more in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring back the men in monkey-suits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest reboot of this venerable franchise uses CGI instead of the wildlife footage and extras in gorilla-suits we put up with in the era of Weissmuller and Mahoney and co. Alexander Skarsgard, like Christopher Lambert in 1984's elegant (but plodding) GREYSTOKE, is a leaner meaner Tarzan than some of the steroidal hunks you see in the gym who might like a crack at the role. The story ? our handsome hero returns to the jungle he grew up in to liberate the natives from enslavement by a vicious mine-owner ? has echoes of some of the older plots in the series (much like the Bond movies), with some atmospheric scenes of Tarzan in his post-African role as Lord of a Manor (his bride is now Lady Jane, which brings unintended echoes of Lady Chatterley!). THE LEGEND OF TARZAN is faithful to the spirit if not to the letter of the Edgar Rice Burroughs source material.The 'foundation' story, his childhood talking to the animals, is told here in a series of crisp flashbacks. This works very well, intercut with the developing rescue drama. The cinematography does full justice to the glories of the African landscape.The Victorian period flavour is well maintained (as it was in 1984), and the story is nearly as fast and furious as an Indiana Jones escapade. Skarsgard brings glamour and charisma to the title role. Margot Robbie's Jane has a luminous beauty that reminded me of the early Sophia Loren. Samuel L. Jackson makes the best he can of a thankless role as the inept but valiant sidekick and Christoph Waltz recycles his recent resurrection of Blofeld with little visible effort.There's not much originality here but it makes for colourful and thrilling entertainment. Hobbits and Harry Potter should have accustomed us to digital creatures by now, but I did find the CGI animals lacked credibility and made me ? almost ? nostalgic for extras in monkey-suits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan is a beautifully-shot, hearty adventure film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Creating a contemporary Tarzan film is a bold idea. The critical reaction hit the film hard, many reviews suggesting that the iconic ape-man's time had passed. Tarzan is a character steeped in problematic history. He's a white superman fighting his way across the African continent; a relic of the colonialist era. It's understandable why he might incite such hostility. And yet, 2016's 'The Legend of Tarzan' does everything in its power to modernise the archaic idea. Tarzan of 2016 is less supreme white-superman, and more a conflicted individual, torn between two realities.David Yates' follow-up to his Potter films has something that many films in the current cinemascape are lacking: a heart, and a sense of uniqueness. Superhero films battle for box office supremacy, but there isn't another movie around currently that feels like The Legend of Tarzan. And, unlike so many other films this year, the film practices brevity. The Legend of Tarzan is good, solid adventure entertainment. It takes classic story elements and adds a modern twist to them: Jane fills the 'damsel' role, but is far more fiery and psychologically complex. Samuel L Jackson plays George Washington-Williams, a real- life figure who finds himself an investigator, hearty companion and fierce gunslinger. Waltz fulfills the villain role. His Leon Rom is perfectionist, heartless and ambitious. It's a role that might feel familiar for the actor, but it works well enough.Skarsgard's take on Tarzan is, perhaps, the most book-accurate in the history of the character. He is well-educated and refined. He can play the English lord. But Skarsgard's Tarzan finds himself conflicted about himself; there's a heaviness that weighs on the character about returning to Africa. He has no 'real' home. The performance is very subdued with only two scenes of primal rage showing through. The rest of the time Skarsgard practices minimalism.Part of the modernisation is the film utilising the Congo Free State, Belgium's oppressive regime of the Congolese people. The film meticulously recreates the costumes and details of the period (such as a train pulling hundreds of elephants tusks into Port Boma). Underneath the summer glamour, Legend of Tarzan touches upon themes of family, respecting the environment, and the damage of destroying connections between people.David Yates brings a particular aesthetic to the film. His sweeping Africa shots are beautifully captured, using real Congolese locations. Other parts of the film, such as the jungle interiors, were shot on soundstages, yet they remain impressive and imposing, finding a sense of earthy magic. There is a subtle grandeur in these environments, not quite real, slightly exaggerated, yet believable. Action scenes make distinct use of slow motion. And elsewhere the camera finds itself focusing on macro shots and close ups: there is a moving abstraction to Yates' direction, he finds powerful images in small details ? eyes, hands, cutlery, ants.Despite having a number of exciting action sequences, and an impressive climax, 'Legend of Tarzan' finds a brilliant heart in the dynamic between its cast members, in the heightened reality that Yates captures through his lenses, and the sense of wonder both on a huge scale (epic jungle or Savannah shots) and an extremely intimate level. The flashbacks are woven into the narrative fabric with grace ? and without alarm. Yates simply transitions us into them, without fanfare, exploring Tarzan's traumatic history. One excellent moment shows Tarzan brought to the Kuba village for the first time after having protected Jane from an irate gorilla. The transition begins with a shot pulling out away from Tarzan, showing the climatic mountain reflected in the window. Jane's voice is heard. After the flashback we cut from close ups of Tarzan to a close up of Jane, contemplating. The shot lasts awhile. It's moments like this that stress the love and importance between the two leads, and reveals the subtle beauty and meaning with which David Yates imbues his cinema.'Legend of Tarzan' failed to win over the critics. Its well- intentioned script might still hold problematic racial politics. And yet, it is a worthy film, entertaining and well-made. This could be the last cinematic outing for the legendary character. It seems fitting, to me, that he has finally been given a rewarding effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting spin on the tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film very intriguing when I watched it, normally you would think that Tarzan was some neanderthal who swung around in trees howling, but this adds a fresh storyline in which Tarzan was that neanderthal guy in the past and is now a posh MP, it is a good spin on a classic tale.The film sends a good moral to the audience not to enslave people and Samuel L Jackson's character provides a good story, good action and some comic relief, if you enjoyed the original Tarzan you will like this.It does contain abit more injury detail and such so young children who enjoyed the cartoon should keep away, but all in all a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Film That Adds To The Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not see this film in IMAX or 3-D because the local theater did not offer them. But I could see how they might enhance the experience.And what an experience it is. The spectacle that Edgar Rice Burroughs created in the minds of his readers found expression on the big screen. Personally, I chose to view the film in those terms--not superimposing current-day politics, but remembering the mythology of the Burroughs tales and how they must have inspired his fans. At its core, Tarzan is about the wonderment and mystery of a human raised by apes, able to communicate with animals and capable of "flying" through the jungle canopy.As such, I will evaluate this film's various elements:CAST: 10: The actor who plays Tarzan needs to be a physical presence on screen. Though this film does not ask Tarzan/Lord Greystoke to cavort in a loincloth, he clearly has the physique for it. This film may do for Alexander Skarsgard's career what "The Wolf of Wall Street" did for Margot Robbie's. Speaking of Robbie, her personification of Jane Porter, Greystoke's wife/mate, is perfection. Maybe Angelina Jolie could have matched her beautiful physicality a few years ago, but otherwise she is unmatchable in her portrayal of the woman who loves Africa and the man it gave her even more than her place among the salons and galleries of England.STORY: 9: The film begins eight years after Lord Greystoke has returned to claim his title in England. As he and Jane journey back to and through the Congo, the story of how Tarzan lived among the apes and met Jane is told in flashback. It works seamlessly.VILLAIN: 10: Christoph Waltz is perfect as Leon Rom, the man with a plan to subjugate an entire country for mercenary reasons.CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10: The beautiful scenery is one of the strengths of this film. Every scene is lovingly filmed and created with an eye for artistic composition.ACTION SCENES: 9: The balance between quiet moments and moments of extreme action is finely tuned to accent, say, the deep love between Lord and Lady Greystoke or the maleficent intent of Rom.SPECIAL EFFECTS: 8: We have been conditioned to expect scenes that are real looking though they do not exist in reality. It is with such a keen expectation that I grade this element an 8, though most of the action is remarkably convincing.MUSIC: 9: Like most good scores, this one was rarely noticed. It complemented the action and the beautiful panoramas.This is an impressive film, recreating the awe of Burrough's original readers, who could only see such images in their imagination. Though some viewers have chosen to impose their political views upon the film, it should be viewed, as its title reminds us, as a legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tarzan of the Apes. Oh, how we've missed you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan is back. Happy, happy, joy, joy.Christopher Waltz plays antagonist, channeling devious energies from his Nazi character from that Tarontotena (whatever) film. Waltz is great, as usual, and has fun playing villain in his white suit and comedy moustache. As a side, I've never seen anyone use a rosary to strangle a person before (but growing up I heard many-a-threat of it.)Margot Robbie, seemingly the sole focus of every advert for the upcoming Suicide Squad movie (her and her butt) plays Jane, and does a great job getting kidnapped. Samuel L. Jackson shoots guns and does not say "mutha-f-a" once. I think the best films are made with international teams. Sometimes the direction is a bit muddled, however. There's a distracting scene where Tarzan and Jackson are talking and the camera zooms around them in circles, and there are lots of close-up shots with the edges blurred, which are copious. But the film, as a whole, is beautiful looking.Alexander Skarsg?rd perfectly embodies Tarzan. From the intensity of his jungle eyes to his chicken cutlet physique, Tarzan's reborn on the big screen in spectacular fashion. Watch this film for Tarzan, the numerous, beautiful shots of the jungle, and how Tarzan interacts with the animals. Animals are interesting by themselves, but perhaps what is most interesting is observing interaction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the PC brigade shouting racism and sexism from the rooftops-get a grip! You people will find racism in absolutely anything just so you have something to get sanctimonious about. The rest of us don't take any notice of the colour of characters, and the story of Tarzan is older than all of you. It's a fun, captivating action film. Don't go expecting depth and existentialism. Grab your popcorn, put your feet up and expect to be entertained for a couple of hours. All in all, I don't feel the film could be improved in any way, it's told with an original story arc and the director knows how to leave you wanting more rather than over facing you with what they think you want to see. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what I expected:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I'd like to say that this is completely incomparable to the animated version of Tarzan because the cartoon has an emphasis on story, and this does not. I was expecting more of a focus on the atmosphere, less weight on story, meaning beautiful cinematography to really show the elegance of nature, and a powerful soundtrack to show its strength.That's exactly what it was.Alexander Skarsgard nailed his role as Tarzan, Christoph Waltz was a decent enough villain, but in this film the only person whose acting was required to be on par was Alex, because the film is, as the title suggests, focused solely on Tarzan.There's elements of a romance between Tarzan and Jane but it's brief and not too focused upon, because once again, it's about Tarzan, being this mythical and legendary figure, the cinematography and soundtrack really conveys that, and Alexander really managed to strike a perfect balance between Tarzan's civilised and savage natures. Almost all of Tarzan's scenes, in fact almost every shot in which he is shown, makes you look upon him in amazement, not just because of how gigantic Alexander Skarsgard was required to become for this role, but also because of the camera angles, the lighting, just everything really makes Tarzan look like the biggest, most dominant, main object every time he's shown. Once again, Skarsgard managed to strike an absolutely perfect balance between the civilised and wild sides of Tarzan, and to be honest, it isn't a balance, it's heavily biased towards the wild side, the civilised side of him is subtle and whilst always present, it's overwhelmed by his natural side. The only scene in which the civilised side was in control was near the start of the film where Tarzan is seen sipping tea and wearing a suit, but even then you can see the animal side just below the surface, and you can almost feel it. The presence and power of that side of him is immense. Overall, this was a beautiful looking and sounding film, Tarzan was portrayed perfectly, and the atmosphere was spot-on, the only criticism I would have is Samuel L Jackson's unnecessary comic relief which became annoying at times, but aside from that, I enjoyed it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall I liked the movie because I like the Story of Tarzan and any opportunity to get exposed to it in the big screen is a good day.This time around, the visuals the acting the sets, the story the intrigue and the animal undertone lurking were all there. So very good in that Regard!Where this movie loses is I believe in the editing part again, it seems some bureaucratic force decided to chop the movie in order to fit some arbitrary and non artistic format. Which is disappointing. Was it done to fit the movie within a certain time frame or because they wanted to try to have the "Action" be more intense it its delivery we may never know but it causes holes in the story and there were many moments I was wonder "what has happened here?" and "how did A lead to C, where is B?". At times it felt dry and without Spirit without Magic.And I am hoping this chopping of movies will stop.What was not very poignant too was the music score, I do not remember it at all, and maybe this is also a contributor to the lack of magic, there was no score causing that heart pounding feeling. Other than this, I think the movie makes for an entertaining afternoon and a nice new iteration to the story of Tarzan and his Legend :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite a Mixed Bag :/</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the cinema to see The Legend of Tarzan with a lot of excitement as it is one of my favourite stories and although I was not expecting it to match the original animation I did expect more from Universal with such a massive budget.Pro's1. The cinematography and the depiction of Africa is stunning in this film and at times breathtaking, easily the highlight of the film. As cheesy as the scene where Tarzan meets the lions he has known since they were cubs is, it was beautiful to watch.2. Overall Alexander Skarsgard was pretty good as a very civilised Tarzan and his back and forth with Samuel L Jackson were enjoyable.3. I enjoyed how the various tribes and locals were portrayed and i found them to be my favourite human characters in the film.Con's1. What did they do to Jane? She was no longer British and I found her quite annoying and despite making the comment about not wanting to be "like a damsel" it was all her character seemed to me. She was always the character needing saved whether in the flash back or because she is kidnapped and then when she does break free in the jungle she is immediately captured and her actions end up leading to the deaths of multiple ape's. Margot Robbie was fine in her performance, especially when interacting with the local tribes, but I just disliked the character. 2. Christoph Waltz playing the exact same character yet again, yawn.3. Paper thin plot at no point did I ever think any of the main characters were in trouble.4. The Lack of action did not help a very slow paced movie and it just never seemed to get going.5. When there was action I was surprised at the very obvious CG and the fact it was so obviously not Alexander Skarsgard swinging at points completely took me out of the movie because it was so poor.Overall while there were some positives and a few redeeming factors the film was in general rather boring. It felt much longer than it's run-time and with a budget this massive I expected so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ruins the fun by going too dark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Concocted over 100 years ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan has swung his way through countless stories not only in literature but also on radio, stage, television and film. So what fresh spin can this blockbuster add to such an oft-told tale? Well, none, it turns out. Firmly set in seriousville, this update anchors itself on a cliché-heavy and wearisome plot ? with more holes and contrivances than a Fast and Furious movie ? generating an overly solemn tone that saps every hint of fun out of the jungle adventure. Even the action sequences are predominantly devoid of excitement (a train brawl proving the exception); the choppy editing, shaky-cam cinematography and inconsistent CGI ruining the potentially thrilling animalistic fight choreography and uses of slow motion. As the titular ape-raised hero, Alexander Skarsg?rd brings the requisite physicality to his anger-driven protagonist, but lacks the levity and charm that would've made his Tarzan more likable and worth rooting for. Margot Robbie's Jane has pluck, wits and beauty, yet still requires saving repeatedly thanks to lazy plot devices, whilst Christoph Waltz brings his trademark eccentricity to enliven his villainous role. The less said about Samuel L. Jackson's completely unnecessary and woefully out of place sidekick the better. Despite possessing the tools required to reinvigorate this century-old yarn, The Legend of Tarzan squanders its opportunities with a pedestrian script, messy action and a needlessly dark mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is Tarzan well depicted?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I have to Compare Tarzan:The Legend of Lord Greystoke with Christopher Lambert in the role of Tarzan (1984) and The Legend of Tarzan (2016) with Alexander Skarssgard as the leading role, I will have to admit that the former is a true reflection of whom Tarzan is compared to the latter which is mostly a story based on the history of Colonialism and Tarzan a pretext to talk about this sad moment of history: The Slave Trade.However, the strength of the film Tarzan (2016) relies,if we talk about whom Tarzan is, on the descriptive nature of who he is: Africa's ghost or the man able to communicate with animals. Especially, near the end, when he communicates with the crocodiles is noteworthy.We can go further in the film's depiction of Tarzan, for example, even if not well developed, is how Tarzan will unite the animals of the jungle for a one extraordinary stamped.In addition, one could say that the special effects showing Tarzan swinging from one tree to another closely resembles Spiderman. However, the great flaw of this film is that of not having focused on Tarzan and his amazing gift of speaking or communicating with animals. It would have been fun to have gone deeper into his gift and not dwell on a tragic historical part of history.To conclude, in the 1984 version when Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) fights the leader of the gorillas, it is worth the viewing. In parallel, the gorilla in Tarzan (2016), the ape he was brought up with, considers Tarzan, his brother, an outcast. The battle between the two is weak compared to the 1984 version.A film, that I hope, will have a sequel if the true focus on Tarzan would be his gift rather than politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Tarzan' is a difficult story to try to film successfully, goodness knows lots of people have tried, so I went into this new version not really knowing what to expect.It's not a bad attempt. Yes, it gets a bit bogged down with politics at times, and then in the next breath tries to be a big action movie, but it has enough moments to make it worth the admission fee.The standout performance comes from Margot Robbie. What with this and 'Suicide Squad' coming out soon she is going to have a huge 2016. And rightly so because here, as she has done in many films previously, she demonstrates what a good actor she is. She saves many a scene here where the dialogue is corny and the pacing slow.Is this a great film? No. Is it a reasonable way to spend two hours? Yes.</fullReview>

When he wife is taken from him, our hero John Greystoke, with the help of George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) battles through the wild Congo countryside to get her back. The bad guy is Leon Rom, wonderfully played by Christopher Waltz, who is to bad guys what Mickey is to Mouse.

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan Review - By Gaurav DaptardarHere comes yet another chapter in the universe of Warner Bros. envisioning a new era of dark and gritty superheroes which started by the tremendous success of Nolan's Batman series .Harry potter fame David Yates keeps the flambeau burning with his first faithful adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan.The Legend of Tarzan begins with our brooding protagonist now a certain Lord Greystoke trapped in the civilized world with his feral upbringing surfacing at tender moments. A poignant scene of Jane (Margot Robbie, Beautiful yet spunky) miffed with Tarzan is found sitting on a big tree which Tarzan, now an aristocratic Englishman climbs with one graceful motion .The vicious beast within surfaces and Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan explodes spectacularly when Jane is kidnapped by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, Flawless) in leau of diamonds promised for delivering Tarzan to chief Mbonga (DjimonHounsou, Powerful) who has his own nefarious plans. Skarsgard is fantastic and manages add the gravitas to the dual personality, a suave lord and King of the jungle. In a spectacular scene worthy of an Imax viewing Tarzan chases and swings on top of a moving train, takes on a bogey full of soldiers indulged in slave trafficking showing his utter commitment to the woman and the tribal families he loves. Thrilling adventure ensues .He is able supported by George Washington (Samuel Jackson, Brilliant).Edgar Rice Burroughs was arguably the first superstar author of adventure novels matched only by popularity of Arthur Conan Doyle. With books translated in more than 50 languages Burroughs legacy has left Hollywood making adaptations of Tarzan and his adventures almost 50 times finding some success. Yates version comes close to recreating what this old master envisioned. The Legend of Tarzan manages to wipe out all previous memories of Tarzan's (somewhat forgetful) big screen adaptations. Herein lies its success. The Legend of Tarzan manages to get its essence correct.The first half suffers from a slight lack of pace and is not as taut and efficient as the latter. Editor Mark Day manages to streamline Tarzan's origin and current story lines to merge smoothly. In the second half, the adventure drives forward with relentless pace with viewer almost on constant edge of the seat.The production values scream $180 millions. Special mention for cinematographer Henry Braham! His cinematography is dark edgy and foreboding in London with foreshadows of impending doom. Africa is shown in all its grandeur and glory with wide and sweeping panoramic shots. It's a visual treat. CGI is realistic and not over the top like some recent tent poles (ID Resurgence?). Music by Rupert Gregson Williams is apt and not too loud. Background score remains Warner Bro.'s trump card with another notable score. Action is well paced and sporadic. This is no captain America. Tarzan is not superhuman and gets hurt, increasing the stakes and audience's involvement.Writing is crisp and writers had the unenviable job of making this 100 years old superhero relevant in our times. They manage it successfully with a clever character played by Nick fury aka Morgan Freeman which is based on a real life character of that time. Tarzan keeps getting timely help from his native African friends dispelling any racist undertone the movie might have projected showing a white man saving Africans single-handed.It remains to be seen how the movie performs in the crowded summer blockbusters. It faces a stiff competition from a sequel awaited by a generation (Finding Dory) and another sequel which tried the same without much success (ID Resurgence). This movie is a breath of fresh air in the summer crowd. You cannot afford to miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low expectations and a surprising movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the cinema for this was my birthday outing. (IMAX 3D=expensive) and my expectations were fairly conservative.I had watched a couple of early Youtube reviews purposely to gauge the general opinions of those who dabble in that type of thing and I am pleased that I did because aside from a couple of ropey CGI moments the movie is very well paced and unlike some of the reviewers I think the action,although not mindless and without purpose actually fitted nicely into the direction of a very familiar but detailed and well told story.Without giving too much away Tarzan,or Lord Grey- stoke as he is formerly known is already living in London and part of polite society after his upbringing in the jungles of Africa so the story starts from that point and what follows after that is a fairly intelligent telling of his return to the jungle and the obvious fight to reconnect with his heritage and save the woman he loves while trying to save the amazon people from slavery.Throw in CGI animals,swinging vines,a decent paced adventure and a 1920's mousstache twirling villain and you pretty much have a Tarzan movie.BTW it's got Samuel L Jackson too in a much needed comic relief role.Enjoy! P.s.The way the African landscape is portrayed is eye popping and look incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to tell you all about one of the surprise fantastic films of the summer. I must agree that "The Legend of Tarzan" was an action-packed, scenic epic with great character actors and a dramatic musical score. The story has Tarzan (portrayed by an amazingly swelt, Alexander Skarsgard - AKA Eric from TrueBlood) Margot Robbie is a spitfire Jane, and Christoph Waltz is fantastic as the bad guy. The film starts with a civilized Tarzan, already a part of high society, who is asked by Samuel L Jackson (also a great addition to the cast) to return to the jungle for a special mission. The mission is exciting, and the animal special effects are the best I've seen. (and yes - animals and humans meet their demise, but neither are innocent of wrongdoing and all are created by CGI) Now this was a great summer movie! (as apposed to the disappointing Independence Day -Resurgence)In fact, I thought it was one of the best epic films in many years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The new Tarzan looks good on paper or when he's standing still, but as it moves with shallow gimmicks and abundance of CG, it reverts back into bland predictable safari.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Tarzan has been known for decades, the movie tries to capitalize this in expectation that audience will follow its two timelines and many branching subplots. Unfortunately, the admittedly nice view is encumbered by myriad of issues, contrasting tones and shallow social and political showing. It becomes an overly familiar sighting that barely presents the characters above their stereotypical roles.Tarzan or John (Alexander Skarsg?rd) returns to Africa after reclaiming his birthright, a conflicting homecoming as he deals with slavery and conspiracy. The story plays after the events of his origin, and the past is retold with several flashbacks. This different path is a welcomed change and surprisingly the little touch on these scenes are effective in setting his character. Alexander Skarsg?rd also looks the part for the brawny slightly beastly protagonist from his speech and mannerism.The problem is Tarzan and both his foes and allies are entirely predictable. Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom is almost identical to his other villain roles, down to the creepy table exchanges and only differs in attires. Margot Robbie is the new Jane, an attempt for more spunky and powerful female, but she's trapped in usual pretty damsel in distress role, which ironically the movie points out hoping for the opposite effect.Samuel L. Jackson performs as the sidekick William, also a vehicle for audience as he's new to the jungle. Expect the same charmingly brash Samuel here. Humor is relatively decent for light adventure, mainly In Samuel's expense, but the delivery is implemented in wrong way, thus it sometimes ruins the supposed intense atmosphere or just misses completely. It wants to have strong characters, social backdrop and occasional light comedy, although it throws them together, even in the same span of five minutes, more often than not it is not effective.For the exotic location, it does showcase some good cinematography. However, it doesn't take off as the focus on CG affects the authenticity. When the movie gives an organic camera angle or rapid motion, it eventually turns in CG fest. There's attempt to mask this with flash editing, not only that it doesn't work this rustic camera cut negates any impact on the action scene.A fairly nice trek muddled by disjointed narrative and clash in styles. With too much reliance in shallow gimmicks and abundance of CG, the beautiful scenery reverts back into bland predictable safari.</fullReview>

I have read several critics reviews where they have literally parroted each other verbatim saying "it uses the same old white savior trope",...well guess what a-holes ,Tarzan IS white and IS the hero and was written over 100 years ago, should we make him black and a conflicted villain instead. the movie has a happily married ,loving couple battling great odds to be reunited and conquer evil intentions,....anathema to the critics. The movie has great visuals, a unique non-origin Tarzan story, good comic relief by Samuel Jackson, and an interesting villain played by Christoph Waltz, a nice mix of romance and action, and just an overall good summertime movie that can be enjoyed whether you are a single,couple,or entire family. It has a few minor flaws in the editing dept., but it's successes far outweigh its flaws. Go See It!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hero's journey with gorillas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trajectory of the hero, it is the new movie Tarzan, it contains all those basic clichés, visual effects and animals are just good (nothing compared to the Planet of the Apes, for example), the performances are weak, with the exception of Samuel Jackson, photography of the film until it is beautiful and surprising at times, despite the excess chroma key, and the scenes with decontextualized audio flashbacks ala Spike Jonzen, and the soundtrack is imperceptible, I have not read the books, but I saw the animation 90s which is better, the movie sin not to exploit the Tarzan of the conflict between the world had wild and the civilized, often wild animals love unconditionally and without judgment they are irrational, it is brushed in the film but very little explored, here is my condolences to the script that disappoints. Tarzan is a movie to see with the family on a Sunday any, just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but unfocused</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't that bothered when I heard about another Tarzan movie. In my opinion, i'm sick of Dracula, werewolf, horror/adventure genre movies. Was I thinking pessimistically? Well, as it turned out, it was enjoyable. Nothing incredible really, but the action was impressive. Special kudos to the visual effects gurus, the CGI gorillas were brilliant. Harry Potter director David Yates knows how to put action scenes together well. Story-wise it felt a bit cluttered, do we need a slavery in the Congo subplot? The lead actor playing Tarzan was surprisingly good. Strider from Lord of the Rings meets Alan Quatermain. Samuel L. Jackson clearly wandered off the set of The Hateful Eight and kept playing a watered down version of his battle-hardened Civil War veteran. I walked out of the cinema feeling impressed. Will I forget about it in 3 weeks? Yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strangely Told Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie...this movie....This movie is hard to put into words. For starters, let's state some basic facts. Tarzan is one of the most popular film and media franchises in modern history, with a quick search on IMDb revealing over 200 entries for the property. However, aside from the Disney movie from the 90's and a few other animated films in recent years, this is the first live action addition to the franchise--or at least the first of any great box office success--in at least forty years. That being the case, one would think that this movie would be an origin story. And one would be wrong about that.This movie tells its story by placing Tarzan and his wife Jane in London years after they've emigrated from the jungle of the Congo. The movie unfolds as the pair go back to the jungle for a mission of sorts, and along the way the origin story is told. That being the case, effectively what develops is flashbacks of the origin story mixed into a sequel. In other words, a reboot which has no live action predecessor from within the last half a century or so starts its story far, far into the Tarzan mythology.That whole gimmick didn't work very well for me. I wanted an origin story, and I found the way that the plot unfolded to be very confusing. I've never seen the Disney Tarzan movies, or any other Tarzan movie. I know the basic gist, as most people do--a man is raised by apes and becomes Lord of the Jungle, is discovered by researchers, etc. But still--the movie should have told me that story. It didn't, really. It skimmed over it, but it didn't tell it.All that said, I found this movie to be pretty disappointing. It's relatively entertaining, and almost saves itself despite the strange plot device, but the most I can give it is 5/10 stars. Not horrible, but not the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average movie, bad CGI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 2D. It was okay, nothing special. The cast was good, but not great. It was hard to really connect with any of the characters, maybe because it felt like we joined the movie halfway into it. I think maybe it would have helped if there was more of an introduction to the characters than what we got. I guess they assume everyone knows the Tarzan origin story, so there isn't a need to tell it again. But in this case they told too little for me at least to connect with the characters.The biggest problem I had with this movie was the awful CGI. The animals looked really bad. Also the scene where they swing onto a moving train has such awful CGI that it's almost like a bad video game.In the end it was an okay movie, but I wouldn't want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review. Or at least this portion isn't anyway. This is simply something I noticed while watching the film. What would you say Tarzan is most identified with? I would bet that your answer is most likely going to be his famous yell. Since the early years of cinema, we've been making Tarzan films. This is not a complaint. One of the first incredibly recognizable sound bites from that era goes to Tarzan's yell. I've seen it used a lot in modern day films, paying homage. Now what if I told you that the Tarzan yell in this movie is featured only off screen? Twice. He's never on screen while doing it. We only get reaction shots of the bad guys saying: "He's close", or something along those lines. Because you see, there's literally a legend of Tarzan in this movie. He is the legend. The story with Tarzan &amp; Jane is well known. This is established. But not having Tarzan visible while he does his famous yell, is similar (to me) to constantly cutting away from the T-Rex in Jurassic Park whenever it roars. It's something that is so rooted to the character, that it's crazy to me that it would be thrown to the side. There could've been a scene where he finally does the yell on camera while taking out one of the higher ranking bad guys. A moment where everyone in the audience could think: "RIGHT. HE DOES THAT." But, in the end, this is just a rant about how nearly absent one of the most iconic yells in all of cinema is in The Legend Of Tarzan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly really good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a surprisingly really good movie. When I first saw it coming to theaters I figured it was another hokey lack of imagination movie with new effects. I was very wrong. This wasn't a monkey boy movie at all. This had a very strong back story of the slave trade in the late 1800's. Not being a fan of Samuel Jackson I was surprised I actually liked him in this movie. I tried hard not to like him, since I really don't, but he played a very strong role here. Added some comic relief that was needed. Margot Robby also played a very strong role, not just Jane the pretty girl. She held her own in dialog as well as character. Last but not least Alex Skarsgaard, wow. Kinda yummy. Little dialog obviously but well played. All in all a fast moving yet carries you along for a great ride. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Movie with Sub-Par Dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie today and I have to admit the opening had me pumped. The music was beautiful and the visuals matched. I immediately decided to dismiss the obvious animal behavior flaws (I am an Animal Ecology major and this irks me at times), etc. because I know suspending my belief in a movie like this is expected. The movie could have been really entertaining had this been the only real flaw. What really disappointed me was the boring dialogue and sometimes emotionless acting. At times character interactions were engaging and made the movie worth the $15 I paid, but the jokes were flat and conversations were boring most of the time, especially with Jane in my opinion. If the dialogue was better, it would have made the movie very enjoyable even while having a formulaic plot. Overall I was a little disappointed with the movie (there was so much hype, too). It was not necessarily a waste of money but I think I would've been better off waiting for it to come out On Demand or something.</fullReview>

No namby-pamby Tarzan in a nappy here! Jane is lovely, and movie moves along at a very fast pace. It is also a gorgeous movie, the landscape shots are quite breathtaking.The ubiquitous Samuel L.Jackson is in it, which was putting me off, as he is er...everywhere, but I actually really enjoyed his character. It was nice seeing him without the eye patch(: Apparently Jane Goodall was "passionately" in love with Tarzan from the original books, she read as a young girl. She wanted to be his Jane! Alexander Skarsgard plays the perfect Tarzan-with gravitas. I think Ms.Goodall would approve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there are twelve classic films with Johnny Weissmuller, and one with Christopher Lambert, but the only version with the famous Edgar Rice Burroughs creation I had seen previously was the average Disney animated film, I was hoping this new live-action film with king of the jungle would be worthwhile, directed by David Yates (four Harry Potter films). Basically John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke (True Blood's Alexander Skarsg?rd) started life in the jungles of Africa, following the death of his mother from disease and his father killed by Mangani apes, he was found by the apes, given the name "Tarzan", and raised as one of their own, developing skills for hunting and swinging on vines. Eight years have passed, John has long since left Africa and settled down with his wife, American aristocrat Jane Clayton (Margot Robbie), and taken his birth name and ancestral family residence, but John's story has become legendary among the Victorian public. Wishing to leave his past behind, John initially declines an invitation to visit Boma and the Congo, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) convinces him to change his mind, hearing that Belgians are enslaving the Congolese population, Jane is eventually allowed to come as well. John, Jane and Williams reach the Congo and find a tribal village that knew John and Jane during their stay in the jungle, Jane recalls the tribe once considering John, as Tarzan, an evil spirit, and how she met and fell in love with him in the jungle. During the night the village is attacked by mercenaries, led by Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz), who in the past was searching for fabled diamonds of Opar, John and Jane are kidnapped, Jane and several tribe members are taken aboard a steamboat, while Williams is able to rescue John. With the aid of tribe warriors, John and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, evidence to expose King Leopold, who Rom is working for, they then move on and discover the family of apes John was raised by, he is considered a deserter and fights with his adult "brother" Akut, but he recovers. Jane in an opportune moment is able to make her escape from the steamboat and swim ashore, but she stumbles into an ape nest, Rom rescues her, then his men shoot and kill many of the apes, John later comes to save the remaining apes, before pursuing Rom. John is cornered by Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), leader of another jungle tribe, John previously killed Mbonga's only son who murdered Kala, after a talk John is spared, just as Akut and the apes arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom plans to take control of the army, taking Jane and the diamonds with him to Boma, a massive stampede of wildebeest is triggered by John, Williams and Akut, the town is destroyed and the soldiers distracted, allowing John to rescue Jane. Rom attempts to escape, but Williams sinks his boat with a machine gun, Rom tries to kill John when he comes swims aboard, but John throws him in the water where he is devoured by crocodiles, in the end Williams returns to Englund to expose slave trading to the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent), while a year later John and Jane have returned to Africa, to raise their first child in his father's old house, and John returns to be among the apes as Tarzan. Also starring Simon Russell Beale as Mr. Frum, Casper Crump as Major Kerckhover, Hadley Fraser as John Clayton II, Tarzan's father, Genevieve O'Reilly as Alice Clayton, Tarzan's mother, Ben Chaplin as Captain Moulle, Christian Stevens as Young Tarzan (5 Years), Rory J. Saper as Young Tarzan (18 Years) and Miles Jupp as The Valet. Skarsg?rd is a bit wooden being both posh and with his top off swinging around, Robbie is pretty and fine, Jackson gets good moments as Tarzan's ally, and Waltz does his usual villainous role well enough, the special effects are fantastic, and there are exciting scenes, but the story Tarzan coming out of the jungle and returning to society is a bit wilted, they should have focused on the jungle life of Tarzan, not reducing it to petty flashbacks, overall it is only a mildly entertaining action adventure. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brand new take on the iconic character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan tells the story of John Clayton/Tarzan(Alexander Skarsgard). Tarzan is living a domesticated life in London with his wife, Jane Clayton(Margot Robbie). Tarzan gets an invitation to return to his home in the jungle. He is accompanied by Jane &amp; American envoy, George Washington Williams(Samuel L. Jackson). Once he returns to his former home in the jungle, Tarzan realizes that something is not right. Now, it is up to Tarzan to stop the forces threatening to destroy the way of life, in the jungle. The Legend of Tarzan is a superb film. The action set pieces are mind blowing. It is thrilling to see Tarzan defying the laws of gravity, as he navigates his way through the jungle. The 3D definitely adds to the overall experience of the film. The visual effects are flawless. All the animals in the film were created using CGI &amp; they look extremely lifelike. The climax of the film is its highlight. There are two minor flaws in this movie. It takes a while to pick up steam. The first ten to fifteen minutes of the film, is quite dragging. The second flaw is, I wish they slightly expanded on Tarzan's origin story, instead of showing a few flashbacks. Alexander Skarsgard is outstanding as John Clayton/Tarzan. Skarsgard has worked really hard to acquire the Tarzan physique &amp; the outcome is extremely positive. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as George Washington Williams. Jackson infuses the movie, with some much needed humor. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Jane Clayton. The chemistry between Robbie &amp; Skarsgard is electrifying. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Leon Rom. Djimon Hounsou is excellent as Chief Mbonga. Casper Crump is impressive as Major Kerckhover. Osy Ikhile &amp; Jim Broadbent are good as Kwete &amp; Prime Minister, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. The Legend of Tarzan is worth a watch. Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud of the latest adaptation, of his beloved creation.</fullReview>

The panoramic scenery of the country and the wild-ride and explosive action scenes were gripping. Overall - this movie hit it right on the head.

		<fullReview>The way the movie tells the story of the Legend of Tarzan as a event rooted in deep history is very interesting, they speak of the colonization of Congo and the era of hyper imperialism which now Europeans powers had the industrial might of the second industrial revolution to dominate and subdue an entire continent. We see the heartlessness of men and their humanity. Waltz is a villain it seems that he always plays these kind of roles, he makes it with the zeal you expect of him, conniving serpent like, one the best actors of his generation he has the talent. Tarzan aka John Clayton is a man that reckons his wild side but is at peace with his past eventually, he respects, loves nature and treats animals as equals, he a good guy, he wants justice for his people. The plot is about a trying to pay the default of a Colonial and imperialist king with diamonds so that they can have a standing army to rule the land. Margot Robbie charm is present and gives pleasant and kind nuance to the film. It is a about a imperialistic and colonial struggle so that the oppressed can find justice and freedom that is their right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All that is Edgar Rice Burroughs is portrayed perfectly in this story based on his characters. I cannot emphasise enough the sheer brilliance of the films ability to translate onto the screen every aspect of the ERB's world from the stunning landscapes to the animals imbued with almost human demeanour's to make Tarzans connection with them all the more real. All this makes the film well worth watching and a real cut above many drama/adventure type films which we are constantly being fed. Iwill go and watch it again probably on the big screen for all the reasons mentioned. However whilst I much admire one very famous actor who has asignificant role in the film I found his character and script veryirritating and not necessary for the story.I also found what seemed to me an almost political point making all through the film to be very annoying and detracting from the beauty of the characters and original idea. I think perhaps the script writers tried almost too hard when all we needed was ERB's world brought to life. Casting notwithstanding the 'star' already mentioned was perfect and the lord of the jungle himself was beyond words in the role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great action and great animals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great action movie! It's one great action or fight scene after another, with a minimum of still, quiet scenes. Also, there are kitties. Great big ones. Great stuff: Effects:There are some great effects, but the best ones are the ones I can't tell from reality. Most of the animals must be CGI but they don't look like weird jumpy cartoons like most CGI always has. The part where Tarzan and the gorillas swing from vines had to be CGI too but except for a couple of seconds here and there it looked really realistic. Did they do something to make the actor's hands and arms look like he really walked on his knuckles and swung from trees? If they did, it was a great effect, and if it was real it was even more impressive. I haven't read up on the movie yet to see which it was; I like to give my review fresh from seeing it before learning too much from other sources or reading other reviews. Animals:It was wonderful to see animals in a movie actually acting like animals. Movie animals usually act like humans. These animals don't have silly "witty" dialogue. They talk only with their own animal cries and body language. It was a real treat for me to see the lions doing the cheek- rub thing like house cats do. They act like cats! All the animal scenes are really well done. A couple of minor points: the stampede seemed to a bit more destructive than one would expect, but perhaps some of the destruction was from someone shooting, there was so much going on I might have missed it; and when Tarzan goes toe to toe with a gorilla, even though that was a dominance display and not a real fight, I thought Tarzan was little bit less banged up than was entirely realistic, despite having to have some surface first aid. Human vs. gorilla is just really no contest, even a human at the absolute peak of human strength. Those are really minor quibbles, though, and they don't detract from the plot because they are just action details. Africa: I really liked the singing. I don't know enough about Africa to know if the songs, clothing, customs surrounding births and rites of passage, etc. were authentic or not, but they seemed to be. I also liked how the script worked in some history and managed to make the actions of the Belgian soldiers and villains believable. Not so great: Women Jane was OK, and the village women and their songs were really fun, but the best female character was the gorilla, Tarzan's mom. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because I was just kind of meh about Jane. If you have to have a really good human female character in the movie to enjoy it, then this isn't the movie for you. I'm enough of a tomboy to be able to identify with Tarzan, but that's just me. If you are going to be identifying with Jane you might not find this as enjoyable as I did. Conclusion: if action is your thing, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but needed to be longer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I rated this a 10, I thought that this movie was very good, but needed more character development and more longer scenes with Tarzan in the jungle. I enjoyed the movie a ton, however, so if you are in the mood for loads of fun, I think it would be wise to see this at the cinema. The CGI has been criticized for being cheesy, which I personally disagree with myself. I really liked the CGI of the animals, and it was good to see it on the big screen. If that was not detailed enough, well keep reading!None of the England scenes should of been removed or shortened, however, I still felt like it needed more Tarzan In The Jungle scenes. Instead of flashbacks, the movie's first seventy minutes should of been Tarzan growing up in the jungle and not just skipping straight to the main story. Then, when they finish with the seventy minutes with Tarzan growing up with the apes, they can then spend another two hours with the story of the slaves (this film's main story) with three minutes more character development and eight minutes of more Tarzan in the jungle with Samuel L. Jackson. But apart from that, this film was amazing and thrilling. Even my grandmother liked the movie when she saw it with me! So, overall, apart from the movie being too short I have to say that this is amazing, and it deserves a 7.6/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than I anticipated - A dark realization of the novels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly I went into the cinema for the cast, mainly Christoph Waltz and Alexander Skarsgard, but found that the whole cast had lived up to expectations I didn't know I had. Visually, regardless of peoples expectation of special effects, I found that the animals were all incredibly realistic and meshed perfectly into their surroundings. Surroundings that up until seeing the film, I had assumed were too green-tinted, it was only while watching that i realized just how well the colour scheme actually worked. I ended up leaving the cinema thinking that Alexander Skarsgard's accent was much better than I thought it would be and that Margot's wasn't at all half bad. I feel that there should be no reason to say just how good Christoph Waltz was as a psychological villain. Even Alexander Skarsgard, who would have to be my favourite actors at the moment, was out shined in certain scenes by Djimon Hounsou. That man(Djimon)is one of the most heartfelt and underrated actors I've ever seen, he can move from so many emotions so quickly and can make you feel for his characters with the smallest change. (See Blood Diamond) To conclude, it's easy to assume that by reviews from critics that this film might be a flop, but without getting your hopes up I can safely say that it has a solid story line and has no direct relation to the 1999 cartoon, but rather the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. In the end it's up to you to go see it, but my personal opinion is that you should go into the cinema thinking it may not be the best, but definitely worth the watch, and you might be surprised by what you see, You may even laugh. Especially when Samuel L. Jackson's on the screen, need I add it. My favourite thing about it, was how they incorporated real historic people into the story line (Leon Rom and King Leopold etc.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people on this site appear to be getting a little carried away with themselves. To quote many, "This is the greatest Tarzan film ever made?" I think these people need to calm down and maybe have a little look at Greystoke (a far superior film in every respect).This particular film, to be fair, is OK...nothing more. The story is adequate but the phoney CGI is what really grates with me. It's just pure laziness. From the phoney animals to the phoney swinging onto a moving train scene ? it's just utter drivel. It's like a cross between Spiderman 3 and Star Wars Episode 1 but set in a fake green-screen jungle. CGI can be done well (see the bear attack in The Revenant), but this was just thrown together. And that is one of my pet hates of modern cinema ? phoney CGI. This has obviously been made, without any craft, for the CGI, bubble-gum for the eyeballs, generation of modern movie goers. Knowing what I know now, I would not have lost out by never seeing this film. If you've never seen a Tarzan film, put on Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. It is a beautiful, human, haunting, moving picture which does the Tarzan legend justice!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully shot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the plot was a relatively simple one, it was well executed, with a few unexpected twists and turns here and there. I believe both long time fans and newbies will love this movie. Critics have come out against the movie for the way it dealt with racial issues by saying things that were diametrically contradictory. While some of them allege that the story is outdated and not relevant for this time and age, others purport that the story is anachronistic because the writers tried to make the protagonist a savior of the native Africans(Which was not the case with most white people at that time). Well, guess what, Tarzan is not your typical white guy. Although he may be pale skinned(Which his creator Edgar says his name literally means in 'gorilla' language!) his heart belongs to his home: Africa.The world was quite different back then, and it is refreshing to see things in a different light once in a while. Jane is a strong character with many endearing qualities. Not only is she brave, independent, and witty, but also beautiful and romantic. She adds depth and grace to the movie. I do not understand why the ratings are so low for this movie. The movie was beautifully shot. The visuals look spectacular. Both the CGI and the natural world in the film were breathtaking.Whatever the reasons for the negative critic reviews and low ratings may be, I found the movie to be entertaining, beautiful, and overall, a good experience. Looking forward to watching it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand the low critics score for this movie. I hesitated whether to join friends and watch it because of that score, and I'm glad I did. User reviews here, which are mostly very positive, reflect much better the value of this movie.First, the story is original and interesting. I liked the fact that it starts off with Tarzan already well established at England, and later gives parts of the original story via flashback. This works very well and is a refreshing view to the well famous tale.Cast did an excellent job through most of the scenes. Scenery and camera work are good too. I watched in IMAX, and some scenes were breath taking. CGI is mostly of a high quality, animals remind the remarkable work done in the Jungle Book this year, but in some scenes their behavior was not convincing enough.So it's not perfect, but overall it's a good and very recommended experience that should be watched on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average entertaining film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did have some excitement for this film and I have now seen the legend of Tarzan and it is an alright film. The premise sees a now civilised Tarzan have to return to the jungle to stop a mercenary from enslaving and destroying the jungle. Alexander skarrsgard plays Tarzan and I thought he did a decent job. Physically he looked perfect for the character and I thought he did a decent job with the complexity of the lord of the jungle. However, I didn't feel any fun involving the character and a bit of a lack of charisma from the character. Margot Robbie plays Jane and she does a good job in being more then just a simple damsel in distress and being a tough woman who you believe Tarzan would be attracted to. Samuel l Jackson is fantastic in this film as Tarzan's American friend and he really brings some life into this film with his usual charisma. Christoph waltz plays the villain in the film and he is his usual self and he is good in his role and adds to the film. The story of the film is pretty paper thin and feels like an excuse to show the beautiful African jungles. But I really liked the flashbacks showing how Tarzan grew up in the jungle and how he met Jane. I kind of wish a film in this style was the film we had got instead of a rushed story that feels forced. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue in it, its just the film lacked humour when needed in a Tarzan film. The style has some good cgi in it especially with the animals in the jungle. However, the fight scenes were hard to follow and were just a bit pointless to watch. Overall this is a decent Tarzan film but I hope they eventually make a better Tarzan film.</fullReview>

The film made me feel extraordinary. The pace, setting and backstory of the film is one that made me relate to the characters and to the story of Tarzan. I went into this film thinking that it would simply be just another George of the Jungle, Tarzan-esque type of film. The movie shattered those preexisting stereotypes that I held. The film makers were excellent in taking a well known story and adapting it from a different perspective. I greatly urge everyone to see this movie.

		<shortDescription>The beauty of the adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon second viewing of this movie, I was struck with the subtle underlying tone which, surfacing from time to time throughout, underpinned the whole affair. The richness of the storytelling was not sacrificed for just adventure nor the mere thrill of gravity-defiance. Here is the love of one's personal history, fellow man, and life-partner, gathered within a heady mix of historically inspired plot...what more could one ask for? Oh yes, to be exquisitely faithful to the originator of the iconic literary Tarzan: Edgar Rice Burroughs. His was a Tarzan of substance, complexity, and depth that had been essentially ignored through 98 years of celluloid. No wonder audiences have managed to confound critics' prognostications and propel this movie for ten days so far (and perhaps many more) beyond industry expectations. It gives a person such as myself some hope, some reassurance, and some faith in both regular people (who will pay good money for worthwhile entertainment) as well as the elite few who are monetarily enabled to produce such a product. My heart is warmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Less, A Lot More Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to the theater not quite knowing what to expect. I'm a little younger than the Johnny Weissmuller and Buster Crabbe generation, but still have enough of the fan based awe of the traditional legend.I also had my family with me, none of whom are interested in a gorilla based fantasy film, but came along just to make me happy. I sat during the initial intro, worrying the movie was not moving along fast enough to keep my family's interest. Then my brain got wrapped around the "legend", how it all began and where it was leading.This is a story within a story. Tarzan, the uncivilized boy/man raised by gorillas and the civilized and distinguished upper class man of English royalty. I loved Alexander Skarsgard's portrayal of a conflicted Tarzan, his eyes betraying his torment, as well as, his passion for Jane.I believe all movie ratings are a result of individual perception of what is expected. For me, I loved the movie and will definitely buy the DVD when released. My family enjoyed the movie, much to my surprise, so that should tell you something right there since they did not expect to like it. I rated it a 9 out of 10, only because I think the beginning seemed a little slow.... quiet, but was purposeful in it's setting the background. Lots of action and swinging from vines in the latter part of the movie with the best fitness form of any Tarzan in any movie EVER.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a Burroughs' Tarzan movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the character of Tarzan since childhood when my Dad took me to see the Mike Henry movies at the theater. Through television I then watched the older movies, devouring them all. Later on I discovered the Burroughs books and wondered for decades why no one ever really attempted to capture that specific and superior vision in a movie. Thankfully, The Legend of Tarzan corrects that and gives us the best genuine Tarzan adaptation ever committed to film. Is it perfect? Unfortunately, no. But so much of it is just simply "right" that I can forgive some occasionally (and only occasionally) dodgy CGI and an uneven pace. This is a wonderful piece of old-fashioned action adventure filmmaking that I had thought lost forever and I couldn't recommend it more highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching Tarzan on a small black and white TV in the middle of nowhere. The story of a man who could talk to animals was magic to me then. This movie brought back all those sweet memories and then one upped them with its incredible special effects and the story that went with them.If you are a fan of Tarzan you will feel like they made this movie just for you. If you have never met him before, this is an introduction you will remember.It was fun, it was exciting and Alexander Skarsgard is amazing. The only reason it gets a nine from me is because I wanted more of everything. I will be purchasing the DVD when it comes out in hopes of additional footage and if there is a sequel I will be first in line to see it.Go see it if you haven't, or see it again if you have.

		<fullReview>Hey, I just have seen today (10th of July 2016) 'The Legend of Tarzan' movie, and what can I say, I really enjoyed it. The main story is very good, the actors perform well, it has action, adventure, drama, and a real Tarzan in my opinion. I think Alexander Skarsgard deserve to be Tarzan, because he fits like a glove on this role. The other actors also perform well (Samuel L. Jackson for example). I think you will not get bored at this movie, it's 3D, the animals depicted in this movie are well made, and the environments too (if they are not real, I don't know). Well, the movie is very nice, maybe you will like it too. The 3D is also good, I don't have anything to say, I'm not that good at reviews, but I tell again that you will like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen most of the Tarzan movies from the days of Johnny Weissmuller, and then more recently Jungle Book, I would have normally avoided this movie. But thanx to IMDb, who gave it a 6.9, and then some of my fellow reviewers gave it 8 and a 9, I was not disappointed at all, and gave it a 7 myself. The missing 3 points are because Jungle Book had superior spell bounding cinematography ( not that this one is too bad ) The casting is very good, except for Sam Jackson, who somehow does not fit into the role. The main characters do a good job of their roles, though Tarzan is a bit wooden faced.Jane has done very well, and the African casting is superb. The only way to see this it on IMAX 3D.</fullReview>

This movie doesn't follow the typical Tarzan story we see in its Disney movie predecessor, instead it takes place several years after Tarzan (John Clayton- interesting surname yes?) leaves the jungle for a posh little life in England and is forced to return to his roots. What follows is a wonderful spectacle, I mean the effects in this movie are out of this world and I take my hat off to all that worked on it!

		<fullReview>Another film about Tarzan but this time with a bigger budget, The Legend of Tarzan is about the feral man who was raised in the jungles of Congo and has now returned to stop the Belgians from starting a war and taking over the country. Straight up, this is a depressing dark take on the Tarzan story...I'm talking moody, death, animal death and more death. That aside however, I thoroughly enjoyed this film (I am a sucker for darker films). The majority of the cast were good with Samuel L Jackson and Christoph Waltz being exceptional to Alexander Skarsgard being...meh, he does the job fine. A much needed comic relief from Jackson's character, the script is nothing spectacular. The real shining star is the cinematography, it's superb. Lush jungle landscapes to the urban town of Boma, director David Yates knows that this is a film to showcase the visual talent of Henry Braham (who is working on 2 new upcoming Marvel films, so keep an eye out). The CGI can be noticeable at times but it's not enough to take you out of the film, and the film tries to pull your emotional strings but does not work all the time. Overall, this is a solid blockbuster and a much darker tale of Tarzan that tries to be too emotive but cannot necessarily reach those heights. - Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the best, but better than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one Tarzan and he is Johnny Weissmuller, introduced to the world in 1932 in "Tarzan the Ape Man", the first of 12 films to star Weissmuller. He wasn't the first (Elmo Lincoln had the distinction in 1918), nor was he the only Tarzan during his reign from 1932 to 1948 (Buster Crabbe played him in a 12 part series called "Tarzan the Fearless" and Bruce Bennett did the same in 1937 under the title "The New Adventures of Tarzan"), but he is the most memorable. Lex Barker succeeded him in 1949 to 1953 with 5 films and Gordon Scott followed Baxter from 1955 to 1960 with 6 films, and the most memorable performance among his competitors was Christopher Lambert in "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes" (1984).The latest addition is "The Legend of Tarzan". It follows the same basic story line first offered in the Edgar Rice Burroughs series that started in 1912 as "Tarzan of the Apes", although there are some differences after the first half hour, and the current film is more like the 1932 film than the original novel and differs somewhat from even that film. It's an ambitious re-write of a familiar tale, and not quite successful.Alexander Skarsgard plays the new Tarzan, and he is certainly the most physically imposing of the Tarzans, even if he does lack the charm of Weissmuller or the intrigue of Lambert. None of the other characters match the level of the previous supporting players.If you're looking for a Tarzan film, watch the 1932 version or the 1984 version. This one isn't bad, but it doesn't match the quality of those two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan 2016 Director: David Yates Writers: Adam Cozad, Craig Brewer Stars: Alexander Skarsgard, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbit Genre: Action/AdventureThere having been a few Tarzan movies before which I don't rate that highly so had reservations but the latest reincarnation but I had a feeling it would be quite good ? it was actually.The story starts with Tarzan having left the jungle and settled into a life of aristocracy, happily married to Jane and living in their mansion.Events in the Congo entice him back to the jungle where a trap awaits.There are a few flash backs to the origins of Tarzan, as a baby, boy, man growing up in the jungle nurtured by surrogate gorilla mother etc, but the origin story is not given that much time instead focusing mainly on the current story, this is a good thing.Alexandra Skarsgard plays a good Tarzan, physically he is a giant well matched but also plays the character well, surprising with some subtlety at times.Christoph Waltz as per usual plays a good villain, I was dubious about Samuel L. Jackson being in it but he was OK too.Film got a bit flat in the middle but got going again building to an exciting climax with lots of good action sequences, CGI of the Animals etc.. good stuff.Thoroughly enjoyed the film so 7 out of ten chappers points for this little gem.</fullReview>

The interesting take on the movie taking place after Tarzan had left the jungle was so intriguing and the movie had powerful messages beyond the romance and swinging through the trees.

		<fullReview>This could have been a silent film, without any dialogue in it whatsoever, and it still would've delivered on an emotional level. David Yates really knows to shoot and cut a film, and I was very moved throughout, whether it'd be from a scene of Tarzan reuniting with his furry friends, or his interactions with Jane, which I thought were really passionate. The chemistry between Skarsgaard and Robbie was excellent, and I felt like they were really this legendary couple that had been together for over a century now.Having read only the first of the Burroughs books, I was very pleased with this film. I've seen the Tarzan cartoons and loved them all, but this film really made Tarzan come off as the superhero that he is. In a sense, the very first superhero. His super-powers aren't really given to him by some freak mutation or a divine intervention. No, his powers are very human, and I wondered if the human body's senses can be heightened if one were to be born and raised in raw nature. The relationship between Tarzan and the animals is astounding to watch. And as uncanny as it seemed, I myself would like to think that is very possible. I wasn't impressed by Tarzan's physical prowess however, probably because the action scenes were badly shot. A lot of quick cuts here, no stunt doubles either. I loved the CGI shots whenever we'd see Tarzan swinging from tree to tree, but that's as amazing as things get. The real wonderment comes from Tarzan's ability to communicate with the jungle, and its inhabitants. The visuals in this film are astounding, and I was so impressed not only by the CGI but the set design too.Now a hero wouldn't amount to much if he didn't have a good villain to go toe to toe with. Christopher Waltz was excellent as "Rom," a greedy man tasked with kidnapping Tarzan for a bounty. I found myself really growing a distaste for this character as the film went on, and kudos to the writers for it. I also loved the name (pronounced "Rome") and its clear that this was in homage to the villain's representation of modern technology, and modern government. And that's what this movie is about. A clash of two worlds. A visual take on the human inner conflict, as we balance our lives around the natural world and the man-made one.I can't say enough about this film. It's very moving and there will be tears. Happy tears more than anything. I recommend it, but not for children. The violence was high. 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never read the original Tarzan books, and I'm not sure how close to the character in the books this movie, I've watched the one with Christopher Lambert, and I really liked it. What to say about this version, it never tries to be annoyingly over the top like The Lone Ranger(2013). It starts out a little slow, but does pick up has it goes along.Alexander Skarsgard does okay with what he is giving, looks less like Tarzan, instead looking more like he should be playing He-Man. There are spots they make Tarzan come across like a superhero, now I'm willing to suspend a serious of disbelief, but that is just pushing it a bit. Samuel L. Jackson does bring charisma to his part, if not it would have been boring. Christoph Waltz is alright, but I was expecting more menacing like he known for playing, but still not terrible. Margot Robbie is pretty memorable has Jane, not playing her helpless, but tough and fearless. Action scenes are pretty good, there overuse of CGI. But still an enjoyable film to pass the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of The Legend of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not an expert on the story of Tarzan, but here's what I picked up from a midday screening of 2016's latest re-imagining: John Clayton III (that's the actual name of the main character) grew up in Gabon, a country in Equatorial Africa. After his father died, he was raised by Apes, learned to swing on vines, be one with all sorts of animals, and befriend his true love, Jane Porter. Now as he lives a quiet life in London, he is summoned back to his homeland by a former American Civil War soldier. The mission: To investigate the interests of a mining camp in the Congo. Oh and did I mention there's some evil dude out there doing a little diamond smuggling as well?Bottom line: The Legend of Tarzan is a passable yet unmemorable viewing experience. Call it a second-tier Raiders of the Lost Ark manufactured for the Disney age. Here's what you get acting-wise: Christoph Waltz gives us his standard, antagonistic performance (with strangling wrist beads as a wubby). Lead Alexander Skarsgard looks like a young Viggo Mortensen but lacks any real charisma. Samuel L. Jackson being Samuel L. Jackson, provides satire as a goofy sidekick with a gun. Finally, romantic interest Margot Robbie continues to disappoint after being so brilliant in The Wolf of Wall Street (her Jane narrates poorly and sort of thinks she's in a comedy). Yeah it's all packaged in 2016's gaudiest summer epic.Now from what I've gathered, "Legend" is far more symbolic and dramatically inclined than 1981's Tarzan, the Ape Man. It's also probably more modernized and digitally enhanced than Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. Don't be fooled though. At just under two hours, this is a loud movie that is full of dangled, random flashbacks that almost deflate any perceptible momentum (Tarzan losing his daddy because Apes beat him to death, Tarzan learning to speak and communicate, Tarzan meeting Jane for the first time, etc.). Director David Yates who was in charge of the later Harry Potter flicks, employs a large canvas with his camera moving fast and forthright. To go along with Henry Braham's lush cinematography, he adds lots of extras in every frame, riverboat scenes that would make Francis Ford Coppola jealous, images of CGI wildlife that bring forth a Noah's Ark-like vision, and pedestrian action sequences that have some unnecessary slow motion to boot (John Clayton fights slave drivers, tribesmen, and just about everybody else here).Overall, this is a great looking film that was obviously designed for the big screen and/or widescreen. However, it has a handsome yet muted Tarzan that is difficult to root for. Just because the musical score pounces in every time he's about to dispose of cardboard villains, doesn't mean his actions are worth memorializing. The same notions apply when he's about to kiss the girl, about to beat his chest with an infamous mating call, and about to become the hero. Rating: 2 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film started out feeling like a trip to Skull Island, then the film drug on and on, and then the predictable ending had morphed into Planet of the Apes with a dash of Indiana Jones. Alexander Skargard gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money in terms of "cardboard acting." This is 110 minutes I'll never get back. The positive/glowing reviews have to be fake/paid for. Notice the disparity between the critical reviews and the user reviews. Something is awry! Also, as for the other actors, Christoph Waltz is slightly more human while Margo Robbie does the best overall. Samuel L Jackson's portrayal is apparently supposed to be the comic relief portion, but I kept wondering why his character is so "out there." I will not be watching again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Tarzan Less Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Tarzan. What a great concept and story to tell and share. This latest version however is too modern, hip and leaves out the spirit of Tarzan or the core if you will. First off, going back to the jungle after so many years to me is waiting too long for a story to pick-up. Think habits and how we adapt from one thing to another. When one stops swinging around and spends more time sitting in meetings, that is their new life. Furthermore, I would have expected a stronger more meaty Tarzan as only the survival of the fittest can last and rule especially in the Jungle. For a guy who swings, runs, jumps, grabs and wrestles, you would expect a muscle group to reflect that. I see it as heavy upper build with big thighs myself. If he is imitating apes and how they live etc., then he would have their strength too yes? Hey, the law of the jungle prevails! Anything that can survive has to make a guaranteed first impression or they get eaten. No second chances. If he was Lord of the Apes, that didn't come through here via his strength but good looks? LOL Jane is too hip and masculine oh well. Starting with her, everything in this movie is presented as larger than life instead of just life. That's where it fails and one has to except the premise and memories of Tarzan instead of what is portrayed here to really enjoy the Tarzan tale. I have read the many tales of all the Tarzan adventures and they had detail, revelation and adventure in every one. They did bog down in book form a bit once the main subjects were covered but when presented in movie form, made for a nice adventure in the day in the life of Tarzan, Jane, Cheetah and the latest happenings in the Jungle. For entertainment, subject matter and going to the movies sake, this works and you can eat your popcorn, have your drink and be content in it. However, it works just fine on cable too. No memorable scenes makes it a movie that you don't see twice. So be it. Enjoy</fullReview>

I thought it was incredible how real every animal scene was - will have to find out how they did this. The story was just fantastic. The scenery was spectacular - to me a must-see on the big screen. This Tarzan version was the best one I've ever seen (think I've seen them all) and apparently very true to the original story (nope - never read it - will now). It was captivating. The actors were excellent. I was completely enthralled and at the end - I didn't want it to be over. It reminded me of the thrill of the good old days of going to the Saturday afternoon movies growing up (I know - most of you will never know the fun of the simpler times :-). I was easily impressed then - not so much so today - with so MANY incredible movies. Tarzan is action-packed and REALLY entertaining. I had to go right home and tell family and friends to go see it before it is out of theaters! I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too harsh critics, action-packed movie with great actors and cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the "professional" critics are too harsh on a film made also with children in mind. I'm glad most users disagree and this is the reason why I no longer care to check anything but regular movie goer reviews before I see a movie. If they care about what we want, then there wouldn't be such disparity in opinions between them and us. On to the movie, the only thing I wanted to see more were flashbacks with Tarzan and his "friends." The movie was action- packed, has great actors and simple plot line. Not a dull moment, the movie went by very quickly, I didn't want it to end so soon. Legend of Tarzan 2, more flashbacks with animals, villain more villainous and more contact with Tarzan not Jane, and I guess a bit better CGI for the perfectionists out there. Go see the movie especially if you have kids, they'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Okay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzen is a movie that I was kinda looking forward to, I mean it's directed by David Yates the same guy who did the second half of the Harry Potter films and there aren't many mature adaptations of Tarzan. First and foremost, this movie is by no means a bad movie, it's just not a great one. I'm going to list the pros and cons as follows.Pros. Samaul L Jackson was hilarious and EASILY the best part about the movie. Margot Robbie is good and INSANELY hot. It had a nice adventure feel and the action scenes where overall enjoyable.Cons. THE SGI SUCKED! It was REALLY bad and used EVERYWHERE! There's one shot showing Tarzan swinging on a train and it was laughable. Alexander Skargaurd was okay as Tarzan he was just kinda stiff and boring. The music was forgettable. The story was kinda mediocre, not bad, but not that good. Christophe Waltz was fine as the main villain, he was by no means bad, but he just wasn't that memorable or entertaining. Honestly the only two movies that he does really well in, is Inglorious Basterds and Django. Also the movie has these weird slow-motion shots that were just awkward and laughable. And the CGI WAS SOOOO BADDD!!!!Overall it's not Horrible, it's entertaining enough to make it possible to deal with the CGI and the occasional stiff line delivered by Alexander. The main reason why I think you can go and see this movie and still have some fun is because of Samaul L Jackson, he's the only part of the movie that I genuinely loved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected the worst, was oh so wrong!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was dubious about this movie before I went to see it. However, I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie was made.The director, David Yates (of Harry Potter fame), was exceptional in bringing out the best in the main actors. It was refreshing to see all of the main characters have a clearly defined, logical motive and no obvious reliance on Deus Ex Machina.There is a subtlety to most of the characters that was refreshing to see. Margot Robbie (Jane) proved herself without hyper violence and without bragging about intellectual achievements. Robbie's character defined herself by her actions and her conviction, superbly. Strong and supple. Christoph Walz was nasty and cunning, giving reasonable depth and credibility to the main antagonist. Skarsgard (Tarzan) wanted to be left alone, providing the audience with a reluctant hero. The director was masterful at playing the characters in tune with each other in a refreshing, seamless and meaningful way.The story certainly has fantasy elements, including jumping off cliffs and surviving. However, what stood out was that every character was believable in their behaviour and decisions. I suspect David Yates gave Margot Robbie (Jane) an opportunity to do a "Black Widow". Robbie, wisely, decided to stick to reality and show strength through wit and perseverance. This is something lacking in many other films: recognising that strength does not come from hyper aggression.There is good humour around Tarzan belonging in Africa more than Sam Jackson. A few of the gags were superbly executed and they came across naturally and reflective of what you would expect in real-life situations.I do hope to see more movies with characters behaving seamlessly, like this one. It's a shame that it has fared so badly at the box office. It's rare I am at odds with many reviewers, however, in this instance, I was. By constrast, I rated the movie highly, but, it absolutely deserved it. 2016 has been a great year for movies. This is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terriable terriable movie in this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be my first heart filled with anger after watching the movie, my ignorance, and characterization of the director can question extremely high force, the movie theme, characters of embarrassing, logic bugs, I shout out just one point in the cinema the words "the first big movies of the year".1, say first structure problem This is probably the most don't speak of the structure of the films I have ever seen, its loose structure, slow rhythm let me almost collapse. Don't mean North America is the attitude of the world? All kinds of characters have attitude does the movie? I don't speak Thai mountain, just hate, since the beginning of the film is a negative character, Samuel Jackson said outside the carriage under him I would be angry, when god, crazy, character is such a change? Say good let it go, say good return home? Then there is the kiss up to the tree? Say good rhythm? Character attitude shift means to enter the second act, so that what the devil's kiss up tree? Is that a debate!!!!!! The first act is not complete in the second act, I can't imagine how to allow such writers and Hollywood director? Back again, such as needles, taishan shift and room? His character confusion in where? Structure didn't understand that in the main line is not clear, people power is almost a joke, all the action is not based on mount tai and attitude changes is the plot. External insufficient internal impetus plot drive is bound to lead to character.2, besides the characters Mount tai is a pair of sleepy right from the start, this is taboo, the character of the negative and the most terrible is good bollywood director opening for not offering a simple task in mount taishan, flow no show of life, save the cat scene is missing, mount tai is less likable. The whole scene one tends to hold onto taishan emotional protection shell, absolutely wrong. "Little shoes" in the hero's opening is what? Is the flow of life, it is him to feed the ostrich, the results bear children had an accident. This is called the opening story, this call character build. Then talk about the action behind the mount tai, in a word, no enthusiasm, why? Because the theme confusion leads to people running out of steam. Mount tai is why go to the jungle? Why do you want to go to Congo? Samuel convince him immediately? Why is that? Mount tai is really care about what? Writer and director really figure it out? The character of Jane is dispensable. Just setting are needed, inner attitude does not need, I even said that the enemy Just grabbed tribal friend of mount tai, mount tai will go to save lives.3, and finally talk about the topic We all want to express the theme of the clear director, but, I'm sorry, I'm absolutely not. The expression of theme was sent into ecstasy, don't give a damn what the audience watching. Theme must come from details, rather than from a great thing. "Schindler's list" Della's goal is to save more people, not to stop the war. People sex in the real exquisite plot magnify hundreds of times, to liberate slaves than great Della. Think about an impending theme, but have nothing. Tai shan will not shoulder the mission of emancipation, he this character set is doomed the character he is not going to be, that is the President of the United States do. Besides small theme, taishan body carries small subject too much, too much confusion, are you want to let go of the past, or going to do? Mount tai in the end what get? We say that the end of the story determines the quality of the story. At the end of a story, the story just like animation childish, I didn't see taishan any growth! This is very terrible, it's mocking at the audience. The audience never know taishan why want to return to the jungle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Tarzan adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is surprisingly good new version of old classic. With good actors it is easy to forgive some flaws of the story. Adventure is entertaining and scenery is beautiful and quite emotional too. Tarzan and animals reunion is beautiful and very emotional. Movies length feels just right for all the action. Aerial scenery from Africa is spectacle and beautiful. If you want to find something bad to say about this movie it is it's thin story and jungle scenes. Jungle just somehow don't feel very realistic, even the animals has animated greatly. Legend of Tarzan is fine salute to old classic Tarzan movies. Age of era is greatly set. Alexander Skarsg?rd is a good choice as Tarzan, even better than original Weissmuller was. Despite clear flaws in the story, the action, scenery and beautifully animated animals makes this movie very enjoyable. Finnkinos new SCAPE concept brings the story beautifully to screen. Picture is very sharp and 3D looks realistic. Dolby Atmos sound system brings jungles voices stunningly to audience. This movie is absolutely best to watch from big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edgar would approve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent if slightly over-CGIed production on the most famous of the Edgar Rice Burroughs heroes. In this one Tarzan is not the mono-syllabic brute of the Weissmuller era but the same character as portrayed by Burroughs. And the story itself (absent the Samuel Jackson character) is something very much like what Burroughs would have done in one of his many Tarzan books. The actor playing Tarzan does a quiet if nice job, Robbie is a tad too model-ly for Jane but otherwise does well also. Jackson has been type-cast for some time now but his character was mildly appreciated. Everyone works pretty well together, the nobility of the Waziri warriors is played out very effectively. And Christoph Waltz plays the mannerly Satan better than anyone on the planet. Some parts move a little slowly but it works. Well written, well-paced, about the right time length, a very well-constructed and enjoyable movie, my 11 year old gave it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top-Notch Tarzan Tale!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan movies were once a Hollywood staple between the 1930s and the 1960s. Actually, Hollywood had been producing Tarzan movies during the silent film era as early as 1918. During the sound era, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer inaugurated the first cinematic "Tarzan" franchise when the studio cast Olympic Gold Medal swimmer Johnny Weissmuller as the Lord of the Jungle in 1932. Weissmuller toplined twelve Tarzan films for MGM and RKO. Meantime, Tarzan novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs abhorred Hollywood's adaptation of his literary sensation, primarily because Tinseltown portrayed Tarzan as a primitive savage who spoke in broken English. Eventually, Burroughs produced his own Tarzan serial "The New Adventures of Tarzan" (1935) with Bruce Bennett. Bennett shared more in common with Burroughs' literary troubleshooter. Not only did he speak in clear, unbroken English, but also he donned a dinner jacket in some scenes! Nevertheless, most moviegoers preferred Weissmuller, and later Tarzans imitated Weissmuller until Las Vegas lifeguard Gordon Scott started uttering complete sentences in "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" (1959) and "Tarzan the Magnificent" (1960). Cowboy stunt man Jock Mahoney inherited the role from Scott and spoke in complete sentences, too. When former NFL football player Mike Henry took over the role in "Tarzan and the Valley of Gold" (1966), movie audiences saw Henry's Tarzan decked out in a suit and tie as well as toting a briefcase. After the short-lived "Tarzan" television show with Ron Ely on NBC-TV, Edgar Rice Burroughs' outdoor adventurer appeared in fewer movies, and those movies were mediocre. French actor Christopher Lambert played Tarzan in the last great Tarzan film "Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan" (1984), but the well-made film?that Burroughs would have applauded-- didn't generate enough interest to fuel a franchise. Walt Disney reverted to the MGM Weissmuller template and scored a huge hit with their animated "Tarzan" (1999) and a straight-to-video sequel "Tarzan &amp; Jane" ensued in 2002. More short-term television series and films followed, but the character lacked tenacity. "Harry Potter" director David Yates may succeed where everybody else has failed with "The Legend of Tarzan," starring Alexander Skarsg?rd, Christoph Waltz, Margot Robbie, and Samuel L. Jackson. Not only would Burroughs approve of Skarsg?rd's Tarzan, but also "The Legend of Tarzan" is a genuinely exciting, often suspenseful, and ultimately satisfying epic adventure that venerates its literary origins."The Legend of Tarzan" takes place in 1890, several years after the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference when Great Britain and Belgium split up the Congo between themselves and established European settlement and commerce in Africa. Surprisingly, this is one of the few Tarzan movies that appropriates factual history, and Belgium King Leopold II did indeed dispatch an envoy to the Congo. Léon Rom (Oscar winning actor Christoph Waltz of "Inglourious Basterds") is the fictional envoy in Yates' film, and Rom has embarked on an ambitious scheme to obtain the fabulous diamonds of Opar to finance Leopold's dream of equipping an army to enslave the natives of the Congo. Unfortunately, Leopold is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy because he has spent a fortune to build a railroad and forts for an army he cannot afford to pay. Rom plans to acquire the diamonds from native tribal Chief Mbonga (twice-Oscar nominated actor Djimon Hounsou of "Blood Diamond") so Leopold doesn't lose his foothold on the Dark Continent. Mbonga is both willing and eager to hand over an untold wealth in gems if Rom can convince Tarzan to come back to the Congo. As it turns out, Tarzan killed Mbonga's son during a hunting trip after Mbonga's son slew Tarzan's ape mother. Since this tragic incident, Tarzan has returned to England and inherited not only his late father's estate as John Clayton, but also his title as the Earl of Greystoke, a member of the House of Lords. The treacherous Rom invites Africa's favorite son back to the Congo for a tour of the new railway and other infrastructure constructed by King Leopold to usher civilization into the depths of the Dark Continent. Moreover, the British Prime Minister (Oscar winner Jim Broadbent of "Iris") implores Lord Clayton to go as does an American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson of "Pulp Fiction"), who wants to accompany him on the tour. Initially, Lord Clayton refuses to accommodate the Prime Minister, but Williams convinces him to accept Rom's offer. Williams trusts neither the Belgium monarch nor Rom; he believes that this deceitful, imperialist pair plan to enslave the natives. Naturally, when Lord Clayton's wife Jane (Margot Robbie of "Focus") learns about her husband's impending trip to Africa, she decides to join him against his will. No sooner have the couple and Williams arrived than the dastardly Rom and a murderous army of mercenaries attack the village where Tarzan met Jane. They take Tarzan and many natives as hostages. Williams helps Tarzan escape, but Rom abducts Jane. He uses her to lure Tarzan into a trap so that Mbonga can kill Tarzan for his son's death.Unlike previous "Tarzan" movies, "True Blood's" Alexander Skarsg?rd shuns the traditional loincloth. Instead, John Clayton retains his European apparel and eventually sheds everything but his breeches. In this respect, he resembles the Incredible Hulk more than Burroughs' protagonist. Aside from this departure, "The Legend of Tarzan" remains largely faithful to the literary character and his heritage. Meanwhile, Yates and scenarists Adam Cozad of "Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit" and Craig Brewer of "Black Snake Moan" don't exploit the African tribal characters for comic relief. Although she is abducted by Rom, Jane Clayton doesn't behave like the conventional, lily-livered, damsel-in-distress, and she displays contempt for Rom because he expects her to act like one. The CGI of the great apes is truly spectacular. Happily, Yates didn't resort to men in monkey suits. Visually, the scenery is as gorgeous as the cinematography is impressive. The explosive showdown between Tarzan and Rom is comparable to a James Bond extravaganza. Anybody who loves Edgar Rice Burroughs and his immortal hero should swing in to watch "The Legend of Tarzan."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best Tarzan movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To put it simply - the Legend of Tarzan is a magnificent movie and for me the best Tarzan movie ever! I would not trust the negative critics with this one ? they were so overly harsh with this movie. The cinematography, visuals and set design are breathtaking: lush jungle canopies, amazing shades and light in the flashbacks, rivers and waterfalls, dark Congo rain forests contrasted with warm savanna colours...I can forgive one or two dodgy CGI scenes because the movie in its entirety is so overwhelming. I read that real landscape shots were made in Gabon ? what an amazing scenery in this country!The score is so beautiful, dramatic (Hozier's song Better Love is great)...and that haunting tribal song in the opening scene... It was a good idea to have historical setting which includes the Belgian King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo. It brought attention to the atrocities committed against the native people in colonial Congo ? the issue which in real life was raised by George W. Williams, African-American human rights activist, also one of the characters in the movie (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson).This Tarzan is a strong, silent, brooding, conflicted type who has subdued sense of humour and Skarsgard conveys it perfectly... He possesses the necessary physique, subtlety, wildness, sensitivity and sadness ... I liked Tarzan idiosyncrasies. Not overdone to the extent which would render it ridiculous or caricature-like: ....little grunt he gives off in the carriage.....the scene with the lions he has known since they were cubs, which was beautiful and done with a measure....the scene with the children who are amazed by his hands... and humour when he teases Williams after the near b...licking scene...Tarzan in this movie is also portrayed as being somewhat rusty after spending 8 years in comfortable life of an English lord (let's just say I was occasionally not impressed by his physical prowess&#xf04a;). His ability to communicate with the animals is one of the best parts of the movie. And that Tarzan yell is awesome!I am sure animal-lovers will love this movie (especially since no real animal was used in the movie). Tarzan's ape family (and other animals) look amazing.Although Jane and Tarzan are separated quite early in the movie, their interaction and chemistry is genuine and the actors successfully portray them as a couple who has been married for 8 years.... The love story and romance are entwined throughout the movie. I liked Robbie as a spitfire, feisty Jane. She is excellent! Good idea to have Jane growing up in Africa as well. It makes the bond she shares with Tarzan even more believable (in addition to off the charts chemistry between the characters).Djimon Hounsou (of Amistad, Blood Diamond, Guardians of the Galaxy, Constantine etc.) is simply brilliant. He has only few scenes, but he makes quite an impression as Chief Mbonga who seeks vengeance. Shame he didn't get a bigger part.I watched Weismuller's Tarzan as a child and his monosyllabic banter may have been amusing and charming, but it did no justice to the character in ERB's books. Until the Legend of Tarzan, I thought that 1984 Greystoke was the best Tarzan ever. Now, he is officially dethroned by the Legend of Tarzan. My family genuinely enjoyed this wonderful piece of old-school action/adventure/romance film-making. One of the best action films I have seen the whole year so far. This is a movie whose heart is in the right place and has some beautiful messages. I warmly recommend it!</fullReview>

He had already seen it with another friend, and didn't mind seeing it again, in 3D this time. The cast was excellent, the scenery beautiful, and the animals very realistic. Action scenes were awesome, with A.S. holding up his end quite well indeed. If you go in suspending disbelief, you can easily be caught up in the story, no matter how much you know or don't know about the original story. All the actors were great, believable, and I even teared up a few times in the dramatic scenes. You must have a taste for fantasy, or don't bother to see it. If you DO have a taste for fantasy, you might just enjoy the ride. I hope there's a sequel, though I know A.S. suffered greatly for that 6-pack (which was almost reason enough to see the movie)...it could happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legendary Take on Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is directed by David Yates, who many people know as the director of the best Harry Potter films. It is a more adult take on the story of the king of the jungle. In this film, Tarzan, who goes by John (Alexander Skarsg?rd) , has already been domesticated and has taken his royal place in Britain in the late 19th century. When George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a gunslinger and civil war veteran comes to ask Tarzan for help because of a slavery problem that may be happening in the Congo over some diamonds, Tarzan must go back. Jane (Margot Robbie) comes along but she, along with some African people she calls family, is kidnapped by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz). Now Tarzan must reconnect with his jungle roots in order to save his wife, and the Congo itself. This movie is really great. It's fun and exciting, and an interesting take on Tarzan's story. It was a risky move to not do the story of his origin (except through a few flashbacks), but rather tell a new story. It was almost like starting with a sequel. But it pays off really well. We understand who the character is and why he is the way he is, and that's enough. The acting is decent. Nothing spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a great comedic relief character and Christoph Waltz plays the same villain he's played in many movies before. Margot Robbie was an American Jane with a lot of moxie. It's always refreshing when a woman is not just in a movie top be a damsel in distress. And Alexander Skarsg?rd is the perfect Tarzan. He plays the sophisticated British and animalistic sides both pretty well. The direction of this movie is great as well. David Yates really has done such a great job. The CGI in this movie is pretty great as well. For the most part the animals ate pretty fantastic, though there are moments where they could be better done. All in all, I loved this film. I'd give it a 9.</fullReview>

Then the news broke that it's performing better than expected in North America where people seemed to trash those negative critics giving it a solid A-. So I went happily for the movie. From the very Warner Bros emblem to the very last scene- just loved!It certainly has David Yates's Harry Potter magic. Taking the character Tarzan to a whole new level. Telling a new original story with effective flashbacks. Loved the slow pace and tone of the movie. Alexander is the perfect Tarzan- a very controlled performance and a totally insane body. Margot is sweet and powerful Jane. Can't wait for her performance in Suicide Squad. She's one actress to watch out for. And Samuel Jackson can never go wrong. He's fantastic. Background score needs a special mention. CGI and 3D effective. It has an absolutely terrific ending. I'm going to watch this movie again. Get totally lost in that beautiful world!

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, The Legend of Tarzan, for me, was a movie that I did not understand why was made. Nobody was really looking for someone to reboot this movie and it kind of came out of nowhere. And that shows in the movie. First off, the storytelling is very confusing. Tarzan's backstory is spliced in with the present so it goes back and forth between past and present. If you have seen the original movie you probably won't have that many problems but there are some questions being raised because they change the story a little bit in The Legend of Tarzan. I personally felt that they should have made Tarzan's childhood in one scene or a couple scenes in the beginning of the movie and then continue with the story. That may have made the story a little bit easier and better to watch. Also I felt as though Samuel L. Jackson's character was there for no reason. He didn't bring anything else to the story and he was just there. He didn't really do anything substantial and whenever he was on screen I always felt he was wasting space. I did not hate him though. He wasn't all bad and I felt he added some comic relief but I did not understand why he needed to be in the movie. On the other hand Tarzan and Jane were cast very well, Tarzan more than Jane. Margot Robbie was okay as Jane, I felt like she could have done better but Alexander Skarsg?rd was a very good fit for Tarzan. I think he looked the part and he played the part very well but the story just wasn't told very well to showcase that. Also the CGI was better than I expected. There were some scenes where it was very lackluster but besides that I felt as though the work they did with CGI was very good. In my opinion I would wait for the Legend of Tarzan to come to DVD. I would not go to see it in the theaters because it was not that bad but at the same time it was not that interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tarzan' is a talky and under-adrenalized reboot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Author Edgar Rice Burroughs' most famous character, Tarzan of the Apes, has re-emerged on movie screens, this time at the hands of "Harry Potter" helmer David Yates. As promising as that might sound, hold the applause. "The Legend of Tarzan" is a disappointing and under-adrenalized excuse for an action/adventure movie.Tarzan has been living the life of an English lord at his ancestral home with Jane for a decade when the movie opens, turning down an entreaty from government bigwigs to return to Africa to accept an invitation from King Leopold of Belgium to see how well his colony in the Congo is going. Samuel L. Jackson, as Dr. George Washington Williams, is on hand representing the United States government, and has his own reasons for wanting Tarzan to accept the invitation. We know he's going to say yes. A Tarzan movie set entirely in London wouldn't be much of a Tarzan movie, after all. There's skullduggery afoot though, and no sooner have the current Lord and Lady Greystoke set foot on African soil again, Jane is kidnapped, and Tarzan has to swing through the dense jungles to find her, all the while being led into a trap.Africa has been a staple of Hollywood movies since "Trader Horn," and author Edgar Rice Burroughs' enduring pulp hero Tarzan has been a perennial movie hero since before movies could talk. "The Legend of Tarzan," frequently seems to do nothing but talk, and that's not necessarily a good thing with a Tarzan movie. It's not that anyone is asking for a return to the days of Johnny Weismuller and "Me Tarzan, you Jane" (and yes, that's a real line, not one of those "did he really say that" lines). In Burroughs' novels, Tarzan is multilingual and articulate. That's not the same thing as needless speechifying.To be fair, Tarzan doesn't get the longest speeches in "The Legend of Tarzan," but the fact remains that this is an oddly talky and slow-paced affair for a Tarzan movie. Blame the screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, which though "based" (to use the word loosely) on the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs is largely an original script with some Burroughs origin story awkwardly inserted as flashbacks. It bears noting that Burroughs' original 1912 novel has never been adapted faithfully, although it's virtually never been out of print. Not only is the script too talky, but much of the talk is clunky and anachronistic. Although the story takes place in the 1880's, you'd never know it from the all-too contemporary- sounding dialogue.The worst offender is the character of Jane, played by an engaging Margot Robbie, who, as in the novels, is portrayed as American, but hardly an American woman of the Victorian age. This Jane is thoroughly modern, but that's neither convincing nor terribly entertaining. It might also be noted that her backstory has been heavily overhauled by Cozad and Brewer, and not for the better. (Jane in the novels did not grow up in Africa, for one thing.)Alexander Skarsg?rd plays a kinder, gentler Tarzan, but it's an open question as to whether that approach is actually a good idea.Skarsg?rd looks the part well enough, though he isn't quite the godlike creature of the books. Yates takes a nearly homoerotic delight in displaying Skarsg?rd's well-sculpted physique, which looks more like the result of hundreds of sado-masochistic hours in the gym than being raised in the jungle by apes, but this is a sensitive Tarzan, moved to near tears by looking into the eyes of a CGI elephant. It's not quite possible to reconcile this Tarzan with the boy who was beaten nearly to death by a great ape - a flashback lifted, if sanitized, from Burroughs' original novel. And although Skarsg?rd clearly gets that Tarzan is a man with a foot in two worlds, but not quite belonging in either, he fails to find the exuberance in Burroughs' story, and the result is a little too depressing to be fun.Yates fails to infuse the movie with any real sense of adventure, and there's shockingly little momentum. And from a "Harry Potter" director, it's also shocking to see the mediocre quality of technical craftsmanship exhibited here. The photography is bland and unimaginative; the special effects are sub-par. One CGI critter after another parades by, each less convincing than the last. The fleet of ships that provide a major element in the movie's third act are singularly fake-looking, and it might be noted that the season finale of "Game of Thrones" pulled off a similar effect better with less money.The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Christoph Waltz, Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, James Broadbent and Simon Russell Beale (Showtime's "Penny Dreadful"). Waltz is particularly disappointing, turning in yet another stock B movie villain performance, completely devoid of menace, charm, or interest. Waltz has won two well- deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscars for Quentin Tarantino movies, but no one else seems to be able to get anything even remotely interesting out of him. As for Jackson, he's playing a Tarantino type here, although it's very difficult to reconcile the character with the Victorian age or anything going on in the story. At least he's fun to watch. Hounsou plays a menacing tribal chieftain with sincerity, but really doesn't have much to do. Beale, a dangerous scene-stealer, utterly upends Waltz in their few scenes together, and leaves the audience wishing he'd had more to do. To be fair, the 3D post-conversion is high quality, and does add some impact to both the action scenes and the vistas, both real and digital. The music score, by Rupert Gregson-Williams ("Hotel Rwanda," "Over the Hedge," "Grown Ups," "Here Comes the Boom") is a pale imitation of "The Lion King," which says a lot about the level of original thinking, or lack of it, permeating the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the best-made Tarzan movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film quite a bit, and I think it would be possible to argue that this one is the best-made Tarzan movie. Of course it's also worth saying that the competition for that status is not all that strong. According to the pros, this is the 49th Tarzan movie (James Bond eat your heart out - ) Going all the way back to the 1930's, there was a long series of Tarzans starring Johnny Weismuller, then another series with Lex Barker, then another with Gordon Scott (a couple of which I saw as a kid and enjoyed), then Mike Henry, and then some one-offs with various other guys that didn't lead anywhere, bringing us up to today. All of them starred broad-muscled hunks with limited acting ability, and by and large the early ones were just B-movie fare churned out by the studios to keep things busy and bring in profits. Then of course there were a few attempts at TV series mostly aimed at kids and that have mostly sunk without a trace.This new one is bigger-budget and more epic in tone. The production values are great and the experience is total fun. I'd say just ignore the trolls posting negative 'reviews' on this site -- I have no idea what their problem is. I thought it got a lot of things right. The biggest of all, which is the key to everything else, is that it's set in 1890, pretty close to the era that Edgar Rice Burroughs aimed at when he was writing all the books. Attempts in previous movies to 'modernize' Tarzan by putting him and Jane in a contemporary setting have just not worked. The whole concept is historical fantasy pure and simple. It belongs just where it was in Burroughs' imagination, when Africa was still The Dark Continent to the Victorians, with mystery and menace lurking in every jungle and river. It's got loads of stunning scenery of all kinds, and it's got all the classic tropes you'd expect: great apes (mangani) and crocodiles, acrobatic swinging from impossibly long vines, a wildebeest stampede, native tribes with their own agendas, sinister Euro villains bent on callous exploitation, and most importantly an attractive (both physique and personality) Tarzan/Jane pair at the center of the story. And (bonus!) it's got a single linear storyline that's actually coherent, somewhat unlike any recent superhero movie you might think of.This time around, instead of casting a muscleman and putting up with mediocre acting, they've taken the opposite approach: hire someone who knows how to act and then get him up to standards with some bodybuilding. It's also great to see Tarzan and Jane as a couple, because this is one of the classic pairs in Western culture. Alexander Skarsgaard and Margot Robbie make an appealing pair of leads and the script is moderately even-handed about following their own parts of the story. They look good, are more than competent in their roles, and Samuel Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, and Christof Waltz are first-rate in the big supporting roles. Skarsgaard does quite an interesting job of portraying a man who literally has two people inside him all the time: he's wholeheartedly Tarzan, the creature raised by apes, but simultaneously he's wholeheartedly John Clayton, cultured Englishman and Earl of Greystoke. In one instant he can throw himself right into an all-out savage fight with a mangani, and in the next instant he's coolly analyzing what just happened and gets right back to planning ahead.Happily, Jane is a lot more than just an ornament or plot device. My wife says the right way to put it is that Jane isn't objectified -- she's a real person. In fact she might be the realest person in the story. Margot Robbie's got a marvellously expressive face and luminous eyes, and her take on the part shows a solidly independent woman who loves her husband fiercely. Skarsgaard (btw whose voice startlingly resembles his father's) as Tarzan is a gentle and considerate man, typically taciturn, but his eyes don't miss the slightest thing going on around him. And you would think that one thing a sensible villain should know is NOT to get Tarzan angry, especially by kidnapping his wife. The native Africans that Jane and John grew up with are friendly warm people, and even the one tribe that has been tricked into helping the villain (Waltz) turns out to have an interesting backstory that ties in cleverly with the main plot. Of course there are issues -- after all the whole premise of Tarzan is nonsense (but no more so than, say, Batman). It would have been nice to have more of the script devoted to character depth (Waltz's character Leon Rom, for example, obviously has pretty deep-seated problem/obsessions that are just hinted at by a few lines). But hey, this is a fantasy romance. Enjoy a well-done ride with a classic character.</fullReview>

As long as Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie are in it again, bring on the second movie! Alexander WAS BEYOND FANTASTIC! We want a sequel to this movie franchise reboot!! I love the darkness and maturity this movie brings too. It's the closest movie towards the books! I'll be buying this on Blu-ray 100%. I love, love, love this movie! The director was fantastic! The cinematography was stunning! The cast was phenomenal!! The musical score was epic. This movie is the BEST Tarzan movie to date. Also, Tarzan is NOTHING like the Disney version... so people need to stop comparing it to that! This Tarzan movie is like the BOOKS, which is where Tarzan first came from. The Disney version is a water-down kid movie (but still fun!). This is the best Tarzan adaption in cinematic history and I want more from the cast, director, composer, etc. Keep the sequel just as epic as this movie, or make it even better than this movie!!! The quality and passion put into this movie is superb! Alexander deserves an Oscar for this role as Tarzan! He is one of the best actors to date!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best of all previous forays into the "Tarzan" legend. Supremely good characters and the acting is amazing, beyond belief. The hero is soft spoken until he needs to be otherwise, the heroine is perfectly played by Margot Robbie and the bad guy made my skin crawl. Cried at the end. The special effects were spot on and the entire story stays very true to the original Edgar Rice Burroughs story. The scenery is beautiful and I think that everyone who attends will take home good feelings about this movie.Young children may be overwhelmed by the intensity of the violence, but those over 13 would find this a really good adventure. The love story in entwined throughout but not overwhelming. An excellent movie for the entire family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good legend of Tarzan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Yates going from TV to Harry Potter to this, which reminds me of Jackson doing Lord of The Rings and then following with King Kong rebooting a classic story. However, this is far superior to King Kong on some many levels, especially being based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' Dark Horse Comic version of Tarzan. Being set in late Victorian times, it shares some awful truth on the atrocities the Congolese people suffered under the power of King Leopold II of Belgium, which includes the millions that died and were used for slavery. Making a film like this has a high risk of seriously going over the top and must have been a challenge to balance believability and a far fetched story. I feel they succeeded in bringing a new reality to Tarzan, personifying the animals extremely well without it going too far. Seeing all these viral videos about animal and human relationships, this film does make you think if it is possible for man to be respected that much within the animal kingdom. Stellan Skarsg?rd must be proud of the his son Alexander, portraying the title role which happens to be Stellan's hero and the reason Alexander eagerly took the role. I believe he was ideal for Tarzan, adopting the posture, right build and the graceful movement you would expect from a tree-swinger; it can't be easy to make a hulking man of 6ft 4" move so elegantly. I was a little worried about Samuel L. Jackson being in this movie, especially him being mostly absent from the trailers. But, he does good and the little comedy he brings isn't silly enough to stain the seriousness of the film. Christoph Waltz does what you would expect and plays the villain envoy, Leon Rom so well I actually believe he wants to be hated in real life. Margot Robbie plays Jane but not necessarily the damsel in distress some might expect. She's tough, knows her way around the jungle and is just as devoted to Tarzan's adopted family. It's a shame Djimon Hounson didn't get a bigger part, seeing what he's capable of in Blood Diamond he falls short or maybe easily overshadowed by Tarzan. The action is swift and brutal showing Tarzan's ability of being a human hero, having impressive physical strength and agility, he's the superhero without all the super, just natural, primitive aggression cased into a civilised nobleman. You're left in awe and at times you see the cast like Jackson, Waltz and Robbie looking stunned, they could almost be bloopers. Though being digitally stunning, there are some weak spots but what is breathtaking is the landscape scenery. Crews spent days filming over the Gabon National Park to capture the true beauty of the African continent and it really shows through, for which I'm glad for it not being all computer generated. There's plenty of out-of-focus close-ups during the dreamy flashbacks which add a welcome artiness to the film. It's beautifully shot and highly atmospheric especially adding the score of Harry's younger brother, Rupert Gregson-Williams which has become one of my favourite soundtracks of the year so far creating an authentic, tension-building and enchanting score. Great song from Hozier too, "Better Love" being the end credits track. I enjoyed this far more then expected, and I was expecting something from watching the trailers. It looks good in the trailers and it certainly entertained me. Sadly this marks Jerry Weintraub's last film being dedicated to him. The producer who cameo in all three Ocean's reboot as Danny Shields, Danny Ocean's Highroller friend who, on top of Ocean's 11, 12 and 13, produced all the Karate Kids. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 6 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 9 The Extra Bonus Point: 10 for the stunning real landscapes, beautiful scenery and for making me feel proud to be an animal lover. 84% 8/10</fullReview>

Stay well away.The concept behind the first R, reduce, is that you should limit the number of purchases that you make in the first place. So, for example, you might limit your household to a single computer. The concept behind the second R, reuse, is that you should reuse items as much as possible before replacing them. For example, it generally makes more environmental sense to update your computer rather than get rid of it and buy a new one. However, if you do replace your computer, you should ensure that it, or its components, are reused. Many charitable organizations welcome donations of second-hand computers. The concept behind the third R, recycle, is that you should ensure that items or their components are put to some new purpose as much as possible. If your computer is not fit for reuse as is, you can donate it to one of several organizations, such as StRUT (Students Recycling Used Technology), which will refurbish it or recycle its components.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Legend of Tarzan" did not reach the expectations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEWI loved the Tarzan movie made by Disney. I have watched it over and over again and will still watch it again because it's a fantastic film. That movie was full of fun and represent the big theme about family. Also, that movie was not complicated at all. When I was a kid, I have always loved Tarzan and the Disney's Tarzan for me, was my favorite Disney film of all time. The soundtrack was also exceptional by Phil Collins. To be honest, I had really high expectations for this movie since the casts are pretty good and the director is known for some of the best harry potter movies. Wow. When I came out of the theater, it did not reach my expectations at all. So this movie doesn't have any connection with the original Disney Tarzan. In fact, none of the story or the background past of Tarzan is the same as the Disney's Tarzan. So if you expect to see a young Tarzan growing up, you will be upset, although they did show some flashbacks about Tarzan's past. But this Tarzan has actually grown up and he wanted to help Congo. So Tarzan and Jane went to Congo with Dr. Williams (Sam L Jackson) to defeat Christoph Waltz. That's basically the plot. The movie wasn't all bad. There are some good parts of it, such as Alexander Skarsgard who plays Tarzan. He did pretty well as he put in work for 9 months to become Tarzan, so he really did put in work for this role. He's an enormous guy and fit Tarzan. I also thought Margot Robbie did fine as Jane. She wasn't all fantastic, but she's just a supporting role of the movie. The flashbacks were also great. But the most fun character was Sam L. Jackson's. God he was hilarious and lively. The bad parts of the movie is basically the plot, the directing, and the villain. The plot included so many things happening that some of them are so irrelevant. The only good part was the 3rd act, which is the only "Tarzan" part of the movie. The 1st and 2nd were just leading up to it. If the Trailer showed mostly part of "Tarzan", then the rest of the movie is expected to be based on Tarzan in the jungle with the gorillas, but it's not. It was an adult Tarzan with Jane. The build up was so slow. The directing was also not that good. The slow motions just don't work. Only a few does, but there are lots of them. The CGI was poor. I mean it was so noticeable, but the parts when Tarzan swing from trees to trees were handled well. Lastly, Christoph Waltz was just...well... Christoph Waltz. He played this villain like he played any other villains. The movie was supposed to be fun, but they really make it more dramatic than fun. This was not the Tarzan I expected, and Disney's Tarzan is much better than this one. But although it was just alright, as a big fan of Tarzan, I will give props for making a live action Tarzan movie. This movie will get a 7.3/10. Go see it guys, but if you haven't seen Finding Dory, I suggest to watch that first and then watch this. Peace !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Legend of Tarzan is one of the strangest blockbusters I've seen this year. It kinda reminded me of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood where your favorite parts of the source material are replaced with political talk which is supposed to be boring, but since it's stunningly directed, it's oddly entertaining.Except 2010's Robin Hood manages to succeed of ending up being a medieval epic. The Legend of Tarzan on the other hand... you don't exactly know where it's heading. It juggles so much themes and subplots; you can sense there is a rich lore around, but the movie doesn't exactly flourish them properly, at the very least. It's just one plot point after another.On the technical side, again, the directing work is captivating. The action may go out of nowhere crazy, but focusing on the production and the atmosphere alone make it quite fascinating to watch.The acting is predictable, but it's fine. Christophe Waltz plays a watchable cartoon villain, Margot Robbie does what she usually does, Alexander Skarsgard makes a convincing reserved/feral Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson brings the energy that helps brightening things up in this rather gloomy version of the tale.The Legend of Tarzan overall takes itself into some interesting directions, but it's also a strange mess. It can be impressive in its filmmaking and entertaining when everybody stops explaining stuff. It's a mixed bag at best. People might clamor it could have been a little more lighthearted fun as Samuel L. Jackson's character's bantering, because once you realize what kind of movie this actually is, there is no turning back.</fullReview>

Alexander Skarsgard is impressive in all facets of the character of Tarzan, the civilized, the wild, and he displays quite a great sense of humor and charisma. Margot Robbie is a great match to Tarzan, we buy this extraordinary couple and their romance. Samuel L. Jackson is as awesome as always in the sidekick part. Christoph Waltz is pretty much as expected, but hey, he nails villain roles like nobody! Djimon Hounsou surprised me: with just his few scenes he makes quite an impression, Mbonga is a hell of a character. Everything is great, music, cinematography. If I have complaints, it would be that fight scenes seem less impressive than they should be, and that I didn't need the overall story involving all Congo. The characters were sufficiently strong to sustain a whole movie. Hope there will be more!</fullReview>

Christoph Waltz is playing the same bad guy he's played in four or five other movies. Skarsguard plays the strong silent type well but there's not a lot of fire there. Samuel L Jackson just seems like a late arrival to the whole thing. His part seemed more of an appendage to the story than an Intercal part of it. The color palette was horrible with muted blues and blacks and browns all through the movie. To me the story was reasonably disjointed and repetitive. Jane is captured, Jane escapes, Jane is captured again, Jane escapes, etc.Frankly I thought the earlier Johnny Weissmuller movies had better action in them, but this was a pleasant enough movie to see with my family on a Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bravo! Well done. After so many failed attempts at creating a Tarzan movie, Hollywood has finally gotten it right. Having read all 23 Tarzan novels by Egar Rice Burroughs, I was skeptical this film would deliver cinematic justice to this character. The "Me Tarzan, you Jane." versions were not only dead wrong, they were hideous. Tarzan was intelligent, He spoke several languages. But he was viciously brutal and unforgiving to his enemies, while loyal, and honorable to his allies.This film was well cast. At 6'4", Alexander Skarsg?rd is the perfect Tarzan. He is handsome, but no pretty boy, masculine, and charming. More importantly, he plays Tarzan as an intellect. Even the fight scenes we're well choreographed. Tarzan fought as if he were raised by apes. Very believable.Perhaps "Tarzan and the Ant Men" would be good sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is fun to be had in The Legend of Tarzan. The locations are visually appealing, the set design and costumes look good, and the acting, for the most part, is quite good. However, this film suffers from an underwhelming story combined with truly terrible cinematography and even worse editing making this film quite forgettable.The film takes the story of Tarzan in an interesting new direction with the film taking place 10 years after the events of Tarzan that people are more familiar with. We see Tarzan living in London with his wife Jane where he now goes by John Clayton III instead of Tarzan. He tries to deny his past and refuses to go back to the Congo. However, devious events orchestrated by Christoph Waltz's character, Leon Rom, force him to return to his old home along with George Washington Williams, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to stop Rom and save Jane. It's an interesting story laced with flash backs to Tarzan's origins. To summarize my critiques of the story, the film simply has too much going on. There are many character arcs and conflicts the film wants to address, but doesn't have enough time to fulfill any of them.What kills the overall experience is the cinematography and editing. This problem is primarily during all the action sequences. The action is so poorly cut together that you can't really tell what's going on. You have no sense of where characters are in relation to each other as the action is happening. It's jarring and confusing and makes it difficult to become invested in the action. What should have been intense action scenes become very underwhelming. The poor cinematography doesn't help either. The camera work simply doesn't look appealing at all. While large far away shots of the landscape look great, the more personal close-ups and action look very dull. None of these things make the film bad, in any sense of the word. But the lesser quality of all these elements take what could have been a fun adventure movie and make it a forgettable experience. You'll be entertained enough, but you will forget about it in a day or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waaaaaaaaay too long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, though it runs only 109 minutes, seemed waaaaaaaaay too long when I sat through it today. It is just one episode after the next, all of them predictable: there will be an incredible fight scene, but the good guys will always emerge untouched - except when Tarzan fights a gorilla, in which case he does get bitten. There is no narrative arc, no sense of building to a climax, though there is a climax when we suddenly find ourselves in Boma.Some of the views of the African forest are very beautiful. The gorilla animation seems lifelike at times, at other times not at all, like the recent Jungle Book. (This is not as good as that.) The leading lady is beautiful to look at, and has some expression. The man who plays Tarzan/Lord Greystoke does not act, and is usually expressionless. This is a real problem, because the only way this movie makes any sense is as a comedy. Samuel L. Jackson gets some good comic lines, which he knows how to deliver, but Tarzan is always very serious, and with this material that gets boring very quickly.The last scene, where Boma gets overrun by animals, is clever until the very end, when the ship blows up but Tarzan emerges unscathed.And did you know that no one - and I mean no one - ever sweats in the Congo? No one, at least not in this movie. Which is strange among other reasons because all Lord Greystoke can say about the Congo in the first part of the movie is that it is very hot.Did you know, also, that there were modern fitness gyms in the Congo forests? We don't get to see them, but the young Congolese warriors all have torsos that only come out of gyms. They are well fed muscle boys.I could go on pointing out what makes this movie unintentionally funny, but you get the point.My last big objection, and it is a serious one, is that the movie gives you the impression that the Africans win this battle with the Europeans. Far from it. The Belgian Congo was different from most African colonies in that it was not a national colony, one that belonged to a country, but rather one that belonged to an individual, King Leopold of Belgium. It was his to exploit as he chose, and exploit it he did, in terrible ways. Belgium did not take control of it, and reduce the horrors, until 1908. But it remained a European colony until 1960. The end of the movie gives you the impression that Leopold has lost and the Congolese are now free. Far from it.If you are looking for incredible fight scenes, go watch Star Wars or something like that. If you want to watch bare muscular torsos, go watch professional wresting, or the old Johnny Weismuller Tarzan movies, or something on the internet.If you want to feel trapped in a movie theater on a nice summer day, wishing you could get back out in nature, go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When it comes to recycling yesterday's heroes, one can wonder if there's still a place in contemporary cinema for Edgar Rice Burroughs' century-old, Tarzan. Arguably, the last thing viewers want to see is another exhausting reiteration of his origin story ? a pratfall that David Yates (director of the last four Harry Potter films) avoids by liberating Tarzan from a brainless feral child to a socially conscious "modern" Englishman in Warner Bros.' The Legend of Tarzan. Yet, so as to not alienate those who are either born today or lived in a jungle for years, the film wisely uses strategically-placed flashbacks to fill his backstory and at the same time jump right into this re-imagined tale. The concept is admirable, however, these vines of flashbacks alone are not sturdy enough to sustain the swing from classic to modern without dropping its true spirit of adventure in the process.With the all being "King of the Jungle" monicker now in the past, Alexander Skarsgard plays the new and improved Tarzan or more precisely for this interpretation, John Clayton III, the fifth Earl of Greystoke. John receives and summarily declines an invitation from King Leopold of Belgium to be the emissary in an expedition to the Congo. He is, however, persuaded by an American soldier-turned- humanitarian George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) who suspects that the Belgian King is enslaving the region's people. Unbeknownst to John, he is actually being lured under a false pretense in order for the King's envoy, Captain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to hand him to a tribal chief whose plotting revenge against Tarzan (for reasons that will be explained later in the film). All this in exchange for loads of diamonds that will be used to finance the King's burgeoning slave trade. Reluctantly taking his wife Jane (Margot Robbie) with him, Tarzan will be forced to peel off his layers (or his shirt to be more accurate) and revert to his animalistic state to fight for the country he once grew up in, now endangered of slavery.Yates undeniably has a firm grasp of cinematic detail as evidenced by the sublime shots of the Congo's vast green jungles and its thin serpentine rivers. However, despite the cinematic storytelling and cutting-edge technology, the film still needs a slightly more aggressive and adventurous filmmaker. For brief moments, you witness what Yates aspires the film to be ? Tarzan swinging from vine to vine, fighting apes, etc. but most action scenes lack the excitement that its obvious competitor, The Jungle Book, excelled in earlier this year. Perhaps this is hampered down by a melancholic and introverted version of Tarzan who sustains his serious tone all throughout the film to the point that viewers will struggle to scratch anything beyond this surface. Skarsgard certainly can't be faulted in his characterization as he delivers the brawn and brain as the new Tarzan. One can only imagine the rigorous training he went under to achieve his physical state. Only if his actual character generates more emotional connection than his abs, the film will be better served.Jane represents an era of women in film who are trying to break free from the damsel-in-distress trope and jump into to a modern-day empowered heroines. Robbie is as feisty as sultry in her character but no matter how tough and self-assured Jane is in verbal sparring whilst shackled in chains, the plot can't find any use to her other than being the captive to lure Tarzan, an idea that she spits out but at the same time mocks her during the entire film. Her captor, Captain Rom, armed with a deadly rosary made from Madagascar spider silk, is played by Oscar-winner Waltz who is slowly becoming a household villain these days. He carries his sneers and other evil mannerisms almost identical to his previous roles. No different is Samuel L. Jackson doing his umpteenth variation of a Samuel L. Jackson character. His presence is obviously for the sake of racial awareness ? as his character Williams happens to be a real-life historical figure who exposed slave trade in African-American history ? and also to draw comic-relief from a film that is crying out for humor. It is odd, however, that some of its sparse humor are anachronistic for the current setting, with William's comments like, "Should I lick its balls as well?" in trying to appease an enraged orangutan.The Legend of Tarzan finds its new footing in cinematic history by taking the eponymous hero to a new canvas in the attempts of exploring a different playing field. Yet, despite the impressive visuals and its noble intention to tackle the atrocities of human slavery and mineral exploitation, the resulting picture ends up too sentimental to have fun and a bit dull to engage in what could have been nothing but a missed opportunity to re-introduce him to a younger generation. At one point in the film, Tarzan does his signature yodel to which Captain Rom responds with (non-verbatim), "Is that him? I didn't expect it to be that way." In a way, this is a metaphor of how this film surprisingly fails to register compared to my memories of the original.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-legend-of-tarzan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good intentions sometimes bites itself in its own ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UGH! Not one of these again?Okay, look. If you're attempting to remake a more faithful Tarzan movie ? notwithstanding the VAST abundance of other Tarzan movies ? you better go all out with it. The original stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs may hold a huge influence of decades-old adventure stories, but one cannot help to notice its largely uncomfortable racial issues, especially in an age where our literary society grows more sensitive by the day. I mean if you think about it, it's inescapable: A white hero representing a total embodiment of powerful, Anglo-Saxon race fighting unusual enemies in uncharted territory. Yeah, I'm sure THAT won't turn some heads, to say nothing of the unpleasant Colonizing that came with it. Yikes! But what made these stories hold their lasting weight lies in their fun, pulpy adventure style in wacky scenarios. So call it compensation: "Sure this sounds racist, but it's also about a guy fighting bad guys with his Jungle friends, and that's awesome enough!"So with that in mind, there are angles to get around this for a modern update on Tarzan. On my money, the best angle is the 1999 Disney version, where they keep the action and the human races simplified in order to develop a man-vs-nature story that actually develops the hero as a character. The other movies went for broke and just became silly action adventure romps. The Legend of Tarzan, on the other hand, decides to take this subtext into the main thrust of the movie, whereas Tarzan is tasked with stopping Colonialism in Africa. Sadly, since the Warner Bros company clearly comforts itself with the gritty reboot template, any speck of goodwill from this otherwise exciting premise gets sucked out in an utterly dull, bloated, occasionally phony, carcass of a movie. The story takes place after the whole shenanigans in the Jungle and Tarzan has made a name for himself in Britain where he takes a new persona as John Clayton. After a meeting with George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), he persuades the former ape-man to aid him in his efforts to abolish King Leopold's slave efforts in the Belgian Congo. Little did they know that he and Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) are in cahoots with each other in an uninteresting villain plot with diamonds and mines. Jane (Margot Robbie) eventually tags along because she misses her homeland and the movie really needs a good excuse to get captured for a third-act rescue. So yeah, it's up to Tarzan and his reunited animal buddies to take down the interlopers, rescue Jane, and despite trying their best to reduce the materials racism, inexplicably take credit from Williams in abolishing black oppression in Africa. Really.Apart from being overstuffed yet simplistic, the biggest problem with the movie lies on how much it blunders on its own intentions. The film constantly emphasizes the horror of colonizing Africa at this time period for little reason other than to address the race issue, yet couldn't find ways to go further with it other than a "great white savior" story. Whether or not they couldn't conjure another angle with the whole "Belgian Slavery but with Tarzan" or they just thought we would think it's noble, but the result ultimately makes him the hero while Samuel Jackson's character gets stuck as a wacky sidekick. It's like trying to fix a wine-stained tuxedo with splashing more wine onto it. Outside of this irony, the rest of the film befalls into boring and half-baked. The writing consists of lazy exposition and awkward comedy, the characters are paper-thin, and the few CGI action scenes ? save for a third act animal stampede ? lack so much punch and scope it's borderline bizarre. I know Warner Bros hired director David Yates to helm this because he banked a lot of money with the gloomier Harry Potter movies, but most of his blockbuster panache and overall dreary aesthetic falls limp here. (Or maybe he's saving his energy for Fantastic Beasts) Most of the performances are all wasted but try to bring charisma, save for Skarsgard who couldn't even hold the medal in appeal against Jai Courtney. Most damming, the movie tries to fill up Tarzans origin story via flashbacks, which serves little more than rush the character development and set up one needless plot points after another. Admittedly, the movie brings itself up a few notches during the aforementioned third act stampede. It all looks straight out of a pulp adventure romp detached from the rest of the movie, but rarely does a film benefit from that. I mean, why can't a Tarzan movie stop refrain from gloomy pretense for once and actually becomes a Tarzan movie?However, in the end, this movie left me conflicted on who this movie is for. It fails to be a historical piece by adding fictional ape brawling. It fails at being aimed for old Tarzan fans by its "gritty reboot" style and the fans of said style would get zoned out by the rest of the tedium. Most damning, though, the movie admirably faces the racial implications but winds up biting its own ass. Credit is due for intentions despite the fact, but sometimes that just isn't enough.To check out my other posts, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-legend-of-tarzan.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely boring first hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sat through an hour and 15 minutes of absolute boredom. Finally couldn't take it any more and walked out. Maybe the last fifteen minutes are great but it's not worth the excruciating pain of the first hour plus. This movie is just full of filler material I guess to keep the costs of the animation down. They could have had a lot of fun and a great story here, but instead they made it boring with a complete lack of action. I would recommend skipping the first hour and maybe get a pizza and then show up. To catch you up, an evil King is taking over the congo with slaves to get blood diamonds, Tarzan is brought in as a sacrifice to an native leader who is blocking the mining. Gee what happens next? Didn't care, didn't wait, all to predictable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just an OK remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of the final Harry Potter films, David Yates, Tarzan (Alexander Skarsg?rd) swings onto the scene as a refined British gentleman having made it out of the Congo and married his love, Jane (Margot Robbie). Once Tarzan, he now goes by his British name John Clayton and doesn't want to return to the jungle until George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), an American activist, convinces him that slavery is being perpetrated on the people of Africa.Very early on, it is shown that Tarzan is being lured to the Congo by the conniving Belgian diamond miner and war monger Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) in order to make a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) leader of a tribe. The plot jumps back in time making this movie serve as both an origin story and a sequel to the original story of when Tarzan met Jane. Despite veteran actors, all of the acting is just these people going through their routine, Waltz doing a proper foreign villain, Skarsg?rd doing smoldering, six-pack, sexy, Robbie doing sassy and tough, and Jackson doing funny one-liners while serving as the moral compass.

Anyways American annoying Jane, invented characters, change of the story, honestly regret paying a ticket for this. Bottom line so bad I had to leave, had not done this since the Garfield movie years ago. Like, the guy that plays Tarzan, was pretty decent but this crappy Hollywood versions is BAD. Maybe the name should be, inspired in Tarzan, but we didn't even bothered to read the book, comics or any material". Plus is annoying all this CGI movies, I would say old movies were more realistic.

		<fullReview>What? Are we that homophobic? Tarzan is now in long pants? That's the end of my interest regardless of whether or not the film is any good.They wouldn't feel the 'need' to do this to a female character so why do it to a classic wardrobe (or lack thereof) of a male one?? I think it's really sad and pathetic that some people are so prudish in this way. Greystoke managed a decent telling of the story with a loin cloth and nobody turned gay by watching it. I don't think Alexander would've had a problem with a loin cloth considering the nudity he did on True Blood. Greed and profits are destroying the industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cardboard Placeholder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarzan, for better or worse has been around in one form or another since 1912. If one's counting, Alexander Skarsgard is the 20th actor to bring the loincloth donning Ape Man to the big screen; a list that includes everyone from the instantly memorable Johnny Weissmuller to the embarrassingly campy Casper Van Dien. The initial appeal of Tarzan stems from author Edgar Rice Burrough's ability to gauge his audience. Broad and formulaic, the tales of Tarzan fed into the eternal mystery of Africa that galvanized readers who saw the dark continent as the last frontier. Burrough's book series fits comfortably amid Haggard's "King Solomon's Mines" and Kipling's "The White Man's Burden" as a piece of fiction that seems at times excruciatingly antiquated.Yet the legend endures as each generation adds its own little spin. The Weissmuller films brought nuclear family normalcy to the jungle; Christopher Lambert injected 1980's machismo; Van Dien was 90's environmentalism and now we have the aught 10's and our obsession with franchises that implant post-modern wink-winks. The Legend of Tarzan is a soft reboot with an emphasis on the word soft. The film begins with our villain Leon Rom (Waltz) making a deal with the menacing Chief Mbonga (Hounsou). Mbonga promises Rom a pile of diamonds in exchange for bringing Tarzan back from England so he may personally slay him for a slight done years ago. Rom hopes to use the diamonds to fund an army of mercenaries hired on behalf of the Belgian crown. Then, after finishing the railroads through the jungle, Rom, with the full support of Belgium will personally bring the Congo aka the heart of Africa to its knees. Meanwhile back in England, John aka Tarzan (Skarsgard) has fully adjusted to life in Britain and refuses to return to Africa "because it's hot." He's convinced to return only after American emissary George Washington Williams (Jackson) announces his suspicion that the Belgian crown is up to no good. Also Jane (Robbie) comes.The main issue with The Legend of Tarzan is it's trying to create a franchise from the middle out. It stretches its story from all sides, trying to cover new ground and generate new themes; basically announcing to the audience that this isn't the Tarzan you've seen in the past. Problem is, the film doesn't seem to have faith in its audience so it rehashes the origin story anyway. The film then hedges its bets further by dedicating time and an arc to Samuel L. Jackson's character, insuring we have an audience conduit to have story elements explained to. He gets a few deserved laughs for voicing shock and wonderment but his involvement just seems like a distraction to the main impetus of the story.And despite all the film's bells, whistles and clunky special- effects, the impetus is still Tarzan saving Jane. The supposed characterization of Jane (told in flashback of course) is done with such triteness that it conjures memories of Audrey Hepburn in Green Mansions (1959); and not in a good way. The film can make light of the fact that Margot Robbie is the damsel in distress all it wants but that doesn't excuse the fact that her only function in the film is to be a reward for Tarzan and be leered at by Rom.Christoph Waltz, for his efforts does a fine job as the villain doing his best to channel the subtle mannerisms and intense mania of Klaus Kinski. Yet the film's wanting script pigeonholes him as a snake; a menace really only good for a few quick and venomous attacks before he slithers away. He surreptitiously tinkers with a rosary made of Madagascar spider silk which not only serves as his weapon of choice but sends a loud message that Rom is a big proponent of Europe's three C's to justify subjugation: Colonize, Culture and Christianize. It's this that saves The Legend of Tarzan from being a complete waste of time. The very true and very vile atrocities committed in the Congo during the period of Belgian colonization is not only present but is given a real (if repetitious) heft. Even if the reasons for incorporating such mass enslavement, injustice and cultural genocide is to halfheartedly appeal to a wider international audience, I applaud Warner Bros. efforts.Yet given the, let's say malleability of the Tarzan ethos, there should have been much more to The Legend of Tarzan. As it is, the film is a cardboard placeholder for Warner Bros. to hold on to the live-action film rights of the Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. property. The action is generic, the story is almost insultingly pedestrian and the faith the film has in its audience is dismaying. Do yourself a favor if you're really Jonesing for your fix of the Ape Man; go watch Disney's Tarzan (1999) again instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excuse for Skarsgard to run around shirtless in humid environments.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1884, the African Congo was divided up by its European conquerors, with King Leopold gaining control of enough territory to build a vast realm of railroads and enslavement. To pay off his debts and to buy up mercenaries for his army, he sends envoy Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) on a quest to retrieve the valuable diamonds of Opar. But they're heavily guarded by a vengeful warlord called Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who wants Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) to pay for the killing of his son.But Tarzan is no longer the wild man from the jungle, raised by apes. He's now the civilized John Clayton, the Lord of Greystoke, living in an enormous mansion with his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). Something of a celebrity, he's lured back to the Congo (though reluctantly, because "it's hot") by American marksman Dr. George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) as a means to identify the possibility of ongoing slavery by the Belgian King. But as soon as Tarzan arrives back to his home, he's targeted by Rom's cutthroat crew, who successfully capture Jane, forcing the Lord of the Apes to launch a daring rescue mission through treacherous jungles and upriver to a stronghold in Boma.The opening scene features a slow-motion ambush, with spring-loaded warriors lunging out of murky waters to attack Rom's soldiers. Fortunately, for the sake of setting up the plot, everyone speaks English. But the visuals are the immediate problem, not only lending to a lack of realism, but also to a forced ostentation, wherein camera tricks and thundering music attempt to camouflage the silliness of the action or the inattention to physics. Like so many CG-heavy adventure epics, gravity is ignored in the hope that superhuman strength and agility will be more impressive than believability. But don't audiences require more and more realism in their fantasy pieces these days? If not, then why all the death and destruction and cruelty toward gorillas?Apparently, despite holding records for being the most filmed character in cinema, Tarzan's story isn't popular enough to dispense with dreadful, brooding flashbacks, which cut in from time to time to familiarize viewers with his childhood among the creatures of the jungle and his romancing of Jane (who also has some oddly placed - but always fond - memories of meeting her future husband). Many of these sequences feature Tarzan swinging through the trees, which presents another tremendous downfall to this version's presentation of the legendary persona. His computer-animated movements are phony at best, and his interactions with the apes shift between moderately convincing and downright laughable. With so many other movies highlighting the advancements in technology, particularly with gorillian characters (including "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" [2014] and "The Jungle Book" [2016]), it's becoming obvious when a new project doesn't have state-of-the-art effects at its disposal. Here, a number of animals can't quite live up to previous CG iterations, including a climactic buffalo stampede and a swarm of angry ostriches. Thankfully, the creatures don't talk!But supplementary visuals of any caliber can't save a deficiency in storytelling or scripting, and "The Legend of Tarzan" has an abundance of such faults. The dialogue is routinely, painfully generic, which carries over into the casting. Waltz (though always watchable) really shouldn't continue to play villains, especially when he's typecast as that smarmy, cocky, calmly formidable schemer with an unshakeable accent. And Jackson has little reason to appear in the film, save for comic relief, a few funny glances, and repetitious, anachronistic comments about ape testicles. But worst of all is the project's attempt to tell a slightly different Tarzan tale, while still retreading the same damsel-in-distress scenarios and the same overthrowing of corrupt, slave-trading, evil colonial white men themes. At least several of the widescreen shots are interesting, though much of this film seems like an excuse for Skarsgard to run around shirtless in humid environments.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Included! Humorless. Suspenseless. Good acting-less. Tarzan is living in England. He has an American wife named.......yeah, we know.....Jane. He is recruited by Samuel L. Jackson to go to the Congo to figure out how King Leopold of Belgium is financing his expansion there. Christoph Waltz is the evil Belgian in charge of getting blood diamonds to pay for all the shenanigans. Tarzan and Waltz collide. Gorillas get hurt. Tarzan has flash backs. WARNING!!!!! Tarzan and Jane survive. Bad guys get it courtesy of Tarzan's animal family and buddies. Questions that aren't answered: Why is Tarzan so disinterested? He seems blasé most of the time. He has less connection with the audience than Rex Herrison in Dr. Doolittle. Why is Jackson in the movie? If it is for comic relief, it fails. If it is for drama, it fails. If it is for PC bullshit about PTSD and Indians.....there it is. If you have seen one Jackson movie, you've seen them all.....he is an angry man with a chip on his shoulder.Why is Jane there? Jane is hot but there is zero nakedness. I didn't even see her calves. No sex. No acting evident either. Why is a pretty good Waltz there? He is single-dimensional.Why are all the Belgians carrying Swiss Schmidt-Rubins of a model make after the setting of the movie? Must have gotten a deal from surplus dealer SAMCO. Why is the CGI so unconvincing? Apparently all the good CGI people were tied up doing The Jungle Book and this movie got the B Team. Why is Tarzan in the movie? Oh, he's the dude playing a dude who can act. It fails. He can't act. What is the most disturbing aspect of the movie? The preview for Ghostbusters. You can smell the stench of that pile of manure from the access road in front of the theater. Wait for the Blue Ray. The Legend of Greystoke can best be summed up in two words: Ho and hum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite a promising first half, this contemporary re-imagining of Tarzan nevertheless falls short by choosing CG-enhanced spectacle over genuine character pathos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As enduring as he may have been through the history of cinema as well as in literature, Edgar Rice Burroughs' muscle-bound British lord raised by apes in the African jungle, who grows up to fall in love with an American woman named Jane, is undeniably antiquated in this day and age. Not only would its depiction of British colonialism and tribal Africans seem utterly archaic, the very fact that it conjures the notion of the white man's burden is cultural poison, which pretty much explains why the most successful take on the character in recent times has been the late-90s animation of the same name from Disney. And yet, for once and future 'Harry Potter' wizard David Yates to attempt his take on Tarzan inspires some measure of confidence that there remains a place for the Lord of the Apes in contemporary filmmaking.Sure enough, Yates and his screen writing duo of Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer start off well enough with a fresh narrative that begins with Tarzan as a now domesticated gentleman settled in his family's Greystoke Manor and happily married to his Jane. That period of domestic bliss is interrupted when he is summoned by the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) to accept an invitation by King Leopold of Belgium to revisit the Congo and serve as trade emissary for the British, an offer he refuses until the American statesman George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) persuades him to make the trip to investigate the latter's suspicions of slavery. Williams' character and motivations are no coincidence ? his real-life namesake was a decorated Civil War soldier who had travelled to King Leopold's Congo Free State and written about the exploitation of the African people by the Belgian colony.That is but one adjustment that Yates makes to his tale in order to shake off the character's imperialistic shadow. Rather than have him lord over the local tribe he once spent time with, Yates positions Tarzan as their equal; later on, Tarzan will also come to acknowledge his dishonourable deed of having taken the life of a native from another tribe, which has in part contributed to his existing predicament. No sooner has he, Jane and Williams arrived in Africa does he find himself the target of a bunch of mercenaries led by King Leopold's representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), who has made a deal with a vengeful tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) in exchange for a fortune in legendary diamonds for his otherwise bankrupt sovereign.Tarzan narrowly escapes the kidnap, but Jane is not quite so lucky, and so the former spends the rest of his time reuniting with former friends and reconciliating with former foes while running and swinging through the dense African jungle in pursuit of the steamer on which Leon has Jane held captive. That setup is surprisingly engaging, though it does go back and forth a little too much to establish Tarzan's backstory from the source material (i.e. the death of his mother as an infant, his father's death at the hands of the leader of the ape tribe by whom he is adopted, and his first encounter with Jane where he saves her from the same ferocious ape leader); alas, even if it does get off to a good swing, this Tarzan ultimately falls off the vine when it is more than halfway through.We're not talking about Jackson's somewhat anachronistic sidekick act, which frankly we thought was a genuinely fun foil next to Tarzan's masculinity. We're not talking either about Waltz's umpteenth erudite villain act, which despite being niftily armed with deadly rosary made from Madagascar spider silk, is getting too familiar and tired. And certainly, we have no complaints about Margot Robbie's atypically feisty Jane, who brings nerve and bravado to her damsel-in-distress role. Oh no, what takes Tarzan down is how hasty he seems to get to his inevitable happy ending, so frenetic to the point that it trivialises his Alpha-male conflict with the ape leader whom he has a mano-a-mano with, the grudge that he was responsible for with Hounsou's Chief Mbonga, as well as the danger that he faces confronting Rom and his men out-numbered and out-gunned.That his Tarzan hardly registers isn't Alexander Skarsg?rd's fault though; in fact, the 'True Blood' hunk is probably one of the best, if not the best, Tarzan we have seen, not only in terms of his incredibly ripped physique but also of how he emotes his character's feral core in the earlier scenes. Yet Skarsg?rd is underserved by a mysterious urgency to get things over and done with ? whether to ensure that the summer audience doesn't get bored or because Yates is too eager to move on to his next 'Harry Potter' venture ? which only further leaves us in the cold as it rushes from one CG-enhanced setpiece to another. As well-filmed as these are ? including an early one where Tarzan leads the natives to literally swing on board a moving train and the climactic centrepiece featuring a wildebeest stampede ? they aren't quite as thrilling without a deeper emotional connection with the titular character himself.It is also somewhat unfortunate that 'The Legend of Tarzan' arrives in the wake of Disney's 'The Jungle Book', which represented the zenith of modern-day CG in portraying both the lush jungle environment as well as its inhabitants within. In comparison, the CG here comes off oddly alienating at best and subpar at worst, especially during the scenes where Tarzan is swinging through the trees at full speed. Yet what this rebooted tale of Tarzan really lacks is spirit and poignance, without which not even the character's famous jungle cry makes him resonate. Not all is lost of course, but given Yates' pedigree as well as a promising first half, we expect this Tarzan to come out swinging ? rather than limping ? to its finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CGI is the best part of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read the Tarzan series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but having grown up watching Tarzan movies on Saturday morning TV with my favorite Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller, I felt I had a pretty good handle on Tarzan's story. I knew his parents died when he was just an infant, and he was taken by a shrewdness of apes and raised to adulthood.I went to the theater expecting the retelling of "Tarzan of the Apes" and how this young boy grew to become the "King of the Jungle". I was excited about the film because the use of CGI in today's movie making often delivers the most outstanding special effects. I was not disappointed - the CGI effects, especially of the animals, was great.However, I really feel this movie is mis-titled. This wasn't the story penned by Mr. Burroughs in 1912, but it was more of a political statement about man's inhumanity. The exploitation of other human beings is really the center piece of the movie. There is also a scene of a train where several of the cars are filled with tusks showing how the human race, especially the Europeans, ravaged an entire continent.There were flashback moments in the movie that lets the viewer know how this young British boy is taken by the apes and the bond he develops with the animals. The movie also touches on Tarzan's strained relationship with one of the tribes. However, the main story has Tarzan as the hero of the day, but it really isn't about Tarzan.Christoph Waltz plays the evil character to Tarzan's good and Mr. Waltz is very good at playing a man with no real moral compass. A man of greed who will do anything to get what he wants.I am not really thrilled with this rendition of Tarzan and would only recommend it for its special effects. I think you can wait to see this movie when it shows up on Netflix or another cable or streaming service.</fullReview>
