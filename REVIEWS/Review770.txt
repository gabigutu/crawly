		<shortDescription>It's starting to sound like a broken record, but you're going to love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the pleasure of watching this movie with three kids who had (to my shock and dismay) never seen it before. It turned out to be as good, if not better, as I remembered. The story is reminescent of the original, printed page (very dark) Grimm fairy tales. The special effects are still special, and the characters are unforgettable. Seriously, don't miss it. This is one of the very few childrens' movies that is smarter and better than what has unfortunately become "normal" for the genera. The reverse evolution in childrens' films is heartbreaking, as kids don't deserve to be talked down to so often in movies. I grew up on films like "Labyrinth", "the Neverending Story", and "the Secret of NIMH", and I still count them among my favorites. In the 80's they gave us cinematic filet mignon, and today's kids are getting Spam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, magical movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic fantasy film from Jim Henson, in collaboration with George Lucas. There really is a magic about the film and that has helped it last as a firm family favourite all these years. As with many films aimed at younger audiences there are messages that the writers, in this case Henson himself, have tried to convey, such as `be careful what you wish for (as in the heat of the moment we are not always sure what is best for us) and also about not taking things for granted. These lessons not only relate to the major target audience of young children but also teenagers and adults alike. The film also has values and attitudes about growing up, the central character Sarah is in the awkward stage between child and womanhood, the stage of adolescence. She acts like a child in her self importance and possessiveness but she is perhaps starting to grow out of her young imagination. She does not want to, her room full of inanimate companions, dreams and fantasies, she feels are slipping away.Labyrinth is about Sarah keeping her imagination alive, her fantasies and dreams, and these help her figure out what she is doing wrong, it helps her realise how her attitude is wrong and causes her to be depressed. There is certainly intelligence to this film if analysed deeply. There is depth to the script, and clear attitudes and values that Jim Henson conveys. Henson is in a way telling not just kids, but also adults, that our subconscious, which includes our dreams and imaginative side (in terms of taking yourself to another place, more than imagination in creating something like a piece of music for instance.) can be as affective a guide to where and when your live is going wrong as your conscious. Sometimes we don't realise things we have said or done until we dream. How many times have you said something, that every teen must have to their parents, for instance `I wish you were dead', very cruel but it is said. I have in the past and realised the full implication in a bad dream, a dream is the most effective doorway to imagine something outside of it really happening. What is fantastic about the way the film opens and closes as that it really hints to the fact that Sarah has been through the same dream before, and that she needs these imaginative friends, and dreams to help her see the light as it were. She says for instance at the close that every now and again she needs Hoggle and company. The opening of the film sees Sarah reciting from a book to herself, she is addressing the Goblin king and the characters of this book and her room are the cast of a play inside her mind, they are special to her and meaningful, in a way we might have a favourite song that speaks to us in some way. At the start of the film when we are first in her room there is clever use of visual hints that you wouldn't pick up on until watching a film the second time. Look around her room and you see the characters everywhere, Hoggle, Ludo even a little replica of a maze. There is also a clipping of Sarah's mother, who we do not know whether she is still alive, but in any case is not around, but she is with a man who is the likeness of the Goblin King. The man in the photo probably a figure of blame for the loss (however large) of Sarah's mother. What is also interesting is Sarah being a young girl at the start of puberty has a certain fascination and perhaps crush on the Goblin King, perhaps a combination of the character from the book and the likeness of which she has created this character in her head. Certainly on a visual and script basis there are some clever touches when you consider this is a kids film. The film itself is much like the Wizard of Oz in terms of story (intentional maybe as it could represent something that Sarah finds special and perhaps inspirational). What I really love about the film is, that before the days of CGI, inside the Goblin world, which accounts for 90% of the film, everything is 100% set work, there must be well over a hundred sets and they are all imaginative an create the enchanting atmosphere of the film, these sets combined with some fantastic matte paintings from ILM that give even more of a scale to the film.I do really like this film, the look, the cheesy feel good 80's music, the characters, it is all great. There is some good humour and of course the odd piece of very childish low brow humour but that is to be expected. It is movie magic no question. David Bowie is good as the Goblin King and all the puppeted characters are fantastically brought to life in there movements and voicing as you would expect from a Henson film. A very youthful Jennifer Connelly before the days when many a website was devoted to her ample bosom, has a charm to her, she has to hold the movie together and win the audience, especially after being very bratty and effectively wishing her baby brother into the clutches of Goblins. She does manage to win the audience though and enchant them with her green eyes and youthful innocence.This film is great, it is what makes, or made fantasy films of this time really enchanting. Real artistry was involved, there was exuberance and charm to it and it has lasted a long time. It is a firm fans favourite and still gains new young fans. I can still to this day sit down and enjoy the film because I remember what Jim Henson tries to teach us. `Keep the inner child alive inside you sometimes he/she actually knows best'. Perhaps certain events in recent years may have panned out differently had this been heeded by more people, but that is all just hear say.Overall this is a classic fantasy film with much artistry and charm to appreciate, certainly Henson had a skill in all his fields in the industry. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool film! Way too good for children. Jim Henson, as ever, is the absolute master of every kind of puppetry known to man or muppet.Particularly adorable is the little punk worm who invites Sarah to "Come inside and meet the missus"... very cute. The plot has all the essential elements of a good fairy tale with the added bonus of a heroine who manages to get through all her trials and tribulations without squealing feebly or fainting into the arms of any poxy bloke. David Bowie is wonderfully sexy (despite the fright wig) and his natural humour shines through although his character does a pretty good job of being spiteful and menacing. I get the feeling the he really enjoyed making this film. The soundtrack is excellent and "As the World Falls Down" is quite hauntingly beautiful ('though I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that the ballroom sequence in which it was played did slow the action down a little - but it was a visual feast).All in all, a beautiful film with a wonderful cast of creatures and humans. Makes me miss Jim Henson's talents lots but at least we've still got Brian (his son). My friend's three year old now has a crush on the Goblin King (I dread to think how that's gonna shape her life!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to admit it's magical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was two years ago. Don't ask me how I managed to miss it as a child but I did.It is obvious that this movie was made for the kiddies but I don't think it can just be enjoyed by the younger crowd. I think perhaps if I had seen this as a child instead of a teenager I would have enjoyed it more but I didn't and I still enjoyed never the less. There is something magical about watching Labyrinth. You just feel the happiness that rubs off from this movie. It almost makes you wish you were a kid again. I admit seeing it now I have to say some parts are beyond corny but I think that's just part of it, I mean that was the 80's right? I am not even a David Bowie fan but I can't help but smile whenever he starts singing (which is quite often). I recently showed this to my 4 year old cousin and he couldn't get enough of it. It was so great to watch him turn his head back to look at me with a giant smile to make sure I saw the puppets doing whatever they were doing at that moment. He really loved it so I bought him the dvd for X-mas this year along with myself a copy. This is really just one of those movies you have to see at least once in your life, just because there isn't another like it. Sure the story isn't much when it comes to plot but try to watch this film all the way through without smiling once, I dare you!A great movie for the kids or kids at heart! 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A relic of a time that seems wonderful by comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear, Jim Henson, you are sorely missed. Not necessarily because you went before your time, or even in somewhat rotten circumstances. No, it is because unlike the purveyors of so-called family entertainment these days, your work was actually entertaining to the whole family. When I was a lad, I used to think these films were childish and patronising. By comparison to what is being aimed at the children of my cousins, it is MENSA material, and I realise now that it was far more brilliant than I had previously given it credit for. Indeed, compared to the "you're not good if you don't have good feelings" rubbish that the likes of B'Harni fill the heads of children with, Henson productions deserve a medal.At its heart, Labyrinth is a simple fable about how much we miss something once it is gone. A young girl wishes that her annoying stepbrother would disappear, only to find when he is gone that she misses him. Enter the Goblin King, played with a great malice by David Bowie. The challenge the Goblin King sets almost sounds like a video game. Indeed, one popular Commodore 64 game of the time set the challenge of collecting the pieces to solve a key puzzle to save the world in a certain time period. Labyrinth was even adapted into a game for the Commodore 64. In Labyrinth the film, this young woman named Sarah, played with a certain kind of brilliance by a young Jennifer Connelly, is challenged to navigate a massive labyrinth in less than thirteen hours, lest her brother become one of the Goblins.It sounds like a very simple idea, and it is. What makes Labyrinth the under-appreciated classic that it is is in the details. As previously indicated, the leads are absolutely brilliant. While David Bowie chews scenery like there is no tomorrow, Jennifer Connelly gets so into her character that she makes it seem perfectly natural when she is interacting with some of Jim Henson's most ludicrous creations. The scene in which she rescues a giant yeti-like thing called Ludo is one of the most superbly-made things in the history of children's film. It is also worth noting that in contrast to the aforementioned normalism of B'Harni and his ilk, Henson's creations taught the valuable lesson that appearances are not the sum total of a living creature's character. Ludo looks like he could tear apart our protagonist, but his manner and speech show him as one of the most gentle and lovable characters ever depicted in film.As you might guess from this film featuring David Bowie as the top-billed star, there are also a few song and dance numbers. Some of them, such as the magic dance number, are immortally embarrassing. Or at least, they would be, if not for two things. First, the suspension of disbelief that Henson so admirably achieves with his puppets is a real pleasure. Second, Bowie's golden voice could charm the paint off walls. When he sings "I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry", it stands out like a stark reminder of why this man used to be able to sign record deals worth tens of millions of dollars. It may even bring tears to your eyes.If Labyrinth does have a weakness, it is in the closing reels. The final song from Bowie stretches the scene beyond its welcome, but it recovers nicely once Sarah returns to the real world. The compositing work in the Firey sequence is rather lousy, and the story seems to grind to a halt when they do their song and dance number. On the other hand, their song and dance number is still incredibly amusing to behold.In all, I gave Labyrinth an eight out of ten. It is not perfect. In fact, I wonder if whomever designed Bowie's costume was not playing an elaborate joke upon him. But for all of its problems, Labyrinth is an underrated classic. One of the few films that is advertised as being for all ages, and can entertain audiences of that description. A great light went out in our world when Jim Henson passed away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viewing it again at the age of 25 just made me appreciate it even more, for all of it's breathtaking imaginative figures, rich scenery and original plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up as a child in 1980's New York, I remember being inspired by many fantasy and science fiction films, that eventually led me to start writing short stories myself (from there to my current occupation of journalism the road was quite short, BTW). Titles like The Neverending Story, Flight of the Navigator and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? captured my imagination and filled me with aw, and with time found their way to my ever growing DVD collection, as did Jim Henson's Labyrinth, the latest addition to my nostalgic bundle of joy.The saddest thing about all this is that no one seems to make films like Labyrinth anymore. Viewing it again at the age of 25 just made me appreciate it even more, for all of it's breathtaking imaginative figures, rich scenery and original plot; especially when some of the scenes seem somewhat dated while the essence and heart of the film remain in tact, even twenty years down the road.In short, Labyrinth is one of Jim Henson's last attempts at creating cross-age entertainment through his world famous puppets, after bringing life to the eternal beloved characters of The Muppets and Sesame Street, and before his sudden and premature death. The story presents us 16 year old Sarah (a very young Academy Award winner Jennifer Connelly, A Beautiful Mind), who has an extremely vivid imagination she uses to escape her everyday worries... or so it seems. After asked to take care of her baby stepbrother, Toby, Sarah finds herself dealing with a screaming infant, instead of wondering away in her thoughts to a world filled with Goblins, Yeti-like creatures, and a King Atrhur-ish talking dog. After several lacking attempts at calming the baby down, she wishes Toby to the evil Goblin King Jareth. Fantasy and fiction clash when Jareth (the one and only rock singer David Bowie, who appears on screen with an extravagant 80's outfit and some cute yet unnecessary songs) actually takes Toby away to his evil kingdom, where he threatens to transform the baby into a Goblin, if Sarah won't find a way to cross a tricky and mystical Labyrinth on the way to his kingdom. Determined to save her brother, Sarah makes her way through the Labyrinth, meeting helpful friends along the way, whilst magical fantasy happenings occur around her...This is a true 1980's gem. Treat it with care, and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie takes you to a wonderful world where nothing is what it seems. I was about 10 years old the first time I saw it and it made such an impact on me that I ended up ordering it from Germany just 12 years old. The setting is fantastic; it's just scary enough without making scares in a young boy's soul. Bowie acts in a trilling way, and his unique and magical voice brings it all together. If you like fantasy you will love this film. All the Quotes make Bowie as Jareth "the Goblin King" the perfect villain. At times you almost despise him but as I wrote in my first sentence, nothing is like it seems. And as I grow older I sympathized with him, you may even say that he tries to help Sarah. If you decide to see that aspect of it that is. All in all I wish you all a lovely experience watching this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful fantasy tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's standards "Labyrinth" may look dated and cheap but there's something about it that makes it special. David Bowie makes it a stand alone movie in the weird ranking. The man is crazy but his performance is excellent!Jennifer Connely (being 16 at the time) delivers a solid and tender performance. She was very, very cute and her performance totally gained the audience's love. The tale is fantastic and keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. The musical moments are also great! The f/x were great for it's time and I wonder how they came out with the idea for creating such original characters. The thing that I liked the most about the movie is it's art direction. The world that is created is taken directly from everyone's fantasy world idea. Colorful and dark at the same time.Better than the "Neverending Story" movies, "Labyrinth" should be watched for lovers of sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Fantastical Quest Through the Labyrinth of Time. This Henson/Lucas production isn't quite what you'd expect from these legendary directors. Somehow, it's better.The genius of Henson and Lucas shines brightly as Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie perpetuate this wonderful tale of fantasy written by Dennis Lee and Jim Henson. Henson's son, Brian (now the head of the Henson Empire), even gets in on the act as the voice of Hoggle.The story opens in the present, this world, this plane. Sarah (Connelly) is a spoiled rotten little drama queen who thinks she is the center of the universe and the sun around which the world revolves.In a brattish fit of colossal immaturity, she stumbles upon the correct words to summon Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) to take her little brother to the Goblin Realm.Once done; however, she realizes how angry her parents will be and decides that it's more prudent to go "rescue" Toby rather than allow his assimilation into the Goblin fold.Jareth gives her 13 hours in which to find her way through an impossible labyrinth, fight her way through the Goblin City, and puzzle out the staircases of the Goblin Castle and save her half-brother.She is punished for arrogance, beguiled in her naivety, confused in her indecision and imprisoned for her quick, thoughtless decisions. "That's not FAIR!" is one of her most used and best delivered lines; used again and again, until it FINALLY sinks in that life just isn't fair.It is a warm, funny and enriching tale, once started. It's about growing up, accepting responsibility for your actions and choices and making them more wisely in the beginning, rather than cleaning up your messes as you go along.In the end, Sarah realizes all the infantile tantrums and childish toys are nothing but detritial remains of her otherwise out-lived childhood. She begins to stumble upon the reality that the important things are family, friends, and the responsibility that comes with making mature decisions. She throws away her immaturity and child-like selfishness to save her brother and thereby sets her feet back on the right path to adulthood and maturity.It's a wonderful "coming of age" movie, and perfect for its target audience: girls 9-13. But I must say that children and adults alike love this movie, worldwide. It's not ONLY for girls, but for anyone who loves fantasy. This movie is far superior to what most consider to be your standard "Muppet Movie." It's one of my favorites. This movie gets an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than "the Dark Crystal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jennifer Connelly is Sarah, an immature spoiled narcissistic bratty teen whom after wishing her baby brother, Toby, away to the Goblin King (a great David Bowie, who's a highlight of the film) and has to traverse a complex labyrinth to get him back learning to be a lot less selfish in the process. Bowie's songs highlight and punctuate a magical film that is sure to appeal to both the young and young at heart. Better then Jim Hanson's other more mature film of the 80's "The Dark Crystal", because it's a tad more humane and more easily to relate to, but both these films are fun to watch. Loving this film from when I was a kid myself might have shading my opinion of it a bit, yet re-watching it just now, I still find it very enjoyable.My Grade: B+ Collector's Edition DVD Extras: "Inside the Labyrinth" 56 minute making-of featurette; Four photo galleries; posters gallery; Filmographies; Storyboards; Theatrical trailer; and trailer for "The Dark Crystal box set" Random Notes: Comes packed with animation cell/scene composite card and postcards</fullReview>

Now she has thirteen hours to solve the massive Labyrinth and make her way to the Goblin castle beyond. Along the way she befriends several of Henson's fantastic Muppet creations for the final battle.This wonderfully produced and magical fantasy is great fun from the beginning to the end. Henson (fresh off the equally impressive Dark Crystal) 'mines his imagination for very realistic places and endearing and vivid characters. Toping it all off is a wonderful casting and a nice soundtrack and musical score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film ever made. Period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth can only be described as a major fantasy success that was loved by children and adults all round the globe. The opinion of some is that this film is wasted on children as it is a superbly crafted, well written and finely directed film which can only be appreciated by people of a certain age and film knowing experience. I believe that these people are wrong, and that all people regardless of their age and film know-how should experience Labyrinth's magic.The film was directed by one George Lucas, infamous for a little film he made called Star Wars. Labyrinth combines his talents with Jim Henson, widely known as the creator of the Muppets. Labyrinth in no way can be compared to a muppet film; it can only be compared with Jim's previous fantasy film ?The Dark Crystal'. Though Labyrinth isn't as dark as Dark Crystal it still bats in the same league. Labyrinth's magic begins to work on the viewer right from the start as the opening credits roll to the music of David Bowie. As the camera zooms in we see a girl who is re-enacting her favourite book ?Labyrinth'. This girl is the film's central character, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly: Dark City, The Rocketeer, Requiem for a Dream). When she arrives home late she has an arguement with her stepmother (Shelly Thompson: Morons from Outer Space, Just like a Woman) over having to babysit her baby brother Toby. When Sarah is left with Toby he begins to cry, a cry that brings Sarah to call for the Goblin King to take him away. This is where Henson's puppet mastery comes into play. There is a wonderful couple of seconds where Sarah, as she is saying the words for the Goblin King to take Toby away, is being listened to by a few a goblins inside her mirror. This is only one of the little ?cute' scenes in this film that shows that Henson and Lucas can combine ideas to produce such memorable scenes that you will undoubtedly cherish.When the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie: The Man Who Fell to Earth) makes his appearance Sarah begs him to give Toby back to her. Eventually the king tells her that if she can solve his labyrinth and get to his castle that lies beyond on the Goblin City within 13hours, she can have Toby back, however if she doesn't Toby has to stay with him forever. Sarah has no choice and accepts his deal.The first of the Labyrinths characters Sarah comes across is Hoggle, a goblin who likes jewels. This has to be one of the film's most memorable scenes in which Sarah is asking him to help her get into the Labyrinth while Hoggle walks around killing fairies. This scene shows brilliant camera work from Colin Corby and excellent direction from Lucas, as Sarah and Hoggle walk around the entrance of the Labyrinth, which appears to be huge.Hoggle eventually shows Sarah how to get into the labyrinth. While she is pondering which way to go Trevor Jones's music manages to build up a confined atmosphere which really adds to the film at these early points.As Sarah walks deeper into the Labyrinth, Lucas switches scenes and brings us into the Goblin Kings castle in which he is singing surrounded by goblins, another spellbinding feat by Jim Henson where goblins appear to be jumping ten foot in the air and throwing Toby in the air aswell.As Sarah continues through the Labyrinth she encounters more weird and wonderfull characters such as Ludo, the huge beast with a huge heart; Didymus, the dog soldier; The junk lady and of course the blue worm.When Sarah and her ?gang' appear before the goblin city within the 13 hour period Jareth calls his goblin soldiers to get rid of them. This is one of the best pre-climax film scenes to come out of Hollywood, brilliant puppetry and almost magical scenery which again is brilliantly shot by Lucas, there is no doubt that there will be at least several bits which you will laugh at and chuckle about later.When they get to the castle Sarah informs the rest of them that she has to go on alone, a brilliant scene which will bring a tear to your eye. When Sarah climbs the stairs she is faced by lots of staircases which appear to lead no-where. When Jareth appears he points out where Toby is, and Sarah tries to get to him. This scene has been copied but never bettered. Copiers include the 1989 horror film ?A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child', a very camp horror sequel of a sequel of a sequel of a sequel staring everyones favourite bogeyman.The film's climax is a one on one confrontation between Sarah and Jareth, which seems to be shot on some sort of astrial plain. This scene produces such memorable lines from both parties especially Jareth. The ending is isn't strong enough to spawn a sequel.A family/fantasy film, which appeals to children and parents, that has a plot is very hard to find today. So if you haven't already seen this film you must make it your priority to see it, regardless of your age, because everyone still has a young child within them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is, no doubt, one of the most outstanding fantasy movies ever made. It is superbly acted throughout, with the wonderful talents of Jennifer Connelly, who plays a spoilt girl called Sarah, who takes too many things for granted. She is very beautiful and such a brilliant actress, and she holds the story together well with her convincing transformation from a young dreamy girl with her head in the clouds, to a mature, unselfish young lady, who learns to become independent. David Bowie is very good as the Goblin King. He plays the villain so well; you don't know whether to love him or hate him. The story unfolds with Sarah wishing her bratty little stepbrother, Toby, away to the Kingdom of the Goblins. However, her wish really is granted, and Sarah then faces the biggest challenge in her life; to complete the Labyrinth surrounding the Goblin Castle, within thirteen hours. If she completes it within the time, she will get Toby back. However, if she doesn't, Toby will be transformed into a Goblin, and will have to live in the Goblin Kingdom for eternity as a slave. With such an inventive and promising plot, they couldn't go wrong. The magic begins from the very start; the magnificent and beautiful set pieces don't fail to dazzle and enchant. The labyrinth itself is definitely a magical experience; full of so many mesmerising sets, such as the bog of eternal stench and the oubliette's. The songs are enjoyable and memorable, and I recommend the soundtrack if you enjoy this film. The whole film is a fantastic visual feast, but the best scene has to be the ballroom masquerade; the costumes, the music, the tone and speed of the whole scene makes it such an unforgettable cinematic experience. The characters we encounter throughout the Labyrinth are a delight, including Ludo the lovable ogre, Hoggle the stubborn and fierce Goblin, and Sir Didymus and his stead Ambrosius. Labyrinth is certainly a magnificent fantasy experience, which will have you nostalgic and will leave you feeling warm inside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Bowie Changed My Life...And My Hair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back at Jim Henson's "Labyrinth", my na?veté as a kid must've been in full effect. When the movie debuted, I admit, I was caught smack-dab in the middle of its target audience - as a fairly dumb, imaginative, gawk-in-amazement-at-even-the-shoddiest-special-effects, Muppet-loving, movie-going ten year-old. My mom took me to see "Labyrinth" after days of pleading, and with all of my aforementioned attributes in tow, I was not disappointed. But sitting in that theater, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see...David Bowie. I mean, here I was watching this amazingly multi-talented guy act, sing and, AND, defy all laws of gravity by rolling a crystal ball around his hand. Plus he could turn into a barn owl. Way cool. For months following "Labyrinth", I wanted to be David Bowie - especially in the hair department. Tina Turner had nothing on this Goblin King, and I was even more astounded a brief time later when I discovered he wasn't even an actor.The movie though, still holds up fairly well, and all the credit in the world goes to Jim Henson for that. One thing was always for certain in the 80s: Muppet technology always remained a step ahead of the visual effects movement. The movie's cast of creature-oddities were far more tactile and believable than anything "Ghostbusters" (for example) could ever throw at you. The one F/X stumble even noticeable as a dumb kid in 1986 were those papier-maché boulders. But I digress.This is a movie you should 'see again, for the first time' and all that stuff. Or show to your kids. Or whatever. It's all good, baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been a favorite of mine since I discovered it in my own adolescence in the late 90s, on Disney and later VHS and DVD. It was such a frequent feature in my home that my own mother was probably ready to wish me away to the goblins, just to stop the torture...a feeling I can now relate to as my own son has adored this movie practically since birth. To the tune of three repetitions a day at times. The timeless lesson of 'be careful what you wish for' is superbly taught here by Jim Henson and crew in the tale of Sarah (Jennifer Connely,) a bratty teen who wishes her baby brother away to the goblins, then has to accept the challenge of the Goblin King (David Bowie) to win him back. Along the way she makes new friends and learn that not only does the universe not revolve around her, but that life is not always fair. David Bowie's music is superb, from the amusing 'Dance Magic', to the whimsical, if slightly oddball 'Fire Gang' and the romantic 'World Falls Down' Each song adds a wonderful new piece of enjoyment to the movie as well as a new facet to the Goblin King and the world he rules. While this movie may be perceived as a kid's film, it is truly one for any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Labyrinth' has deep symbolic and psychological significance. It's about a girl going into the fantasy world to work through her issues and fears about growing up. In her room there are all the different creatures/toys etc found in the labyrinth and books from which the symbolism of the labyrinth is taken. Some themes in the movie reminded me of 'The Phantom of The Opera', because it involved a labyrinth, The Goblin King is a musician and a magician and he's in love with a young girl. This movie can be seen on several levels: first, as a children's movie, but also as a movie for grownups, because there are some universal lessons that everyone can learn from it...this movie is so magical and wonderful...the characters in the labyrinth are truly fantastical...I saw this movie in 2006, but i still love it very much and I wish i saw it when i was younger...I probably would have loved it even more, if that's possible :DIn case anyone is interested in the symbolism of Labyrinth and it's characters, here are some interesting links:http://www.katiescarlett.co.uk/ http://www.oddpla.net/realm/ http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/lorelei/littlemagpie.html http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/lorelei/labyanalysis.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic childhood memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any child of the eighties will remember this film. The Soundtrack is compliments the film well. David Bowie brought this film to life. Jennifer Connely is superb and interacts well with all the characters. Jim henson films are the original Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter if you enjoyed them then watch this. I have watched this film in excess of 50 times and never bore. It intergrates mystery,humour, romance and fantasy. I remember as a child watching the behind the scenes and being amazed at the work put into this film. Although hey are puppets Jim Hensn has done well to disguise this you are easily consumed in the story and forget about he puppets. This is a must see for all generations old and new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic tale in the tradition of Non-Politically Corrected stories by the Brothers Grimm and the like.Ultimate Good - the virginal young girl fighting to correct her own mistake made in anger.Ultimate Evil - the seductive powerful male tempting her with all manner of rewards to ignore her responsibility.She hangs tough even when offered a teenager becoming a woman fantasy.A serious case of beauty/innocence v. the beast - while he may have looked pretty the Goblin King behaved in the manner of the true beast: an abuser of power and advantage. Even at that, none of the obstacles he presented were insurmountable as long as Sarah kept thinking and kept her mind on what the ultimate goal was.Some people seem to get completely 'stuck' on the issue of the age difference between them - but that again goes back to classic fairy tales, age and experience v. youth and enthusiasm.Overall, an excellent tale, well played and I believe seriously under appreciated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my fellow goblins are basically in love with this movie. David Bowie is a dreamboat and demonstrates unspeakable talent in both his acting and his singing... and dancing. I know many women who, after seeing the movie, have developed obsessive crushes on David. We sometimes have parties themed around the movie to celebrate its excellence. It's also a great icebreaker when trying to hook up with men. I guarantee that you will love it! Here is a breakdown of the plot: An ugly girl named Sarah is wishing doom upon her baby brother, so naturally, the Goblin King comes to the rescue, kidnapping the infant. Jareth (Bowie) dances lovingly with the lucky baby and his devilish minions, while unfortunate Sarah has to find her way through the conundrum that is the Labyrinth. She comes upon many mysterious creatures. Some (like me and my friends) have the ability to take off their heads and throw them around. Sarah meets "helping hands" and magical dogs. There is also a beautiful romance written into this adventurous tale. The love between Jareth and Sarah is the purest love I have ever witnessed, and don't quote me on this, but sometimes I imagine I am Sarah... standing on the stair-steps, waiting for Jareth's body to defy gravity and walk up from his position standing on the ceiling underneath the platform. I won't spoil the ending, so I have not checked the "spoiler" check-box.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Henson's movies always suffer from slow or boring plots. The characters and stories are lovable, and the sets and costumes are out-of-the-ballpark mad-awesome. Yes, these sets and costumes are the stars of the show, but the plots and dialog tend to be a bit lacking.I kinda like the image of wholesome empowerment for young ladies (a la Miyazaki) that exudes from this movie. Here we have Jennifer Connelly (Yowza!), a little lady who doesn't like her brother, so she wishes for goblins to take him away. And so they do, and she has to fight her way through David Bowie's crazy dreamworld to get him back. Supposing she gets him back at all! *bites nails* The song David Bowie sings when he finally makes his big appearance is truly, depressingly bad. Jeebas, you'd think they could've written something really rockin' for the big showdown. Wasn't Tangerine Dream on every film maker's speed dial in the 1980s? (rhetorical question) TD did soundtracks to movies called Sorceror and Thief. Considering this movie is about both sorcerors and thieves and Jennifer Connelly, TD would've fit right in. Oh well. *sigh* To me, Jim Henson's stuff shone brightest when someone else was writing the dialog. The man was a true gem in the world of special effects and ambiance. Too bad nobody makes 'em like this anymore. People jest don't got tha guts!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is--very 80s and very glittery. And you can't help but love it.I wish that filmmakers nowadays would make children's movies more along these lines. Slightly dark, but magical and intelligent instead of bland and overly polished. This movie is far more lighthearted than The Dark Crystal, another Henson production.I love Bowie as Jareth; you can tell he loved being Jareth. His costumes are glam rock, his tights--very tight, make up over the top, and his hair crazy but it all fits the character well. I do think his acting is slightly underrated for this film. He exudes confidence despite some very cheesy dialog and plays the role well. Some of the songs are almost embarrassing and unnecessary, such as "Dance Magic" or the firey sequence, but they are made up for by the wonderful Escher scene.Connelly is fine as Sarah--though a little overacted at times.The puppetry is great fun, as are the little details sprinkled throughout the film.It does seem somewhat dated, the outfits, songs and soundtrack are plucked straight from the 80s, but that is part of the charm. I never saw it when I was a kid, and have only recently discovered it. It is good fun. I have read some reviewers saying that this movie isn't for children because of the underlying "tension" between 15 year old Sarah and much older Jareth. It is subtle (would go unnoticed by little kids), and one sided. Jareth is trying to seduce her , but she never reciprocates (he never gropes her and never tries to kiss her). Even when they dance in the ball room there is the 6-12 inches of clearance between them. There is not much about this movie that is horribly inappropriate for children, maybe for very sensitive young ones, but that is it. Lighten up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little lethargic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in the theater when I was young and have seen it three to four times since. The first time I liked seeing it as it was different and I like Bowie. Hover since then I find the singing was not done very well, Bowie was very lethargic and too laid back and his acting skills a little suspect. Overall the story was a little boring, or at least presented that way.I know people are supposed to love babies, but personally I found all the crying enough to make me ask for a Goblin King to come take ME away. I found this part of the story a little silly, but then most of the movie was. It would have been a lot better without the singing.Personally, I find I much prefer The Dark Crystal over Labyrinth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as dark crystal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming a couple of years after the far more accomplished Dark Crystal this is relatively straight-forward but still a helluva lot more imaginative than any family movie of recent years. You could call it a modern fairy tale, but it's just not deep enough. And for a film called Labyrinth, it's strangely uncomplicated.Jennifer Connelly (younger and prettier, though her acting is questionable) stars as Sarah, a teenager who bizarrely doesn't have a boyfriend and ends up living in her own fantasy world. Her dad and stepmother go out, leaving her to babysit her baby brother. Annoyed with his crying she utters a magical spell, wishing the goblins to take him away. Sure as sugar, the Goblin King himself (Tina Turner, oh sorry...I mean David Bowie) turns up and takes away the screaming tot.In order to get him back she must solve 'The Labyrinth' (cue dramatic music) and reach the Goblin King's Castle within 13 hours. Along the way she meets new friends (of the Jim Henson variety) in the form of Hoggle the dwarf, big, hairy and cuddly Ludo and cute little fox Sir Didymus. It's pleasant enough entertainment but there are some serious problems.The most serious of them all is David Bowie's attire. Most specifically, his trousers, they are a little revealing in the crotch department to make an understatement. You'll cringe, you'll avert your eyes, yet you'll be mesmerized. Come on, how could this have been allowed in a family movie. Plus, Trevor Jones' score is disappointingly unmagical and the filmmakers have given in to the urge to have David Bowie crank out some dreadfully 80's tunes that stagger the action and hold up the plot.It's a shame to call Labyrinth nostalgic. But if it were made today it would be full of hollow CGI. There's something charming in practical effects and puppetry (or is that Muppetry?) that no computer graphic can generate. The photography and is stunning and it captures landscape and fantasy perfectly. And all those cute Jim Henson characters are far more interesting than any Hobbit.Filmed in Panavision, the 2.35:1 anamorphic picture looks good. But not exceptionally so. Columbia are so hyped up over their Superbit releases. And that's fine when considering newer movies. But for a film like Labyrinth we really should have a brand new, hi-def remastering. THAT would have looked super. What we have however is just a good-looking movie. There's hardly any grain, no dirt (surprising considering the age of the print) and perfect colors.Originally recorded in Dolby Stereo, the first DVD release was in 2.0 surround only. For this Superbit release Columbia have given us a full 5.1 track in Dolby Digital and DTS. How does it sound? Like 2.0 surround. There is hardly any deep bass. It's front speaker biased, with little or no surround use and there's practically no difference between the Dolby or DTS tracks. We could have been given a full 6.1 track with stronger remastering of the original sound elements. How cool would that be?As this is a Superbit, there are no extras. The original DVD release had an hour long documentary on it. But this Superbit is only slightly better in quality, so it's up to you to decide which one you want. Also, there is a Collector's Edition which includes this version plus loads more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagination overload</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth', I was wowed by its imagination and creativity. Every scene brought some new creature or environment that had me smiling in appreciation. The only thing I can compare it to is 'The Wizard of Oz'. But, not unlike Henson's 'The Dark Crystal', I found myself growing more and more emotionally detached as it went along. I try not to analyze these things too much as I'm watching it, but a comment by Roger Ebert that I read on its Wiki afterwords summed up my feelings perfectly; "Ebert said that as the film was set in an "arbitrary world" none of the events in it had any consequences, robbing the film of any dramatic tension.".I would whole-heartedly recommend it on its artistry and imagination alone, but it seems like that focus left precious little time for the other elements of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable fantasy in which a teen girl needs to find her baby brother and goes into a fantastic world , a land beyond imagination . It deals with 15-year-old Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) accidentally wishes her baby half-brother , Toby (Toby Froud) away to the Goblin King Jareth (David Bowie) who will keep Toby if Sarah does not complete his Labyrinth in 13 hours. As she enters into labyrinth where everything seems possible and nothing is what it seems. Sarah has to rescue him before midnight, or the baby will became a goblin.Fantastic fairy tale about a girl who dives into a wonderous fantasy world through a labyrinth , in which to be showed a fabulous sense of wonder , imagination , astonishment and amazement . This is a gorgeous story specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as possible . This wonderful flick is an enjoyable tale with great charm from a screenplay by Terry Jones , being based on a story by Dennis Lee and the same filmmaker Jim Henson , trying to incorporate too much dreamland with fantastic beings like Goblins , dwarfs , fairies , giant monsters , among others weird and bizarre creatures . They have been made by means of puppets and no by computer generator effects but at the time hadn't been invented . As the Ludo rig originally weighed over 100 pounds, but was brought down to just over 75 pounds, as it was becoming too difficult for the actor/puppeteer inside the suit. However , the owl in the title sequence is computer generated , the first attempt at a photo-realistic CGI animal character in a feature film . The visual beauty of the impressive scenarios give the movie a real sense of wonder and surprise . Breathtaking production design and sets are visually rousing and appealing . And a spectacular "Dance Magic" scene consisted of over 48 puppets, 52 puppeteers, and 8 people in goblin costumes . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Alex Thomson . Imaginative and sensitive musical score by Trevor Jones ; including various agreeable songs by the great David Bowie . The movie was stunningly directed by Jim Henson , early deceased at 53 years old , though was his final feature film , however, being continued his work by his son Brian Henson . Jim established the Creature Shop, a puppet studio and as he directed the successful "The Muppet Show" (1976) , it became a smash hit and would eventually become the most widely watched series in television history. Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made The Muppets movie(1979), defying the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a movie . The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which included the moody fantasy Dark Crystal (1982), which was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous work . The most successful TV work in the 1980s was "Fraggle Rock" (1983), that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry as ILM was at special effects . When he died all too soon in 1990, he was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting environmentalism and his brilliant "The story teller" (1988) series respectively attest to and , of course , this ¨Labyrinth¨.</fullReview>

I watched this movie as a kid and I am determined my kids will have the same experience. Great for kids around 10 years of age this magical tale of Sarah who must take on Jareth the King of The Goblins. He's ruthless and will use any trick to get what he wants.

		<shortDescription>A Jim Henson and David Bowie Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far more entertaining than "The Dark Crystal" and perhaps Henson's answer to "Fantasia". It's a good comparison, as both were the best work of two media geniuses, and neither were financial successes at the box office. Both were also "panned" by movie critics. David Bowie is the only person who could have played "Jereth" the Goblin King. His songs and the main theme fit the movie perfectly. Produced with all the cutting edge "wizardry" of it's time, it still holds up well today. The story is a bit confusing at first, because the "prologue" was either cut from the screenplay or the film. Her mother is not dead. Her dad has remarried. Mom "ran off" with a rock star that strongly resembled David Bowie. How does magic fit into all of this? Does she imagine the whole thing? It's a fantasy. The comparisons to "Alice and Wonderland", "The Wizard of Oz", and "Where the Wild Things Are" are (somewhat) obvious. "Sarah" must wander through the enchanted "Labyrinth" to save "Toby", her new baby brother, from The Goblin King. Costume issues: Jennifer, like Annette Funicello, is growing up much too fast, and her costumes try to minimize this. David Bowie is a bit too "perky" in his skin-tight spandex tights. Instead of the Cowardly Lion, we have the furry cowardly gentle giant beast "Ludo". Very entertaining and otherwise quite original with incredible special effects. Amazing puppetry, and a lot of people in "Muppet suits". All new characters. None of the usual Muppet gang. As in all Henson productions, war-like behavior is ridiculed, as is greed and avaricious behavior. (The "Junk Lady" is the collector of useless, meaningless items, and shows that these things "cling" to all of us.) Children will see it as "fairy tale" or adventure. Adults will comprehend it's deeper meaning. My only dislikes are the gnome peeing in the stream, and the "Bog of Eternal Stench". The "helping hands" are a 40 foot drop! The giant mechanical warrior is an amazing feat. Perhaps the world's tallest "Muppet". The talking "cannon-balls" ("Did I hit anything?") are too much fun! Trademark Henson ending, with a reprise of all the "imaginary" characters! Excellent featurettes show how amazing the puppetry and sets were, especially for 1986! (David Bowie's other masterpiece is "The Man Who Fell to Earth".)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun fantasy film - quite enjoyable to watch. I was 14 when the movie came out and I enjoyed it then and still enjoy it now. This is the type of film that kids and adults alike can love.To describe this film I would say it is "The Dark Crystal" meets "Alice in Wonderland" meets "Snow White" meets "Cinderella" meets "The Neverending Story". Labyrinth is just as good as all the films I have mentioned.David Bowie is absolutely perfect for the role of Jareth the Goblin King - wonderful performance by Bowie and his songs for this film are quite good.I loved the character Hoggle - he's quite an interesting little guy. Ludo is so lovable (he's nothing like Chewbacca yet he reminds me of the Wookie lol). Sir Didymus is just cool and somehow puts me in mind of Fizzgig from The Dark Crystal. Sarah is so much like Alice (in Wonderland) lost in a bizarrely magical surreal world.The only thing I really found wrong with the film was the finale - it ended quite abruptly for me - and I think it should have tied up the loose ends with Sarah's parents and baby brother. But otherwise the film is A-Maze-ing! ;) 9/10</fullReview>

With a fantastic story, beautiful visuals, stunning acting and unforgettable music, Labyrinth has received a spot on my all time favorite movies list. Labyrinth, a horribly underrated film, has held a special place in my heart since I was a child, and I have never met a person that has seen Labyrinth that hasn't thought it to be absolutely flawless. Sarah, the epitome of teen angst, is being prowled upon by David Bowie in super tight pants after banishing her baby brother to a land of goblins. I can think of very few things that are more interesting than that. Bowie delivers a fabulous performance, creating a gloriously sensual antagonistic character(though, somewhat pedophile), and Jennifer Connelly, one of the prettiest ladies in Hollywood, reminds us all of how bratty we were during our teenage years. In short, Jim Henson, George Lucas, David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly. There you go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MINOR SPOILER INCLUDEDYou know a movie is good when you AND your 4-yr old can enjoy it. It passes the test of time. The music is great, the scenery is complex, the characters are creative, the costumes are fun, and the story is interesting.While there are some limitations to the special effects because of the year it was created, it is a quality movie. The choice of David Bowie as the Goblin King is fantastic. On the bonus features, they discuss how they wanted to get a current celebrity in the role (such as Michael Jackson), but David Bowie is a perfect fit for such a mysterious character. Of course, the music is all Bowie with interesting lyrics and catchy tunes. What is fun is seeing things repeated in the movie (won't say what, so I won't really spoil it). From the early scene in the bedroom, throughout the movie, and back to the bedroom, things will catch your eye!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i will start with i watched this movie as a child numerous times and absolutely loved it.16 years on i decided to watch it again, after contemplating it might ruin my memory of the film it didn't.But i will say this as a child watching the Labyrinth it was magical and a tad creepy not so much that it would give you nightmares, but enough creepiness considering it's about a goblin king (David Bowie) who wants to turn the baby he has taken into a goblin.Jennifer Connelly gave a good performance plus she is cute as the whiny "It's not fair" teen. Sarah is plunging in puberty ? that all of it might be going on in her dreams. That her companions on this journey are merely living versions of her most reassuring bedroom toys. When she departs the land, she is finally departing childhood.Of course i was not thinking this as a child, it was just a fantastic world full of puppets. It does seem to get a little aimless at times and many encounters come to nothing. Yet the puppetry is nothing short of genius from the mind of Jim Henson.Yes the effects are dated but so are some of the classics that revered by most.If you never watched this film as a child i think you missed out, watching it as an adult will never be the same but it still enjoyable. make sure you show this to your kids as I know I will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pleasurable fantasy flick from Jim Henson and Lucasfilm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the films I saw a number of times in my childhood (it came out the year I was born). Like Jim Henson's 1982 film, "The Dark Crystal", this is a puppet fantasy film (though some humans appear in this one), but I didn't see the first film of the two that much while growing up, and now that I have seen it more than once within the past couple years, I have to admit, while many like it, I don't. However, watching "Labyrinth" again twice in the past couple years, my first viewings in probably nearly a decade at least, was different, in a good way. I now see more flaws in the film than I used to back in the day, but it certainly hasn't completely lost its charm.Sarah is a fifteen-year-old girl with a strong passion for fantasy and fairy tales. One night, her father and stepmother leave her to babysit her baby half-brother, Toby. Soon after they leave, Sarah is annoyed by Toby's non-stop crying, and after saying some lines from "Labyrinth", one of the books she likes, she says she wishes the goblins would come and take him away! Soon after she says this, she sees that Toby is no longer in his crib! She meets Jareth the Goblin King, and realizes what she has done! The goblins really have taken the baby boy, and he will become one of them in thirteen hours unless Sarah makes it through a labyrinth to their castle in time! So, the teenager then begins her trek, and learns that the labyrinth is very dangerous and complex! Jareth will only make it harder for her! The main character, Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly (one of her early film roles), is unfortunately a bit of an absurd one. A fifteen-year-old getting all worked up over a baby taking her teddy bear?! She can be maybe a tad irritating at times, and Connelly doesn't put on a very good performance in the role, which makes the film lose points. Fortunately, this only occasionally drags the film down, and there's enough to make up for that one character. On the journey, Sarah meets a number of likable and sometimes humorous puppet characters, and finds herself in some fascinating places. The humour is sometimes perhaps a little too kiddish, but I still got a good number of laughs from it. The 1986 fantasy flick also contains suspense and appropriate music for it. Rock star David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King is another highlight, and so are some of the songs he contributed to the film.This Jim Henson project tanked at the box office, but fortunately, since then, it seems to have turned out to be one of those films which has gained a strong cult following since its box office failure, and I certainly can't question why! Although by no means perfect, "Labyrinth" is a decent fantasy film, directed by Jim Henson and co-written by Henson, poet Dennis Lee, and Terry Jones of Monty Python fame! With all the puppets and sets, it obviously took a lot of effort and a lot of people to make this movie, many people who deserve a lot of credit, and their hard work paid off! Does this film have more for kids than adults? Well, maybe, but it's definitely not strictly a kids' movie. Many adults seem to like it as well, and seeing it after growing up, that doesn't surprise me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great family fantasy fun. Tra la laaa!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, I remember seeing Jennifer Connelly on TV (I think it was on Blue Peter), talking about the making of her new fantasy film, Labyrinth. I was instantly smitten by the gorgeous brunette and made a point of seeing the film at the cinema when it came out. Although my primary reason for going was to gaze at the stunning actress for a full 100 minutes or so, I also found myself enjoying the film on less libidinous levels.Jim Henson (of The Muppets fame) delivers a dark fairy tale laden with messages that will resonate more with the viewer the older they get. For children, Labyrinth is simply a visually arresting and magical tale with wonderfully imaginative characters. Older viewers, however, will pick up on several strong themes within the story: responsibility, the importance of imagination, sacrifice, and the difficult journey from childhood to adulthood.Sarah (Connelly) is a teenager who lives her life with her head in the clouds, spending her days dreaming of faraway lands and magical worlds. When her father and stepmother leave her to look after her baby stepbrother, she selfishly wishes for the screaming toddler be taken away by Jareth the Goblin King (David Bowie). Her wish is granted: Jareth whisks the kid off to his castle, leaving a stunned Sarah only 13 hours to try and get him back (after which, the boy becomes a goblin!).Sarah sets off on a rescue mission, finding her way through the complex labyrinth that surrounds the castle, meeting new friends on the way, learning a few valuable lessons about life, and growing up a bit in the process.With some wonderfully inventive sets (think Dali crossed with Escher), loads of memorable characters, and a few catchy songs, Labyrinth is enormously entertaining. Bowie is great as Jareth, who chews up the scenery whilst wearing a ridiculous costume (which includes package enhancing tights and a silly wig), stopping occasionally to perform a tune or two. He also manages to say the words 'Tra la la' with a straight face?bravo, Mr. Bowie!And Connelly... well, let's just say that I find her difficult to fault.The fantastical characters that inhabit the domain of the goblin king are a fun mixture of Henson puppetry and animatronics, which are only let down by the occasional visible wire or spot of bad 'matting' (particularly noticeable when Sarah meets The Fireys?creatures that can remove their own body parts).Towards the end of the film, the pace does lull a tad (I find the sequence in the goblin town rather overlong and unfunny), but, on the whole, Labyrinth is a terrific family movie that stands up well to repeat viewings.Which means I can watch young Jen time and time again without worrying too much about getting bored. Hurrah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been watching this film when I was a kid at 6. This movie is really terrific and I watch it over ten times. But my copy lost and I didn't find another one in shops. However, after ten more years, I still remember clearly the songs in this film. David Bowie's voice is so sexy and charm. Especially in the song "As the world falls down". I like the scene so much! And Jennifer Connelly was very beautiful in that scene. The film was made before the age of CG. When I watched the making of, I am so amazed with the setting and all puppets in the film. I really can't imagine Hoggle's expression is controlled by 4 actors.I got a chance to watch it again (as DVD rental is so much easier now) and remind me the fantasy. It is really a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film not only for children but for adults. Very Honest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film as a child and just recently watched it again. I saw a lot of truth in it. People lead you into this confusion of the emotional labyrinth and you run and jump through hoops until you can tell them "you have no power over me". How often we do this with people and with ourselves.Actions, thoughts, words, emotions etc create confusion, fear, anxiety within us that takes a position of power over us. It is only when we realize that we can claim power over these things at any time that we are truly free. Until then we journey over the same steps over and over again confused and lost. It is also a film about the meaning of friendship. That those true to us will always be there. Before her main furry friends disappear from her room they say to her "but if you need us, if you really need us"and she rejoices with them and her new found freedom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forever ...not long at all, if you're watching Labyrinth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to pick the best movie, of all movies ever, Labyrinth is it. Labyrinth takes you to an underworld, where the clock strikes 13 and the way forwards is sometimes the way back. Sarah, a young girl wishing she lived in a fantasy world gets her wish when she tells her baby brother a make-believe story which becomes true. By saying the words "I wish the goblin king would take you away, right now", Sarah gave the Goblin king the power to do just that. Instantly Sarah finds herself underground begging the king for her brothers return. The Goblin King gives her 13 hrs to solve the Labyrinth before her baby brother becomes a goblin forever. Sarah faces an exciting journey full of fantasy, and adversity as she makes her way through the labyrinth meeting various friends (hoggle, ludo, sir didamus) along the way. In the world where walls move, fruits drug, and rocks are friends Sarah learns not to take things for granted, and most importantly that life isn't fair, but that's the way it is. David Bowie, who plays the Goblin King, also does the soundtrack. Every song is integral to the movie, and literally part of the script for example: "How you turn my world, you precious thing. You starve and near exhaust me. Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one." shows how he truly believes he loves her and is giving her what she wants by being cruel. When not singing, his acting is perfect, the taunting way he tries to seduce Sarah while never relinquishing control, allows you to feel his power. "Just love me, fear me, do as I say, and I will be your slave. Look what I'm offering you... your dreams". Makes you almost wish she'd give in. The ending is perfect as she realizes all he is offering is a dream and she can finally say "You have no power over me!". I can literally recite this movie word for word, lyric for lyric, and I'd still watch it a hundred more times! You won't just watch Labyrinth, you'll be engulfed by it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting artifact of its time. Muppets, muppets everywhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire this movie. Jim Henson and his gang, responsible for the Muppets and all the Muppet shows, did a wonderful job with characterizations and the sets. But honestly, I saw it for the then 14 year old Jennifer Connelly (the DVD extras make it clear she was 14 during filming) who has grown up to be one our finest, and most attractive, actresses 20 years later.Connelly plays Sarah who resents having to baby sit too often for her crying little half-brother. So, she wishes the goblins would come and take him away. Her wish is granted, and only then does she realize how bad she was, and the whole movie then becomes her quest to retrieve the baby. David Bowie is superb as Jareth the Goblin King, and to get the baby back Sarah must get to his home, the castle on the hill, before 13 O'clock. The difficulty is the labyrinth of walls and other obstacles between Sarah and the castle.Most of the other characters are muppets that end up hindering or helping Sarah, depending on how quick her thinking is. Connelly does a good job as Sarah, and it is just fun to see her in an early role. Those who are fans of muppets and Henson projects likely think this is a superb movie. Others will come away a bit bored.SPOILERS. Sarah does make it to the castle right before 13 O'clock, and is transported back home where the baby now sleeps comfortably. But it isn't a dream, as various muppet characters end up there with her too. And, just in time before parents returned at midnight, to find all is well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wondefully engaging.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labrynth is a tremendously engaging film which served to showcase the young talents of Jenifer Connelly, as well as highlight those of David Bowie. The Henson crew is well represented in the many memorable characters, as well as Brian Froud's imaginative designs.The story borrows heavily from both Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz, where a young girl is whisked away to a fantasy world, or is she? Is it all in her imagination, or is her imagination so powerful that it has created a living world?Young Sarah feels put upon, having to watch her baby brother and being pulled from her fantasy world into a much darker and less satisfying reality. Typical teenage stuff. She makes a poorly chosen wish, and lives to regret it. She must enter her fantasy realm, and soon finds it is far more dangerous than in her make believe games. She is helped along the way by an odd assortment of creatures, but her charm and intelligence sees her through, despite the efforts of the seductive Goblin King.Labrynth encompasses the greatness of fairy tales; the metaphors for the maturing process, the hidden depths of the characters, the primordial terror. It also features the wizardry of the Henson team, with their wonderfully life-like creatures. The muppet feel is at first jarring, but quickly sucks you in. You soon forget they are puppets and think of them as real creatures.Jennifer Connelly makes a spectacular debut as a lead (she had a few films under her belt), definitely hinting at her success to come. She seems equally mature and innocent, and is a vision of youthful beauty. David Bowie is the perfect choice for the Goblin King; a unique presence, seductive and repellent. The various character performers give full personalities to their puppets, allowing you to forget that they are puppets.The music is memorable, although a few pieces can be a bit annoying. Some of Bowie's music doesn't quite work, but it does mesh with the story.Labrynth is a wonderful fantasy film and a great family film. There are real scares throughout, but also memorable characters and engaging music. This is the type of family entertainment that inspires youthful imagination, rather than just providing a diversion for and hour or so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, what a feast for the eyes! What a brilliant film, what a marvelous cast - Bowie, Connelly, what a great soundtrack! This film is bordering very closely to the term Perfect. Such a brilliant story could appear only as a joint result of so many people - director, actors, composer and the Muppet makers. David Bpowie is impeccable in his high wig and his cool, bored manners, while Jennifer Connelly is maybe here in her best role in the whole life. She is open, naive, honest and sweet teen who looks for her kidnapped little brother. Other great characters are Ludo, talking door knobs, little pesty goblins themselves. Just watch this excellent entertaining film and enjoy a great flight of humor, of excellent Bowie's songs, where Within You is the best, and just admire the first rate production!</fullReview>

It has some absolutely wonderful characters that you can really get attached to and really relate to which makes you feel like you're more in the movie. Even as small, small child Labarynth was my favourite movie and remains my favourite to this day and i can sit down and watch it with my entire family which really means that is has something. David Bowie's Music in this could not be any better - "Magic Jump" in particular. In short - anyone who has not seen this movie; i urge you to go out, rent it, watch it, love it, buy it, and treasure it until the day you die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>be careful what you wish for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i first saw this film at the age of 12 and immediately fell in love both with it and David bowie. this is not your average fairy tale, its darkly comic and slightly Gothic charms are the perfect antidote to the saccharine sweetness of so many Disney movies. the story is wonderfully inventive, the songs memorable and, considering it was made in the 80's, some of the visual effects are quite stunning. bowie's performance as the goblin king has got to be his best ever, managing to combine power, world-weary cynicism, a wicked sense of humour and just a hint of sadness. it is impossible to dislike his character and, by the end of the film, i actually felt sorry for him. Jennifer Connelly's progression from a spoilt brat living in her own fantasy world to mature, sensible and responsible big sister is subtle enough to avoid being preachy, whilst still being a timely warning to all brats out there. of course, the human cast members are completely overshadowed by Jim Henson's fabulous puppet stars, most notably sir didymus and hoggle (although hoggle was actually an actress in a suit). the final showdown between bowie and Connelly, utilising the designs of m. Escher, was simply amazing. this may be a fantasy film, but it's not just for the kids. this one is a delight for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairy tale type movie about a girl who learns many life lessons while on her way to get her baby brother back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember when I first saw this movie. I was around 10 years old and it never tired me to watch it over and over and over.At the time I didn't understand many things in the movie, the lessons of life. It were the characters, played by real people and by puppets alike, which won my heart and made me want to return to that world time and again.I was so sad when my brother accidentally recorded something else over my Labyrint video. It never aired again and I slowly forgot about it only to remember it every now and again when seeing or hearing the names of David Bowie or Jennifer Connely, or the word labyrinth.And now, almost two decades later, I found it again! This time, when watching it with adult eyes, I judged the movie differently. I saw details, little touches which I hadn't notice before as a child. Also, I noticed the life lessons (don't take everything for granted, don't say things in anger for example) and guess what, even though the movie has been made in a time when technology wasn't as advanced as what we have today, it was still very good! It's the story itself, the acting of the characters, the dialogues which make this movie so special. I've seen many movies made with super modern technology, yet they didn't impress me as much as Labyrint still does, because they have no real story. It's the special effects that carry those movies, you take their special effects away, there is nothing left. A real good movie, to me, is carried by the excellent dialogues, acting, good story lines.Labyrint is still a great movie. I've shown it to my children and they loved it. It was great to share something that is special to me with my children and watch them enjoy it as much as I did as a kid.Even watching it as an adult is a pleasure. I was first afraid, that perhaps in my memory I might have lifted this movie up too high, after all, as a child you value different things than as an adult and your memory often makes you remember what you want to remember and how you want to remember something. So I was prepared for a disappointment. It wasn't even necessary.This movie is as good today, in 2006, as it was back in the 80's. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's face it, the eighties gave us the best of everything: best music, best movies, best acting, etc. Now, we get leftovers that have been churned out a thousand times and remakes that make me nauseous. Labyrinth is a breath of fresh air from all that.Despite Jim Henson being dead and gone, his movies live on- and Labyrinth rules supreme. Well, to me, anyways. With a combination of (gasp) original ideas, characters, and enchanting music, Labyrinth is a classic that is overshadowed by travesties such as LOTR.For those of us who were around in the 80's, like myself, chances are, you were familiar with David Bowie, rock god. He pulls himself up from that disaster The Hunger and plays Jareth the goblin king with wit, charm, and charisma that you can't deny.Jennifer Connelly- whom, I already loved from Phenomena/Seven minutes in Heaven- was perfect for Sarah- she had the right tone, right intelligence, right facial expressions- every scene where she wasn't in it left me begging Henson to bring her back (which he did! :) Labyrinth has everything that movies today only WISH that they could possess: great acting, great cast all around, fun/original storyline (Quick! Hide! It's an original IDEA!!!) and it's fun for the whole family.Labyrinth is a classic, a gem that will always have a special place in my heart. If you haven't seen this beautiful masterpiece yet, please do so. After all- the only things in life that one should regret are the things that you haven't done. Make sure missing Labyrinth isn't one of them.</fullReview>

It seems easy at first but soon she is stuck in a labyrinth of helping hands, confusion, falling, talking worms, trolls, fairies, bird heads, a pirate dog and a garbage dump.Everything in this movie is Jim Henson. The puppets are just something that he would do. The music and the costumes are a little cheesy but it's really good. It is a great movie that I remember watching over and over again when I was a girl.One thing that I thought was weird was the tights on Goblin King.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best fantasy flicks that I have ever seen in my entire life. First of all, we have Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) a teenager who has a wild imagination. All Sarah wants is an adventure, and she wishes for the goblins to come take her baby brother away, and the goblins listen. Exit baby brother Toby, enter David Bowie as Jareth, the Goblin King. Jareth tells Sarah that she has "13 hours in which to solve the Labyrinth", or else her baby brother will become one of them (the goblins) forever.So what does Sarah do, well she decides that no matter what she has to solve the Labyrinth to get her brother back. Aww, what a cute story line, oh did I mention that David Bowie and all his goblin friends, don't want her to get the baby back. Will Sarah solve the labyrinth in time to save Toby? Well, to do it she might need some help along the way, maybe director Jim Henson could send a couple of puppets to help her. What, that's what he does? That's right, there's a bunch of puppets that make this movie excellent. This is the perfect movie for anybody that wants an adventure. It's got everything in it, action, drama and of course yes there is some comedic and also touching moments. There's also an excellent soundtrack featuring songs written and performed by David Bowie himself.So, if your looking for the perfect adventure be prepared to enter, "The Labyrinth". I gave this movie 10 out of 10, because I loved the story, it really sucked me right in, and it had tons of memorable characters, I loved them all, there all my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality vs. Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best children's literature is deep enough that it is really adult literature. The best children's films contain thought-provoking material for adults. This is one of those films.We are introduced to Sarah (played to perfection by Jennifer Connelly--I have never seen a more brilliant representation of a teenaged girl) as a girl whose fantasy life, based on a book "Labyrinth", so engages her that she forgets about her babysitting obligations. She views her stepmother as a "wicked stepmother" in a fairy tale. Soon she will wish that the goblins (representing her fantasy life) will take away her brother (representing her real-life responsibilities) altogether. As King Lear says, "That way madness lies." She enters the fantasy world to recover her reality.What ensues is a lot of fun, and is as amazingly imaginative as one would expect with such names as George Lucas, Jim Henson, Brian Froud and Terry Jones in the credits. The fantasy life, represented by the Goblin King (The understated menace of David Bowie's performance as an actor is underrated) appears as a labyrinth trying to divert Sarah from her goal. The labyrinth becomes less literal as her journey continues and the diversions include a romantic (not sexual) fantasy with the Goblin King and the temptation to lock herself into her room and to keep the world outside.THIS MAY BE A SPOILER: Finally the Goblin King explicitly offers the comfort of abandoning her real-life responsibilities to embrace her fantasy life: "Obey me, and I will be your slave." She responds to this paradox by expressly accepting responsibility for her own life. By doing this she has attained adulthood by putting fantasy into perspective. Adulthood does not mean abandoning fantasy (the fantasy characters are still alive) but keeping it in its place; Sarah can now address her duties as a babysitter, a sister and a daughter.END SPOILER The movie would have been much better if the whole "Magic Dance" sequence were cut. The song isn't that great, Bowie looks like a git prancing around (spoiling his performance elsewhere), it slows the action down and moves the plot forward not one whit. The ballroom dance segment is also quite long; guys will tire of it much more quickly than girls and young women.Notwithstanding the serious issues dealt with in the film, it is just plain fun. So much attention is paid to details and incidental characters that they steal the show: the next time you feel like you're talking to someone who's asleep, use the line "It's so stimulating being your hat!"</fullReview>

This isn't any ordinary hedge maze... this thing is freaky and full of puppets! Ugly puppets, and most of them are up to no good. So the lesson in this movie is be careful what you wish for or you might have to take it back by being forced to go through a giant maze full of some messed up s*** and be forced to stare at David Bowie's bulge! It is big though....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a traditional muppet movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>david bowie made this movie being the head goblin, and with the tightness of the tights, i was lead to think other things. the movie is about a brat that cant handle the responsiblities of babysitting, and wishes that goblins and ghouls will steal the baby! but of course, she is talking out of spite and when the baby does go missing, she realizes that the fantasy that the "goblin king" has becomes a reality. i found the music addicting and was anxious, since it was a muppet movie and i wanted to see the creative creatures that she would meet along the labyrinth. the labyrinth stuck me as an odd name for a movie, so i looked up the word and discovered it's a board game with mazes that twist and turn. so i understood that significant meaning and found it to be rather original. the movie is a guaranteed hit to those who either like muppets or the entertaining of david bowie's musicals talents and his appearance, alone that could help several people, one being my sister.

They just don't make em' like they used to make em'. Today all we have is cluttered CGI-fests like Star Wars. Nothing compares to the original wizardry and inventiveness of these movies.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in high school, on a bus trip, in a period of my life when I hated all movies and thought they were worthless. Nevertheless, it made so large an impression on me-- despite the fact that the fact that I had been paying it no attention, and trying to study-- that I've always since remembered it. The instant I realized that this film is called "The Labyrinth" and stars 'that-one-chick-who-was-in-Beautiful-Mind,' I had to immediately see it again.It's an amazing tapestry of rich characters, original ideas, and brilliant sets. The acting is superb- if Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) annoys some people, it's *because* her acting is superb. She's supposed to be a whiny little teenager. And the Goblin King (David Bowie) is at his best. He's perfect for the part, and his songs range from breath taking to haunting to unutterably beautiful.The film includes funny moments, scary moments, silly moments, and heart-wrenching moments. Every piece of it is woven together to make a truly superb movie. I enjoyed every minute watching this film, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and moving adventure. But I do recommend it ONLY if you have an imagination- the ending seems to baffle those that have no depth of mind. Unexplained details and puzzling, unresolved mysteries only add to the wonder and magic of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE LABYRINTH. I LOVE LABYRINTH. I LOVE LABYRINTH. If I say it enough times everyone who reads this will too :PThere are some in this world who hate this movie. I know of one person myself, who feels the only good thing about it is David Bowie with a mullet.Then there are those, like me, and most people I know, who see it as a high point in cinema. Now I'm not a 'Star Wars' fan, in fact I only watch the original for Peter Cushing, and I only want to see the latest for Christopher Lee. But George Lucas DID make 'Howard The Duck', which can only be a good thing. Jim Henson is a god - that was already universally known before I started this. Terry Jones is a god also - hey, he's a Python! David Bowie is also one of my favourite musicians, who, despite comments to the contrary, has proved he can act in films such as 'The Man Who Fell To Earth', 'Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence', 'The Linguini Incident' and of course 'Labyrinth'.Jennifer Connolly puts in an early performance of merit sixteen years before her Oscar win, and Bowie is fantastic and, as many members of the opposite sex have told me, very sexy as Jareth. Then there are the others. They a re not muppets, they are not animatronic creatures - as far as I'm concerned they are alive. They may as well be as they are so lifelike it's unbelievable. Hoggle, Ludo, The Worm, The Fieries, and especially Sir Didymus (hee hee :) hee hee) are all wonderful creatures you'd love to meet, and I'm not just speaking for myself when I say how great it would be to have a house full of goblins ala Jareth's Castle.The imagery is wonderful, the script first rate, the acting from the leads and the puppeteers superb. The music is the best Bowie made between 'Scary Monsters' in 1981 and '1. Outside' in 1995. There is nothing wrong with this film whatsoever. When I watched 'The Godfather' I thought "Yeah - a good movie, a great movie" but I wasn't enthralled by it - it didn't make me feel uplifted. "Labyrinth" does. In a world when films like 'Titanic' and 'Gone With The Wind' are applauded for their extravagances, 'Labyrinth' is a breath of fresh air. It is not stale like most 80's movies today, and it leaves me with a feeling of pure enjoyment and happiness every time I watch it - which is at least once a month by the way...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Connelly was just starting her career when she made Labyrinth. Unfortunately it shows. As Sarah, her acting has its moments, and though she has sub-par dialog, her character grew on me. The sets are incredibly colorful and fairy-tale-like. However, they look cramped and fake. This unusual world tells a rarely told story in movies, one of growing up from a child into an adult. Sarah begins the story still in her fairy-tale world. Her room is a beautiful collection of childhood dolls, figures, and toys. New posters of plays and actresses are also apparent, however. Suffering, babysitting Toby every weekend, "its not fair!," she cries, and she's right. Inside the labyrinth she realizes life isn't fair. Life is complex, bewildering, full of choices and decisions. **If the other user comments haven't spoiled the ending yet, stop reading.** By the end Sarah has her baby brother back, and for it given up a romance with an unusual prince-charming. She hands Toby her teddy bear Lancelot to keep, then goes to her room alone. In the mirror her Labyrinth friends appear. She realizes that while growing up is hard, her friends and her childhood memories will still be there for her.</fullReview>

Not only was it wonderful when I was seven, but it is still wonderful today. Labyrinth was one of the fantasy movies put out in the mid-80's, others would include Princess Bride, Willow, Legend, Krull and Dark Crystal (which are all good movies) however, Labyrinth was a step above the rest. The soundtrack is great, most songs are by David Bowie and the characters (mostly muppets) are very lovable. Although the plot is simple the movie is incredibly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell in love with this movie the very first time I saw it, which was back then when I was about nine or ten years old. This movie's captivating, a true fantasy classic with a romantic twist in it. What I love about it too is that I can in many ways relate to our lovely heroine, Sarah. She has lots of dreams which seem to be impossible to come true through the ordinary eye, but she knew that deep down in her heart, they could. This is a wonderful movie, and I don't think I know one person in the world who didn't see or dislike this movie. David Bowie was THE PERFECT rock star to play the Goblin King - other options were Sting (which wouldn't be a bad choice either), Mick Jagger (sorry, I can't picture it!), and Michael Jackson (what was Jim Henson thinking when he thought about putting Michael Jackson in this movie???).The movie set doesn't look like a movie set at all...it's very life like. I LOVE the style of the whole Labyrinth that surrounds Jareth's castle and the Goblin City. I love the beautiful ball room where Sarah dances with Jareth - VERY VERY ROMANTIC!!! AHHHHHHH!Brian Froud is one of my favorite artists of all time, and I think that his work on illustrating the Goblins, the masquerade masks, and all the other strange and fascinating characters in this film was pure magic! The movie itself is very magical itself!I say that this is THE best fantasy film of all time. I miss Jim Henson very much. Jim Henson is truly one of the greatest film makers of all time, and I still adore his work and his creativity. His son, Brian Henson, is doing an excellent job keeping Jim's visions alive!!! :o)Labyrinth is the bomb, and truly one of the greatest films every made!!! :o)</fullReview>

The children of today are being deprived of a classic. Little needs to be said of Bowie's part as Jareth, the Goblin King. Every line he utters leaves you laughing, or at least grinning. He's evil yet irresistable, charming, graceful, and just about everything else. The music of this film is also great. The soundtrack lives in my cd player. "As the Worlds Falls Down" is enchanting, and "Chilly Down" and "Magic Dance" are so fun you want to get up and dance. I think everyone should see this movie, because it truly is a classic.

		<fullReview>I first saw Labyrinth when I was 11 or 12. I remember being fascinated by it, and strangely enough, David Bowie was part of that strange attraction I had towards the movie. Technically, perhaps, it wasn't that well-done; they were still experimenting with the use of puppets at that time anyway, for it to be a real flaw. Jennifer Connelly was absolutely stunning, and amazingly gifted in interpreting the character, I mean, you could really believe that she was that girl so firmly aware of the Goblin King's attempts to sway and seduce her just so he could take Toby away. And Toby - what a cute baby! And Hoggle, what a goblin! Please please, Jareth, take me to the castle beyond the Goblin City. Not to mention the brilliant use of M.C Escher's artwork. I just wish they would re-release it on video, or at least, repeatedly play it on t.v. I hope this wish comes true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was another of those that watched this as a child and found it pretty scary, to watch it again now and find it more amusing than anything else. Not that that's a problem, of course.But, the diabolical 'songs' showcased during the film are incredibly awful, to the point where you wonder what was in your last drink. Not only that, but one or two weird random sequences completely ruin the rhythm and flow of the storyline, and had me puzzled as to why they were even there. That's a pity because this would otherwise have had the potential to rank alongside Neverending Story in my opinion.I will say that David Bowie does a pretty good job and looks the part, unfortunately the effect of the 'little girl lost' is rather lost itself as she is surrounded by creatures nearly all much shorter than she is, making her look tall and capable of defeating anything, which probably wasn't the idea.This film is definitely better viewed as an adult if only to capitalise on the many witty lines dealt throughout by the various characters. Having said that the whole story assumes you like babies, which may not suit everyone, me included.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently a facebook friend posted a clip from this movie, which I'd never heard of. David Bowie playing the goblin king in a Jim Henson movie? That had to be worth watching.It was, although I probably would have enjoyed it more when I was 12. For one thing, when I was 12 I wouldn't have minded Jennifer Connolly's high-school-play caliber of acting, nor the general quality of cheap kids movie that peaks out from time to time.While at times the movie feels as shoddy as a student film, at other times it shows flashes of incredible genius and imagination. But more than anything else, this movie is just really weird. Bowie is an odd choice to write songs for a children's movie, the story floats somewhere between fantasy and meta-fantasy and there is some traditional kid's movie moralizing mixed in with things you don't usually see taught in kid's films (like, life is unfair, so sometimes you have to be unfair too).I can't say this is a great movie, but I would certainly consider it well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people may scornfully label this as a "puppet movie" for "babies." Wrong! Though this creative and charming fantasy delight may be fun for the kiddies, there is plenty in this film to entertain those who are over three feet tall and know how to spell "cat."There's life lessons and a message about the "ch-ch-changes" growing up can bring, puppetry elevated to an art, (Rest in Peace Jim H.), fantastic sets and costumes, a beautiful score, AND an exquisite performance by one of modern music's handsomest, sexiest, and most talented gentlemen. I am speaking, of course, of none other than the one, the only, Mr. David Bowie.Bowie's physical beauty was glowing, his voice was as angelic as it always was, and his acting performance was enchanting as the Goblin King (Jareth). Splendid in his contoured leggings, ruffled shirt, glittering vest, and mane of golden strands (it was a wig, I know, but still. . .), The Gentleman (as I refer to Bowie on the Net, capital T capital G) cut a regally fine figure, and his voice (both singing and speech) was as sexy as ever. The Bowie songs made the film, in my opinion, and none of them would be out of place on any of the three recordings that the gorgeous and gifted Thin White Emperor (another way I designate Bowie) put out in the mid '80s. Also, Bowie is an unparalleled dancer, as showcased in the ballroom fantasy scene and the "Magic Dance" scene.This is a movie for kids, teens, grownups, romantics, dreamers, Bowie fans -- just about anyone. And if you're not a Bowie fan, this movie just may make one out of you. Never mind the Disco King, bring me the Goblin King!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things are not always what they seem in this place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is at her wit's end when she is babysitting her half brother Toby who won't stop crying and wishes the goblins from her favorite book, The Labyrinth, would come and take him away. When this actually happens, she must face the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) and find her way through his labyrinth to rescue Toby before he becomes a goblin himself in thirteen hours. Along the way, she meets a variety of fascinating creatures and faces all sorts of obstacles, for Jareth will not give up the child easily in this strange world where "anything is possible and nothing is what it seems".I was fortunate enough to see Labyrinth on its initial theatrical release and have been entranced by it ever since. To this day, it remains one of my favorite movies and is one of the few that I will pick up when I don't know what to watch. And now, some twenty years after its original release, my children also are enjoying the wonder that is Labyrinth. Along with The Wizard of Oz, there are few fantasy movies I would recommend as much for sheer enjoyment, and in many ways, this is a very similar movie.One of its biggest strengths is the wonderful puppetry by the Henson Company. Comprising a large part of the cast, these are really beautifully designed and skillfully used. Combined with some really excellent surreal set design, there is a great atmosphere of fantasy and unreality that is necessary for the story. Things like "the Helping Hands" and the staircase scene late in the movie are great.But the sets and the puppets are only part of the charm of Labyrinth. I found that the dialog in the movie, while at times a little corny, is generally witty and humorous. And the casting of Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie in their respective roles worked really well. Jennifer Connelly gave a nice performance and Bowie was incredible as the Goblin King. Shari Weiser was a good choice for the role of Hoggle too. Lots of humor and action help keep this movie rolling at a good pace so that it never gets boring. And then there is the soundtrack-wonderful music from David Bowie.All in all, this is a charming, funny and entertaining movie that is great for the whole family and stands up to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I found the Labyrinth a wonderful movie. Yes maybe the acting wasn't what it was today, maybe there weren't scenes like they could have done today. But it was a great movie! Just the basic plot line of a an angry teen who wants to follow her dream of being an actress and a writer like her mother, who then says something that she really didn't mean. Life's not fair! Is an often quote that escapes her mouth. But then like we all do at some point we realize that Life isn't fair. No matter how bad you want it to things just don't turn out the way you want them, so an angry teen turns into a grateful and somewhat of a nicer woman. She matures in the movie, and she realizes that Life isn't fair, she makes friends that will always be with her in some form or another.

		<fullReview>The movie starts out with a really cool title sequence featuring the first ever completely CGI animal, a barn owl to the music of David Bowie (Underground from the Labyrinth soundtrack). Then we are taken to a fantastical land where a maiden in a dress runs up to face her adversary and announces that "through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered I have fought my way to the castle beyond the Goblin City to take back the child you have stolen..." she goes on to say the her "...will is a strong as yours, and my kingdom is as great" only to be interrupted by a flash of lightening and responding clash of thunder. Then in a strange turn of events she mumbles what she just say, while still facing her adversary, only to proclaim "damn I can never remember that line!" and pulls a red book titled The Labyrinth out of her sleeve to recall her next line. But it's too late the enchantment has been broken, we discover the maiden is an ordinary teenage girl, her adversary is her faithful dog companion, and the fantastical land is merely a local park. A bell tolls and the girl runs from the park with her dog Merlin through the rain down suburban streets before arriving home to the disappointment of her stepmother (who through the release of the Return to Labyrinth manga is named Irene but fans had previously dubbed her Karen). We discover the girl, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) was supposed to be home an hour ago to babysit her half-brother Toby (Toby Froud). Through this interaction and the discovery of her room we learn Sarah is a fifteen year old girl stuck between her fantasy filled childhood, and growing up into a young lady. (Don't do it it's a trap!)As the night progresses Sarah unwittingly summons the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) to come and take her baby brother. In order to right her wrong she must solve the Labyrinth and defeat the Goblin King in 13 hours or Toby will be (allegedly) turned into a Goblin. Sarah proves to be impatient and inept at solving the mysteries of the Labyrinth, however thanks to some friends she makes along the way she manages to solve the Labyrinth, defeat Jareth, and rescue Toby. Through all this Sarah finds a happy medium between her fantasies and growing up (Peter Pan is displeased with you Sarah!)I "discovered" this movie when I was a very young child (so young I don't remember a life without Labyrinth), my cousin Kasi loved the movie so most every time when all of The Cousins? stayed at our Grandma's we would watch Labyrinth among others like, Magic Island, Princess Bride, Legend, and Ketchup Vampires to name a few.To see more reviews like this head over to https://nerdyowlbooks.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone where to mention the title "Labyrinth" to you, maybe the image of late singer-actor David Bowie in this film would come to mind. Directed by the late creator of "The Muppets" Jim Henson and starring Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King and fresh-faced newcomer Jennifer Connolly as teenage heroine, Sarah, this fantasy film is chuck full of fantastical characters and wacky songs.As the film's antagonist, David Bowie is at his flamboyant best as the menacing, yet amusingly charming Goblin King. His mere presence makes you wait for what Bowie will utter either in speech or in song. He is so cartoonish in concept, but devilish in his schemes to trap Connolly's Sarah in his titular 'Labyrinth'. In addition to being the leading man, Bowie demonstrates his originality in songwriting as he penned every song for the film and performs all but one number; reminding us why he is still one of the best singers of all time (even posthumously) and how catchy the tunes Bowie wrote are. I dare you not to start singing or dancing to Bowie's fanciful lyrics and choreography.Playing the (at first) bratty, but loyal and brave Sarah demonstrates the raw talent that future Oscar winner Jennifer Connolly had at her disposal. She is virtually unlikable in the film's start as her selfish teenage attitude exudes a loathsome persona. However Connolly's switch to heroine is believable as her character undergoes a transformation throughout the film as Sarah must face each challenge that Bowie's Jareth lays out for her. Sarah soon becomes a likable strong female as she learns to work with her compatriots (the cowardly Hoggle, the kind behemoth Ludo and the wily, overly confident Sir Didiymus) to solve the labyrinth and retrieve her baby stepbrother from the Goblin King.The creatures created by the Henson Creature Shop are as fantastical as the film's villain. In a world populated primarily by goblins, but also with birdlike and massive mammalian beings too, it's like a child's fantasy novel come to life. The puppeteers (many are familiar faces to another who knows "The Muppets") provide the added camp factor by playing laughably fun characters that all have life of their own. An enjoyable movie for all ages and guaranteed that you will be grooving to the music and singing too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Henson's fairy tale adventure is definitely one for the kids only as I found when watching this appallingly childish production. Packed with inferior effects, cheesily dated music from David Bowie and some of the tackiest '80s fashions you'll ever see, this is by far a product of the period in which it was made and one which is difficult to take seriously otherwise - unless you're the same age as the annoyingly cutesy baby which makes its appearance here. Toddlers are guaranteed to have a wonderful time with the song and dance routines, the colourful sets and scenery and the variety of weird puppets that pop up along the journey but this is one for the under fives only.The problems? Well, a total lack of plot for one doesn't help, with Jennifer Connelly and her baby brother suddenly being transported to an alternate reality for no apparent reason when she makes a wish. You never really know what's going on or why, only that Connelly must rescue her sibling. It's just an excuse for lots of dodgy adventures involving stinking bogs, a extremely disturbing dwarf-man known only as Hoggle, and a monster that tries to be Chewbacca from STAR WARS and fails miserably in the charisma stakes.The lead is taken by Jennifer Connelly, who proves to be more annoying here than in her debut outing, PHENOMENA. David Bowie struts his stuff in a cheap wig as the Goblin King, who does things like walk upside down on ceilings but proves to be a disappointment when its revealed that he has no power to actually hurt Connelly and co. after all. As for the puppets, well they're mainly played for laughs and are reminiscent of FRAGGLE ROCK and nothing else. All of the usual suspects are here under the makeup - Frank Oz, Warwick Davis, Kenny Baker - but they play generic caricatures and are of little interest. As for the labyrinth itself and the numerous dangers and wacky situations that our heroine encounters, from talking walls to moving stones to creepy witches, again kids will enjoy but adults may find their attention wandering. Unlike something like STAR WARS or HARRY POTTER which can be enjoyed by kids of all ages, LABYRINTH is a childish production so if you're over five years of age, give it a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. The highlight of the film is, without a doubt, all the beautiful creations made by Jim Henson and his incredible creatures workshop. Credit is certainly due to all the amazing characters and sets that are showcased here. The story itself, on the other hand, is not as impressive, there's really nothing compelling about it. We follow a young girl named Sarah struggling to solve a labyrinth to save her baby brother. The plot is very back and fourth, as well as frustrating at times. The characters are not likable, we are never given a reason to support Sarah, or even for us to actually want her to succeed in her quest, while David Bowie is certainly charismatic as the Goblin King, it's difficult to find him likable as a result of his motives. While its flawed, Labyrinth is a beautiful film, sadly the kind that would not be made today, I would recommend it as a family film as long as your children are not too sensitive. A young girl must complete a quest in order to retrieve her baby brother the Goblin King before its too late. Best Performance: David Bowie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resentful at being made to babysit by her father and step-mother, Sarah - an imaginative but whiny teenage girl - inadvertently wishes her baby brother, Toby into the Labyrinth; a magical world populated by goblins and ruled over by Jareth, The Goblin King, played by the late, great David Bowie. Jareth informs her that unless she can solve the Labyrinth in thirteen hours, Toby will be turned into a goblin, confident that she will be unable to do so.It seems that everything and everyone in the Labyrinth is out to get Sarah and throw her off the scent, so she has to try to befriend the characters she meets in order for them to help her. Among the myriad of colourful creatures there's Hoggle, a troll, Ludo, a hairy beast-monster with the ability to control rocks and Didymus, a feisty, scrappy little dog-knight.Though it has a large following now, I was surprised to learn that Labyrinth was a commercial failure at the time it was released, and it's very hard to pinpoint exactly why. Labyrinth is like Jim Henson's take on the Alice in Wonderland story, with all the imagination and creativity you'd expect from a Henson production and just a hint of sexual awakening/coming-of-age thrown in for good measure. Even when watching as a small child, I picked up on the chemistry between Jareth and Sarah. And noticed Bowie's astonishingly tight pants...In addition to having themes that appeal to both children and adults, Labyrinth shows an immense attention to detail which give it great re-watchability value. Though I've heard many times that Bowie must have done this movie for a quick cash grab, I never got that impression at all. On the contrary, it looks like he was enjoying every minute and is now perhaps one of his most iconic and defining moments of his career, especially to those born in the eighties and after.</fullReview>

I love everything about this movie, the music by David Bowie, David Bowie's hair, and his tights (which I noticed at a much later age I might add).The plot is just wonderfully charming and the characters are funny and lovable. I think this is the movie I've seen the most in my life.Great family adventure with the right amount of scary from some of the "obstacles" faced in the Labyrinth. It also has the perfect amount of silliness and humor.Though I cannot say how this movie would be perceived by someone who sees it for the first time today, it might be odd. But for someone who remembers it from their childhood, this movie is legendary. When me and my sister wants to feel like children again, this is what we watch.</fullReview>

Cast and crew read like a who's who: directed by Jim Henson (of The Muppets fame), written by Terry Jones (of Monty Python), produced by George Lucas, starring David Bowie and Jennifer Connolly, music by David Bowie. Decent enough fantasy-drama, but plot is a bit random. Has some periods where it just drifts. The use of musical interludes just seemed out of place, and like padding.Good special effects and use of puppets, as you would expect from Jim Henson. Good performances from David Bowie and (15-year old) Jennifer Connelly, in one of her earliest roles.Adults might find it a bit random and inconsistent at times, but kids should love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that caters to that piece of childhood of which many of us refuse to let go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: This film was recommended to me by Lauren Shumaker for "Steve Pulaski Sees It." Jim Henson's imaginative scope of Labyrinth is what carries the film and saves it from becoming a listless display of decorations without any kind of creative spark. A film like this could easily be done in a soulless manner, basically having puppet characters going through the motions alongside flat human counterparts without any sense of joy. With Henson's production company at the helm, Labyrinth becomes a lot of fun; an adventure that winds up frequently sucking you into its bizarre world and only letting you break free for a few moments at a time.Until it decides to let you loose (or hit a slower patch), Labyrinth keeps you invested in its maze of a world, evoking mystery, enigmatic characters, and solid performances with a strong sense of stylistic flair. The film revolves around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), a fifteen-year-old girl who must navigate a confusing, visually deceiving labyrinth in order to get to the kingdom of Jareth, the Goblin King (David Bowie) to rescue Toby, the infant she's babysitting. Her wish for Toby to be taken by Jareth, a character in a play for which she's rehearsing, after he wouldn't stop incessantly crying comes true, and now she must get to Jareth's kingdom in thirteen hours or less before Toby is turned into a goblin.Labyrinth is one of those films that was destined to find its audience in due time. Burdened by minimal advertising and middling box office performance during its original, 1986 theatrical release (likely because of the story not being a known franchise or existing property), the film has resurfaced enough of a cult following that the idea of a sequel is being tossed around. Films like these are strange little marvels because they're exactly the kind of films that remain timeless in a narrative sense, even with dated special effects and costumes that screamed the respective time period. No matter what decade we're currently in, pop singer David Bowie's performance here is still loud and outrageous, and regardless of the respective era, Henson's puppets and characters are just as entertaining as they ever were.And no matter what age we are, for most of us, Henson's creations still inspire the kind of wonder they did when we saw shows like Sesame Street at a tender age. The eccentricities and the larger-than-life characteristics of the puppet characters make for such an engaging experience that, as stated before, their world becomes ours, and by the end, we're almost sad to leave the world we've been entranced in for well over an hour. We have Hoggle, Sarah's most loyal companion throughout the labyrinth who sometimes gives her helpful hints, but really acts as cleverly incorporated moral support, Sir Didymus, a fox knight tasked with the difficult challenge of being brave, and Ludo, a beast with a large heart. The power of Henson's creation is strong in Labyrinth, so much so that screenwriter Terry Jones doesn't skimp out on the human characters and leave the puppets to do the work; we also get a fascinating villain at the story's core and a charming narrative structure that builds as we navigate the nonlinear land of the maze.Stylistically potent and narratively charming, Labyrinth caters to that whimsical part of your brain devoted to clinging to every ounce of childhood you have left in a way that emphasizes all that you love and miss rather than exploiting it for cheap sentiment. It's an admirable feature in a somewhat forgotten film that is finally getting the respect it deserves in the modern day.Starring: Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie. Directed by: Jim Henson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie, great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this movie for a long time but never watched it until it showed up again on TV recently, probably in part tribute to the recently passed David Bowie.Overall, it was an OK movie, not Star Wars or Lord of the Rings level in my opinion but still fun and entertaining to watch (it kind of reminds me of "Legend" another fantasy movie with Tom Cruise and Mia Sara that appeared the year before). I liked the humor but sometimes the appearance of the puppets were too distracting and that is what I think dragged the ratings down. Jennifer Connelly held her own as such a young actress at the time and David Bowie was spectacular as the brooding, sinister Jareth the Goblin King.The plot and storyline are what keeps viewers like me in tune for years to come. The thought of a selfish teenager wishing something in a fit of anger without first thinking carefully about it repeats itself over and over again and is a wise message to tell to all children and adolescents. For this alone, Labyrinth is worth watching. I kind of think this story could come out even more vividly through the books that came out shortly after the movie was released but I'd have to find out for myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative fantasy adventure from Jim Henson &amp; company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Labyrinth" is a film that holds a special place in the hearts of many children of the eighties. Initially a box office disappointment, the film has nevertheless built up a strong cult following in the 30 years since its release.The story concerns a selfish teen girl (16-year old Jennifer Connelly) who, inspired by a play that she's rehearsing, wishes for her baby brother to be taken away by goblins. Realizing that her idle wish has come true, she must then embark on a quest to rescue her brother from the fearsome Goblin King (David Bowie).Future Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly ably carried the film in one of her earliest roles while David Bowie's distinctive portrayal of Jareth ranks as arguably his most memorable screen performance. Additionally, the many talented performers involved in bringing to life the denizens of the labyrinth are deserving of high praise.The screenplay by Monty Python alumni Terry Jones is grounded in fairy tale tradition but shows abundant imagination. Filled with twists and turns, the viewer never knows what to expect. Apart from the main plot, there are a handful of songs that were expressly written for the movie by David Bowie but I wouldn't rank them among his best work. Their distinctly 80's sound doesn't exactly argue for the movie's timelessness.Helmed by legendary puppeteer Jim Henson, the movie shows considerable care in bringing the labyrinth's fantastic creatures to life. Visually, the movie has an alternately colourful and moody look that takes full advantage of the marvellous production design. The special effects are pretty good as well, including some CGI that was ahead of its time.Ultimately, "Labyrinth" is a thoroughly entertaining family-oriented fantasy adventure, though one that does show its age to some extent. Still, with a combination of fine performances, an imaginative storyline and appealing visuals, "Labyrinth" promises a memorable viewing experience for fantasy lovers both young and old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After I heard that Bowie passed away I thought I had to watch something with him. Labyrinth seemed as a great choice.Both David Bowie as Jareth and Jeniffer Connelly as Sarah act marvelously. The puppets are controlled by 52 puppeteers matching Bowie and Connelly's performance. 48 of them were used in the impressive Magic Dance scene. The creation of them was all done by Jim Henson (the father of the Muppet Show). He drew every one of them by himself. In a review, he mentions his notebooks in which he drew the puppets.Sarah, a 16 year old teenager, is a selfish girl who is very imaginative. While she is reading in a green garden she forgets all about time and arrives home late. Back home, she gets really angry at her dad and stepmother for forcing her to babysit her toddler brother Toby. After the parents leave their house, Toby starts crying non- stop. Sarah becomes even more furious and wishes him to be taken by the goblin king (Bowie). Her wishes come true and so an adventure begins...Even though it seems like there are a lot of special effects in the film, actually there are none except the owl in the beginning. It is one of the first ever CGI creations. And a legend like David Bowie added to this fantastic production makes it even better. I don't have any second thoughts on my first impression of David Bowie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An a-MAZE-ing film for all the family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mix Jim Henson's directing and puppets with Jennifer Connelly's acting and David Bowie's acting and music and you have the Labyrinth, a 1986 cult classic with thrills, spills, fun, humour, and a good story suitable for the entire family. Connolly plays Sarah, a selfish 16 year old girl, who was supposed to be babysitting her baby brother but instead of caring for the infant she wishes him away to the Goblin King, Jareth, played by Bowie. Thus starts the adventure; Sarah has to rescue baby brother Toby from a magical fantasy world controlled by Jareth and his goblin folk. Jareth imprisons Toby in the Goblin castle in the middle of a Labyrinth and Sarah has only 13 hours to rescue him before he's lost forever. Along the way Sarah faces many perils but she is helped by Hoggle (a wrinkly, grumpy inhabitant of the labyrinth), Ludo (a massive hairy beast), Sir Didymus (a fox/ knight), and Ambrosius (Didymus' cowardly sheepdog/ makeshift steed). This film is not just fun it's visually appealing and imaginative with puppets galore as well as well imagined scenery. There are clues to events in the film littered around Sarah's room at the start of the film and reinforced at the end which serve to demonstrate that it's not just a random magical world but partly also Sarah's imagination which is driving the sights in the film, take for example the picture of Bowie and the statue of a Goblin king on Sarah's dressing table, or a poster of impossible stairways on the Sarah's bedroom wall. This is also a clever film delivering a message that it's okay to be imaginative but also reinforcing the values of maturity. At the start of the film Sarah is selfish and moody much like a child but by the end of the film and the journey Sarah has become responsible and caring, almost as if the film was a metaphor for Sarah's journey through puberty and blossoming into a responsible young lady.Be enchanted by an A-MAZE-ing film, if you haven't seen it yet then you really should spare some time to watch a film which can still stand on it's own two feet in a cinematic world which has evolved massively.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After unfathomably being greeted with ambivalence in 1986, the past 30 years have shown generations of children and former children alike coming to their senses and regarding Jim Henson's Labyrinth as the cult classic turned indisputable classic it deserves to be. Sure, it's a figurative remake of Alice in Wonderland (and if that's enough to deter you, there's the secret pathway out of the Labyrinth - please use it), but Henson's uniquely clunky practical effects aesthetic lends it a bricolage magic that's wholeheartedly its own. Indeed, if Labyrinth is derivative, Henson shows excellent taste in source material, as his work here could serve as the template for the perfect children's fairy tale - it's visually spectacular, bursting with imagination and heart, isn't afraid to delve into the realm of the dark and scary, but always with a purpose, and peppers its fantastic journey with moral messages that feel impressively unforced and genuine. Not too shabby for a film initially sneered at by Roger Ebert as "never really com{ing} alive," n'est pas? Like any good fantasy parable, it's as profound as you'd like it to be. Sure, there's a time-worn narrative of assuming responsibility and growing up (interestingly tweaked by addressing, rather than shying away from, protagonist Sarah's tentative sexual awakening, as evidenced in her fabrication of the strangely sensual Goblin King), friendship and forgiveness, but Henson also works in delightfully disturbing vignettes cautioning against mindless materialism and mob mentality (and even, arguably, a Snow White-esq allegory for date-rape drugs), all the more affecting in their surreality. It's also worth noting that Alice never came up against a perpetually farting sludge swamp called "The Bog of Eternal Stench" (did I mention Monty Python stalwart Terry Jones was a co-writer?). Her loss. Viewed 30 years after the fact, the film now plays as a breathtaking love letter to the days of pre-CGI puppetry, and the boundless imagination of maestro Jim Henson. There's remarkable depth to Labyrinth's seemingly barren landscapes, and, as Sarah is quickly cautioned, it takes a more careful look to really drink it in. Sure every painstaking puppet on display is indisputably impressive, but it's in the little details that the film really "comes alive". Take the tiny, earnest worm who invites Sarah in to "meet the missus," or a nightmarish, scarring tunnel of "helping hands" treated as a throwaway gag, let alone the forest full of gibbering creatures who cavalierly rip off their heads only to turn it into a gruesomely carnivalesque dance number as trace examples of the film's cauldron of creativity. Henson has a remarkable ability to conjure up genuinely frightening imagery, and yet have it feel appropriate and wholesome all the while. And hey - anyone who can work a climactic showdown around an transposed M.C. Escher set is all right in my books. As the film's human component, teenaged Jennifer Connelly demonstrates a perfect awareness of the keen talent to come. She carefully ensures that Sarah hits the exact right balance of dreamy and impetuous enough to evidence a character arc, while sharp and feisty enough to avoid being excessively whiney or self-absorbed, and culminates being one of the few teen leads to remain wholly sympathetic throughout. Regardless, there's no denying that the film belongs to David Bowie, cementing his place in generations of children's hearts with his deliciously silky, playfully menacing Jareth the Goblin King, and cementing his #1 spot in 'most distracting filmic codpieces' for everyone else. Bowie not only contributes some infectiously fun tunes to the soundtrack - it will forever be impossible to avoid bopping around to "Magic Dance", while "As the World Falls Down" remains hauntingly evocative - but he throws so much into a performance other actors would have slept through that it's clear he's having a ball. Bowie is even insightful enough to play up the paradoxes inherent in his fantasy creation - he exists both to frighten Sarah but also serve her every need - while his cavorting around with abducted baby Toby shows a strangely protective tenderness, making his an intriguingly nuanced fairy tale foe. It helps invaluably that the puppets bobbing around them feel not like puppets but an unforgettable cast of characters. Lovable furry behemoth Ludo and chattery Sir Didymus (who himself feels like a Python outtake), let alone the charmingly self-loathing and neurotic Hoggle, really shouldn't interact so seamlessly, but somehow they all blend into the quirkiness of Henson's framework indispensably. If nothing else, the fact that a fairy tale involving puppets, synth-pop tunes and David Bowie in a neon mullet has not only survived the 80s, but actually improved with age, is testament to Labyrinth's timeless appeal for children old and young. Henson's magnificently kooky fable still glows with spectacular imagination and a heartwarming earnestness, coupled with discerningly dark subtext, and two infectiously enjoyable lead performances. Whether uninitiated or a veritable goblin yourself, it's undeniably worth taking a jump, magic jump into Labyrinth, and experiencing one of cinema's most enjoyable nightmares anew. RIP Goblin King, and thanks for the magic -9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives up to the word "magical".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lovely and engaging Jennifer Connelly stars in this fantasy-adventure populated almost exclusively by puppet characters. She plays Sarah, a selfish teenager. Obliged to babysit her infant brother Toby (Toby Froud, the real life son of the films' creature and costume designer Brian Froud), she "wishes that the Goblins would take him away". And the Goblins are happy to grant this wish. She must then journey into a world of strange characters including Jareth (pop star David Bowie), the Goblin King. Working against a deadline, she navigates the title location in the company of characters like the somewhat weaselly Hoggle, the valiant Didymus, and a giant named Ludo.Conceived by Dennis Lee and the late, great Jim Henson (who also directed), and scripted by Monty Pythons' Terry Jones, "Labyrinth" is a good, solid diversion. Sarah and her cohorts must solve various problems and overcome obstacles, and all of this is done with pizazz and a refreshing amount of humour. (The door knockers are particularly funny.) Shot in widescreen by Alex Thomson, it shows some real imagination. When our heroes come perilously close to falling into something called The Bog of Eternal Stench, we can sort of get a sense of how bad it must smell; the visuals really help in this regard. The finale is action packed, and there's little here - save, perhaps, for the antics of those head removing members of The Fire Gang - that would freak out the youngest and most sensitive of viewers.Bowie is charismatic as the villain, and he also gets to perform in some musical numbers for which he wrote the songs. Many of Hensons' talented associates - Frank Oz, Brian Henson, Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Kevin Clash, etc. - perform their roles with verve. Diminutive but brave Didymus would have to be this viewers' personal favourite.With so much of today's family films revolving around computer animation, it's necessary that we introduce our kids to more classic forms of entertainment such as this.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To the late Henson's credit it has yet to be equalled or surpassed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frustrated with babysitting on yet another weekend night, a selfish teenager summons Goblins to take her baby half brother. She is then given 13 hours to solve a labyrinth and rescue him from a Goblin King before he is lost forever.Even though it was met with mixed reviews nearly thirty years later it still manages to charm and retain a cult following. As a boy I remember watching Jim Henson's feature in a darkened cinema, being scared by the Goblins in Toby's room and the Firey gang intimidating Sarah. Under scrutiny, some of the wonderfully painted backdrops, CGI (at the time a pioneering) owl and matted Fireys' elements have dated but overall the film holds up extremely well. There's plenty of subtext - for example; Sarah's mother, Linda, a stage actor and her relationship with an unnamed man portrayed by David Bowie. There's also 'Easter eggs' including toys, figurines, books and games referencing the characters and set ups shown in the film. Veteran performers Frank Oz and Dave Goelz operate various puppets in the film, along with a number of Henson's show and film regulars. The talents of the many puppeteers, animatronics, designers and voice work to name a few are outstanding in bringing the characters to life. This coupled with the finely crafted sets, costumes, hair and makeup add up to something quiet special. That's without mentioning the wonderful score by Trevor Jones, music by Bowie and choreography by (Star Trek Next Generation) Gates McFadden. Based on Dennis Lee and Jim Henson's story and although a couple of writers had a hand in the screenplay, its credited to Monty Python's Terry Jones, the finished product is magic.It's much more fun than Flight of the Navigator of the same year and better than The Never Ending Story (1984). Henson retains the fantasy atmosphere of The Dark Crystal but makes Labyrinth far more family friendly to great effect, balancing the pace and darker elements successfully.David Bowie is perfectly cast as crystal touting, owl shape shifting Jareth, who takes Toby on Sarah's wish and falls in love with her. Bowie has some great dialogue both humorous and serious. Like The Wizard of Oz adventure it refreshingly has a female lead, Sarah played by Jennifer Connelly, who's acting and interactions with the puppet characters really sell the magic and believability. Sarah aided and hindered by an array of memorable characters from a Wiseman, Door Knockers, Helping Hands and The Worm, to the (creepy Dark Crystal-like) Junk Lady and Four Guards to name a few. She's mainly helped through the labyrinth by fairy exterminator Hoggle, Sir Didymus, Ambrosius (a.k.a Merlin Sarah's trusty dog) and Ludo a friendly Bigfoot like creature as she goes through the different environments including a maze, bog, forest, Goblin town and Oubliette to mention but a few.The music numbers are well placed and fitting. Bowie's 'Magic Dance' with the complex puppetry is a joy and technical timing achievement and as a child what was once the boring masquerade ballrooms bit 'As the World Falls Down' plays, as adult is hauntingly dreamlike and wonderful executed. The catchy 'Chilly Down' song stands out and though not malicious, the Fireys are unintentionally dangerous, the track includes the voice of Red Dwarf's Danny John-Jules. As the film draws to a close its topped off with an edited version of 'Undergorund' which also played in the opening as Sarah recites the play, The Labyrinth, possibly hoping to follow in her mothers footsteps. What's intriguing now is that you can interpret the film in different ways other than the narrative presented - that her coming of age adventure was real. As an alternative the whole adventure maybe just away for here to remember her lines, a dream or something more symbolic.Overall, some of the elements have dated slightly but as a family piece of entertainment and fun you can't go wrong will Labyrinth. To the ingenious talent of late Henson's credit it has yet to be equalled or surpassed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily One of the Best Fantasy Films Out There!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Labyrinth knowing only that it was known as one of the best fantasy films and that David Bowie was in it. Upon finishing it, I was thoroughly impressed. Wasting no time with the beginning, it got right into the action. Although I wasn't fond of this, it picked up and quickly became a phenomenal movie. Labyrinth captures what modern movies could never do. The characters are quirky and the costumes fantastic. I can't imagine this being made nowadays and it still being enjoyable. The costumes and special effects are part of what made the movie so memorable. If that was replaced with CGI the movie wouldn't have as fun to look at and overall wouldn't have felt like anything special. With age comes greatness it seems. Overall, I was very impressed with this movie. It was funny with enough seriousness to keep you interested, memorable, and just a fantastic movie. If your into fantasy, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie 'Labyrinth' had something for everyone:For little kids: It's got muppets, cute songs, and that marvelous "You remind me of the babe" mantra.For teens: The protagonist is an adolescent that teens can identify with. Plus, David Bowie and his too, too, stylish, music.For adults: They get the blessed feeling of nostalgia when they watch the show again, possibly with their own kids.The thing that ties it all together is the "coming of age" theme. We first see Sarah acting out her fantasies as a little child would. Her perilous journey through the labyrinth is reminiscent of the turbulent teen years. And when she tells the Goblin King "You have no power over me", and rescues her little brother, she's crossed over into adulthood and is ready to be more responsible.But the cherry on top is the closing dialog when she sees her old friends from the Labyrinth in her bedroom mirror:Ludo: Goodbye, Sarah.Didymus: And remember, fair maiden, should you need us...Hoggle: Yes, should you need us, for any reason at all...Sarah: I need you, Hoggle.Hoggle: You do?Sarah: (nods) I don't know why, but every now and again in my life, for no reason at all!My takeaway: grown-ups can still indulge in fantasies once in awhile, and in so doing, feed their inner child.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Henson Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe its been 30 years since this film was released. A little girl is forced to grow up very quickly when her little brother is taken and at risk of being turned into a Goblin, but the sets made (by M.C. Escher), the puppets (from Jim Henson) the romance between Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) and the Goblin King (David Bowie), was just magical. A modern day version of this film would just have used CGI but its nostalgic and wonderful to see real puppets in action in a kids film. I am sure any child of the time imagined themselves running around in that maze avoiding the challenges set and having such companions as Hoggle, Ludo and Ambrocious (that last name makes me think of Ambrosia Rice Pudding for some reason). David Bowie as the Goblin King though, I'm sure he had all the girls falling at his feet he had power, mystery and I guess for the ladies looks. Labyinth is just a truly magical film a fairytale with puppets and actors instead of animation or CGI. All I can say is RIP Jim Henson, you and your puppets are truly missed, they brought to life many a legend of film and television drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies you either love or hate, that you either get or don't get. For me, Labyrinth has been a film I have loved immensely since the early 90s when I was a child. I have seen it dozens of times and love it just as much each time as the first.First of all, David Bowie as the Goblin King is perfect. His facial expressions and mannerisms are spot on.Jennifer Connelly is excellent in this and shows both a childish side and a mature side as she progresses through the Labyrinth.And of course the supporting characters such as Ludo and Hoggle are both funny and memorable.Lastly, the music and songs by David Bowie are ALL perfect. In particular, the masquerade ball sequence is stunning. Yes, its extremely cheesy and dated, but its the 80s and who cares? The Hensons created a masterpiece with this that will always stay with me as a true shot of pure enjoyment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre but utterly arresting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LABYRINTH is Jim Benson's follow-up of the grotesquely eye-opening puppet enterprise THE DARK CRYSTAL (1982, 7/10), and also his final painstaking work, where he pairs a cherubic Jennifer Connelly and a trend-setting David Bowie (look at his 80s coiffure!) as human actors with all his accomplished puppets, to present a spellbinding fairytale in a labyrinth at the heart of a Goblin kingdom. It was a disastrous commercial failure upon its release, but time has been pretty generous to it and now it has achieved the cult status and even a possible sequel has been hatched for many years. As bedazzling as Bowie plays the almighty Jareth the Goblin king, this is no prince and princess romance considering Connelly's Sarah is only a 15-year-old, after her embittered wish accidental becomes true, Sarah faces a daunting task and must solve the labyrinth within 13 hours, otherwise her little stepbrother Toby (Froud) who has been snatched by Jareth and his underlings, will become a goblin forever. Not as otherworldly as THE DARK CRYSTAL, but again Benson and his prop teams let their imagination soar with no boundaries, there are biting fairies, countless helping hands, the paradoxical door riddle, a juggernaut cleaner, talking walls, head-detached creatures called Fierys, the bog of eternal stench, junk-yard hags, behemoth metallic guards just to name a few. Plus, the picture distinguishes itself as a prototype of computer-generated CGI technology, For Sarah, it is also a journey of learning not to take things for granted, don't be as spoiled and selfish as she is in the beginning, and making friends alongside, soon she will be accompanied by the cowardly dwarf Hoggle, the giant beast-looking Ludo, who is actually very timid and can summon rocks, and a chivalrous fox named Sir Didymus. All is granted with vivid impersonations thanks to the excellent puppeteers behind them. One innate shortcoming of puppets-operation is the lack of fluidity in motion, especially during the large-scale actions, that's why the film slackens a bit in its second half when Sarah's squad grows, and during the castle-raiding scenes, it becomes rather distractive. But as luck would have it, a final highlight arrives in a gravity-defying stairwell resembles M.C. Escher's RELATIVITY, where Sarah faces off Jareth alone and rebuffs his conquest, her mission finally has been accomplished and Jareth is defeated and morphs into the form of an owl. Bowie contributed five songs to the soundtrack, the most striking one is AS THE WORLD FALLS DOWN, played in a critical scenery where Sarah's memory is fading and she appears as a princess in a masquerade, captivated by Jareth's gaze and supposedly should forget about her mission and capitulate to Jareth's glamour. Connelly is peachy and sufficiently engaging as a little heroine acquires wisdom and compassion in this phantasm fable, as the film cunningly suggests with all the paraphernalia in her bedroom of a girl obsessed with a fanciful wonderland. I could imagine if I had watched it when I was a kid, this movie could have been stuck in my memory as an all-time classic, and I doubt the current cinematic puppetry can ever reach the same altitude of ingeniousness and virtuosity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) is left home alone by her parents to babysit her little brother Toby. She can't stand her stepmother and she hates her crying baby brother. She makes a wish to the Goblin King (David Bowie) to take Toby away. "I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now." She begs for Toby's return. The Goblin King transport her to the Labyrinth. If she solves the Labyrinth in 13 hours, he will return Toby or else Toby will be turned into a goblin forever. At the entrance of the Labyrinth, she meets grumpy dwarf Hoggle who kills faeries.Jennifer Connelly is lovely and she calls Hoggle Hogwart. Jim Henson brings his various puppets and visual styles to work in an imaginative and sometimes dark creation. It is a fun adventure with some light charm and also a good coming-of-age story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was at my grandmother's house at four years old. Back then, everything about this movie scared me, whether it was the goblins, Jareth, or even that cute caterpillar at the beginning. I didn't understand what was happening but I knew that I didn't like it. Fast forward to about twelve, I kept thinking of a movie but I couldn't figure out what it was called. After a while of searching I finally find the movie that I was thinking of; The Labyrinth. As I watched it for the second time I remembered how fearful I was eight years ago. I couldn't believe how scared I was of a movie that was so fun. Since then I have watched it about ten more times raising it to the top of my favorite movie list.When people ask why I like the Labyrinth so much they need to prepare for a ten minute speech. The storyline is impeccable; a teenage girl's brother being taken by a goblin king leading her to go through a Labyrinth meeting different creatures and doing different tasks. Not only does this scream intense, but it also is made to be funny. There are twists and turns all throughout her adventure that keep you on your toes. Not only is the story great, but the cast was chosen perfectly. Jennifer Connelly perfectly portrays a seemingly innocent teenage girl being thrust into an unexpected world. David Bowie shows that he not only is an amazing singer but an actor as well. For me, if Jareth were to be played by anyone else, the movie would not be as great as I believe it to be. The effects were great for the time period, special effects have advanced since the 80's but I find it to be very well done for the things they had accessibility to. There are a few goofs in the movie such as continuity issues and equipment being shown on camera. They weren't able to access much of the technology that we have today to prevent these mistakes. Overall, the Labyrinth brings many different genres to the table such as mystery, action, and even a bit of romance. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys anything. It's a classic in my book and it needs to be more well-known than it is.</fullReview>

This wonderful film is one of my favorites and reminds me of my childhood, yet is just as enjoyable in adulthood with it's quirky characters, epic music, witty dialog and visual treats.The main character, Sarah, is an interesting one; she is an innocent kind of brat to begin with but comes of age as she takes responsibility for her brother and friends. There is still an aspect of her that will always remain childlike, which I like and can relate to.</fullReview>

She must enter a magical maze and find her brother within 13 hours else he will turn into a goblin forever.The movie has magic, goblins, sweet monsters, greedy dwarfs, fairies and a lot of other strange creatures. Make-up of most of the characters is...well outdated; so is the set design. But Connelly is very pretty and more than makes up for all glitches with her fair act.Watch it for her! 6.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this film is quite old, it's age doesn't detract from the overall viewing experience.David Bowie's performance as the Goblin King is extremely entertaining, and the songs are very catchy and stay in your head. The character is intriguing and very different to the normal 'bad guy' - you never really know whether he is truly good or bad.Sarah at first seems like a complete spoilt brat, and Jennifer Connelly depicts this very well, but as she changes this is captured equally skillfully. Her character is straightforward and not terribly appealing, but I suppose some people would learn to love her as the film went on.The main criticism for this film is that it is just plain strange - in both a good and bad way. The oddness makes it unique and appealing and is very well done, but it is also quite confusing.A fun film to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Bowie! Jennifer Connelly! MUPPETS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time I reached the scene where Jennifer Connelly fights David Bowie inside a M. C. Escher painting, I fully understood why Labyrinth has become a cult classic.The movie follows the usual conventions of children's movies, with a conventional story arc and almost laughably obvious moral, but there's a kind of strangeness to it that belongs as much to Henson as it does to Bowie. The labyrinth itself, which seems to operate under the magic realist rules of something like The Phantom Tollbooth (a children's classic if there ever was one), and all the creatures within it are filled with humour and invention. They're funny but they aren't jokes, and that helps for the more serious scenes. The whole thing is rooted on this same slipperiness between language, reality, and fantasy.Of course, it should be noted that this is firmly a children's movie, and not in the Pixar "fun for adults too!" camp. Honestly, I think this is to its credit -- the lack of any sort of wink to a more knowing audience is endearing. This is a film that believes in its own earnestness, and never feels like a cynical product. At the same time, it does make some parts a bit tiresome or wince-inducing for an adult audience, but it really isn't for us. It's for overly precocious children who will probably grow up to have weird sexualities and tastes in music. God bless them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>#1 Movie to Watch with your Girl Teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>15-year-old Sarah is struggling with the existence of her baby half- brother, Toby. She accidentally wishes him away to the Goblin King Jareth who will keep Toby as his newest goblin if Sarah does not complete his Labyrinth in 13 hours.I first saw the film in my early teens when my parents bought the movie on laser disc. Today I'm not much of a fan of the muppets or musicals. I get restless and impatient, shifting and rolling my eyes. Yet even now I can take in the joy and boundless energy the muppets and music provided to Labyrinth. An integral part of the story and setting you can't separate one from the other and it be the same movie. So not only is this my favorite film from my teens, it's also my #1 muppet movie and #1 musical.I loved the choices she had to make in the first half of the movie. She tried the lipstick to mark her way ? it didn't work but it was really smart. Every obstacle she tried thinking about it and using whatever she came up with as best she could. The logic puzzles seamlessly worked with the idea of a labyrinth and having to maneuver through a foreign place.David Bowie enchanted as a stony-faced villain king set on seducing a young girl in any way he could manage. The choice of making the glass- ball juggling act part of the character's mystery and allure worked, characterizing in such a visual way. I think he represented all the darker, more worldly choices a girl can make but in a way that is non- threatening to parents yet still calls to a teenager.Anyone with a sibling, especially a younger sibling, can totally relate to Sarah Williams. As a child you are still trying to figure out the right and wrongs of situations. Many times it is not until you've already done something that you realize it was wrong to do. Sarah made a situation like this feel sincere and believable. David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly played off one another very well, the age difference wasn't an issue and it could have been rather creepy.Two of my favorite characters are Hoggle, a dwarf with a penchant for cheap jewelry and Ludo, a gentle giant whom Sarah rescues from being tortured by goblins. They are such polar opposites that they made the perfect traveling companions. When Hoggle first betrayed Sarah I was more heartbroken and hurt than mad and angry. And the fact Ludo could call rocks to him just seemed to fit who the creature was. For a bag of fur and a plastic mask on a stick they made these two feel real and significant.Production wise I think they balanced between the plot which I love, the music which added mystery and allure and the muppets which added character and energy. If not done just so the whole thing could have been a cheesy mess. I think this says a lot about who was behind the film. Henson knew how to utilize his puppets in a way that made them relevant in the story. Lucas understood storytelling and that each element mattered. David Bowie's songs in particular fit the subject and tone of the film to perfection. The writers really helped the balance because the plot worked and made a great background on which to hang the music and muppets. It's this kind of balance that writers everywhere are attempting to achieve in their own writing. To make what potentially are the weaknesses (the music and muppets) into strengths really show how expertly this movie was produced.The two best scenes in the film have all to do with the writing though. The first when Jareth takes Sarah to the ball and she's an honest to goodness princess. And the second, a scene following when Sarah's back in her room around all her belongings that make her feel safe. Such a one ? two punch. The first tried to suck her in with her hopes and dreams, the hopes and dreams any young teenager has about the future. Perhaps unrealistic ideals though. Then Jareth follows up with total reality and the safety the present provides. It's everything you know and want to hold on to so you don't have to face the future. Both, equally could suck her in and Jareth would win. It's this kind of struggle we want to see for our characters whether as a writer or as the audience.As a teenager you are in a struggle between your hopes and desires and the reality of real life. Coming to terms with where you fall as an individual is when you really grown up. Even at my age this movie hits a core place inside me when I watch it again because it shows and reminds you of the decisions you've made to get where you are today.Read more of my reviews at http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

The 80's seemed coolish...I like the unusual hairstyles from then...XD but ya...I mean I don't really like very many new movies. They are mostly all about the same thing. The only ones I really like are horror stuff like Vampires and Zombies, but thats all.

		<shortDescription>All in all, pretty good family yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah (Jennifer Connely) feels under-appreciated. Like Cinderella she feels like she's just a slave for her stepmother and that her father doesn't really care. So one evening, when she's forced to watch over her new baby brother Toby for an umpteenth time, she makes a careless wish for a goblin king to snatch the annoyance out of her life. And sometimes you get what you fish for. The goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) does what is asked from him and he takes the baby to his castle, located in the middle of huge, shape shifting labyrinth and Sarah has only 13 hours to get her brother back, or he's turned into a little goblin.I have to admit I warmed up slowly to this movie. The opening was quite good, but the first half in the labyrinth felt a bit jarring and forced, despite the art direction of this movie is top notch in every way imaginable. One other reason for my reluctant warming was the 80's rock sounds made by David Bowie, which I felt were a bit more of a hindrance than a merit.But after I had watched a while and some new characters emerged I begun to enjoy the movie more and it did leave a quite nice after taste after it ended. This all is thanks to fantastic creature and set design of the film and I have to admit, that in the end, some of the music tunes of the tale are pretty catchy.So as an advice, if you don't like it right away from the beginning, let it got a bit further into the Labyrinth, as it was in there the movie fully opened up to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting movie for children who are old enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw it when I was six and it was a little scary but I understood it and kind of liked it, once I got over the scary part. So I guess it depends on the child. I believe HEnson left this movie for people to interpret in maybe different ways. Some people say the girl was a spoiled brat who learned to think of others. Some say her wish was revealing her hidden fears. I do not think Conolly's character was spoiled or selfish. She was a little immature for a fifteen year old, but at the same time very bright. But like a teenager, she appears self centered on the surface, but when it really mattered, when she was missing somebody she loved, she learned what was really important. I think it also showed her fears like somebody said. Also, her character was kind of a loner, and I think they implied that she had some issues, perhaps with her parents divorcing. Her parents seemed so rapped up in their own lives, going out all the time and hardly paying attention to their children. It did not seem like she had a lot of friends and it seemed she spent most of her free time in a fantasy world, reciting lines from that book. So I think this movie was sort of showing troubles, her fears as and her capability of facing them and how you appreciate somebody you love when they are gone. However, I think he made it evasive so it would be up to the viewer to interpret. The most clear message is how you realize you love somebody when they are lost.</fullReview>

However, even now at sixteen years old I still love the movie.Both David Bowie and Jennifer Connolly give fantastic performances and teamed with an action packed storyline this film is far from boring.However, I realise that this film isn't everyone's cup of tea. The viewer would need to be able to suspend their disbelief in order to follow the movie and really get into the concept of it all.

		<fullReview>This is, without a doubt, my favorite movie of all time, and has been since I was four years old. I drove my family nuts singing "Magic Dance" more times than I can count. Sarah's story is so amazing and captivating because all the events relate to growing up and Terry Jones has written a brilliant script, although not much of the story is his after Sarah eats the peach. David Bowie is wonderful as usual, despite an amazingly long mullet! The songs are very catchy, prepare to have them stuck in your head for days after, and "As The World Falls Down" is especially good. The Muppet's make this movie all the more enjoyable too. I love this movie, and watch it whenever i am sick, or in need of cheering up! It reminds me of being that four year old kid again singing "Magic Dance" at our local park! Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... I was staring at the roof when I suddenly wondered "how many stars might have at IMDb a genuine piece of art like Labyrinth?". And then I said to myself, "well, people is so generous giving punctuations... only Paris Hilton as part of the cast could force the masses to rate a film with less than seven stars".God! What are you thinking! This movie should be at least a 9/10! First of all...The world created for Labyrinth it's absolutely real. You can sense it, you can smell it. It's warm and natural, full of signs and symbols, and every corner has a secret to tell, and believe when I say that not even the most expensive and newest FXs could approach to Labyrinth's level.Characters, both, actors and "puppets", are terrific. One of the things I love most of this film is that there is not such thing as a bad guy, an evil lord, or a terrible villain with a scar on his face. They are not recurring stereotypes. Sarah is like any normal girl of her age; she can act like an arrogant selfish bad-mannered teenager but she is a good and sweet person too. The same goes for the Goblin king: he doesn't have any evil motivation for doing what he does; at the beginning he is just trying to help Sarah by making her wish come true. There is this little spark of innocence shining within each one of them that makes you get involved with them.Beautiful for adults and children. I remark this because nowadays it's quite difficult to find a movie easy enjoyable for all ages, when most of the films made for kids are just stupid.This movie has nothing to envy to any other fantasy film. It's the prodigy of the genre. 9.5/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do we like movies so much? What do they really offer that has ultimately enchanted us so? And why do we proclaim certain movies the WORST films ever and others are generally accepted as classics? It makes you wonder... what is drawing us in? Is it the overpaid superstar Actors/Actresses? The Music perhaps? Is it the well respected Director? The underlined plot and general feeling? For me it is very much the general feeling of a film and the music that goes along with it. In my opinion, a bad score or soundtrack can give a film an ordinary almost cheesy feel and often can throw you off. Labyrinth attracted me right off just because of me being such a fantasy lover but..I must admit...it was David Bowie too. I had honestly never heard David Bowies music but after this movie I can say I'm definitely bewitched by his evident stare and strangely attractive melodies. This film is a true delight. I would recommend Labyrinth to any parents with young children. It's warm and musical. Magical and Equally Enchanting."LABYRINTH" A movie made good by uniquely entrancing tunes &amp; melodies. But of course, also because of Jim Hensens' classic child-like enthusiasum that literally burst at the seams through out any of his films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great non-CGI film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The art of animatronics and puppetry is going to be lost very soon as CGI takes over that responsibility in film making. If you watch this movie on DVD then you must also watch the "Making Of" feature to see some of the great talent and creative minds that worked on this movie. You will gain a real appreciation for what these people can do. The MC Escher set is also amazing.David Bowie is also great to watch. He has a charisma that is ageless and creates a character that no one else could.Not all is great with this movie, however. It doesn't age well, sadly. The music is dated and very 80s. Also, a teenage Jennifer Connelly isn't quite the great actress she would become. Fortunately, she is still charming and cute.So, if you are a fan of David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Muppets or creative film making then this movie is for you. Also, 80s mullets. Lots of them, especially in the Making Of feature. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was a little girl, this film fascinated me, and I still love it. It an all round great film - if you just take it for what it is, its a kids film, which its good as. But when you really take it in, this film is so much deeper than it seems.The whole meaning of the film is Sarah going through adolescence. She learns so much about herself, comes to terms with her family, and has her first love in the form of King Jareth. Anyone who loves this film will have wanted Jareth and Sarah to get together, and thats the sad thing, they're separated forever - Sarah chooses to save her brother instead of stay with the one she loves.Also, the imagination is this movie is great - they pull off the puppets so well, and its hard to believe that this was a 1986 film! The owl in the beginning sequence was the first ever 3D computer animated thing in a film. And yet this is a cult classic, sadly not a huge well known blockbuster. The soundtrack is great, some of Bowie's best work. Even if it wasn't a film soundtrack, these songs would be great. The lyrics are meaningful, and they are dead catchy!My favourite film ever - Im the biggest Jareth fan in the world. Thankyou Jim Henson!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has lost nothing of its originality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this movie was released, I gave it a miss, thinking that a 19 year old was so grown-up = too old for children's stuff. Stupid me. Finally watching "Labyrinth" 20 years later was a real pleasure. And predictably so, because: get people like Jim "Muppets" Henson as director, Terry "Python" Jones as writer, plus Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie as actors together, and you'll surely get something unique. Henson's puppets display such a range of emotions it never ceases to amaze the audience. Jones wrote a story that certainly is bizarre and unusual, taking us into strange sets like the Escher staircase, the swamp of Eternal Stench and the pit full of hands, yet it never becomes an empty effects show like many movies of the 2000s. There are always human passions such as the need for friends, resisting temptation, fear of the unknown, and Jennifer Connelly, still very young but enormously talented, makes them believable. David Bowie as the Goblin King seems to be delighted about this role in a musical comedy, obviously quite a change after the dark stuff he shot before ("The Hunger", "Merry Xmas Mr.Lawrence"). "Labyrinth" is a movie where everything works - which must have seemed unlikely even to its makers before - and it has lost nothing of its originality, weirdness and beauty over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few other movies manage to make me smile quite the way Labyrinth does. It is that perfect combination of storytelling and humor and suspense just peppered with music and magic that always draws children in.The story is a simple enough quest, but the characters met along the way are what make the difference. Jennifer Connelly in her first role shows the brilliant actress she will eventually become, David Bowie hypnotizes every time he sets foot on-screen, and the Hensen muppets bring more grins and giggles than could possibly be expected in any movie.Unlike Dark Chrystal, which could only truly be enjoyed by those who were fantasy freaks, this one is approachable to almost anyone, whether or not they enjoy fantasy. Unlike the muppet movies, this is its own world, and stands alone in the stable of muppet classics. It is not any one thing--fantasy, musical, puppet show--and therefore appeals to anyone who likes at least one of those things.A highly enjoyable story, and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has delighted me since I first saw it in the theatres. I went back to see several times and bought the VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD copies as they came out. It was a delight to find my wife was also a rabid fan of Labyrinth as well and now our daughter delights in seeing it over and over again. David Bowie is mesmerising as the charismatic Goblin King. Jennifer Connelly graces the screen in one of her earliest roles. Jim Henson's creature creations flesh out a fantastic but strangely believable world. The characters Sarah meets on her adventures have captured the imaginations of millions of viewers. Fans still make tributes and recreations even over 20 years after its release and Labyrinth merchandise still sales in huge numbers. While it faired poorly financially when released, Labyrinth has shown that it was simply just ahead of its time. Its magic is still strong for people all over the world. This is a breathtakingly wonderful family film--full of magic, fantasy, and touched by the whimsical genius of Jim Henson. I highly recommend it not only for fans of fantasy, but for anybody who is young at heart. I know of no one who has seen Labyrinth and ever regretted it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stars: Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie.A teenage girl, Sarah (Connelly) is living a fantasy life. One night she wishes the king of the goblins would take away her baby brother. When her fantasy becomes real and the Goblin King (Bowie) actually does take him away, it's up to her to travel through a labyrinth to the castle and save him. This film, is just a really easy movie to watch. It's very entertaining. Where it doesn't always make a lot of sense (and it doesn't have to), it still has really good looking puppets and sets, and Jennifer Connelly does a good acting job, as does Bowie. The songs in this, all written and sang by Bowie, are catchy and fun in their synthesized 80's style. My only problem with the film is it's lack of character development before Sarah is trapped in the Labyrinth, but it really doesn't affect the film. If you're looking for a light, family adventure, this is a good choice.My rating: *** out of ****. 101 mins. PG for mild violence and mild language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful little fantasy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delightful little fantasy film. The story's opening should appeal to many kids: teenaged Sara rebels at the baby-sitting duties that interfere with her vivid fantasy life. She would never hurt the child, but creates a fairy tale around her frustration. In this story, the beautiful princess (Sara, of course) is set free when denizens of Fairy-land abduct the evil infant. Then, suddenly, the fairy tale becomes real.The story is Sara's quest to recover the lost child from Jared, played by David Bowie. He works well as the world's dark lord, even if his song scenes seemed gratuitous. Sara traverses the mythic Labyrinth guided, misguided, and befriended by beings from Jim Henson's wonderful imagination. This is the true magic of "Labyrinth," the sustained vision, comical and fantastical, of Brian Froud's world peopled by Henson's creatures. The whole world is simply amazing - and it goes on, in changing scenes and amazing detail, for the rest of the movie.This is a wonderful kids' movie, with no real violence or adult themes, and with a happy ending. It does have a dark edge, however, that may scare the very youngest. Although it's a kids' movie, the kids are optional. Feel free to enjoy it just for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proves that creativity has no limits. "Labyrinth" is a wonderful tale of a teenage girl named Sarah, played by Jennifer Connelly, lost in the magical Labyrinth. The labyrinth is ruled by the Goblet King Jareth, played by David Bowie. Bowie's charm and presence enriches the movie greatly. The movie has some fun, pure 80's, songs by Bowie and also includes the very beautiful "As the world falls down".What i did not like about the movie is the fact that it gets kind of slow near the end. In my opinion it also includes a few too many songs. Other than that its a film every fantasy fan should see. One of the best in its genre.8/10</fullReview>

People claim it's a little dark for children, but the characters like Hoggle, the goblins, Sir Didymus, and Ludo help defuse the "creepy" scenes of the movie. As Brian Henson once said, "Kids are prepare to get scared...It's culture." It's a perfect combination of fantasy, family, and adventure. Jennifer Connelly (who gives an amazing performance at the age of 14) and David Bowie (who wrote and performed the films 5 original songs) bring spirit and life to the screen.

		<shortDescription>An absolute CLASSIC of Children's Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a foot is put wrong in this masterpiece of modern fairy-tale telling. Every line sings out, every character a gem.Bowie has no talent at all as an actor, but in this he shines out as he's essentially playing some strange personal aspect of himself... He's constructed an excellent villain in this, *how can it be* that he's so effective despite the slight cockney accent, the ridiculous wig and boots, the daft dialogue? Confidence! He throws himself into the part full-tilt and has a ball, and it shows! He LOVES being Jareth, and so Jareth becomes a very lovable villain, vain, pompous, mysterious, never, actually *dark*, you understand...Jennifer Connelly is even better. She IS Sarah.But the real star is the story, which gives Lewis Carroll a fine run for his money, a story full of games and jokes and tricks and a labyrinthine host of delightful minor characters, perfect for a children's story.I think perhaps the two sequences for which I have the greatest admiration are the sequence with the Peach, the Masked Ball and the Junkyard, and...THE BOG OF ETERNAL STENCH! ... which is probably the most GENIUS children's fiction thing EVER.The appeal of this sort of story-writing for kids can't really be pinned down to a formula, you have to have a natural talent for it, and it's clear that the makers of the this movie were completely saturated with this natural talent.A Delight..."SSSHHHHHHH! ....she's going to say the *magic words*..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Henson is a fascinating man. His Muppets and other puppets are truly extraordinary, beautiful, and creative. They have more life in them than just about any other form of animation out there. The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth are truly cool movies - they existed because these guys wanted to do something really unique, and that deserves wild applause.Labyrinth itself has a fantastic idea behind it - young Sarah, who is struggling with growing up and the responsibility that comes with it, is left to watch her baby brother while her parents go out. In a moment of selfishness, she wishes goblins would take her brother away...and they do. Now Sarah has only 13 hours to work her way through a massive Labyrinth, or her brother is gone forever! The premise is great fantasy - it takes a very human character, with a very human problem, and blows it delightfully out of proportion. There is plenty of adventure and wacky friends, and of course, David Bowie is our villain! The budget of the film shows - many sequences are amazing and epic, and some of the puppets are massive and intricately detailed! That said, I think the movie lacks characterisation, particularly for Sarah. She has such grandeur in her line delivery that it is hard to believe she is anything but a fictional character. That undermines what I found so appealing about the story - that the events in the story are caused by her actions and attitude. This lack of deep, real characterisation hurts some of the other characters in the film, particularly Hoggle.Of course, if you grew up with the film, or you are a big fan of the other Henson films (The Dark Crystal, Mirrormask), you'll have a tough time hating it. It's quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magically Abstract, Although it Could Have Gone Much Further.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those timeless movies that it seems everybody saw as a child. It's a wonderful, magical film, that borders itself on the abstract. However, that's just the problem, it BORDERS on the abstract, teases the audience with it and then takes it away. It could have been a much better film had it explored the abstract, if it had dived into it without hesitation and apology. As it stands,it only tantalized viewer s with the promise of the abstract, and little more.The acting is average. There's neither nothing terrible nor incredible about it. David Bowie is an average, although a little odd, villain. Jennifer Conelly is an average heroine. Toby Froud is an average baby. They all do their parts well, but step down to let the film run itself. There's nothing wrong with this, but it leaves me without any comments about the acting other than that, that it was average and non-obtrusive to the story. The same thing can be said for Jim Henson's directing: average and non-obtrusive.There are a lot of things, little things, about this movie that makes it really special. The song David Bowie sings is a classic, especially the beginning (featured in the card game Mow). The puppet animation is a rarity in feature-length films, and is a pleasant addition to this film. I have absolutely nothing against modern special effects, in fact I love them, but it's a nice change of pace to look at Labyrinth and see something more solid... something more old-school and traditional. David Bowie's character is more enjoyable than David Bowie's performance, and is something so intriguingly and wonderfully different than most main-streamed characters that it must be mentioned.This is a wonderful family movie, and one that people of all ages can enjoy. Anybody who's a fan of David Bowie, Jim Henson (especially his work with The Muppets) or 2005's Mirrormask should find this movie especially enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I could only have been about five years of age. Something about this film captured my interest as a child and now as an adult I can see why.Most children like to imagine they can be whisked away to another world full of amazing creatures. In this film they get to follow Sarah as she is taken to the world of the Goblin King. Her task is to rescue her brother Toby before he too becomes a Goblin. Along the way she meets some colourful characters and learns a thing or two about herself. Watching her every move is the Goblin King who tries to make her give up her rescue attempt.The music is delightful and should have you singing along in no time. Most are sung by Bowie himself.Adventure, action, romance and a little humour makes this a must see for all fantasy fans and I would recommend to anyone who likes to watch a feel good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Connelly before she became the gigantically famous Oscar winning star she is today, starred in the Labyrinth as a young teenage girl named Sarah who dreams of fairy tales and is most likely to be found buried in the pages of her favourite fairytale novel on any give afternoon. One day, she is left home alone and kept in charge of her baby brother who never seems to stop crying. In the heat of her frustration, she wishes ill upon the child. She wakes up from a nap to find out that the goblins from one of her novels have come to life and stolen the child. They've taken him to the castle where a sinister prince (played by rock star David Bowie) lives. Now she must embark on a journey into the wonderland in order to save her baby brother. Jim Henson's amazing puppetry and animation is quite dated now, but you will be captivated by the innocence and sincerity Connelly showcases here, as well as the great but disturbing chemistry she shares with Bowie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I love this movie. It is a classic. My brother and I (26 and 19) have been watching this movie since it came out in 1986, and now my children are watching it. I actually went out today and bought the soundtrack on CD and got rid of my cassette version...lol. David Bowie looks hot as can be in his Jareth costumes!!! It is an extremely memorable film with unforgettable quotes and scenes. I especially love the worm with his little scarf..."No, I said 'ello, but that's close enough!" For any of you who have not seen it, check it out!!!! Be sure to check out the Behind-the-Scenes Documentary that is included on the DVD as well. It is extremely cool to see how they made all the puppets, and it really makes you respect all the effort that goes into a film like this. They spent a year alone just creating all the puppets. The finished product is amazing. And when everything is put together, it seems so real, and it will make you forget that it is not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another non-Kermit the Frog movie Jim Henson did.Labyrinth is about Sarah, a teenage girl who's into fantasy a lot. She hates taking care of her little brother and wishes that he could go away so she can feel more peaceful about herself.And speak of the devil she says the magic words as her brother is taken away by Goblins and she meets the goblin king who would offer her an opportunity to live a happier life.But all she wants is her brother back. So she's taken to the world of Goblins and must take the challenge of the Labryth maze. She has 13 hours to get her brother back or he'll end up as a goblin forever.She meets new friends, danger and a sign of hope if she believes in herself.Labryth has the same theme as Dark Crystal does. It was directed and thought up by Jim Henson himself. Has impressive muppets and creatures in it. Plus it's done by the people who did the Star Wars movies as well.I figure those who like Dark Crystal might like this one as well. It's a real treat and a perfect fantasy for someone's girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful blend of classic themes, memorable characters and engaging story lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a movie that can entertain a range of viewers from the young (and young at heart) through the classical literature professor. Oddly enough, but quite true. The surface story and characters are vibrant, providing a constant parade of situations, dialog and scenery that weave into a delightful adventure that take the viewer along for the ride. The underlying surprise is found in the steady stream of classical literary themes that form the bedrock of both the character motivational elements and many of the situations they find themselves experiencing. When I first viewed this movie shortly after it came out, I was delighted to bring a tape of it to my college literature professor and tell her with a knowing wink that "this movie is a sneak attack of classical themes". Her dubious look after looking at the tape sleeve was replaced the following class day with a delighted smile of her own. Both she and her grandson had found the movie to be a wonderful viewing experience. Labyrinth both entertains and educates with a deliciously subversive undercurrent of parable, myth and psychodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Labyrinth" has always had a special place in my heart. I think I like it so much because the entire movie is sort of infused with the wild weirdness of glam rock. The other reason it's so dear to me is that it's really pretty deep for a kid's movie. And very dark. When I was actually a child, "Labyrinth" scared the hell out of me, but I still loved it. The film's world is both fantastic, and wonderfully realized. For me, Jareth the Goblin King is the central expression of the world. He's sophisticated and intelligent, and makes a very good villain. Yet, he seems more bored than megalomanical, and sort of gently despairing about the lameness of his henchmen. He's a little like Maleficent from Disney's "Sleeping Beauty", and "Labyrinth" has a similar timeless effect, with many adults still enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie 3 times now since first being introduced to it a month ago. I am taking a class in puppetry--with a focus on Henson and his muppets--and had the pleasure of seeing this in a classroom of over 200 students, many of whom had never seen it before, and the rest of whom were Labyrinth enthusiasts. It was an amazing experience to see the looks on their faces as the film progressed.If you have never seen this, for the love of all things puppet, go out and buy it. Do not rent, BUY. Preferably the special edition DVD with the "making of" documentary. You will watch it over and over again and enjoy it more each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this movie since I was a small child. Sarah(Connely) loves "The Labyrinth" book and finally, she realizes that the book is REAL. Frustrated with her parents and her baby brother this 16-year-old says 'the words'. Her brother gone in the next seconds she begs Jareth(Bowie) to let her have him back. He gives her some leniency, but not much, and gives her thirteen hours to find her brother in a gigantic labyrinth. She takes many of the things in the Labyrinth for granted, then realizes that things are not always what they seem in a place where you never know which way is right. She encounters many friends along the way, and she never forgets them. Many people think that since Jim Henson directed, it must be those goofy Muppets. Not true. This movie is greater then the Muppets. And in my opinion, greater then Star Wars. Children and adults alike will enjoy this film. I severely recommend it. The music will capture your ears, and the magic of the Labyrinth will capture your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrith is the best movie ever! When I first watched it, I couldn't understand it because the people around me were making to much noise, but the first thing I did when they were gone was I went to Rogers Video and rented the movie. I watched it almost five times in one day it was so good. It's an adventure movie, with a bit of comedy and it's a little scary, but not really. I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and magic. It is amazing!! If you get it on DVD, watch the documentary. It's really neat. It's got some bloopers in it, it shows you how everything was made and you can learn some stuff from it. My friend told me that she didn't like the puppet things. She was talking about the goblins, but she was right and she didn't know it. The goblins really are puppets! In the dance magic scene, there were around fifty holes in the ground that the puppeteers put there hands through. This is an awesome movie! Two thumbs up and a 10 out of 10. The graphics were amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone ever notice that the little guy who moves the slate pieces that Jennifer Connoly has marked with an arrow yells " Your mother is a friggin'aardvark!"? It's one of the craziest things I've seen in a movie, it totally took me by surprise the first time I noticed it. He shakes his fist too, I think. It's one of the funniest most unexpected scenes in the movie. Anyway, I don't know how far into the flick it is, so you'll have to watch it from the beginning to see it. Also this movie can be a little creepy for sensitive little kids. Hoggle is really ugly and some of the opening scenes are pretty scary if you're only little. Not a movie I would put on for a three or four year old, it's more for six or seven year olds but definitely good for adults too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sarah had just made an awful wish that the Goblin King would take her baby brother and the wish was fulfilled. Now he has be taken to the Goblin castle to be turned into a goblin. Sarah is on her way to rescue him, but she has 13 hours to travel through a labyrinth to reach the castle to save her brother. On her journey she meets some strange and mischievous creatures that help her out or try to stop her.Well, this is the first I've seen it in over a decade or so? well, actually it's first time in a while, that I sat down and watched it fully. This is warm and tremendously fun film for kids and adults, though you could say it's fairly cheesy nowadays. In all, it doesn't ruin the charm and fun of this puppet production.This is a weird, enchanting, sometimes dark and very magical fairytale film by director Jim Hanson and producer George Lucas. Hanson captures the very endearing, the bizarre, and the artful and quite colourful dreamlike world of The Goblin King perfectly. While, the script is witty and very poetic in its many puzzles. Though, you would expect that, as it's written by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.Great puppet designs by Jim Henson, that is truly delightful in their many different personalities and distinguishing traits. From a dwarf, goblins, a fox and his sheep dog, a hairy beast, talking door knockers and rolling and farting rocks. Some of the creatures are a sight to see and are fairly likable and hardly annoying. Henson's creations are just a marvel to look at. Not forgetting the Labyrinth and Goblin Castle that he created is simply astonishing in detail and character.The soundtrack is another distinguishing element of the film, other than the puppets and the labyrinth. Though, one or two of the songs are a little too self-indulgent and slows down the story a bit, but the music soundtrack mostly comes across as pretty hypnotic and mystical. Well, most of the songs.The performances are outstanding and come across as quite natural. Jennifer Connelly is gorgeously sweet as the teenager Sarah, while David Bowie fits his role perfectly. He has a spell-bounding aurora as the manipulative and charismatic Goblin King. Though, his clothing style isn't a sight to see. I'm glad that he got the role ahead of Michael Jackson. As well he sings all the songs in the film.What we got here is a simple fantasy film that has a lot of heart and a mature moral to the story. It builds on its striking details, creative imagination and stunning performances to a great effect.It was a pleasure to see it again? fully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the age of 10 in 1986...it has been my favourite ever since, and I will be 30 in 2006! Even the wondrous and stupendous sweeping plot of LOTR:TROTK under Peter Jackson and the hilarity of The Wedding Singer, my second and third favourite films, cannot hold a candle to this mother of all fairy (firey??) tales.From the androgynous handsomeness of David Bowie as the Goblin King, to the innocence-to-womanhood tale of Sarah, the film is full of rich detail, marvellous plot, twists and turns, and the magic of the much-missed Jim Henson.I hope that when I have children, they also appreciate the complexities of "Labyrinth" at both the childhood and adult stages.Long may the Henson legacy reign under Jim's son Brian.</fullReview>

This movie is absolutely the most entertaining movie ever created, it may not be the best movie ever made but it is my personal favorite. It has David Bowie (who could resist) and remotely good child actress (jennifer) but sometimes shes a little over the top. It has fantasy, unrequited love and lust, singing ( and good great songs at that), its Jim Henson so i mean again who could resist, and all of that combined with a fascinating script complete with wonderfully quotable quotes.yes i am in love with a movie maybe ill marry it.OK peace to allKelly Marie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is an AWESOME movie. It's somewhat fantasy-like and I think the acting is good. I'm always a fan of Henson productions and the work on the film is amazing. The songs are clever and fun to sing-a-long too. Bowie is one of the coolest people alive, so him as the goblin king is very satisfying to watch. It's mainly about a young girl named Sarah(who's acted really well by Connelly) who has to reach the goblin castle through a tricky labyrinth by a certain time in order to save her baby brother Toby, who she wished away, from being turned into a goblin. She meets colorful and unique characters on the way also. It's really entertaining and it's a movie that you could watch over and over. If you like Muppet/human movies like this, i'd recommend "a Muppet Christmas carol" also by Henson productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Labyrinth is a very magical and fantasy movie. Sarah(Jennifer Connelly) shows that with a little confidence you can do anything you put your mind to. Sarah get her self wrapped in her favorite book called the "Labyrinth" and then it comes true when she actually wishes her baby brother, Toby to be taken away by the goblins and their king. She begs for Toby back but Jareth(David Bowie) tells her she has to solve the Labyrinth within 13 hours if she wants to get him back. She takes on the challenge meeting obstacles and new friends along the way. Though Jareth is trying his hardest to keep the baby, Sarah gets past all of his challenges in good time. Finally when its a few minutes before time is up she makes it to the castle.... the ending is very fun and sad though... This movie will move your hearts... It's my favorite movie in the world and I recommend it to anyone who loves Fairy Tales/Fantasy movies. The puppetry and camera movement/shots in this movie are very good. Also David Bowie is Muy Caliente!(Very Hot) in this movie!!!!!!</fullReview>

With six songs by Rock legend David Bowie Labyrinth is one of the most wonderful fantasy films of it's or any time.The film should appeal to the child inside. It's ideal if you're a David Bowie, Jim Henson, George Lucas or Brian Froud fan. Froud's artist hand in the movie has it's effect through the whole production. The movie has charm and meaning.

		<shortDescription>My feelings for Labyrinth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always have a great fondness for Jim Henson films. Along with Labyrinth he had another great, wondrous film that was frowned upon by critics, The Dark Crystal. But I guess not many appreciate the great minds that come with creating movies like Labyrinth. I remember watching Labyrinth when I was just nine years old and then a few years after that. It was a family thing to sit down when it played on the cable movie channels. Now that I am a Mom and a lot older, I think more people today should appreciate the effort and great minds that go into making these original characters, making them come alive. When I first seen the movie I was infatuated with David Bowie just for the fact he seemed so sexy but I didn't even know who he was.After graduating high school I grew to appreciate David Bowie's past and current musical triumphs along with his portrayal of Jereth in Labyrinth. Every song was genius and about 95% were created by Bowie himself. My ultimate fave song in the whole movie is "As the World Falls Down" and the scene itself was enchanting. It seemed a world you wouldn't want leave. But throughout the movie it just made me laugh and just hypnotized me. I know the late Jim Henson was proud of all his achievements with the muppets and his creations such as Labyrinth. Though it was looked down by the movie critics Labyrinth is a masterpiece, a perfect example of the genius minds of Jim Henson and Frank Oz, also all the performers and master of doll making. I would suggest anyone to allow their children to have the pleasure of viewing this movie. As my daughter has also. I believe it shows that with a brilliant imagination and extreme talent you can make the biggest fantasies come true and be so real you are caught up in the world itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful for a new generation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in college, mostly because of David Bowie. Since then I've probably seen it 100 times. The muppets are great, Jennifer is cute as a button, and Bowie is hot hot hot. I hope when Sarah got older, she went back to the Goblin King. I think I might have taken Toby back to the house, left a note, and stayed with the Goblin King! The scene in the ballroom ... wow. Such a pretty song. There's only one scene that bugs me, and it's really trivial - when she's first starting in the Labrynth, she heads to the right. Then when she finally finds the first turn in (with the help of the worm), she turns ... right. The entire labrynth is to her left, that just isn't correct. But - it's trivial.I wanted my husband to see the movie but when I went to get the tape, it was gone. It was in pretty bad shape anyway, but I was upset! So ... got it from Netflix, and since then, he and my kids have become new fans as well. My five year old in particular wants to watch it over and over!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best movies of my childhood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, I loved this movie because I identified so closely with Sarah. I spent my days creating a world in which I immersed myself completely. Even at ayoung age I appreciated her strong character, and her complexity. Also, David Bowie was/is/will forever be hot. :-)Now that I have a son, we watch it together. And he loves it too! I think what makes this film so endearing is that whatever character you root for comes out getting something in the end. While the Goblin King is menacing, he is also a very sympathetic character, and I imagine most fans of this movie secretly want him to win, at least for a little while.This is a wonderful family movie, since the humor is often quite adult and the visuals are incredible, but almost any kid would be well entertained by the fairy tale elements and wacky characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Labyrinth: My favorite Fantasy film of all time *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one movie, from my childhood, that I have not outgrown. I have seen labyrinth at least three to four hundred times, in my life. Every viewing feels like the first time. When the credits role I am a little kid again, awaiting with eager anticipation every little nuance that made it great. I remember when I was nine-years-old, and my mother took me to see Labyrinth. It was the movie that made me love cinema. I had seen the Wizard of OZ and E.T., and loved them both, but Labyrinth was the one film that truly resonated with me. As an imaginative child it was the element of fantasy that intrigued me most. Most of the Fantasy films of the 80's were incredibly cheesy and underwhelming. They did not allow me to suspend disbelief, but Labyrinth did.When I saw Labyrinth my family had just gone through a tragedy. The realm of The fictional world became my escape, my little happy place that I could goto anytime I wanted. The creatures like Hoggle, Sir Didymus, and Ludo were so life like that I believed, if I wished hard enough, that I could meet them. And, as a young boy approaching adolescence lets just say that I harbored some pretty impure thoughts about the beautiful Jennifer Connelly(she was so hot!). The soundtrack(David Bowie made my second favorite soundtrack since Purple Rain!), The Jim Henson characters, and the elaborate special effects made Labyrinth the pinnacle of fantasy film for me. Sure, The Lord Of The Rings is great...But I always felt like(and still feel)that Labyrinth was "my" movie.I highly recommend this to everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that shines with genius (and glitter)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is unquestionably a highpoint in the long and illustrious history of muppets. The scenery is evocative, the characters are endearing and creative, the storyline exhibits a strong cohesion, and the dialogue scintillates with wit. The truly remarkable thing about the Labyrinth, beyond the simple fact that it looks as jaw-droppingly gorgeous as it does, is that no single scene in the entire movie is anything less than perfect.That bears repeating. No single scene in the entire movie is anything less than perfect.Every line is impeccably appropriate to the characters, the mood of the scene, and its place in the story. Every word is in precisely the right place, and not one of them could be improved upon without radically altering the film. Jareth is heartbreaking, Sarah is emotionally accessible, even Toby plays his part with sincerity and gusto, and the muppet characters that surround them were clearly each custom-made for their role, with ingenuity and flair. No character is extraneous, down to the briefest cameo appearances. Not a single second of this film anywhere can be considered superfluous. The level of mastery involved in the Labyrinth's design is simply breathtaking. Perhaps that's why the humor never gets old, an effect that's notoriously difficult to achieve in any medium. If comedy is rooted in novelty, the Labyrinth is simply ageless.This film missed being my absolute favorite, only on a pure technicality. Really, it's not the fault of the Labyrinth that I saw the Dark Crystal first. If you haven't seen either, you owe it to yourself to hit the rental store and try it. You may just find yourself buying it on DVD immediately afterwards.</fullReview>

I have fought my way here to the castle, beyond the Goblin city. For my will is as strong as yours and my kingdom is as great. You have no power over me." I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys humor, song, and dancing puppets. David Bowie is well worth watching and hearing his gorgeous voice. It has beautiful songs and costumes during the ball.

It's all subtly, on the top you have a beautiful childrens movie full of fantasy, but on second levels there's meaning to it.. meaning of growing up..it leaves you wondering whether she dreamt it or not.Its a marvelous movie and I truly recommend it to everyone to watch. I liked how Jareth was played, and trust me I've watched this movie over and over again, I can repeat his lines, and Sarah's. It's seems to me the story is all about growth in one girl and the lessons learned in the labyrinth. It teaches her not to be selfish and to grow out of her childish ways because in reality, she's a grown woman. This movie is awesome, truly the best. watch it. lol</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this movie since I was young. Now, at 23 years old, I can still get excited and 'spooked' by 'Labrynth.' The story is timeless, the art direction, puppets, cinematography, etc. are extremely well-done, and the acting is top-notch. DAVID BOWIE is amazing, and his composition and performance of these original songs never fails to astound me. Also, he is a fine actor and very seductive and irrestistible as the 'Goblin King.' Jennifer Connelly in one of her first roles plays the whiny teen-ager precisely, and develops throughout the film with the life lessons she learns in the labrynth. DON'T MISS THIS FILM ADVENTURE. It is truly excellent, and all my generation X friends will attest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Nothing is as it seems...' That's for anyone who sees this movie and thinks it's automatically stupid or for kids because Jim Henson made it. In reality, this is a great, classic movie that I grew up with and still watch.Basically it's the story of a girl named Sarah who lives within her own fantasies and daydreams. But when the King of the Goblins steals her baby brother after she wishes him away, she has to solve his Labyrinth in order to get him back.I love the friends she makes. They could have been stereotypical, but the cowardly Hoggle, gentle Ludo and well-meaning Sir Didymus make you wonder who she'll meet next.But the main attraction is David Bowie, who plays Jareth the Goblin King. He does a great job, and the songs are beautiful and I recommend you listen closely to them if you get a chance.Overall, if you're willing to just relax and watch a fun movie, go for this one. If you're a cynical person where nothing is ever good enough in the first place, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight breeches and fuzzy felt make for a fantasy classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is one of those films you probably never watched as a kid, but went looking for when you grew up.After The Dark Crystal and Fraggle Rock, Jim Henson Directed Labyrinth. The film could almost be looked at as a combination of its two predecessors - the darkness of Crystal mixed with the fun cave-bound Fraggles. Unlike The Dark Crystal, Henson added the human factor to the mix, making the fantasy somehow more realistic and adding scale to the Labyrinth world.The production team behind the film has some big names which almost guarantee its status. Lucas as Exec. Producer, Ken Baker and James Devis as Assistant Dir. and Production Designer Elliot Scott (responsible for much of Indiana Jones). Behind the music, Trevor Jones and Bowie conjure some relevant and magical moments, as well as some very memorable tunes.The story is very Wizard of Oz, in as much as 'was it a dream?'. However, Henson throws the old fairytale rulebook out the window, and hey, it's not a dream! Sarah (played by Connelly when she was 16) is a troubled teen who, fuelled by her fascination with fantasy and Bowie's character Jareth (see how many pics of him you see in her room), gets drawn into the Labyrinth.I suppose any attempt to associate the 'Labyrinth' with a metaphor for troubled teenage angst is rubbished by that fact that Sarah's bedroom is filled with a hundred weight of fur jumping around and singing at the end of the film. If you did want to go down the psychological route you could do it like this:1)The Labyrinth is a teenager's travel through life/puberty 2)Jareth is your father who left you when you were a kid 3)Toby is your innocence (which you want to get back) 4)The Goblins are your troubles (and are everywhere you turn) 5)Didymus, Ludo, Hoggle, the Worm ('ello) and all the other friendly creatures are your mates. 6)Bog of Eternal Stench is your room.Or maybe the whole story is the book she's reading right at the very beginning? It is entitled 'Labyrinth'. Coincidence?Anyway, It's a cracking film that appeals to all ages. It has many levels and can be watched in various mental states, depending how much you want to get out of it. In my opinion, it's on a par with the Dark Crystal and a far move from any traditional Muppet film.Some Useful Factoids:-Bowie allegedly stuffed unused fuzz into his tights to make for a bigger packet. -Ludo is a board game decided by the throw of dice -Labyrinth - from Latin labyrinthus, from Greek laburinthos; possibly akin to labrus, double-headed axe, of Lydian origin (useful eh!) -The owl is a Barn Owl -Jareth's hair was borrowed from Tina Turner for rehearsals and screen test.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I read the summary of "Labyrinth" I was thinking of some kind of computer game (I mean with the goblins and stuff) I was watching it with a friend, who'd seen it before and I didn't really know what to expect from it. I thought it sucked bigtime, until I saw David Bowie as the Goblin King. I was surprised to see him like that, espessially because the film is older than I am, and I don't know David Bowie like that (as an actor I mean). but from that moment I just simply LOVED the film and its humor. I'm not saying that Jennifer Connely doesn't do a great job, but she can't handle the movie herself, but she plays Sara very, very well. just watch it and you'll see what I mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I'm a little biased in saying this, but I would have automatically loved "Labyrinth" no matter WHAT...because for the past year I have discovered the musical and artistic genius of Mr. David Bowie, and I am now an unabashed fan of his work. The sheer versatility and longevity of this man is so unbelievable that I won't even let myself go off on a tangent about it, because I'm sure you've heard it all before!But I digress (as usual)...and with regards to the film itself, it really is an underrated classic from the late '80s - a masterful and amazingly imaginative journey into an other-worldly place. When Sarah's (Jennifer Connelly) noisy little baby brother is unexpectedly taken away by the goblin characters in her favourite storybook, she suddenly realizes that the only way to be able to get him back is to find her way through an intricate and frightening maze (also in her story) - the "labyrinth", if you will. Basically, as she progresses along, she comes across loads and loads of surreal obstacles, hilarious creatures, and interesting setpieces that lay the ground for a wholly creative odyssey.I found myself to be very impressed by the clear effort put into this project to make it seem fresh and unique. Sure, a few parts here and there totally reek of the cheesy late-'80s style - you can't omit the Goblin King's (David Bowie) eye-popping outfit - but for the most part, it is a surprisingly effective and timeless children's fantasy, well-acted, well-written, well-designed, etc...plus the bonus fact that most of the film's soundtrack was exclusively composed by none other than Mr. Bowie himself! How cool is that? You've gotta love the dedication here...This is certainly a film that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to children of any age...although I must admit that even when I watched it for the first time at a pre-adolescent (!) age, I was pretty well scared out of my wits because I had NO idea what the heck was going on! Aw, well...that was just my ignorance for you. Hopefully I've been a more sensible viewer since then.</fullReview>

I rented it almost every single time we went to blockbusters until my parents were like, "What? That again?!"David Bowie has a strange attractiveness which makes you feel bad for the Goblin king. You know he loves the main heroine, but he doesn't really know the right way to express it. Bad dating skills that's what. But still even at seven I felt like crying for him, and the eccentric haunting songs too!This is fantasy, drop LOTR you've probably seen it a hundred times already, drop Harry Potter you've probably seen it TWO hundred times already and watch the Labyrinth. It has this touching, and again, eccentric quality that makes you just fall in love with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, but not superior movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a fantasy movie by Jim Henson, and it shows in all the (non-human) characters. This movie is beautiful, with excellent detail work throughout. One could not ask for a better Sara then Jennifer Connelly, who kept Sara from coming of as spoiled, instead of merely unhappy and frustrated. The story is right out of a fairy tale.This is not a bad movie, by any account, but there are distinct flaws that keep it from reaching the heights of The Dark Crystal or The Princess Bride. For all the work on the special effects, there are points where there are dark lines around all the foreground characters and the bluescreening is clear. Far too much of Sara's travels were dependent on luck, rather then intelligence or wisdom. And both the Fieries and the battle in the Goblin City were long, "wacky" action scenes that lost me due to their being random and not being about Sara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is one of Jim Henson's adult productions. He was best known for creating the Muppets (Kermit the Frog &amp; co. and Sesame Street). Henson still had a lot to look forward to even upon his death in 1990. Had he still been alive today, he probably would've been one of the mighty legends in entertainment, maybe even along the lines of Walt Disney.Labyrinth is a story about a teenage girl (Sarah) who's experiencing the usual teenage problems. She has to deal with her family, as well as troubles with privacy and responsibilities. Sarah is largely into storybook fantasies (something like Alice in Wonderland), and when she's babysitting Toby one night, she tells a story about her sad life, and later wishes her brother to the goblin kingdom. Her wish is inadvertently fulfilled, and then she meets the Goblin King (Jareth). Sarah requests to get Toby back, but while Jareth is willing to leave her with her fantasies, he gives her 13 hours to solve the labyrinth before Toby's stay is permanent. Along the way, Sarah meets many local goblins (in the spirit of The Wizard of Oz). Those who join her quest are Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. The many other goblins they meet are mostly there to make the trek to the castle more difficult. Several pitfalls are even set up by the Goblin King himself. One way or another, the group manages to overcome each and every obstacle, where upon reaching the castle, Sarah has to reach the King on her own. With a hint of romance, she's given one last chance to allow him to help fulfill her dreams. But Sarah learns to allow maturity to overcome her romantic desires, and thus the spell is broken.I've watched this movie even as a little kid, and I never grew bored of it. This movie has plenty of fun stuff in it. It has action, adventure, drama, and comedy all in one. The characters are lovable, the musical sessions are beautiful, and everything in the Labyrinth is literally brought to life. There are many parts to the story (mostly stuff happening among the goblins) that I still think are terribly funny. A few parts even provide pure sentiment.It's a shame that nowadays, Labyrinth is often ignored by many moviegoers. I thought it was nice that Jim Henson was trying to broaden his potential in entertainment. All of the effort put into this production has an everlasting shine to audiences.Labyrinth is a classic movie and will always be cherished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one could get past the unavoidable flaws of creating something REAL, that is, without computer animation, one would find that this film is an exciting, enticing, mind-stimulating masterpiece. The plot is, for the most part, unique, and the characters are entertaining. One can never guess what will happen next around every turn, and optical illusions are everywhere, with the characters walking and floating around within them. There is more behind this movie than one could ever reveal with two, or even three, viewings. It's extremely easy to get swept away with the magical mysteries of this creation, and the way the characters interact with each other is, again, unique and unpredictable. The idea of the plot itself was enough to snag one's interest out from under one--and the creatures, attitudes and ambitions (of the young girl) illusions, mind-games, music, and ending add a great deal more to the absolute perfection and magic of this excellent film. People who dislike this movie simply have no imagination or taste for pure, unpoisoned adventure and excitement. It IS slightly similar to The Dark Crystal as far as the creatures and creativity go, but the plot, characters, morals, goals, and just plain overall feeling you get when it's over are completely different--and in my opinion, better. Labyrinth will always thrive and continue to live within the souls of those who have the heart, mind, and imagination enough to believe in its powerful perfection and spiritual magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie so much! it is the movie of my childhood, i used to wish that David Bowie was my dad when i was about 7. I have read a few of the comments about this move and they, as i expected them to be where praising Labyrinth. But i was shocked to read one that said that David Bowie was an aweful actor and that the songs that he sung were terrible as well. I cant fathom people that do not like the songs, they are the best bits in the movie, especially the song at the end, when sarah is running around on the stairs, and the song that is playing when Sarah and Jarith are dancing. Plus for those that think that David bowie is an aweful singer, you need to be educated.i love this movie and i always will, it will be a movie that i will show my own children.an excellent movie that i give 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first spotted this incredible movie on a danish channel sometimes in my teens. A few years later I saw it again and totally fell for it. Now that I work in a dvdshop I have access to almost all those movies you remember as a child. This movie however is so magical to me. But I guess all fairytales are. Sarah, a teenage girl that lives in a fantasy world of her own feels like she's being unrightfully treated by her father and his new lady. She's left one evening to babysit her younger babybrother when she in despair "wishes that the goblins would come and take him away". And so the goblins do. The goblin king appears and Sarah begs him to give her her brother back. He gives her a suggestion that if she can get through a labyrinth that leads to his castle in 13 hours she shall get her brother back. And so Sarah begins her journey through the labyrinth. An adventourus journey filled with magical creatures, wonderful music and danger.</fullReview>

David Bowie is excellent and just fantastic as the Goblin King, and the whole movie is just so sweet. No matter how many times I watch it I know that I'll always cry, in the end, when she's talking to her friends in the mirror and they are coming to party with her.

		<fullReview>Wonderful Movie. I saw it for the first time just before my 18th birthday and it is spectacular. It has all the genius of Henson's puppets combined with the storytelling genius of Lucus. A much watch.The songs may not be spectacular, but they're very fitting for the somewhat dark storyline. The puppets are very much darker than henson's muppet characters.Bowie is excellent as the Goblin king while jennifer displays the talent that will eventually earn her the oscar. A definite must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have not already seen this film, you should go and buy it! It's spectacular. I grew up watching it, almost every afternoon at the babysitters. If you want to take an analytical approach, note that the film may look low budget compared to modern movies, but look at all the work that went into Henson's puppets. It's just amazing! The concept is quite imaginative too. Naturally David Bowie was brilliant in this film. And who wouldn't love his uber-mullet? This is classic 80's! I would recommend getting the special edition DVD. It has interviews and "Making of" footage. You'll be glad you bought it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really pales in comparisent of "The Dark Crystal" and "The Storyteller".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "The Dark Crystal" and "The Storyteller" mini sereis, I was quite amazed at the breathtaking plots and all the amazing uber-realistic creatures in these life-like fantasy worlds. Then I heard my friends talk about "Labyrinth" and how wonderful it was. So one day, I decided to rent it, and boy, was it a big mistake.Hmmmmmmm.....where to start........*MINOR SPOILERS*First off, the plot and constant songs in the movie felt like I was watching a live action adaption of a Disney animated movie. Too many songs, too many bad songs!!!Second, the sub-plots with the bratty heroine and the goblin king were just muddling. Does she have a crush on him or what? Plus, isn't she a bit too young for him? Does anyone care about this? But atleast the brat's baby brother was cute though! Why she would wish a horrable thing upon him, I dunno....Third, the low-rent muppets. The Dark Crystal and The Storyteller had at least believable muppets you can feel close to. The ones in "Labyrinth" just made me want to feel far away from them. Hoggle is a total crabby whiner, Ludo is a loudmouth, the Goblins are more stupid than vile (the Skeksis could have them for dinner in a minute) and don't you dare get me started on the talking inanimate objects! The only muppets I liked in the film were the ones that could take themselves apart, the sheepdog and the junk lady that throw garbage at Miss Snobby (she deserves it!).Ugh, I think I'll watch The Dark Crystal, now that I mention it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing like a crummy day of babysitting your little brother to make you wish him away to the Goblin King! What's that, you didn't mean to? Well...time is of the essence...you have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth, before your baby brother becomes a goblin!I've loved this film since I was 10 or so, and it started me on my love for David Bowie in general. My entire comment WAS going to simply be "mmm, Bowie in tights", but I just didn't think that would help anyone. If you're a Bowie fan and have not seen this movie, what on earth are you waiting for!? If you're not, and you don't mind a little 80's cheese, this film is great. I love the sets that they built, and all the little critters they created for the film. My favorite part of the whole film is the ballroom scene, it's just so beautifully done. From Hoggle and Ludo, to the Fire Guys and the Bog of Eternal Stench, this film can carry your mind away into a different realm and make you daydream about wishing away morons in your own life to the Goblin City, where you would never have to see them again! This film has spawned thousands of fan fiction stories, and multitudes more than that of dreams. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially someone with young children who is sick of traditional kids shows these days. =)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was really awesome. It is categorized as a family movie - it is aimed at both children and adults - and this is definitely true. It might be scary for children to watch. I know I was scared as a child when I saw it. But it can be very childish (not in a bad way), and children I know have really liked it. It has that young, playful side of it - but it also has a more evolved side to it; It has some really interesting fantastical ideas weaved into it...it is no simple movie that was just thrown together. It really is a work of art. An idea that I found really interesting was the bedroom scene, when Sarah finds herself lost among piles of junk, and Jareth tries to "seduce" her (into wasting time), in a way, with the comforts of her own home. He also tries to seduce her into wasting time by dancing with her at a ball. This concept can really be applied to our lives, and the bedroom scene is just really really imaginative and out-of-this-world. A very appealing aspect of the movie was Jareth himself. David Bowie does an EXCELLENT job of playing the villain, and he is very attractive at that! He shows absolutely no emotion in his eyes, which is crucial to his character. It's perfect for a portrayal of a villain to children, and a seducer to more mature audiences...I know I couldn't get enough of watching him! I'm running out of room now...but I would recommend this movie to anyone who has any imagination at all. It is really great. And watching it several times really helps you to pick up on some things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The makers of the special effects of the LotR movies and the new Star Wars movies should definitely watch Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal (1982), they could learn a trick or two.This movie, together with the Dark Crystal, just radiates such a feeling of complete wonder and mystery, it grabs you and encloses you into a fantasy world and doesn't let go.Both in this movie and in the Dark Crystal the world created is so complete, so incredibly finished, that you would believe yourself to be in it.These works of art should be held in high esteem, and still stand up high after two decades. Must see films, especially for those people that think "Peter Jackson is a great director"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one that I watched when I was six for the first time. I remember loving the bloke in tights that I now know to be Bowie.I did not see the film again until last year just after my 17th, At first I did not recognise it, but then the goblin king entered the room and I knew exactly what the film was.I love this film, it creates fantasy in with role play as well as a hidden love story. It represents growing up and ageing from a child in to an adult, taking hold of responsibility and dealing with life.Sarah, the young girl is an innocent who always thinks of herself, her father is getting remarried and she is uncomfortable with this, to get away she dissapeers into the fantasy of her favorite book the labyritnth. Yet she gets more than she bargins for when she wishes her baby brother away and he goes to the goblin kings castle, she must solve the labyrinth along the way but Jareth (the goblin king) is always around the next corner trying to stop her from achieveing her goal. The love story is between Sarah and Jareth, they both feel for each other but there is something in the way for each of them, Jareth is portrayed as evil to sarah, and sarah wants her baby brother back, they can never fall in love!In the film there are 5 songs by bowie, 3 are performed, they are very good songs, 2 can be found on the best of bowie dvd. The other songs are by trevor jones, also very good.Since growing older and realising who Jareth was I have become a keen fan of david bowie and love all of his music and films that I have made a point of collecting.The labyrinth on the other hand I have worn a few tapes of out and I often wish the goblin king would come and take me away, I loved this film then and I love it now, It comes highly recommended, a definate 10 star award!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie of my childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie for the first time, It was like a "coup de foudre". Actually, like if the thunder hit me, it changed my life! It a so good magical movie that tells a wonderful tale. If you have never seen this movie, you really get to watch it soon. It's one of the masterpiece from the 80th and it reminds my childhood. For myself, I watched this movie at least, 10 times and never, I got fed up! So, This story told about a teenager girl who is a little jealous of her younger brother who still a baby. Indeed, her parents love very much their daughter but they come to have their second kid and have less time spending with her. So, Sarah, acted by Jennifer Connelly, get to keep her brother for a night and don't feel like that at all. She yelled after him and are offensive. Then, a mysterious lightning and a thunder occurred. So, when Sarah reach at the brother's room, she realizes he is not there anymore! Then, a strange man ( David Bowie) appears in the darkness and say "If you want your brother back, you get to cross the famous labyrinth and confront me". So, I let you discover by yourself what happens next... The only thing I can say, is that, she'll probably learn to love more her younger brother!9/10 Very good you ought to see it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near and dear to my heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that is truly near and dear to my heart. I probably first saw this film when I was 9 or 10 and just loved this film from that day on. Since then I've watched this movie many many times. I'm not really sure what it is about this film, but there is something that just makes me feel happy and is just an all-around fun movie to watch.Like I said, this film is one of those special movies for me, but the things I'm about to say could very easily get me savagely beaten if I said this to a hard-core fan of the film. So, even though I love this film there is a few things that I've NEVER liked about this film and the biggest one is David Bowie. What is he doing in this movie? I don't understand what people like about this guy, I really dislike his music and REALLY dislike his music in this film. I'm sorry, I know some of you out there are steaming right now, but it's just the way I feel. I honestly cringe every time David opens his mouth in this film.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!The only other major complaint I have about this film is the very end of the film. I can't stand how anti-climatic it is. David and Jennifer are talking and sort of arguing, she repeats some lines from her book and then he throws the little glass sphere in the air and she's suddenly back home. I'm sorry...but, LAME!!! Even when I was a kid I didn't like this end. I think I usually shut it off by the time I got to this part, because all the cool stuff had already happened.END OF SPOILERSI know I'm really sounding like I didn't like the film, but I really did like the film a great deal. There is some excellent comedy in the film, spectacular special effects, great puppeteering, and interesting characters (my personal favorite is Ludo...with Sir Didymus as a close second).If you haven't seen this film by now, I really do suggest you see it. I assure you that if you are talking to a movie buff and they find out that you haven't seen this film, there is going to be hell to pay. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theatres when I was two years old. I then saw it about four times a day for 13 years after that. I've now settled into a reasonble "once every couple of monthes" viewing pattern, but that doesn't change how I feel about this film. I have to say that it is my all time favorite movie. Yes, I can quote the whole film, yes, I have the soundtrack, and yes, I have the teeshirts. That, however, doesn't mean that my views are bias. It is simply a wonderful film set in a fantastical land starring David Bowie! Now, don't BS me. If you're "too cool" to enjoy a movie, even when it gets a little silly, don't even bother watching it. I don't want to hear it. This is a children's film that, Like "Beauty and the Beast", can be enjoyed by peole of all ages. A wonderful soundtrack accompanies the journey into a Jim Henson fantasy almost before it's time. From an era when people didn't try to shelter their kids from all reality (e.i. fear, pain, unusual love.. REALITY), the subtle messages of this film are never overshadowed by it's mystical setting. It doesn't matter how old you are, if you want a fun film that everyone can watch and enjoy, check it out. Heather</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike most people who have commented on this film it came out when I was 26... and I fell in love with it then and love it still today. I like many can recite line for line the dialogue... (indeed I am known for the "allo" "did you say hello" "no I said "allo" but that's close enuf".... lines) It is one of my favourite movies of all time, a perfect fantasy with a perfect cast and perfect story. I cannot imagine anyone else in the world being cast as Jareth..., David Bowie IS the goblin king... I managed to get it on video several years ago but then my dogs ate it (don't ask). I am now 42, and it is still one of my all time favourite movies. I am now actively trying to acquire a copy so that I can show it to my neighbours kids, (6, 5, and 4 respectively) cause I know they would love it. It is a childrens movie with a brilliant twist it can be viewed and appreciated by adults. I could wax lyrical about this movie for pages but you have all heard it before. Needless to say I shall merely quote "come on in meet the missus" "it is so entertaining being your head" "Ludo smell" "Did I hit anything, yes? no?" "would anyone like to play scrabble" "Ambrosius this is so embarrassing" ""no one shall pass without my permission" "well then may we have your permission" "hmmmmmm wellll, errrrrr, yes"..... buy it, rent it, borrow it, steal it if you have to (joke) but see this movie... your inner child will thank you for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this movie fascinates me. Seeing David Bowie in his best acting role ever. He was meant to play Jareth. And Jennifer Connely is amazing. She just fits the part perfectly. I recommend every single person in the world to see this movie. It is absolutely incredible. Every other time I rent a movie (which I do quite often) I rent Labyrinth. I would buy it, but I cant seem to find it anywhere. I absolutely love this movie and have for over 8 years. It is a timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know those films that your mum and dad had on video for you when you were very young and that you watched so many times you couldn't possibly begin to guess how many? Well this was one of those for me. We had it on video for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I haven't seen it for a few years but I do remember loving the fantasy of it. I saw the Dark Crystal later (I was still only about 7) but as I hadn't 'grown up' on it I didn't like it as much, mostly because of how dark it was so it scared me a bit. However Labyrinth was pretty scary too. It was my first knowledge of David Bowie and that is always my first image when I hear his name. I don't know of anyone who will deny being scared by him when they were little. Wonder whether or not he knows that thanks to that film he frightened an entire generation? I'll tell him if I ever meet him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie for the young and old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was little I've loved this movie. If you like Fraggle Rock or The Muppets, then you'll love this. The movie is basically about a spoiled teenage girl named Sarah whose jealous of her baby brother Toby. One night Sara decides that she wants goblins to take Toby away.Well goblins do take Toby away and then Sara decides she wants her baby brother back. It's not going to be easy because Sara has to wonder through a labyrinth to get to the center of the Goblin City where her little brother awaits. Along the way she meets several friends that help her find way to the center of the labyrinth.It's a good movie. It kind of brings out a part inside of you that has always dreamed of living in world of magic and fantasy where all sorts of strange beings live. I must say that Jim Henson did an excellent job and so did all of the puppeteers. David Bowie did a good performance as the Goblin King (other than the fact that the family jewels were quite noticable beneath his spandex).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Perfect Movies I Ever Saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie from the first opening scene where you see a teenage girl in a field reading aloud from a fantasy book in full princess dress and then the illusion is broken as she picks up the dress to run and reveals blue jeans beneath. It really spoke to me since I was (and still am) very much enchanted by the fantasy gendre.In some ways I WAS Sarah as a teenager. Sometimes everyday life just seemed so boring and stressful and the idea of escaping to another world full of magic and talking creatures seemed like the ideal change of pace. The labyrinth she must find her way through is imagined beautifully with riddles to solve and challenges to overcome--just like life really. When I was young I didn't see the metaphor there but now it strikes me when I watch it. The muppets are spectacular to watch and David Bowie as the Goblin King is very intriguing actually. His songs seemed somewhat odd the first time I viewed the movie but nevertheless I found myself humming them afterward. They haunt you just like parts of this movie do. And I'm not a David Bowie fan at all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generally fun cult film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my not-so-guilty pleasures, this charming piece helmed by the late and very much lamented Jim Henson is lovely to see and a joy to experience. Taking its visual cues from Henson's "The Dark Crystal" and its story from a mix of Alice in Wonderland and the Wizard of Oz, this is a classic story about growing up without relinquishing your childlike wonder.Adolescent Sarah (Jennifer Connolly) lives so much in her fantasy world that she views reality as a burden to her--particularly the reality that involves babysitting her infant half-brother Toby. In a fit of pique, she wishes that the goblins would come and take Toby away. But unlike just about every other elder sibling who's made a similar request, hers is granted in the form of the Goblin King himself (David Bowie, probably one of the few people on the planet who could pull off '80s hairstyles). Instantly regretting her thoughtless desire, Sarah journeys into the King's labyrinth to find Toby--and herself as well.Like "Dark Crystal," the visual design for this film was handled by illustrator Brian Froud, and like that film does a wonderful job of creating a strange, eerie, and beautiful fantasy world. The episodic plot is simpler than that of "Dark Crystal," but the characters are more engaging that those of the previous film. Sarah's principal companions--a cowardly dwarf, a gentle Bigfoot-like creature and a quixotic canine--are among the most appealing. Bowie turns in the best performance of the humans, creating an antagonist who is less of a classic villian and more of a trickster archetype, both charming and unsettling.Light and sweet, "Labyrinth" will not be for every taste, but for those whose appetites run to fantasy it's worth a look. And for devotees of Henson's unparalled genius, it is definitely a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film for the entire family!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth!!!! One of the greatest fantasy movies of all time!!!!! I remember first seeing this movie in the late 80's when I was 'bout 4 years old. I remembered enjoying it very much! This movie stayed at the back of my mind for years. It always kept popping up in my mind though every so often. It wasn't untill three years ago that I finally saw this fantastic film once again and it was great! One of the ultimate best ways to burn a babystitting Saturday night!!!!!!! Today i went to my local video store and purchased a copy, was the only one there and so I decided to not let this opportunity pass by. I had dinner once I got home and put in the movie for both myself and my three year old brother. We both loved it, my brother couldn't stop laughing. All the characters no doubt all make a great tribute to this film, however, both my brother and I loved that fox and the dog (can't remember his name), in my opinion he steals much of the show at some parts towards the end and is actually quite funny! This typical 80's fantasy is not only towards the children but for adults as well. It has a good message about life in it which I think was very well done. THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE. How true that is! Maybe 'tis just the way I happen to interpret them, but fantasy movies have always seemed to have messages about life in them and I happen to like that very much. This movie no where near has much of an impact as "The Last Unicorn". This movie is a bit more of a lighter more comedic film with a simple nice message to keep the smile on your face and turn the film off happily. I think anybody should see this film at least once in their lives!!!! For people who are into fantasy and messages, I tell people to see this movie right before "The last Unicorn." It will get you comfortable with the realm of fantasy and understanding. Then you can go on to the more powerful impact story. Anyways this movie was very nicely done, the actors were great, and I am glad to finally add it to my collection. I think it is fair to give this movie a 9/10. Rent it and be amazed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A tour-de-force for Jim Henson and his studio.Jennifer Connolley leads this cast of 5 humans, 1 Dog and more puppets than you can count. In the role of Sarah she does a splendid performance of a introverted yet willful teenager put through the challenge of surviving her own imagination. The peak of her performance is the Ballroom scene. I would say the Jennifer has never looked better in any other film.David Bowie hams it up a treat. Remember this is primarily a childrens' film, so his performance is spot on. He plays the fascinating and semi-evil Goblin King (Why he too is not a goblin is unaddressed ;-)) with a wry and distinctly flowery style.The puppetry is brilliant with Jim Henson once again proving himself to be the best in the business.No fantasy film since has surpassed Labyrinth in terms of imagination and charm. I look forward to the new batch of fantasy (Harry Potter &amp; LOTR) but still they are hardly original works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the best movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First i would have to say what i say is clearly my opinion, and other people might have their own. The movie is the best i have ever seen. For some reasons such as it has an all star cast. David Bowie (Jareth) gives an Academy Award and Grammy winning performance. His music is still the best i have heard to date, and which deserves at least eight Grammys. He sets the mood perfectly with his dire performance. No one could have done a better job at his part, he did it perfectly. Jennifer Connelly (Sarah) does an outstanding job at making you feel her pain and her gain. No one was better fit for the part. You really live the movie with her. The plot is the all time best. No other plot has come close to even matching it. This speaks highly of it, because i was born in 1986, and i am used to modern day plots and special effects, which are supposed to be better, and i find this to be the best. I can not think of anything negative about it, because there isn't anything. So in conclusion i would like to say there are not enough words to express how immense this movie is and if i were to grade it on a four star chart, i would not be able to since it is worth at least ten stars. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and i hope you will enjoy the movie if you have not seen it yet. Chow for now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Grows on You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I was even a year old when "Labyrinth" came out, so my first exposure to the film was on the Disney Channel, when it was actually decent and a channel I enjoyed watching, before it became a channel for people 10-12 It used to come on all the time, and I kick myself that I wasn't smart enough to appreciate this movie and record it. As a child of about nine, I wasn't even interested in a movie like "Labyrinth." Although I love the Muppets and I liked "The Dark Crystal," I wasn't willing to give this movie a second chance. It looked too dark and the Muppets were scary. They didn't even look like Jim Henson muppets to me. The first few times I caught it on TV, I didn't even watch five minutes of it, but then one night, when my sister (whose name is Sarah) was watching it for the umpteenth time, I decided I had nothing better to do, and I actually sat down and watched it with her. I was completely amazed. I can't ever remember being so spellbound! From the moment the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie), appeared on the screen, I couldn't take my eyes off him. Now, don't get my wrong, I was afraid of him, I mean, he truly frightened me. One my first observations were his multicolored eyes, which made him even scarier. He was the kind of character that was scary, but at the same time, so........WEIRD, you just couldn't help but stare. SPOILERS!! I rented "Labyrinth" this past weekend after reading the comments and remembering how cool the ballroom scene looked and the pained look on Jareth's face when he realizes Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) isn't going to stay with him. And now that I watch it again, I can see the flaws. But the flaws are far outweighed by how wonderful the rest of the film is. David Bowie pants are a little too tight for my liking, but just ignore the pants and look at his hair. I have never seen hair so AWESOME! And he wears that jacket armor so well! Jennifer Connelly does get a little trying in the beginning, but gets much better as the film moves on. In the first thirty minutes of the film, I thought it was going to be some campy Sci-fi flick, rather than the magical fantasy film I remembered. First Jareth tells Sarah she has thirteen hours to find Toby, and then fifteen minutes later he says she only has nine hours and twenty-three minutes. I was like, "Whoa! Where did the time go?". But it all gets better when he reduces her time to only an hour, the film is all uphill from there. And I must say I'm very pleased to say it is as enchanting as I remembered it. And yes, when I was nine I did want to be Sarah, and yes, I did wish that I could dress like a princess and have the cool-looking Goblin King sing to me. Those blue highlights he had in his hair were so cool!! The casting in this movie was excellent. David Bowie was the perfect Jareth, and his singing....well what can I say? He's David Bowie! Jennifer Connelly is a very believable Sarah, and I feel sorry for her that she has to make the decision to take Toby instead of staying with Jareth, and it looks as if she is sorry that she can't stay with him, but she realizes she has to leave all the "fairytale" behind her. My favorite character, besides Jareth, is the worm. I wish they sold little replicas of those worms! Now that I'm older and I actually know who David Bowie is, I can appreciate the songs and the music. The only part I don't like is the part right before the chorus "Dance Magic Dance" but that is the only flaw in the music. I wish so badly that I had recorded this movie! And I'm having trouble finding it a decent price, but I think my new life mission is to buy the soundtrack and the VHS tape. Anyone who likes, the Muppets, 80s Sci-fi, or Fantasy films you should see this movie. Heck, even if you don't like any of those things, you should see this movie. It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and it keeps getting better and better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, "Labyrinth." Who can honestly say they don't remember the time they first heard David Bowie, AKA The Goblin King's nasal British voice explain "Sara, don't defy me!" and mystically turn his crystal orb into a snake! THAT'S cinema!Why can't kid movies be like THIS instead of blatant TV commercials? This film has it all: comedy, action, drama, romance, special effects, visual effects, a great cast, great acting, and just about anything else one would expect from such a terrific flick. It's also shocking to see there was a time in which a clash of stylistic tastes actually WORKED in a film. You've got GlamRocker David Bowie starring, wacky Python alumn Terry Jones writing, kid guru Jim Henson directing, and sci fi underlord George Lucas executive producing, and yet the film actually came together... beautifully. Those were the days when even fun kid flicks were still something special... still ABOUT SOMETHING... still... dare I say it (oh, I do) ART.Those cats who keep pumping out "Pokemon" movies are all and good, but they need to allow at least one or two movies a year for children who aspire to be more than retarded nine-to-five tie-wearing cubicle warmers pounding on a computer at their mediocre job. C'mon, Hollywood... I know it takes a bit more effort and a great deal more money than having Tom Green make funny faces for two hours, but you CAN make a great kid/teen flick that will make your precious money.Just watch this over and over again, and hopefully some of it will sink into your head. At least you'll get some cool music in there, allowing you to avoid Aaron Carter for another five minutes.</fullReview>

Jennifer Connolly plays Sarah very well, although the character is sort of a ditz (look closely at some of the choices she makes inside the Labyrinth itself and you will see why I say this). There is so much about this movie that is lovely that the only way to understand it is to see it for yourself. It will always have a spot in my heart as one of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still magical despite the flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers in this review.Like many people I saw this film as a teenager and was completely entranced by it - for two main reasons, firstly, because I felt like they had read my diaries in order to write the character of Sarah!!! And secondly because David Bowie is and was so sexy!Seeing it as an adult I can see the flaws. The script is very weak, as is the concept. Sorry but, as beautiful as Jennifer Connelly is (I always wanted to be her) her acting is really not great, but then again, with a script like that I don't really know if she could have shown us what she was really made of! I was never very scared of the Goblin king. For all his show of evil, how can a guy who rules over a bunch of such incompetents be scary? How could such an army possibly hold dominion over even a fairytale land? And since he has such power, why does he stand back and watch Sarah barge into the castle, telling his idiot goblins minions, 'Do something!' Sorry but it just doesn't hold any water.I would LOVE to remake this movie with a truly scary bunch of goblins and a truly evil king. To all those who were wondering, yes I believe he is in love with her. This would not have to be lost. And also, making the goblins truly evil would not have to lose the humour either. Plenty other movies have scores of frightening evil minions with the old stupid one providing comic relief. It's not that hard to do!! :)The last scene between Jareth and Sarah was terrible. He looked amazing and her acting wasn't too bad, but those lines, aaaargh. It must have really pained Bowie (such an intelligent guy) to have to say 'I ask so little. Just fear me, love me, let me rule you, and you can have anything you want.' There is no attempt to veil his true intentions at all - only a complete idiot would be taken in by that little speech. PLEASE can we have some subtlety - after all the movie has been at pains to suggest that the goblin king is wily and manipulative. That was not manipulative. That was just a really bad attempt.The very ending, I am sorry to say (and I thought this even when I was a teenager) is absolutely pathetic. The intention is good, but carried out really badly. 'Every now and then in my life, for no reason at all, I need you - all of you' would make sense if she said it a few months into the future once she'd had time to realise the sense of it. But straight after she just got out of the labyrinth? It's totally illogical. She hasn't even had enough time to put her toys and costumes away.But when all is said and done I have to say I adore this movie even still. There are some classic lines - 'It's so entertaining being your hat.' 'I hit something? Yes? No?' that you really can't beat and always have me in stitches. And despite all the holes the visuals are such that I can still let myself be carried away by the fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is rare to see a fantasy film that is as engrossing to adults as it is to children, but this is one of the few. This film was released when I was 9 years old and I appreciate it more every time I see it. It has that "Peter Pan" type of story in which one wishes to escape from reality and have a fantastic adventure. The master Jim Henson creates puppet characters that entertain and amuse like no other and seem no less lifelike than the human characters. That is no small feat. In a word this film is "magical" and shouldn't be missed by you or you children. Enjoy.</fullReview>

Production, costume and makeup design that truly works *with* the themes of the movie. What a team!This is often cited as a children's film, but I disagree. To me, this is a fantasy movie for all ages. It takes two archetypic myths (the Heroic Quest and the Coming of Age Story) and handles them with depth, sensitivity and humor. Bowie especially is good--threatening and seductive while gradually revealing his deeper emotions.I first saw this when I was 26 and I *still* love Bowie's costume and hair! That tattered 18th century look is wonderful--and the tight pants are quite a treat. &lt;grin&gt;</fullReview>

My parents borrowed the book for me from our library in 1983 or 4 when my own brother was an infant. If you haven't read it, look for it in the children's section of Barnes and Noble. Read it once, and you too might believe that this book is what inspired a movie of a girl looking for a brother who was taken by Goblins...=)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic! What more can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well actually I could say a lot more. In fact, I could gab about this film all day! It's magical and mystifying. The whole atmosphere of the film makes you, well me anyway, wish that you could be there. The labyrinth truly is a magical place and a great home for any of us people who like a bit of adventure. Sarah, the young heroine, is played wonderfully and is a really strong character, as is Garret the goblin king, played by David Bowie. David not only delights us with his talented acting but also sings as well! What more could you ask for! The puppeteering is excellent and the sets are transfixing. Being a HUGE Monty Python fan, you would have thought that Terry Jones penning this great film would be the reason for me seeing it, but no, I've been watching this film for 12 years and only realised last year that Monty Python was even loosely connected. This just makes the appeal even stronger though. A must see film which I can't put down in any way. Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to Neverending Story, Willow, and Legend, Labyrinth is one of the greatest fantasy films out there. It is also one of the best films from the creators of the muppets. Anyone who has not seen this and that is in to these kind of films, please do see it. You will not be dissapointed.!!!SPOILERS!!!Sarah(Played by the lovely and talented Jennifer Connelly)wishes for her baby brother to be taken away by the Goblin King(Played greatly by David Bowie)to his castle. She soon feels bad for what she did and must travel through a labyrinth to get to the castle, face the king, and save her brother. On the way she meets some of the coolest friends and enimies.Great story, acting, effects, and soundtrack. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie! Jennifer Connelly is unbelievably beautiful as Sarah. It has this magical fairy tale quality to it, but with a lot of more mature humor. It's not a bad movie for kids, but some parents might not appreciate the tainted fairy tale humor, for example; near the beginning when Sarah sees a strange creature swatting fairies out of the sky and he explains it's because they bite (they seam to be some kind of mosquito). The story itself is pretty involving, and David Bowie's music certainly doesn't hurt. There are a few scenes that could have been scary had they been presented differently, but in this movie they just come out kind of weird. You don't have to worry about giving your kids nightmares. There are a lot of cool special effects that add to the surrealism of the movie, particularly the final battle between Sarah and the Goblin King. The end result is a great movie for adults and kids alike!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GOT TO LOVE IT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, here are my two cents. For those of you who saw this movie when you were older VS younger it is kind of crazy to really judge this movie. I did not see Willie Wonka until I was 23 (this Year) and I would not in my right mind judge it because you know what I lost that innocence and it would be insane to say it was a ok movie but their was no plot development etc. Of course that is my opinion.BUT about this movie. I loved it and I still do. I watched it on my DVD last night. It was cool. Of course like most people's favorite scene is where Sarah and Jareth are at the Ball. That scene is so RELAX and you can see it in the two characters, by their smiles and OH GOD does David Bowie look so HOT in this film. I think he looks great anyway but in this film for sure!!!! On the DVD it shows the work that was put in to this movie and it was amazing and now that I am older I can appreciate it more. Which leads me to say that I cannot believe how much real puppets look better than stuff done on CGI. Not to say that all CGI sucks but I guess I just like old school stuff.This movie is awesome and I tell you rent it, it is a great movie and it their is something for everyone in it.Plus for all of those SCI Fi fans who liked Star Trek the next generation, Gates McFadden helped on this movie as a choreographer. And you can see her on the DVD documentary for Labyrinth Which is kind of neat!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Jim Henson, and enjoyed some of his greatest puppetry on display in The Labyrinth, but unfortunately the script doesn't pack as much of a punch as the brilliant special effects and directing.It's basically a cliche, Wizard of Oz piece where young girl is thrown into one of those Oz-like mystical worlds where anything is possible, also similar to that in the Phantom Tollbooth or the Point. It just isn't very new and while the zaniness is to be appreciated in parts, it takes over the film and gives it no room from which to develop.It is structured badly as well. The plot comes up out of nowhere too quickly, and ends too suddenly but not soon enough. Understand? Maybe I'm just rambling incoherently.All in all, it has it's inspired moments and can be very funny and stunning at times, but doesn't measure up. Good for kids, but unlike Henson's other work, it doesn't hold up to the later ages...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Labyrinth is a classic fantasy film of the '80's. The characters and settings are all extremely creative; there is never a dull moment. David Bowie does a wonderful job as the glamorous goblin king, Jareth. Most of the goblins are played by puppets, courtesy of Jim Henson. Interspersed between the intriguing plot line are musical numbers performed by David Bowie which really give the movie much of it's modern yet neo-fantasy charm. Wonderful! ::smooch!::</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This coming-of-age story is more than some of Jim Henson's best late work; it is also an allegory for growing up without losing all of the wonder and magic of childhood. Despite the heroine's terrible acting, Henson's expressive puppetry, colorful characters, and firm grasp of the fairytale tradition of storytelling make this film accessible to children while still having enough thematic meat for adults. David Bowie's classic role as the mysterious and sensual Goblin King gives this film an edge that the saccharine children's movies of the 1990s have been sadly lacking as well. This is a film that grows with the viewer, and it is just as compelling at age 25 as it was at 10.</fullReview>

The surrealist fantastical adventure left me feeling warped and is probably a huge contribution to my deteriorating mental health. Why is this film so good? Well, you have a goblin king played by David Bowie. (Genuinely scary, not just for kids, for god's sake just look at how tight his trousers are...) You have talking worms, monsters who can tear themseleves apart and put their legs on their necks, ogres who can call on rocks and boulders, excellent music (once again, that mental deterioration thing again, I won't ever recover from when i saw him sing jump magic), dogs on top of other dogs, and a little guy called Hoggle.This is just the tip of the ice-berg.This is a very funny film witha lot of seriously messed up things in it... ..watch this or i'll throw you into the bog of eternal stench.</fullReview>

For an imaginative child, (or grownup) this is the perfect movie to fuel your wishes and dreams. Sara is indeed lucky, to have encountered fairies, trolls, talking worms (!) and those terrific fierys that can "Take off their heads!" The music is also terrific, and does not slow down the plot as, in my opinion, music in a film can often do. I am now sixteen, and this movie has not changed a bit (It won't ever).

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is an example of a film that can never be copied, bettered or remade. Jim Henson (R.I.P) was the master of puppetry and fantasy, and anyone who disputes that fact is a fool. I don't know anyone who doesn't like this film, and damn right too. Whether they admire it for it's charm, whether it evokes premature nostalgia, or because they love it, it is respected and oft talked about. So what if we're all 20 year old's with nothing better to do than get pi**ed down the pub and hare about in race-tuned Fiestas? This film is great anytime, be it a drunken binge, or a night in on your own. Funny, fashionable, well-made, I cannot fault this film. Dave is in fine form as the Goblin King, and he sports a thrillback eighties hair-do to boot. Jesus, I'm going to watch it again, right now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw 'Labyrinth' when I was 5 years old, and I promptly developed a crush on the Goblin King. Now that I'm older, I've learned to appreciate the whole picture, not just David Bowie. 'Labyrinth' must have been an incredible undertaking, but the love it was made with shows in every frame. With the exception of Sarah's parents, who are definitely skewed to be the stereotypical nasty stepmom and absentminded dad, all the characters were multi-dimensional, even the king. The pup- I mean, the Muppets all are original creatures, especially the Fierys ('Let's take off her head!') and the fairys who bite. The set is amazing, David Bowie steals the show, and you can't help but laugh at all the little touches you don't notice until your 3rd or 4th (or 30th or 40th) viewing. Jennifer Connelly is a little whiny at first, but gets better as the film goes. This film used to be impossible to find on video, now you can get it on DVD and VHS. What I've noticed about this movie is that either you saw it as a kid and LOVED it (acted it out, watched it over and over and over, etc), or you were sorely deprived and can't really get into it now that you're older. However, everyone who grew up on 'Labyrinth' has a strange, fanatical devotion to it (much like 'Legend') no matter the quality of the film in others' eyes. It's definitely one to dig out and relive, or show to the kiddies. It's just scary enough to keep them glued to the screen, there's no annoying slightly slow sidekick to cheese things up (Jar-Jar anyone?), and it definitely fuels the imagination. The Muppet/Jim Henson movies will endure long after the Pokemon and Power Rangers are in the trash, so just take a deep breath and go rent or buy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me this movie ranks up there with Goonies in nostalgic value alone, and that's saying a lot. Like most people born in the 80's they've seen it countless times, and have something of a love affair with it. While on the other hand people not born in the 80's or not a kid right now seem to look at it for the most part as if it were stupid. Roger Ebert for example gave it Two Stars, saying there was no strong plot line, and it dragged on to long. While I usually respect Ebert's reviews he totally missed the entire charm, and deeper meaning of the movie.This is anomaly of sorts. While browsing through the comments here I've seen numerous accounts of people who rank this movie as one of their favourite movies ever, while others make the same comments as Ebert.100 Goblins to one I can guarantee you that anyone who makes primarily negative comments about this movie wasn't born in the 80's. Not to say their comments are wrong, but they don't see the childish charm within the movie, and instead concentrate their comments with a objective "adult" point of view.So what's the moral of the story? Stop thinking like an adult, and start imagining like a kid.Ohh, and I gave this movie 10/10. If only for Jennifer Connelly's performance alone, nevermind Jim Henson's masterful puppets.</fullReview>

It has just about anything and everything required to make an ultimate effect on people out of a fantasy movie. It has kings, goblins, a damsel in distress, and most of all, it has a great cast. David Bowie makes a very lasting impression for people who have seen this movie, the tights, people, but of course that is very obvious. He also makes one heck of a villain and makes the Goblin King truly as dark and shadowy as his name. Jennifer Connelly, who plays the role of Sarah, who truly has a personae that anyone watching the movie should be able to empathize with. For those of you who haven't watched it, Toby should've had his, but then again, I do have a younger brother, too. In any case, the muppet characters are incredible, truly one of Jim Henson's masterpieces. The soundtrack is a must buy because David Bowie just transforms the atmosphere of the movie into one of an ampetheater of fantasy which gives life to the film.This movie is a 1986 film, but it has timeless quality because so little of it involves things that change through time. I feel that people should watch this movie at least once in their lives, it's one of those, "I never knew people would have made a movie about this"- kind of movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a fantastic movie for kids and adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember this movie so well from when I was a kid when it first came out. It was this movie that led me to develop my crush on David Bowie (and I know I'm not alone here!). It's a fantastic movie for kids - and just as good for adults. The Jim Henson creatures still look great, David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly play their parts so well, the music (by David Bowie) is wonderful (my favourite is the title track and 'When The World Falls Down' - I have the soundtrack). This movie is a must for all David Bowie fans. You'll enjoy this movie if you like adventure, good storylines, Jim Henson characters and are a kid at heart! I recommend it to everyone - it's still one of my favourites.I too wish the Goblin King (David Bowie's character) would have taken me away! I still do!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great when you can make the analogy of the Labyrinth's challenges being life's challenges. So many lessons can be learned by the studious viewer. Even if you can not stand some of the songs, or feel some of the effects are done poorly you can benefit from the artistic sentiment of this "adult-themed" children's spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An odd but thoroughly entertaining movie! Great for Sci-Fi Fantasy buffs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing that absolutely has to be mentioned about this movie is the music. David Bowie performs all of the vocal tracks and does a terrific job. Sure the songs can be kind of cheesy, but they're definitely the kind of songs that you will find yourself humming for weeks afterwards. The second thing that needs to be mentioned is the overall look of the film. It is just beautiful. The sets and back-drops are lavish, and all of the puppet characters are done by the Jim Henson team (nuff said right?) The story is not too incredibly thought provoking, good triumphing over evil, but it is fairly solid and enjoyable. The music and the visuals more than pick up the slack that the story line creates though. I think that anyone who is a sci-fi Fantasy film fan owes it to themselves to see this movie at least once. In comparison to other films, it is more fantastic (fantasy) than Willow but not as epic. It is less fantastic than Legend, but definitely easier to follow. And it is more lighthearted than both of these movies and the Dark Crystal are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was way ahead of its time, and possibly one of the coolest ever made. It is no surprise that the mastermind behind it is none other than Jim Henson his-self. He manages to create a totally unique fantasy world, complete with dozens of puppet creatures.David Bowie plays the bad guy, and he dresses like a freak. Jennifer Connelly, complete with the thickest eye-brows known to man, plays the geeky heroine. Toby Froud plays Jennifer's baby brother who she is trying to rescue. The rest (or majority) of the film is played by puppets.The main ones are Hoggle, a little dwarf-man-thing, Ludo, a great big bloody yeti, Didimus, a valiant dog-like noble (and in my opinion the best character) and his trusty steed Ambrosia. All the other creatures (goblins, birdy-things, etc) are all brilliant as well. Who needs ten-trillion-million-billion dollar special effects when you can use the magic of puppets (that wasn't a joke).All my respect goes to the late Jim Henson, who created two of the best films of all time, Dark Crystal and this, Labyrinth. In fifty years time, the magic of Jim Henson will still be with us all as we watch this film with delight, while others will settle to watch 'Star Wars Episode 72' and 'Matrix 12'.10 out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid this is just a great film all the time. It has people to look up to, people to love, people to hate, people to be frightened of, things to laugh at, things to sing along too and a true sense of magic and wonder. As an adult it is a film for escaping too, a film to put on when you don't feel well, when your girl/boyfriend just dumped you, when it's raining outside. It reminds you of why you don't want to grow up and of why you did. Plus it is beautifully made with wonderful effects by Jim Henson, magical designs by Brian Froud and a great soundtrack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot even begin to describe to you how much I love this film. I first saw it when I was a little girl of about six - I am now seventeen and I still adore it. It is the most magical, beautiful film I have ever seen, and it mesmerised me from the very beginning. I was absolutely overjoyed when it was re-released. First of all, what I notice the most now, is David Bowie's fantastically wicked performance as the menacing, seductive Goblin King. Having David in it instantly gives the film an extra offbeat kind of charm - I don't deny being a major fan of his - but even if you're not a fan, you can still appreciate the high quality performance he gives, and how he fits the character so well - getting the perfect balance of a wicked, seductive and slightly strange Goblin King. His music instantly makes the film a jewel amongst other fantasy adventures. For example, the songs 'Within You' and 'As the World Falls Down' are almost painfully beautiful to hear. This is combined with an excellent performance from Jennifer Connelly as Sarah - the willful and strong heroine, and the amazing talents of Jim Henson and all of the wonderful creatures he creates. I believe that this is a film perfect for both adults and children who like to take a little trip into a magical world of escapism once in a while.One criticism, though. If I had been Sarah, I would have ditched the baby and stayed with Jareth. Heh, heh! ;-)- And if anyone mentions one bad thing about Jareth's tights and/or hair and make-up, they should come and see me about it. I'll sort you out.... You have been warned :-)There is a growing community of Labyrinth fans on the net. I am obviously one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth contains what i feel to be the late Jim Henson's best work ever. the level of detail and expressions that he was able to generate out of his puppets has always amazed me. i'll take a muppet over a computer generated Jar-Jar anyday.the book is literally a children's book come to vivid life. every scene and character has a magical feel about it that most so-called children's movies lack. the key to this movie is that is can just as easily be enjoyed by adults as well, since some of humor and situations work on 2 different levels.David Bowie was perfectly cast as the villain and a young Jennifer Connelly brings just the right note of polite innocence to her role. virtually all the other roles are inhabited by muppets but the voice characterizations are top notch.the only gripes i have is with some of the scenes going on a bit too long, and the songs being enjoyable but unnecessary.definitely a good choice for children.rating: 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is an amazing fantasy, far too good to be merely labelled as a "children's film." The detail is superb, especially in the cases of the Henson characters like Hoggle, Sir Didymus and the Junk Lady. Jennifer Connelly is great as a heroine who can do things herself, without relying on some muscle-bound hero to pop out and save her. And David Bowie - who could resist those tights? He makes a wonderfully wicked - and sexy - villain, and his ethereal vocals really give a sense of magic to the film. So, what are the lessons we must all learn from Labyrinth? Nothing is as it seems, don't take things for granted, and never, ever tell Jareth that his Labyrinth is a piece of cake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had totally forgotten about this movie. I watched it endlessly when I was little, had the soundtrack, and would dance around my room to it *lol*. Then, a couple weeks ago I saw it for sale at a store for $12.99.. Im practically broke, but it was the last copy.. and I'd never seen it for sale before so I HAD to get it! Well, I watched it again... and again.. and again. I have to agree with everyone here... This movie rocks. There is a lot of sarcastic humor in it that flew over my head when I was younger.. and I dont care what anyone says, but for 1986.. The effects and make-up etc were pretty darn good. I think we've all gotten used to all our fancy computer special effects, and its spoiled us. At the end of the movie, there was a special "Behind the scenes footage" included.... and just seeing how they made and brought Hoggle to life amazed me. I think partially because, after a while, you forget that Hoggle isnt real (sorry, he's my fave in this movie!). So seeing them 'build' him I guess amazed, and saddened me a little.. you know, a reality check ;-). Anywho... A lot of hard work went into this movie.. and its too bad that still so many DON'T know about it, or do, but don't appreciate it. :P</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1985, I was born. One year later, Labyrinth came out. My mind was just play-doh back then, so I can't say I truly remember anything. However, my sister used to always babysit me on friday nights, and play one of the movies that I enjoyed but she hated, and so I tended to watch the movie quite a lot.1992, I became of an age in which I remember things. I remember jumpin around and dancing to 'The Magic Dance' and getting down with 'Chilly Down.' I remember renting it every chance I had the chance. Everyone else in my family hated it so, but I remember watching it fondly, and people said I was going to break it for watching it so much.It came after a while that my family took all the toys out of my room and told me to grow up. I was 9 years old. Labyrinth became a memory that I rarely had.I recently got a job babysitting, and it a child who was 7 years old. The day I got my first 20 dollars for it, I went on to the movie site, and there Labyrinth was, in all of its glory. Memories bombarded me, everyone told me that they had taped it off of TV, but broke the tape it was on.I later went to the store to get Labyrinth. ten-thousand times it seems that I have watched it.I showed it to the child yesterday. He said that he likes it, and I began to cry.-Christopher Gregorovich</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, yet another great fantasy film that almost disappeared forever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank goodness for DVD, I have been trying to get a good copy of this for years.I still cannot believe how many people do not know that this movie exists. I wonder if this film would have ever been released if it was not for the current trend in cult releases on DVD and tape. It may not be the best movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the best fantasy films of modern cinema. Sure, maybe some of the effects may be dated by today's standards or the film may have been marketed for children, but ... who cares? The work on the design of this production alone should have won it several awards, David Bowie's performance still stands out as incredible, and the story itself is a lot deeper than most will admit. But hey, at least that fact has not hurt the film's popularity. Only something as well done as this could withstand the tests of time in a film industry like ours.Regardless of anyone who might disagree as to how good or bad Labyrinth is, no one can deny it's power to generate a fan base that could survive without any means to purchase a copy for so long. Only something that can touch people's hearts and minds could do something like that. The eighties heralded so many well done fantasy productions that I wish it would become a filmmaking trend again someday. Labyrinth, The Never Ending Story, The Princess Bride, Return to Oz, and Legend were truly some of the most painstakingly detailed, amazingly directed, and beautifully scored films that I can think of. I may have originally viewed them as a young child, but over the years not one of them has disappeared from my memories. As one grows older one forgets the unmemorable, but not works of art like these. After just viewing Labyrinth again, I can see that even though I've grown and I've learned many things about filmmaking itself, this movie still amazes me. Even if some have a problem with the pace or are avid haters of muppets, they should sit down and give this film a chance. At times it almost seems as if the characters in the film are just walking through a wonderfully done canvas of colors, and I am not talking about the matte paintings. There are points where the viewer just forgets that they are even viewing a film and become mesmerized by the music, visuals, and feel of Labyrinth. One might think that Bowie's music, having been a fad of the eighties, would have also been awkward after a decade or so, but that is not the case either. The music just seems to fit as if it were never part of the real world at all but just more of what one would expect from mischievous goblins out to have fun or Jareth's attempts at wooing the heroine. If I had to pick one thing about this film that will truly leave anyone in awe, it is the ballroom sequence. I have not seen many films in my life that have given a feel of a hypnotizing dream like Frank Oz and Jim Henson did in that scene. The symbolism equally matched with a romanticized score, perfectly timed dance choreography and unbelievable costume designing make for one of the grandest scenes I have ever viewed.I'm very happy that now after more than a decade, this film has been restored and given a chance at new life. Maybe now more will learn of it and give it the appreciation it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been few movies as magnificent as this one, especially one that's aimed for children. This movie is one of the deepest films I have ever seen. In both the Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal, Jim Henson has given us a unique world where anything is possible. His creative talent and his imagination will forever be remembered in these two spectacular films. The Labyrinth has one of the best soundtracks that wasn't composed by either James Horner or John Williams. . .and the acting is incredible. David Bowie really shines as Jareth. In fact, I couldn't imagine another actor playing that character as well as he did. This movie ranks right up there with Groundhog Day and the Matrix in terms of spirituality. There are many, many levels to this film, and it's ashame that very few people understand the complexity of this motion-picture masterpiece. Since I grew up on this movie, I may be biased in it's favor. . .but even if I were to watch it for the first time in a theater right now, I would have to admit that it's a work of art.</fullReview>

I've heard many people say how the movie is nice and simple... the movie itself isn't. Its full of depth, the plot is simple enough though and that's nice because it leaves room for you to speculate about what the hidden meaning is.

Unfortunely many movie goers, seem to think that a movie with a guy with lots of guns shooting bad guys is much more an adult film than something like Labyrinth wich even has cute little puppets in it. And so many Fantasy movies are bound to flop right at the begining just because of this type of macho, very adult atitude towards movies.Well, im 29 and i love this movie. Unfortunely i can´t find it anywhere and i didn´t taped it when i could, so now i only can remember it. And strangely enough the thing i remember best is the cute centiped little creature that lives on a wall, wich Sarah mets right when she arrives at the Labyrinth. That must be one of my favorite characters ever. Anyway i think this is another great work, by the man who could have changed fantasy movies as we know them ,if he were still with us. Jim Henson does an incredible job with this movie, that altough it´s filled with puppets, the human side is never forgotten and Sarah, must be one of the most realisticaly portrated teenagers in a story like this. This character has more depth than many others from the so called "more adult" movies.But what makes this movie so unforggetable, are the creatures and the amazing landscapes in the world of the Labyrinth. Those set pieces realy create an amazing enviroment and a very original one in some ways. Maybe also because of the soundtrack, wich is very diferent and very good also.So everybody get this movie, because it´s too good to be so forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film. Beautiful art direction, great writing, and some lovely acting.All the principals are marvelous and exude personality. Bowie is terrific as the ambigous Goblin King, who is neither truly evil nor truly good. Connely plays her role with aplumb and spunk, and her character Sarah is an conflicted, realistic portrayal of a teenager. The muppet characters are varied and interesting, and Boggle especially makes you forget that they're not alive.And despite other comments, there is a story. A simple yet involving one. Sarah's search for her brother is marked by self-discovery and insights into the nature of life and reality. She is also courted by the Goblin King, who's true nature and intent is left for the viewer to decide. All in all, a fantastic ride.And the soundtrack is cool.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>look past the fantasy and see the metaphor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch this movie, try to look past the staging, the direction, the art and the effects. Look beyond the trappings of a pretty fantasy and what you will find is a deeply symbolic story about growing up, about the way we perceive reality and the way we ascribe to evil things that are really faults within ourselves. Visually, the movie is rich, and children will love the classic adventure story of a young girl and a goblin king; but when I think back on the movie, instead of seeing the goblin-king, I see a beautifully subtle symbol for the childish weaknesses we all outgrow. When you watch this movie, watch carefully. It's much deeper than it seems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical memorable journey through a world of artistic sight and sound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a video store clerk, I see many movies that never quite manage to get the recognition they deserve, and Labyrinth is one of those films. Another vision of artistic and technical achievement from Jim Henson, Labyrinth is a movie that remains with you for life. To see it is to love it. While at first glance it may be branded a children's film, Labyrinth maintains complex story and artistic elements that children might miss. While the story revolves around Sarah, played with innocence and strength by Jennifer Connelly, the true star is Jareth, the slightly sinister villain. As Jareth, David Bowie creates a villain who is at once charismatic and suave, but underneath like a child desperate for the attention of others. He terrorizes her with trolls and chases her with Chillys, only to plead for her forfeiture to his will. The film overflows its coffers with colorful characters to populate its world of wrong turns and wonderment (Many of these characters, and the same charming visuals return in two unreleased videos for Bowie's songs from the film, "Underground" and "As The World Falls Down"). It also contains memorable and touching music from Bowie himself as well as composer Trevor Jones. Once you hear the somber "As The World Falls Down" or the jubilant "Magic Dance," it will be very difficult to forget them. Overall, Labyrinth is a touching fable filled with colorful characters and memorable music, and not to be underrated or left on the video shelf. For fans of the style, I recommend Frank Oz's "Dark Crystal" and Ridley Scott's "Legend" with Tom Cruise. For fans of Bowie, I recommend "The Linguini Incident" and "The Hunger", directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony Scott.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The technical wizardry and un-paralleled imagination of Muppet master Jim Henson. The celluloid and soundtrack appearance of one-time Ziggy Stardust, David Bowie. The sparkling wit of Monty Python graduate Terry Jones. The enchanting Jennifer Connelly. What more COULD you wish for?A lot more, it would seem, as "Labyrinth" remains one of the most criminally misunderstood and under-appreciated films in the history of cinema. Ignored on initial realease, derided by critics for it's lack of brevity and narrative core(!), and since sniggered at for Bowie's eye-catching wig and leg-wear. But WHY?"Labyrinth" has managed to survive such adversity and live on in the hearts and minds of cinema-goers and children of all ages because it is a blissfuly innocent and compelling modern fairy tale; a true cinematic gem bursting with spectachular set-pieces( from the gravity-defying Escher room to the sumptuous wonder of the ball-room bubble), a breath-taking gallery of incredible creatures( remember the jive-talkin', limb-swappin' Fireys, or the l'il tea-slurping worm?),haunting Bowie-tastic songs, a captivating heroine in the form of Jennifer Connelly and a devilishly love-lorn Goblin King in the form of David Bowie. The story of Sarah( Connelly )venturing into the wickedly deceptive Labyrinth to rescue her baby brother( baby-sitting has never been THIS compelling! ) from the clutches of a Goblin King( Bowie )and his army of ranting urchin goblins is not just an exciting adventure story, packed with as much humour, suspense and time-honoured family values as you can fit into 101 minutes, but also a beautifully handled coming-of-age story, detailing Sarah's venture into the equally unknown area of womanhood.Let's hope such a movie as "Labyrinth" is never forgotten. It certainly won't be if I get my wish!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still my favorite movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just saw the movie again, perhaps for the 10th or 15th time, and I just have to say that I never tire of it. Certainly one of the best done movies I've ever seen, and one of the best movie soundtracks that has ever existed. (Certainly the only movie soundtrack I can think of that I would actually pay money to get, as I have to like all songs on a CD before I buy it.) David Bowie is excellent as Jareth, the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly is certainly one of the better movie heroines I've seen. She's not the passive type who cries about broken nails or screams and screeches after everything that happens to her. Although she is a tad unwise, as is evidenced by her rather poor answer to Jareth's question on how she likes the Labyrinth -- "It's a piece of cake." And great performances by the people responsible for Hoggle, Sir Didymus, and Ludo. Unlike others, I enjoyed the ballroom scene, and the song "As the World Falls Down" is my favorite off the soundtrack. This slower scene is a refreshing break from the faster pace of the rest of the movie, and I love the way the scene is ended. The end of the movie, when Sarah enters the castle, was particularly great. I loved the way the stairs and doorways and everything are all over the place, upside-down, sideways, or whatever, and it seemed that only Sarah was unable to walk upside-down. And David gives off a great performance in the end, as he tries to stop Sarah from finishing the poem that will undo him. As one last note about the movie, I would like to bring up a topic somebody else mentioned in one of the reviews on this site -- a Labyrinth 2. Personally, I think this would be a BAD idea. So rarely does a sequel ever live up to the original, as has been evidenced so often when a sequel bombs. I've so rarely seen a sequel that works, and even then they are rarely as good as the original. While I would love to see the sequel if it were as good as the original, I doubt if that will ever happen. My only complaint is that the IMDB's voting options only go as high as 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun movie! If Star Wars is our modern mythology, then Labyrinth is our modern Fairy Tale. Jim really scored on this one. The labyrinth in the film is a metaphore for life, full of pitfalls, people who don't want you to succeed beyond them, and those who do. There is a fantastic cast of characters, all well-rounded and believable, despite the fact they are not human. The only thing in the whole movie I think should have been cut is the ballroom scene. I understand why they did it, but I still think that it slows down the pace. Jareth's riding pants were a little frightening, but David Bowie nailed Jareth (the Goblin King). Brian Henson's vocal and mechanical performance is superb. You'll like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this was a fine movie, and it was interesting to see the puppetry, 80s soundtrack, and so on, but the core story was pretty average. For someone very familiar with the hero's journey (I used to read a lot of fantasy novels as a kid), this movie had little new to offer. I don't have a problem with this tried-and-true story structure, but the movie just didn't do a particularly good job of executing it.While the basic motivation for the plot (a wish gone awry, more or less) has good potential for a story, the goblin king seems a little too wooden for the setup to really be convincing. Does he actually want to keep the child, or is his real intention to give the heroine a test of character? It seems like the answer is neither. He repeatedly professes dismay at Sarah's progress, yet does little to stop her and seems to be strangely uninterested in what's happening. Bowie certainly looked the part but I think his uninflected portrayal failed to be compelling overall.Another thing I thought was problematic was the lack of real threat in the story. Throughout the movie, the heroine encounters trials such as: getting lost, falling in a hole, and having to cross a bad-smelling swamp. I understand the movie was geared towards children, but I think the level of menace and dramatic tension could have been increased without making the movie too family-unfriendly. After all, kids already know fear. There are certainly things I fear as an adult, but nothing can equal my childhood terror at the thought of raccoons (don't laugh), terrible creatures of the darkness that invaded our yard to shatter our illusions of suburban security and raid our trash cans. But I digress. My point is, the challenges faced by the heroine seem pretty tame even by kids' movie standards.The final abyss was especially weak. Rather than a climactic scene in which the heroine has to confront her own inner demons, she instead has to overcome... Escherian staircases? Then she struggles to remember a monologue (as the main antagonist waits patiently) and finally triumphs when she utters the last line: "You have no power over me". Well, that's all well and good, but it really could have been a lot better. (Even "Bartholomew and the Oobleck" had a more exciting climax, and in that story the main antagonist was inclement weather!)Still, the movie had some good messages about responsibility and growing up, the power of friendship and kindness, and so on. And it was pretty imaginative. It's something I wouldn't mind my kids watching, if I ever have kids. All in all, it was pretty good -- just not great.</fullReview>

Sarah (Connelly) is a teenage girl who dreams to be part of a real-life fairytale finding romance. She starts getting pressurized by her father and stepmother always making her watch her baby brother, Toby. One night, when her parents go out and leave her babysitting him, she wishes for him to be taken away by goblins and their king, Jareth (Bowie). Jareth tells her that Toby's at his castle and that she has 13 hours to find her way there by solving the labyrinth. If she doesn't rescue him in time, he'll become a goblin forever. while Sarah embarks on her journey, she sees strange things and meets new friends. I've loved this film since I was 6 years old and David and Jennifer are great in this. I recommend this classic fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there anything as magical or as memorable, as this movie? I think not. Labrinth is a timeless treasure, and can be loved and enjoyed throughout generations. I watched it as a child, and it still holds the same magic and wonder it did for me then, seeing it for the first time. I've shared it with my son, and I hope one day to have a daughter to share it with as well.David Bowie is at the top of his game as the Goblin King. Talented, romantic...You just want to be in Sarah's shoes in this movie! He is so commanding and gorgeous in this fantasy role.The songs are catchy and will stay in your head long after the film is over. You don't want her to leave, yet you want it all to work out for her in the end (I personally would have stayed with David Bowie!) Not since this movie came out has any other film been quite the same. Nothing can or will ever match it, though there are two other films that have their own magic and remembrance: Legend and The last unicorn. All in all, Labrinth is a great family film that will stay fresh and timeless- and will never be equalled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combining music, adventure, comedy and fantasy, this film is a timeless childhood classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to start by saying I loved this movie as a child. As a matter of fact, I loved a lot of Jim Henson's work, having grown up on the Muppet movies and of course on The Dark Crystal. At 17, I still love this film, it is a timeless childhood classic for the whole family to enjoy! Then again, I may be biased as my favourite film genres are musicals, animation and fantasy. Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Little Nemo's Adventures in Slumberland, Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St Louis, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Princess Bride and NeverEnding Story were my favourites, and I know one or two reviews here have been disfavourable towards Legend, and that has got a lot of hate on IMDb. But I want to say despite Legend's flaws, it is a visual feast to the eyes, with a great music score and one of the best villains ever in a fantasy film.Back to Labyrinth, it may have one or two minor flaws. People have complained it is cheesy and dated, and that the ballroom scene slowed things down. Maybe so, but this film is so entertaining and such fun and the ballroom scene was exquisite visually I honestly don't really care.Labyrinth, I think has held up well. The puppet characters are fantastically designed and move seamlessly, and the film is filled with widely imaginative sets that are both haunting and enchanting. The film began and ended very effectively I thought, and the special effects are well above average. I especially love the feel of the film, it is like a Grimm's Fairytale. A lot of effort went into making this movie and it shows, the battle at the Goblin King's castle especially was a masterstroke.The story is timeless, filled with exuberance, charm, comedy and adventure. This is what a fantasy film should be like, and reasons why Wizard of Oz and NeverEnding Story work so well even on repeated viewings. The scripting is not that bad, Dungeons and Dragons especially had inane and vomit inducing dialogue that alone ruined the film. There is some good dialogue in this film though, Jareth gets the best of them. There were some funny moments here, the fiery dudes who take off their own heads were great fun, same with the cute little dog. And I like Hoggle, a gruff but somewhat humorous character. As well as the feel of the film, and the characters I love the fact that Labyrinth teaches values about growing up without preaching.I have heard complaints about the music being cheesy. Maybe I am wrong for saying this, but while it isn't the most imaginative music score ever in a fantasy film, I liked it. It has a unique sound to it, and gave David Bowie the opportunity to show off his strengths. I like David Bowie, there are songs of his I like more than others, but then again it is like that with most musicians. His songs here are fun, the lyrics are nice and the melodies are memorable. The final confrontation between him and Sarah was a definite highlight.The performances and the characters were also great. I have also heard complaints that Sarah is a vapid heroine and that Jennifer Connelly is just eye candy. Can I be one to disagree? Jennifer Connelly isn't the best actress ever, but in an early role she is not bad at all. Her character is the sort of character that goes on a journey, she starts off perhaps unlikeable, but in the end we want her to succeed. Think along the lines of Princess Lilli from Legend. The best piece of casting is David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, there may be those who may laugh at his Tina Turner- like wig, but Bowie plays a unique sort of villain. Nothing too sinister or camp, but one that is evil but also charismatic, manipulative, sympathetic and sexy. Bowie played all these qualities flawlessly, as he was ever so sexy, his voice was in great shape and some of his costumes are to die for. And the voice acting is very well done, I noticed some Muppet regulars there, including Brian Henson as Hoggle. Plus Toby Froud as baby Toby is absolutely adorable.All in all, I love this film and will cherish it for years to come, no matter how many minor flaws there are. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just watched The Labyrinth for the 100th time!!! Yes, I'm a geek - I'll freely admit it, but I've watched this film since I was a young girl and even now I still find it magical. I also must admit, that as I've grown older, I have found Jareth more and more sexy...but that's another story.Every shot is a visual treat, even the dullest of shots, when Sarah first enters the Labyrinth and we see close ups of her feet running down the (seemingly never ending) path, is beautiful to look at, the floor literally glistens and the sound design is perfect! The humour is still relevant in this day and age, and I crack up every time at the lines said by the two headed door way guards.You simply can't beat this movie and a remake would be tragic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My fav movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just love Labyrinth! It's really a classic and it brings back the good old days before CGI. And the moral is, nothing can replace great storytelling magic. Long live Jim Henson! Man, it's really got to be the highest point in his career, the muppets are so so real. I just love the way he breathes life into them! And they are all so unique! The storyline in Labyrinth is great and multi-layered - definitely a bit too complex for a child to understand. When I first watched it, I was 12 and it scared the hell out of me! And it was great to revisit it 20 years later and find that you have progressed and that you can understand the multi-fold depths of the film.I think David Bowie did a fantastic job (and I'm not even a David Bowie fan) playing a charismatic, manipulative and yet sympathetic villain. He did so great a job that at the end you are left feeling sorry for him, cos he didn't do anything wrong - he liked Sarah, he granted her first wish to take Toby away, gave her a second chance to get Toby back... he wanted to love beneath his seemingly evil facade. And I thought the songs were real good. the depths of the lyrics, wow, I didn't know David Bowie can be so profound! I found Sarah so courageous. It really strikes me, and how in the end she chose to face womanhood and adulthood maturely, accepting responsibility. I would have taken the easy way and stayed with Jareth, knowing that I'll get all my wishes granted.I think it's a great great movie, very profound and moving even though it's filled with muppets and targeted at kids being in the fantasy genre. It's definitely not dark, it's just deep. I actually rewatched to confront my childhood fears, didn't expect to stumble upon a cult of Labyrinth fans and even more rabid David Bowie fans who imagine fantasies of what could have been and what if Sarah ended up with Jareth. Hmm, wonder if they would feel the same way if Jareth didn't look like David Bowie but like some of his underlings! But somehow in spite of the age difference, the love story moved me greatly. I wonder why? Perhaps in all our secretest heart, we want a prince charming and live in a fairytale ending ever ever after instead of living in the real world, with its taxes, retrenchment, economic problems. So yeah Sarah chose bravely, I think I'm not so brave and I would have chosen differently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult film disguised as a children's fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much more to this movie than meets the eye. It's an adult film disguised as a children's fantasy. There is enough there to captivate children and lure them into a magical world, but as an adult there is quite a bit of subtext involving Sarah's (Jennifer Connelly) coming of age and dealing with reality as someone who is not a child but not considered an adult. She has to deal with feelings of a sexual nature that she's not sure about, (hence an older man in the Goblin King played wonderfully by David Bowie) and she must make choices that bring her closer to leaving her fantasies behind and becoming an adult. All of this will go over your children's heads, especially the Ballroom scene and the now famous tights. They will simply love the film for it's magical and romantic properties. It is wonderfully brought to life by Henson, Froud, Terry Jones of Monty Python fame and the two main actors, Connelly and Bowie, who both do a fantastic job. Connelly playing the perfect teenager who grows wiser and Bowie being the best romantic villain put on screen.Just a bit about Bowie's acting. He was slated for this film by music and film critics alike when it was released. But what more could one want? It's still a children's film, albeit with adult undertones. He couldn't be too evil yet was still bad enough to be seductively watchable. I think he played it for all it was meant to be and possibly more..(perhaps the producers and Henson didn't realise how sexual he came across).As for the songs... please try and put them into context of the scenes they appeared in, (and also the time period). Magic Dance was in a raucous, mischievous party like scene... the lyrics were full of childish magical terms. Worked very well in the scene and lets face it...it is infectious. As the World Falls Down, a beautiful lullaby placed in a scene where Sarah is "dreaming", (well hallucinating due to being drugged..;)) and invokes a sad mood regarding a lost girl physically and emotionally who is confused and craves the love of her Prince but knows she shouldn't. It is quite possibly one of his most romantic lyrics ever and his voice is divine. Chilly Down was just for that scene and that scene alone. Perfect characterisations of the puppets mentality. (Remember David is writing for the film). Within You was written just for the scene where he is confounded by Sarah's attempts to deny his affections. Quite sad when viewed in the film. Underground neatly wraps up the film with tales of another land inside and outside ones mind. His vocals on this song are brilliant and even reminds me of something off of Young Americans. So you see I believe he did a fantastic job with this movie both acting and music wise. It was what was needed from him and he delivered ten fold.I really hope Bowie and Connelly are not embarrassed by this film. I think they should be proud to have been in something that has captivated generations of slightly alienated young pre sexual girls (and a few boys), and has lead many of them onto their careers...what more could you ask?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight-Garbed Glam Rock Meets Sword-and-Sorcery Cinema... Curiously Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of Jim Henson lives on in innumerable places. "Labyrinth," while not one of the greatest of his oeuvre, is still a gem (though a slightly tarnished one) full of memorable animatronic creatures and the late Henson's consistent ingenuity.Jennifer Connelly pouts and whines her way through her performance as Sarah, a spoiled teen who must rescue her baby brother after wishing that goblins would come and kidnap him. Which they did, led by goblin king Jareth (David Bowie, who, unfortunately, sings).Early in the journey, she meets a goblin named Hoggle who helps her on a trek fraught with peril and that-wasn't-there-a-minute-ago puzzles. Along the way, she meets Ludo, a shy demon, and a delusional knight named Sir Didymus. Meanwhile, Jareth gives Sarah a deadline to rescue little Toby before he becomes one of them... forever!The performances are not that good, and the songs are cringe-worthy, but the film is still full of magic and fun. The magic is provided by Henson and his highly skilled creature performers, while the fun is provided by both co-writer Terry Jones (yes, Terry Jones of Monty Python fame) and cinematic wizard George Lucas. "Labyrinth" is, almost rightfully so, a very popular film. Feast your eyes... but maybe not your ears... on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as successfully fantastical as the other Henson films, but it is an entertaining KID's flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Labyrinth on TV the other day, after years of having not seen it, I'm reminded in general how I see Jim Henson's work, via the usual Muppets (in the 'Muppet' movies) or in the non-traditional ones (the spectacular film 'the Dark Crystal'), just a smidgen different than as a kid. For one thing, there's the nostalgia factor, of having loved the muppets as a kid and seeing how the entertainment value is still there, if on a slightly different wavelength then as a kid- some jokes more received and understood and some moments not as freakish as when back in the day. But with Labyrinth I just thought, despite all of the talent and marvelous special effects, "this hasn't really changed much for me since I was a kid, it's still just, well, good." The story itself- of young Jennifer Connelly going after her baby brother kidnapped by the Goblin King (David Bowie, in full-on regalia) while navigating through the tangential directions of the Labyrinth with help (or not) from creatures- is just a fairy tale for kids. That it's got some clever direction from Henson is not without its merits and some scenes get the fantasy feeling right, even for its time and visual FX limitations. But if there are limitations anywhere noticeable it's in the script by Terry Jones, from the story by Henson and Dennis Lin, where chances to reach to a larger audience (like with the Dark Crystal, which works for adults just as well as for kids) are missed. The humor in the film does work here and there, but there are also the Bowie songs to contend with which are, more or less, rather disappointing and, well, 80's in retrospect. I still liked the inventive uses with the supporting Muppet-type characters, the little troupe of sorts that follows Connelly's character till the end (almost). However, having seen it again, I'm not sure when I would want to watch it again, unless I had some kids around. In short, one of the lesser Henson films (ironically the only one produced by George Lucas) which means that it still has enough visual prowess and imagination to top the current films reaching for its target audience.</fullReview>

The man who spun the crystal balls behind Bowie did an excellent job. Talking about it makes me want to go home and watch it! Everyone should watch what they wish for. They may just get it.

Don't be discouraged when you see the outdated costumes and puppets. When you start watching the movie you begin to believe it all and it no longer bothers you.Overall this is a wonderful movie. I fully recommend it. Borrow it, buy it, just make sure you watch it!The basic premise of the story is that a teenaged girl makes a wish that the Goblin King would take her baby brother away. When it comes true she immediately regrets it and sets off trying to get her brother back. There is an extraordinary cast of goblin characters that she encounters.This movie actually reminded me a great deal of Clare B Dunkle's The Hollow Kingdom.

		<shortDescription>A true original of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth was yet another of the films I grew up with as a child. And even now that I'm 22 years old, it's just as delightful now as it was then. One of the most imaginative, visually stunning fantasy adventures ever to grace the big screen. A true original in the vein of Alice in Wonderland, this surreal, enchanting story is a real marvel to behold.A film that blurs the line between reality and illusion, our heroine Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is far more interested in fantasy lands and far off places than dealing with solid reality and her impending womanhood.The one thing she hates most is babysitting her brother Toby. When she can't stand it any longer, she makes a wish to Jareth, the Goblin King, to take Toby away. What Sarah doesn't realise is the Goblins are listening in, and she finds her wish granted.Sarah's fantasy world has now become a frightening reality, especially when Jareth (David Bowie) appears right before her eyes. When she pleads for Toby's return, Jareth sets her a task. If she wants Toby so badly, she'll have to get him back herself, from Jareth's castle at the centre of a deadly labyrinth.With only 13 hours, Sarah must brave the insidious tricks, impossible conundrums and bizarre creatures to solve the labyrinth. These are all delivered from Jim Henson's production company, where he really allows his imagination to conjure a visual treat.There is so much to see in this film. Wonderful sights, minute details, impressive settings, especially the Goblin City. You'd need to watch this film several times to take in the sheer amount of visual detail and magnificent splendour that went into the making of Labyrinth.I can only imagine how long it must have taken Jim Henson and Co to create such a surreal and inventive world. And that includes the puppetry and animatronic effects. Hordes of Goblins, the cowardly Hoggle, the misunderstood Ludo, and the over-brave Sir Didymus. Each one with their own unique personality. Not since Gremlins have I seen such amazing puppetry put to such engaging effect. The painstaking amount of effort that went into this film is incredible. Of course today it would all be done with CGI, which shows how lazy film-makers have gotten over the years. Although the breathtaking MirrorMask is an exception to that rule, and shows how CGI can be used in the fantasy genre when done correctly. Sarah and Jareth are the human element. Sarah does a lot of growing up when dealing with the Labyrinth's many enigmas, such as enchanted door knockers, helping hands, and the infamous Bog of Eternal Stench. Although Jennifer Connelly is occasionally a bit on the bland side, she holds her own, and interacts with the puppets believably.As for David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, although he has questionable taste in wigs, I liked his performance. He could have hammed it up like Jeremy Irons in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but instead he makes for an impressive villain. I love the way he manipulates those crystals, and some of his songs are really catchy. He looks right at home here. With his fright wig and mismatched eyes, he doesn't look much different from the puppets he's surrounded by!Some scenes are a bit pointless like Sarah at a masquerade ball and in a junk yard. Although they're great to look at, I'm not sure what they add. They might have something to do with Sarah's growing up from the fantasy world she prefers to hide in, but the film could have done just as well without them.But Labyrinth has a real rip-roaring finale in the Goblin City, filled with visual invention of the highest order. Sarah's defeat of Jareth has got a nice adult edge to it, and the film is capped by a delightful scene at the end where she has a party with all the friends she's made.An undeserved failure when it came out, Labyrinth will always be one of my all time favourites.So whenever you're feeling down, lose yourself in Labyrinth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story is original, fantastic, and beautiful. If there was any way in the world they could recreate it with the technology of today, it should be, but there isn't because the actors would be different. Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie were too great to replace. The music is wonderful, the storyline is unmatched. Something to this quality hasn't been made. Fantasy films aren't around anymore, not like this. If you disregard the lack of technology and budget, and only take in the storyline and music, there should be nothing to judge negatively.Though this movie didn't seem to do very well in the theaters, it has become a cult classic for many, even if they weren't born in the '80s (I was born in 1990). I watched this film as a child and I've never stopped loving it. In fact, now that I understand it better, I love it more than ever.</fullReview>

Although Jennifer Connely doesn't land in her GREATEST acting role, but good songs- and just a nice story for a lot of children in general.

		<fullReview>I've read a lot of reviews on this movie and i noticed that most of them where written by 20 yr old people and up. But i'm only 14. The thing about this movie is that, yeah, there may be some flaws, but when you're only 3 or 4 when you first watch this movie you don't notice that. I think that's what made it so special for me. I've been watching it before I even laid eyes on sesame street and it's still my favorite movie because it holds a lot of memories with it. It's like it's engraved in my head - I've memorized every line. I still get a jumpy feeling in my stomach at the part when i was watching it as my dad gave me ice cream. Just little things like that. And after not watching for a few years and then suddenly seeing it again brought back a lot. I found myself remembering all of the words to every song David Bowie sang in it. Also, after just watching the Hulk, I thought that the actress looked so familiar and I had to look it up. Sure enough it was Jennifer Connely, the first time I saw her in another movie besides the Labrinth. I still don't think that the part she played in the Hulk fit her at all. A movie I would expect to see her in would be more like the Lemoney Snicket Series of Unfortunate Events, not a Spiderman type of comic remake. I was disappointed. But what i'm getting at here is that I have understood the deeper meaning of the Labrinth before I could have ever figured out what kind of bird Big Bird really is. I love the Labrinth and I don't know why older people just point out flaws like they know it all. Yes, i'm only 14, but my will is as strong as yours and my kingdom as great. I know and understand what i'm talking about, so why don't people listen? Just try me on politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is so much more than an adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely adore this movie! It is so much more than a childhood adventure about a girl rescuing her baby brother. And thats not just because there's David Bowie in it, with his fantastic blonde mullet and skin-tight spandex getup. Its about Sarah's growing up as well, and is also a love story, in case you didn't notice. In her quest for her baby brother Sarah abandons all of her childhood fantasies and selfish needs in order to save Toby, and her adventure in the LAbrynth is kind of like her last fling with the old imaginary world she built around herself. At the end of the story she realizes that she needs to live in the real world and start to care more about the real people in her life. Also, there's the strange relationship she has with the Goblin King, Jared. She is too immature to realize that his feelings for her are deeper than his outward malevolence. When she challenges him and comes after Toby I think that he finds himself falling in love with her, but this love is never really addressed openly. In the movie the action comes before the actual plot line. I think the Goblin King was just pretty desperate, I mean, did you see any real ppl in his kingdom? Its not like he was going to date one of the puppets that Jim Henson made. She was more attractive to him when she proved herself to be a worthy adversary, and defied him. I really think they should have gotten together when she got a little older... oh well. I love the part where she eats the peach and she ends up in the ballroom with him. The set was a little cheesy but I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. It was so cute how he looked upset when she stopped dancing with him. I also absolutely loved when she ends up in the room with all the stairs and he's decked out in black leather and knee-high boots. The song he sings for her is so meaningful but she doesn't get it at all, i mean how stupid do you have to be to get that he likes you? She bothered me a lot a few times in this movie. Its so great when he keeps disappearing and reappearing behind her and below her. I think David really captured his character in that scene. I like the haunting quality of the melody and the words... I've turned the world around for you... and the end of it where she still didn't get it and he sounds so sad and desperate when he says : Life without you sunlight...live without your heartbeat...I...can't...live...without...you..." I just wanna cry. So honestly you should watch this. It's like a cult classic. watch it before you can't find it again. nowadays i can only rent it from this store that specializes in this kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth was made in 1986, yet the passage of time hasn't dimmed the spectacular demesne that unfolds before the viewer's eyes. The real world is quickly left behind as we follow Sarah - a petulant teenager with a lively imagination - on a quest to save her baby brother from the clutches of the Goblin King. With the help and hindrance of sundry fantastical dwarves, goblins, beasts, and the ilk (brought to life through the puppetry genius of Jim Henson) she has 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth.Given the talent of Henson, the human actors were always going to face stiff competition. Jennifer Connelly plays the lovely but perpetually startled-looking heroine (although perhaps she is surprised at the clunky and unlikely dialogue she occasionally spouts). However the casting agents were spot on in their choice of the deliciously androgynous and mocking David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King. But the real stars of the show are the denizens of the labyrinth. These range from the simple yet visually effective 'helping hands', to huge hirsute beasts, to a goblin army, and some funky fire-dancers. Similarly impressive is the interior of the Goblin King's castle, which is a replica of the famous optical illusion involving staircases that appear to float in mid-air and connect to each other at impossible angles.Although there is some bad dubbing and a seemingly endless number of what must be the fakest polystyrene rocks ever to have graced the silver screen, this only minimally dilutes the viewing pleasure. Labyrinth will reward the spectator (even those who would not class a fantasy film as their normal fare) by transporting them to a captivating world where things are not always as they seem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sixteen years on, Labyrinth is still a fascinating movie suitable for the whole family to view on one of those Sunday afternoons (although very young kids may find it a bit scary).David Bowie as the Goblin King does a great job and has good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly. I was never a fan of David Bowie's music but I have to give him credit for his songs and performance in this movie.As for the story itself, it is pure fantasy as Connelly finds herself in a labyrinth facing all kinds of ugly creatures in the hope of rescuing her baby brother who is in danger of being turned into one of the goblins. It is pure fun as she makes her way through the labyrinth.The creatures themselves were very good as would be expected with them being created by Jim Henson.A great film, great creatures, great music-what more could one ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DANGER DANGER: horrible movie ahead!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I was recommended this film by an older lady where I work, and I must say that this film was so bad that I felt the need to come here and warn people about it. This movie is terribly acted, terribly written, terribly directed, and TERRIBLY too long. I preface the rest of my comments by saying that I'm a HUGE fantasy fan and enjoy it very much when it is done right.Note for director Jim Henson: if you are going to make a movie with little - oh, who are we kidding - NO plot, do NOT let it drag out for almost two hours. I cannot even begin to describe the pain that watching this film induced. Since there is nothing to speak of in the way of plot, there obviously cannot be anything in the way of pacing. The protagonist, Sarah, wanders aimlessly from one life-threatening situation to another. Also, the cinematography (sp?) and set design is typical of a Hollywood fantasy film. They go out of their way to make everything really weird, and spend ponderous amounts of time on close-ups of characters faces.One highlight - we are given an alternative view of hell . . . a giant marsh that smells like farts and burps. Sadly enough, this revelation was one of the most entertaining aspects of the film.I will give the film one good comment - the creature effects were superb. Too bad such talent was wasted on such fluff. I watched the behind-the-scenes featurette at the end of the movie, and it seemed to me that everyone involved in the project was so concerned with getting all the details right, making everything "just perfect" that they forgot to include believable characters, good dialogue, and something to invest our emotions in. In the end, the film is an overly-preachy, "want-to=be-a-cool-fantasy-film" disaster. Please, take my advice, don't watch this if you are wanting to be entertained or stimulated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy nostalgia for the Puf 'n Stuf generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family pictures are a curious breed, particularly when they aspire to greatness as George Lucas' fantasy "Labyrinth" seems to. There is a recipe to making such films, and the recipe is interesting as much for what it includes as for what it leaves out. Being a fantasy family picture, "Labyrinth" requires: enough magic to bedazzle the small children, a feisty young hero or heroine, scary monsters, a boo-hiss villain, narrow escapes, and a happy, warm, ending to bring a tear to the eye and prompt a family hug. It must not have: blood, realistic violence or excessive terror.The included elements are there up to a point, and the film is colourful and glossy. Unfortunately, it is also terribly bland. David Bowie's Goblin King (a surprisingly flat performance) is utterly camp and devoid of menace. A bit of sexual tension between Jennifer Connelly's Sarah and Bowie would have helped, any tension at all actually. Sarah's supposed race against time to rescue baby Toby should pile on the suspense. It doesn't. The goblins and beasties should be at least a little scary. They are not. Sorry, Jim Henson's creations are irretrievably cuddly and cute in this film. The deus ex machina Sarah utilises to eventually enter the Goblin King's castle is also a let-down.Without some sort of edge, "Labyrinth" falls short of greatness. It remains a curiosity, particularly for those wanting to see Connelly's early career. It is a cinematic pantomime, a feature length H.R. Puf'n Stuf. It's safe. It's nice. It makes you wonder what it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow... I mean wow... I really cannot for the life of me see why anyone, let alone so many reviewers on this site would enjoy this movie.This is the first movie I have ever not been able to make myself finish. It was extraordinarily and PAINFULLY dull and boring to get to the hour mark alone, and not long after that, I just couldn't handle it anymore.As for the PACE, the movie moves along at a crawl,The ACTING was absolutely awful, save, perhaps, for Bowie's mildly disturbing performance.The story was just plain stupid and uninteresting. Contrary to many reviews I had read prior to watching for myself, the film is not intelligent in the least: themes and "life-lessons", if you could even call them that, are spoon-fed to the audience by unimaginative writing, most of which is borrowed or copied wholesale from other stories, myths, and films, and by the elementary-school-play-quality acting of the characters.I get the whole coming of age rationale for the labyrinth and the symbolism therein, but it is presented in an incredibly dull package. Movies with similar goals typically manage to hold the audience's attention with stunning visuals, clever humor, and skillful directing to really hook the viewer. NONE of these can be found in Labyrinth. The visuals are drab and uninspiring, the attempts at humor fall flat and the movie ends up just plain NOT funny, and the directing is just too slow-paced with little reward for the patience required to watch.On a side note, this was supposedly released as a children's movie, and yet, phallic imagery abounds, and a twisted sexuality pervades the film. Bowie's character, his attempted seduction of an adolescent girl, and just the way the story plays out is uncomfortably reminiscent of the formula used by pimps in sex trafficking... the subtle nature of these themes and images makes them easy to write off as harmless, or to miss entirely. I honestly wonder how many who watched this film as a child and look back on it nostalgically as "magical" were subconsciously affected by this warped sexuality.In Summary, this movie was a huge disappointment, an ENORMOUS waste of time, and "Magical" only in the Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch sense.This movie really has nothing positive to offer. If you didn't see this movie as a child, there is really no reason to see it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely enjoyed growing up watching Labyrinth, this movie was one of my childhood movies, made into a fantasy movie with great effects and great characters and the background set. David Bowie plays the Goblin King who kidnaps baby Toby from his Step Sister. Sarah has a maximum of 13 hours to solve the labyrinth before Toby becomes a goblin forever. On Sarah's travels, she meets an old git (Sorry it's who call it when i watch the movie) called Hoggle, who helps her on her labyrinth to get to her baby brother. Sarah meets allsorts of characters, a fairy who bites her when sarah picks her up, a worm, a beast, those laughing creatures who take their heads off (What ever kind of creatures they are) Sarah gets to her baby brother and has to remember the line she read from her book (You have no power of me) as the 13th hours strikes, the mission is over, Toby is back in his cot and sarah is back home and is happy to have everthing back to normal before the father and step mother come home after a night out. The movie ends when sarah has all the characters with her after needing hoggle with her when she begun her journey. I give this movie 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I wasn't ten years old the first time I saw this film, so it isn't part of my treasured childhood memories. Maybe that's why I found it such a disappointment.Labyrinth is little more than a David Bowie rock concert, accompanied by the Muppets. I'd say the completely irrelevant Bowie rock songs dragged down the plot, if it weren't already so weak in the first place. Goblin King kidnaps girl's infant stepbrother; she goes into a magical world after the baby, and...you don't need spoilers to know how it's all going to turn out.Yes, I know -- the Quest is really an allegory for the girl's emotional transition out of childhood. I get it, honest I do. It's still clichéd, heavy-handed and predictable. This theme has been done before, and far better.Cross Fraggle Rock with mid-80s MTV, and you've got Labyrinth. After such a promising beginning with the far superior Dark Crystal, it's too bad the Henson organization had to stumble so badly on its second venture into classical fantasy.Fortunately, Jim Henson left behind far greater work than Labyrinth for us to remember him by.</fullReview>

But just last week I found it in a pile of old VHS tapes at the swap meet. I brought it home watched it with my younger brother and walk away disappointed. I sat there wishing it would just end. The thing that killed it for me was the music. Maybe I'm just not very fond of 80's music or just didn't pay close enough attention to them but every song was terrible and made no sense. On the other hand they had some Incredible looking creatures. And Its not to long. I would recommend this to people with younger kids. Since I remember thinking it was the greatest thing ever when I was a kid. And my Brother who is 13 really liked it and even wants me to get him the soundtrack. But as far as I go I wish I would have left the memory of this film as it was.</fullReview>

Most of the movie is just David Bowie behaving very strangely, looking at a baby and a girl walking around a labyrinth without any idea what she has to do. There is really nothing interesting to see in this movie. The story writers came up with no new elements. Most viewers will know all of the ideas presented in this movie from some other movie they have watched before. Woke up the next day and directly went to the toilet.

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies. David Bowie plays the Goblin King with Jennifer Connelly as his leading lady Sarah a young girl trying to get her brother back. She finds friends in the most unlikely characters and they all share a bond of defeating the King. In a place where nothing is as it seems she struggles through to the castle to defeat the Goblin King, get back her brother, and ultimately find herself. Jim Hansen creator of the Muppets, Fraggle Rock, and the Dark Crystal, has outdone himself with this one. Definitely a must see movie for the whole family. A classic soul searching main character, who meets with obstacles and must devise ways to overcome them with the help of their friends. To find out where her heart really lies, and to discover that she really does like how her life is. That family is important even when they make you do things that you really don't want to. That they love you for who you are even if they have a hard time showing it. Sometimes you have to find what really matters</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Muppet Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born in 1986 and to this day I remember this being the very first movie I saw as a child. It trumped every Disney/animated movie of the 80's and I dare say it the 90's. Now as a 24(soon to be 25) yr old woman, I can admit that I have watched this movie every night in bed for the last week. It never gets old, the humour is wonderful, the puppets are unquestionably expertly designed and made, and lets face it David Bowie if pants got any tighter I would be in heaven! I recommend this movie for anyone of any gender, age, genre allegiance, it speaks to your inner child while not insulting your adult sensibilities. The songs are a tad cheesy (really just one in particular, you'll know it when you hear it) and the masquerade ball makes you yearn for a era when those events and costumes really took place. More than anything this movie makes me wish and believe in the impossible. It's movie magic perfection in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having blasted Henson's Dark Crystal it's only fair that I review his far more cheerful Labyrinth, even more considering that I loved it. I don't know what's about human nature but I just can't put together the innocent charm &amp; beauty of this one and the terrifying darkness and hopelessness of the other. Maybe the most uplifting thing is that Labyrinth was made 4 years after DC, so I guess his inner demons had been successfully exorcised by that time. The plot here is about 16-year old Sarah, unhappy in her family life, with having to babysit her half-brother, wishing for the king of the goblins to take him away and having her wish fulfilled. A repenting Sarah then wants the kid back, but now the king says that for that to happen she'll have to reach to his castle at the center of a labyrinth, in a given number of hours. If she fails to do so, she'll never see the baby again.The flick starts with a scene I'm sure Shyalaman's fans will recognize, as it's a carbon copy of that providing for the end twist to The Village: the heroine jumping out of the wilderness to a modern road, complete even with the van coming down the asphalt. I won't say it's a rip off but it certainly looks like it, Night. What strikes me most during these first scenes is how comfortable Connelly looks in front of a camera, as if she had grown up there. She doesn't even seem aware she's the one singlehandedly carrying the flick on her shoulders--as from the beginning Bowie makes for a most nonthreatening villain--so if any lingering tension we'll find along, that will have to come from another source and that may only be the difficulties and setbacks Sarah finds in her quest. We may even say her real adversary is the Labyrinth itself, not Bowie's king of the goblins.Labyrinth is a pleasure to watch if only for the amazing skills shown by everyone involved, from the writers to the puppet designers to the people animating them and, most of all, to the director. The movie is an authentic artwork, with scenes, settings, so avant garde they are a treat to watch--as the Helping Hands or the Dancing Red Devils bits. Others are just funny, yet so naturally done that you can only marvel and laugh as that of Sir Didymus blocking the way on the bridge or that of him heartedly confronting a whole enemy battalion, demanding its surrender. But what's most engaging in this movie is its pervading innocence. Even in the most angry or desperate moments for our Sarah--as when she tries to escape from The Cleaners--there's no evil or cruelty in the mood, atmosphere; it all happens as if this was just an inoffensive physical game.Henson had the unique gift of introducing us to a world where a single piece of fabric cut &amp; sewed in a certain way, filled with the fingers of a skilled hand, could give birth to a wholly unforgettable character, one many times with a more distinctive personality than any played by real actors and with charisma to burn. The first coming to mind are, of course, Kermit the Frog &amp; Miss Piggy. Labyrinth follows this distinguishable tradition with puppets so adorable and well defined at the same time as Ludo, Sir Didymus or Hoggle; not to mention the punky little worm who provides my title. And I can't think of a better choice for Sarah than Connelly, mainly because of her naturally radiating innocence--at least during her pre-RFAD years--but also because she treats the puppets as real persons; not for a moment I got the feeling of her thinking: "Aw, these are just puppets and I'm just pretending to treat them as humans". Also her Sarah is respectful of everyone else and demands from them the same ethics she has been raised to abide by. It's only when she sees she isn't treated fairly that she resorts to treachery or lying.Beautiful cinematography, slick plot development, smooth pacing, perfect direction. The songs are not great shakes but the choreographs indeed are. A wonderful fable without the manufactured cuteness of a Disney flick. A rite of passage? A fantasy born of the need of a lonely girl to escape her everyday reality? Whatever the case, a movie your inner child will enjoy watching. As for those unfortunate who don't have one, whose dried up and died long ago, just read Hated It to know how unhappy they can be. 8.0/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would expect Jim Henson to turn out something good, and "Labyrinth" doesn't disappoint. I would venture to call it a fantasy in the more accurate sense of the term. It's not one of these disgustingly cutesy movies that tries to pass itself as fantasy while essentially serving as a 90-minute commercial. There's a lot of mind-bending logic at work in the movie, as teenager Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) has to rescue her baby brother from the king of the goblins (David Bowie) after she accidentally wished for the goblins to take the boy away.Despite a few less than realistic lines that they give Connelly, some scenes in the movie are really impressive. There is of course the continually-changing maze that she has to navigate, but there's also an instance of Knights and Knaves, and even a room based on M.C. Escher's lithograph "Relativity". And of course, there's a number of Muppet-like characters, although they're a little more grotesque here.All in all, it's a very impressive piece of work. A-maze-ing, one might say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Magical Masterpiece by the Legendardy and Talented Jim Henson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that this new and enchanted film by Jim Henson is scripted, acted, landscape and portrayed really well. I'm going 2 go through everything right now.First off, the casting of this film is terrific, we have David Bowie who adds a lot of humor and dark humor to the film, Jennifer Connelly as the sweet and saving Sarah and then Brian Henson voicing and controlling the tempered troll Hoggle. All of the other cast and back up actors also acted very well.The music is outstanding and very stunning and it jumps out at you. Definitely a change of music, not like the Dark Crystal's soundtrack which was full of disturbance, darkness and suspense. I feel the music in this was more adventurous and funny.The landscaping, back drops and background designing was formatted well and like Dark Crystal, it was very real life like and creatures and characters adding to that were very affective.Overall Labyrinth is a fun and very fantasy alternative ride which all will enjoy. Those who have seen Dark Crystal before this should give Labyrinth a try because Labyrinth seems to bring something very, very different to the table.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's from Jim Henson and it was released 4 years after masterpiece The Dark Crystal. Even with a very different story comparisons between the two movies are inevitably going to be made. The story in Dark Crystal is more elaborate, you get more background information about the characters and the races etc. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy Labyrinth, on the contrary but this movie would never be able to beat the Dark Crystal in my opinion. Labyrinth is more light hearted where Dark Crystal had a more serious and dark tone. I particularly liked the part of Didymus being small he thought he could take on a huge army. he did remind me of Reeperjeep from Narnia. Than there was Udo the big hairy monster who was actually fuzzy and adorable. And not to forget Hoggle the grumpy but helpful dwarf who did care more about Sara than he wanted to admit (reminded me of Grumpy in his relationship with Snow White). Labyrinth does have human actors and not only dolls and puppets like in Dark Crystal however the human actors stay limited to Sara, the goblin king and little Toby. Sara played by Jennifer Connolly played this part well. She was first a childlike teenager on the verge of becoming a young woman still being attached to her dolls (materialistic) and fleeing into her favorite fairy tales. After her journey she learned an important lesson. I think that was shown well. Another human part that was executed amazingly was that of the goblin King played by David Bowie. Bowie is a singer and not an actor and it shows when he is singing a song, you can see the performer in him and how he tries to put the attention on him. Although not cruel he is threatening and evil and yes Bowie did this well for a non-actor. His walking on the ceiling part amazed me as a kid, I still love that today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has freaking David Bowie in it man!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is done by Jim Henson's team, not sure if it was the same people that did "The Dark Crystal" or not. All I do know is that this film was better than that film as the inclusion of actual human characters helps rather than being all puppets. The film has a girl babysitting her infant brother. The girl is a young Jennifer Connelly, however, she looks a bit old for the role. I am sure she is young in this one though as she still looks young in more recent movies. Well she soon wishes the goblin king would come and take her brother as he is a pain and soon enough the goblin king does come in the form of David Bowie! She is soon tasked with trying to navigate a labyrinth in a set amount of time or her brother will be turned into a goblin. The film is fun and it has a few musical elements to it as well. Generally I hate musicals, but the songs work here. David Bowie is perfectly cast in this one as when he sings among his goblins he looks right at home amid the puppets and he brings a very high energy to the role, suffice to say he is a rather good actor. He was also very good in this vampire film and he also did a short horror film where he did not speak but had such a presence. The maze is rather cool, though I kind of wish the movie were longer and more scenes were done within said maze. Still, has fun characters for Jennifer's character to meet, a rather good plot, a super giant cool looking door guard and a nice finale as the goblin king and Jennifer walk through a very strange set of staircases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta love Labyrinth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Within your eyes, I'll place the sky" David Bowie meets Jim Hensen. Incredible. This movie is so weird and so magical, no one should go without seeing it. However, if you made it into your adult life without ever entering the labyrinth, it may just be too late for you. Labyrinth is just too strange watch unless you saw it before you were ten.Bowie plays the Goblin King, although he does appear distinctly human, particularly when surrounded by muppet-like goblins and they all sing and dance together. The puppets are exactly what make this movie fantastic, but too estranging for the adult sensibilities. Some chase little girls, some can take off their own heads and juggle them, some function as door- knockers and some are British worms that say "'Allo," and not hello.If you know what I'm talking about, you know how awesome this is. If you don't, then you have probably lost any respect you had for me as a movie reviewer. That's fine - I know I'm appealing to nostalgia here.After watching this as an adult, I can see why this appealed so much to me as a 6 year old, and later as a teen. Sarah is a strong female hero, determined and unwavering. Jareth, the goblin king, can give Sarah anything she wants, and can sense her every desire (as creepy as that sounds). He takes her baby brother away to fulfill a dark desire among older siblings - to be an only child again, the centre of attention. She immediately recognizes the fault in her desire, and asks for Toby back, but Jareth has hidden him in the centre of his labyrinth in the hopes that along the way he can tempt her into leaving her real life behind.Sarah is a girl who lives in a fantasy world, and her appeal to Jareth is a reflection of this, but in the end, her duty to her family and her life is stronger than the pull of the magical world. She fights long and hard, struggling through a maze of tricks and traps to get Toby back, and in the end she faces Jareth and everything he can offer her. She rejects the fantasy of being his queen."Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then we need to be taken away to a place where anything is possible. A place that encourages us to use our imagination. For centuries books have been that place and it's a tradition that lives on. The next phase of course was in performance, first in the streets and on the stages and eventually on the screen. Now the worlds and characters of these stories could be realized and nobody does it better than The Jim Henson Company. The Muppets became a worldwide sensation, but that was only the beginning because in the 1980s the company branched out and created some of the best Fantasy films of our time, starting with 'The Dark Crystal,' which then led to this collaboration between a few great talents.Pros: Great performances from the cast, including a scene-stealing one by David Bowie. Beautifully scored and a fabulous soundtrack by Bowie. Full of whimsy. Special effects and puppetry that were amazing then and have stood the test of time. Good steady pace. Beautiful cinematography. Incredible production and costume designs. Some really exciting set pieces. Has some really sweet moments that aren't sugary.Cons: A couple hairstyles and one green screen sequence date the film a little. This story has pretty much been told before.Final thoughts: Some films we loved as children don't hold us so well when we see them as adults. But then some never stop putting a smile on our faces. For me and many of my generation this is one of those films. This was a big production with a lot of effects, but unlike some other films of the time they have aged beautifully and the film as a whole has retained the magic. Just goes to show what masters the people behind this film are.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, complex but slightly muddled movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting, multi-layered complex film about coming of age for a teenage girl. However, the film is uncertain what audience it is aiming at, and as a result the tone is muddled with darker aspects meshing uncomfortably with cheerful scenes clearly aimed at much younger children. The lack of clarity is the films main failing, coupled with some inconsistent acting by a young Jennifer Connelly, inconsistent special effects and poor sets mean that the film is definitely inferior to Henson's previous effort, the excellent Dark Crystal.The plot is interesting, multi-layered and complex, but is slightly undermined by some interludes that seem totally out of place and tonally very different. This mainly is around some of the musical numbers, some of which work very well, and some that did not. When the main plot is focused upon the film performs. The story looks at the needs and desires of a frustrated teenager, played by experienced young teenage actress Jennifer Connelly. She had a number of films already under her belt when she was cast in this film. The structure of the film leaves what is real and imagined open to interpretation by the audience. However, this clever ambiguity is undermined somewhat because the film doesn't quite know what it is as an overall experience: is it a dark fantasy, comedy, or fairy tale? Connelly's performance at the start of the film is uncertain, too broad and played with a lack of subtlety. However as the film goes on, she her performance improves and during a surreal venetian ball she has a highly effective non verbal confrontation with the Goblin King (a solid performance by David Bowie), and hints that the character is moving into a sexual awakening at this point, but then decides she is not ready for this, and makes a decision not to pursue this. It is at this point she is beginning to show the potential as a very talented actress that eventually led to a highly successful career leading to an Oscar for best supporting actress for the film a Beautiful Mind.Technically the film is well put together, with some clever visual effects, especially towards the film's climax. Some of the animatronics are highly effective, particularly in the film's major battle sequence. The creations of Hoggle and Ludo are real standouts and those characters are interesting and draw the viewers interest. However some of the other work looks like puppets and undermines the suspension of disbelief. Production design by Eliot Scott is solid, albeit some sets work very well, and some sets unfortunately look like sets. The visual effects range from impressive to satisfactory, the work being split between George Lucas's ILM and Optical Film Effects. David Bowie's tunes work reasonably well with the film, but again the style of some of them seem out of kilter with the story. Nevertheless the film feels reasonably satisfying at the conclusion.Overall an OK film, if slightly unclear at what it's trying to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Jim Henson film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K. I know it's a film with puppets and Bowie dresses like and eighties reject, but come on. This film is absolutely fantastic!! Bowie, playing the Goblin King, it the bad guy that you know you should hate... but you don't. Maybe it's because of his love for Sarah, or perhaps it's because his music is the best music in the world (really, buy the sound track, its incredible) but there is something that makes you fall head over heels for this film. After all, at one point haven't we all wished the goblins would come and take out annoying siblings away? Be careful what you wish for, or a tights wearing glittery David Bowie and clan of puppet goblins just might. This is one of my favourite films of all time and yes, it is better than the "Dark Crystal". Watch it- i dare you not to love it!!!!</fullReview>

Either way, it's still my favorite movie of all time.This movie is heat-warming, it's got morals, and it can be enjoyed by people of all ages: which is more then what I can say for most of the other movies I watched when I was seven.

		<fullReview>Another of my childhood favorites. Even today being much older and seeing it I still love it. I really can't explain why. I see the corniness of it and still can't help but love it. I even own it and watch it a lot of the time. I guess I'll call it a guilty pleasure. I guess for some reason I just love the story, the characters, and the world that was created. At times I wish there was a sequel but in a way I know that it's better that it didn't have one.Considering the time this movie came out the directors and others who worked on the film really did do some amazing things. Remember this was back in the day when we didn't have all these re-makes and not everything seemed to be based off a book. In fact the way I heard it the book came after this movie came out. I have noticed that this movie does have a pretty big cult following though, so I can't feel too bad about loving it as I do. Although strangely I'm probably one of the only ones to love this movie and not love David Bowie. True I think he makes a great villain and still has dignity after dressing the way he did. But I never and still don't have googly eyes for him. Or that's how I put it. I never seen him in a romantic light. I'm the person who voted for Sarah to beat him and leave. Never did I wish she could stay with him or wish I could stay with him. I will admit though that I like the songs in this movie, always have. Probably the only Bowie songs I like besides Changes. I think it's a really great family movie and has things for all ages.Last note. For all of the love I have for this movie I will always remember that there was something that scared me in this movie. It's really stupid and I laugh at it now. But as a child the ball scene always scared me. There I said it. Really it was the masks that scared me. It never kept me from enjoying the movie though. It will always be one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mid-eighties snapshot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time yesterday, which probably makes me unusual in that I am the right age to have seen it as a child. In fact it came out when I was eight years old. I have the advantage, therefore, of watching the film with more mature eyes, without the fear that I will be disappointed.First of all I should say that I don't dislike eighties music, and I think that David Bowie is a talented and capable performer. I am not, however, a great fan of eighties puppetry despite having consumed a large dose of The Muppet Show as a child.Labyrinth is first and foremost a fantasy aimed at children and teenagers, and secondly a coming-of-age story. It succeeds in creating a unique fantasy world, helped by the music, creating an unusual setting and ambiance. I really don't think this film could retain any of its charm without the bold eighties electronic sounds, the sort of sound effects which are more closely associated with science fiction rather than fantasy. David Bowie's androgynous style and exaggerated colours add to the general wackiness. The Goblin King spends his time singing silly songs and experimenting with skin tight trousers. It does become clear that Bowie's character is the classic power-hungry ruler driven by a need to control others.The puppets work well. The directors avoided excessive Muppet Show type "jumping on the spot" which has always irritated me in Henson's puppet animators. A lot of effort has clearly gone into the special effects, with the "heads-off" dance deserving a particular mention. Today the effects of this particular scene look horrible with so many holes in the presentation it is nearly laughable - but it still works within the film framework and the love and care put into it is clear. Other than that, there are some particularly good effects, for example the door knockers and the final staircase scene at the castle.Jennifer Connoly as the ultra-cute Sarah does her job well, and I think that if asked she could have presented herself as a more mature and able protagonist. It seems to me she was directed to act as an innocent teenager and I think she manages this for the length of the film.The main weakness is story - or lack thereof. The film is not short for what is essentially a trek across difficult terrain. That said the longest story I know about the same thing is the Lord of the Rings. Labyrinth, like the Lord of the Rings, manages to fill most of its time with interesting non-events, which seem important to give reason for the final evolution of Sarah's character; much as Tolkien's trilogy built up to Frodo's final decision to leave his home and friends behind. But the story remains that of a long trek, with adversity, until the final confrontation with the bad guy. Tolkien's story is, of course, richer in print, but no such thing exists for Labyrinth as far as I am aware.The second weakness of the film is its submission to Hollywood standards of one-liners and absurd battle scenes. These have been staples of the American motion picture industry for at least 30 years and they are more childish than a talking worm. It was excruciating having to put up with this towards the end of the film.I struggled with a score for Labyrinth. If I were an adult seeing it in 1986 I probably would have hated it for reasons already put forward by other reviewers. I am being generous giving it 8 out of 10. This score is for a combination of an above average and entertaining film, which is unique and unrepeated, a representative of a time long past, and deserving of a special place in motion picture history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was without a doubt the best movie that Jim Henson ever did. The characters were so memorable and the plot was a little off the beaten path. However, the one thing that everyone remembers was the music. The songs that David Bowie sings are unforgettable. The only thing that made me mad was that they did not release a "Labyrinth" soundtrack and none of the songs have ever been released on any David Bowie CDs. This is one of the 10 greatest musicals ever made. Everyone should see this. Another reason that everyone remembers this movie is that it was one of the first movies that Jennifer Connelly made. The backgrounds were also very interesting. I mean you had the Labyrinth as well as the castle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cream of the Henson/Muppet Co.'s Crop!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I stated before, I love the two Henson/Muppet films, The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth. Labyrinth is by far the better film. Its plot is a variation of the quest movie genre. The fact that its hero is a young girl, and the quest involves the kidnapping of her baby brother is definitely a new twist. Again Jim Henson's creativity is the main "star." The visuals and art direction are so stunning and creative as are the characters. The story is refreshingly new, the music score and songs by Trevor Jones and David Bowie are wonderful. The acting by a young Jennifer Connelly and surprisingly David Bowie as the Goblin King are excellent. My favorite "Dance, Magic, Dance" works so well with the characters and the choreography. Connelly plays Sarah, a kind of self-centered teen initially, who wishes her baby brother, whom she has been told to babysit, would just disappear. Unfortunately, the Goblin King, hears her and grants her wish. When she tells him she didn't really mean it, he tells her that she has until midnight to rescue him from his castle, which is surrounded by a huge, twisting Labyrinth. Many lessons are learned along the quest. What a journey director Henson and co-writers Dennis Lee, Elaine May, and Monty Pythonite Terry Jones take us on. This is their Masterpiece to date!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Three Best Films of My Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) must babysit her little brother (technically, half-brother) when she would much rather recite fantasy lines in the park. After wishing that he would be abducted by goblins, he is -- in fact -- abducted by goblins! Now she must rescue her brother before her parents get home.Growing up in the 1980s, this was one of my three favorite childhood films, alongside "Princess Bride" and "Adventures in Babysitting". It is just a great family film, one that kids will love and adults will, too. That's a hard thing to capture, something I do not see much anymore, outside of Pixar films.Jennifer Connelly shines, not surprisingly, and David Bowie is the perfect casting choice for a villain -- he can sing, and he has that exotic look about him. (I hear other considerations were Sting and Michael Jackson, but that wouldn't have been the same.) The songs are incredible, and the directing and puppets of Jim Henson are timeless.I recently had the privilege of showing this movie to a few people who had not seen it before, and one who who had (and enjoyed singing along). While it is a childhood memory of mine, there is no reason it cannot become a new memory of yours or a childhood memory for your kids. Just a great film.Of all the great things that came from this film (Connelly, and Toby Froud's production company, to name a couple), one that might be overlooked is Kevin Clash. If you know the name, you know him as Elmo, arguably the most popular Muppet of all time. But before he was Elmo, he worked with Jim Henson on this film... coming into the business in your 20s alongside Henson and Frank Oz must have been the greatest treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect puppetry, everything else is so-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the grounds of puppetry, Labyrith is unparallelled. In fact it should be screened at at theatre production courses in colleges worldwide, because it shows pure creative brilliance in theatrical puppetry. Costume actors, Glove puppets, Black light puppets, cable puppets and animatronics. Labyrinth has them all. I was so impressed that i really didn't care that the story was sappy.It starts off by introducing us to Sarah, a self-obsessive adolescent who lives in her own fairy tale world. She is frustrated with her parents, especially for leaving her the task of staying home to watch over her baby brother Toby, while they go out for the night (at the the beginning of the movie). In her frustration the summons the fabled goblin King to come and take him away. The next thing she knows, He comes and takes Tobe away, back to his castle. Sarah begs the King to give him back, so he gives her thirteen hours to complete his labyrinth which leads to the castle and somewhere inside is Toby. on her Journey she encounters a myriad of weird critters and puzzles, and soon she teams up with three individuals. Hoggle, a midget with more wrinkles than Yoda, Ludo, a red haired Yak who walks on two legs and can move rocks with his voice. And then there is sir ... a puppy dressed in Renaissance clothing, with his 'somewhat' noble steed. Time is ticking and they must hurry.Labyrinth lives on quirks and funny faces. There are enough of both for the film to be enjoyable, even if it truly is sappy. Jim Henson was one creative fella, May he rest in peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Fantasy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is a teenager fond of fantasy and make-believe. But she's also a hot-head and a bit selfish, so one day she wishes her baby brother Toby be taken away by Goblins. The Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie) appears in her room and grants her wish. But Sarah immediately regrets it and is given a chance to recover the baby if she complete the Goblin King's labyrinth in 13 hours.Labyrinth is a movie that walks the thin line between an all-out children's movie and a fantasy spoof that adults who like to watch clichés subverted can enjoy.From a technical point of view, this movie is excellent. Jim Henson created all the creatures and they're visually complex and wonderful. The sets are also marvellous, including the labyrinth, especially when see from above, and a sequence in a room with stairs that go up and down, and to the sides, like in the famous Escher painting.The story is solid and because of its simplicity there are few plot holes. The characters that Sarah meets along the way are also lovely: there's Ludo, a giant monster who's a bit simpled minded but adorable; Sir Didymus, a chivalric fix who mounts a dog and is afraid of nothing, even when the odds are ridiculously against him; and Hoggle, a cowardly goblin who slowly discovers friendship.This movie is certainly full of simple but timeless messages about courage, honesty, selflessness and friendship and so it's a perfect movie for children.There are some grating moments, like when David Bowie starts singing; they're so embarrassing and unnecessary you feel like skipping them. I think good movies like Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence and The Prestige have shown that Bowie is not just a singer but an excellent actor too. He needn't sing in all his roles. It's just an annoying way of getting a viewer out of the story.Anyone who enjoys a good fantasy movie that doesn't take itself too seriously should enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a classic because it's a crowd pleaser. It's a romance, adventure, drama, coming-of-age, musical fairy tale with a British accent. It has something to entertain, delight, or horrify everyone.The ballroom scene is so perfect in capturing what a child thought being a grown-up would be like and how different it is. And can you not smile at Sir Didymus " The air is sweet and fragrant..." and whether its the sometimes cheesy songs or Bowies package ( the original wardrobe malfunction) that make you cringe there's got to be at least a dozen other redeeming qualities to make it all seem just peachy. Jim Henson was the master of his art his puppets (some of my best childhood friends) steal the show (Bohemuth,Ludo,the helping hands and the fireies were brain bending effects for the time)Brian Froud's artistic concepts of the goblins and their weapons were fantastic and whimsical! and David Bowie made the best fitting soundtrack to a movie I've ever heard. "Within You" still gives me goosebumps and if you can resist foot tapping to "Chilly Down" then I do believe that "your mother is a fragging aardvark!"The plot is simple as all good fairy tales should be young Sarah is on a quest to rescue her baby brother from the Goblin King who has kidnapped him and taken him to his castle beyond the goblin city (in the middle of a labyrinth) The magic of the movie is not in the plot but in the characters Sarah meets along the way. Each character is so well thought out and memorable even if their time in the movie is short you remember still the worm, the little critters under the tiles, the lichen(those had me inspecting the lichen in our yard a bit more closely)It's definitely a must see for all children and those poor sods who didn't get to see it as kids. When I was growing up it was my favorite movie I knew the words by heart within 2 weeks, my parents dreaded a trip to the video store because they knew it would mean renting it yet again and for some reason their daughter born and raised in Seattle sounded as if she had lived in Liverpool all her life after watching it. The scene with the crystal ball juggling caused some injuries and dents in the walls (dont try to duplicate with billiard balls) and many failed attempts to send my younger brother the the goblin king, guess Jareth didn't take a shine to me :( The movie has inspired me and reminded me that "Things aren't always fair" and for all those who say magic and fantasy are just for children and should be put away when it is time to grow up "Damn I can never remember that line."</fullReview>

Jennifer Connelly was still OK as the girl. David Bowie did steal the show, but it was fun to see her in a movie before she became a star.You probably would like the movie Labyrinth. Some of the creatures in the movie are a little silly, and it gets a little annoying.

		<shortDescription>Tacky, but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Labyrinth' is somewhat of a very enchanting film, but leaves you wanting a little bit more;the potentiality that Labyrinth could have had disappears somewhere throughout the film. The ideas of a rock star, a crazy existence full of puppets, 80s music, and a lost girl in a fantasy world all mixed together, seemed quite appealing to me (in a twisted way). But this film almost failed me, because of its lack of a plot. The tragedies of Labyrinth are the terrible script and cheesy acting.Of course, this is a KIDS' movie; those pictures are bound to be a little stupid for my tastes, but the film could have been so much better; more mysterious. To me, Labyrinth is pretty average. The one thing that saves it for me though, is the incredible David Bowie. Though his acting in this is so-so, his appearance and songs make up for the juvenile elements of Labyrinth.David Bowie has a pretty odd place in the film though; he's a singing Goblin King with a major mullet, way too-tight pants, egotism, and somewhat of a crush on Sarah. Yet, without these essentials, Labyrinth would be completely lost in a maze of itself, so to speak.The plot is weak because the connections between the characters are not realistic; there is too much emphasis on the technical details of the puppets and tacky sets, rather than the growth of characters. Of course there are some changes in the characters, but their lines with each other are pretty stupid, with too many clichés.Jennifer Connelly's acting has an anxious (overacting) and sometimes, too happy energy, which really annoyed me. Though, she was only 15 and perhaps pretty average in her acting, the whole personality still infuriated me. Sarah just didn't cut it for me, simple as that. The puppetry and effects are pretty good, especially for that 80s era. And since this is a Henson production, I'll give it credit for that reason too.Overall, Labyrinth is an `ok' film, but it makes me sad at how much potential this film had, yet it just couldn't completely pull through. Another thing, which I cannot stand about Labyrinth, is the conclusion; it was utterly pathetic in my eyes. Fans of David Bowie (such as myself) or fans of The Muppets will like this film and respect the creators, for their vision and good efforts. You should see Labyrinth nevertheless. You should expect to be humored and feel upbeat; just don't keep your hopes up for an epic fantasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I first saw Labyrinth in 2001. It wasn't until the second time I saw the movie I became obsessed with it. I have printed off Labyrinth sheet music from the wonderful site Jareth's music hall, I have lyrics to all the songs that have them, the list could go on and on. This movie really made an impact on my life. The fact that I am obsessed with muppets helped out.Besides, some great voices are featured in the film, such as Kevin Clash, Brian Henson, Danny John-Jules, and others. Jim Henson's muppets definately helped the film out. It had dramatic scenes, but the goblins provided lots of comic relief. Hoggle was a great character. Thanx to David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly for agreeing to do this movie. W/o you, this movie would have been impossible. David did a marvelous job as the goblin king, Jennifer as Sarah. Thank you, all of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children's film you can stand to watch with your kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare and wonderful films that straddles the line between children's movies and adult fare. While most parents will agree that it is more than suitable for most age groups, you won't go into sugar shock while trying to watch with your kids, like some cartoon features out there, and is impressively entertaining for us grownups as well. Most of that is accomplished by telling the story on two levels, a simple chase for the baby brother on one hand, a complex look into the babysitters mind on the other (pay close attention to house in the very beginning, all the characters are there to give some context). I won't bother rehashing the story, you'll have to see it for yourself, but I will say that Henson was one of the only people out there that created entertainment for children with the assumption that they actually have a brain!! This and the Dark Crystal (DEFINITELY a must see) remain my top 2 picks for best children's movies, and are pretty high up for adult films too. Henson has done for film and TV what authors Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are, Little Bear) and Silverstein (poet, Falling Up, Where the Sidewalk Ends) did for literature, gave our children more than condescending eye candy, he gave them art.</fullReview>

It's about a Fraustraded Teen ( Jennifer Connely) who sends her Baby Brother away to the Goblin King ( David Bowie)and must rescue him by going in a gigantic Maze infested with Monsters.

Forget the plot though and enjoy a film for all the family.Kid's will love it as well as adults who will be in tears at some of the profanity like hoggle having a wee.This film sums up the 80's because its so bad its brilliant all I can say in the words of that little rat thing is 'come along Abmrosius'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a true CLASSIC!!! Forget showing the kids "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter", get Labyrinth!!! A classic tale of good versus evil brought to the screen by the magic of Jim Henson. The movie has everything from action to comedy. The puppetry is among some of the best seen ever as the story of one girl's quest to save her baby-brother from the clutches of the evil Goblin-King unfolds. David Bowie is excellent in the role of Jareth, The Goblin King and plays the role brilliantly. The young Jennifer Connelly also puts in a marvellous performance as the naive young girl who takes everything for granted in a world where nothing is what it seems. Jennifer actually did her own stunts for the film too and puts in a daring performance. Quite simply, this is a movie which has to be seen by everybody and thats the bottom line, coz Dave Woollin said so...</fullReview>

Of course, whereas "The Dark Crystal" was very dark and serious, this movie is very bright and funny and is full of songs by David Bowie, who is also the star villian in the movie (and one of the only three humans that are visible for most of the film). This is a more family-oriented movie than "The Dark Crystal" was and is almost as innovative. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

I wonder if this was appropriate for a kids movie, and I truly feel sorry for all the costumed midgets on the set at eye level with Mr. Bowie's poor fashion choice.</fullReview>

When I rented it a few years back for another look, I was rather dismayed at how poorly it had aged. I found the puppets to be silly and cheap-looking, and Bowie made me cringe. Still...it has its moments and I will certainly have my kids watch it when they're a little older. Good for kids, though adults may wince as much as they grin. One of those better moments...check out the expression on Bowie/Jareth's face when the girl tells him: "you have no power over me." And love the bow to Escher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must have been 1988 when I saw this film first on television - I completely missed it at the cinema. A friend of mine had recorded it. We must have watched it 5 or six times in that week! It's amazing, if you go somewhere and just quote a single line or even just a single worm-style "'ello!", everyone knows exactly what you're talking about. This film really has reached cult status for those born around 1980, plus or minus a few years with a lot of other followers outside that period. David Bowie, the "King of the Cod-Piece" steals the show with his first appearance at the bedroom window. I'm really surprised this film was given a universal rating over here in the UK as some parts could be really quite scary for small children, but hey, it never did us any harm :-) The soundtrack I've just bought from Amazon 'cos I can't find it anywhere else. I'm going to be the envy of all my friends! I hope this film lives on until I'm old and grey. If they re-released it in theatres, it would make an absolute killing and loads more people would fall instantly in love with it. Rock on "Serrr-wah!"</fullReview>

However, as the years went by I had forgotten where the wonderful dream of the Goblin King, Luto, Hogle, Sir Didymous, Ambrosus, Sara, and the detachable head guys came from. It was on one of my trips to the video store- where I now work, that I found my dream. My mom said I saw the movie about a million times as a kid, but I bet I have seen it a million more by now. The greatest fairytale every done, besides Peter Pan. Sizzling Hot David Bowie and all the amazing creatures from Jim Henson- whom I share a birthday with! I love the soundtrack, it gives me that dreamy childlike feeling of "falling in love". There are no words to explain the beauty of those songs, you have to hear them to understand. If anyone knows where to find the book- although I've been told it is out of print, and the movie, let me know. Must go to the Labyrinth Ball. And it is a surprise how many people know and love this movie, I too thought I was the only one. Jareth all the way!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. If you want me to talk production values, costuming, visual effects or anything like that (of which I don't judge a movie on) then this is great in all of those departments.The basic plot of this movie. An annoying teenager named Sarah who for some strange reason likes to recite monologues about goblins. She gets handed the job of babysitting her baby brother (very reluctantly) and accidentally wishes him to a goblin world. The Goblin King (Of which I'll say here and now that David Bowie does bring a certain charm to the role) decides that Sarah must have thirteen hours to travel through his labyrinth to get her baby brother back. Of which he is in the center at the Castle at the edge of the goblin city.This movie was entertaining to watch. I did feel that some of the things didn't really have a point (like the singing - it was good but I can't overlook that it doesn't have anything to do with the plot). There wasn't anything really engaging to the storyline. It might be worth a watch but I personally think it's decent enough but nothing I'd watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always admired Jim Henson more than I like him. I know I enjoy the Muppets, but I can't place it in any point in time in my life where I watched them. They have a nostalgic spirit, but nothing too personal, which is a great shame because I would have really loved them. In fact, I think the only specific Henson related thing that I can place in a time in my childhood is Muppets Treasure Island. I wish I saw Labyrinth when I was a child as I can tell its most powerful aspect is nostalgia. Granted, I would've found it way too scary. It's an oddly hit and miss film throughout. Sometimes it's movie magic and sometimes it's a complete flop that I'm really not a fan of. The action sequences, besides the ones that go on for too long, are fantastic with a great affection that I love, but the music sequences are the purest of cheese. Sometimes too slow and sometimes too quick, sometimes timeless and sometimes dated, there's a strange imbalance about the film but fortunately, due to Terry Jones' screenplay, there's a great dry Monty Python (albiet 'for kids' version) sense of humour throughout. And of course there's Bowie at his campiest which is a feat in itself. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so this isn't the greatest movie in the world, but for the time it was made the effects are awesome and it definitely gets points for being so great to watch 4 or 5 years after the first time! Jennifer Conelly and David Bowie are magnificent; Jim Henson definitely had a real grasp of the twisted and funny.The movie begins with Sarah (Conelly), a teenage drama queen who is obsessed with fairy tales and costumes. She is fed up with having to baby-sit her baby brother Toby and so, in a fit of rage, wishes out loud for goblins to come and steal away her charge. Of course, the King of the Goblins, Jareth (Bowie) hears her, and actually takes Toby. Sarah begs him to give her brother back and Jareth demands that she first solve his strange and ever-shifting labyrinth to get to his castle before he can give Toby up.Along the way, Sarah meets some weird and wonderful characters, such as Hoggle the grouchy but soft-hearted dwarf, Ludo the gentle giant, and Didymus the ever noble... fox-dog thing (Hoggle is, in my opinion, the best). She discovers that things are not what they seem, not to take anything for granted, and the audience learns that Bowie looks great in tight pants ;). In all seriousness, this is a great, classic fantasy flick that one can enjoy every time one watches it.</fullReview>

Even ignoring the snicker-inducing "special effects" (which are always subject to particular times and contexts, but still hard to believe these were revolutionary twenty years ago), the picture feels more like a tenth-grade English class group project than an actual theatrical release. Seriously hilarious, though ... sometimes intentionally (yes, Henson was fairly brilliant), but mostly not. The music though ... no one actually thought this was acceptable when this movie came out, did they? I'm sure today's pop music will sound equally as ridiculous in twenty years, but dear lord this soundtrack is despicable (and Bowie did put together some very fine albums) ... and hilarious.

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is a fun story about a girl, Sarah, who lives her life vicariously through storybook tales and fantasies. She resents having to always do what her parents tell her, but she never realized that she needed to be careful about what she wishes for. After taking a terrible wish, she is forced to undo her own words through actions ? complicated ones, at that, that rely on tearing through a web of deceit, a labyrinth of lies.Sarah is forced to make the oddest of acquaintances into friends she can confide in to achieve her goal of getting to the Goblin King's castle. This movie is directed by the superb puppet maestro Jim Henson and produced in part by George Lucas?and is definitely worth seeing. If you enjoyed the Neverending Story, or loved any of Henson's Muppets, then this movie will undoubtedly strike your fancy. In a way, since it's a short movie with a lot of colors, it is good for young kids?but I hesitate saying that since the ideas are more complicated than what is just on the surface."The Labyrinth? It's a piece of cake!" RATING: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great Movie, a little cheesy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Labyrinth by Jim Henson is a delightful combination of children's fantasy and the 80's pop culture, but this is evident even before you see the movie, because the film boasts David Bowie as its leading man... or lady? Despite disturbing images of Bowie's lavish groin region, the film is surprisingly good. The only downfall may be the corny looking puppets. The goblin puppets in this movie look as revolting as Jim Henson's puke after a heavy night of drinking.Here's the plot summary: A young girl named Sarah (Jennifer Connoley) struggles to get along with her "wicked" step-mother, who actually seems to be really a nice person. Sarah finds her refuge in children's fantasy novels and dreams of becoming an actress, like her late mother. One night, while her father and step-mother are out on a date, Sarah is charged to look after her baby brother Toby, who has stolen one of her dolls and will not stop crying. In a fit of rage and over-dramatics, Sarah proclaims her wish for the Goblin king to take Toby away forever. Much to her surprise, this happens, and now she must reach the Goblins' Castle in the middle of a gigantic labyrinth to save her baby brother. The Labyrinth is very well done and couples the zany antics of Jim Henson to the musical genius of David Bowie, who creates a very good soundtrack for the film. The pace moves very well and is enjoyable for audiences both young and old. The tow small errors in this movie are these; 1. Jennifer Connoley's acting is a bit over done, but really not that bad. 2. The puppets are so cheesy and ugly that some scenes are hard to watch. All in all, The Labyrinth is a great movie and fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not quite as good as the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is worth watching, no doubt about it, but it's one of those movies where the whole is smaller than the sum of the parts. The puppets and sets are magnificent, Jennifer Connelly is great, and the dialogues are full of humour, but the story makes very little sense (especially the beginning and the end). You could change the order of many scenes and not even notice it.Bowie, who is a decent actor is most of his movies, is absolutely terrible in this one. I'm not sure if it was his fault or the director's, but he just feels wooden, as if he's reading his lines from a cue card - reminded me of Patsy from Absolutely Fabulous, when she's nervous and freezes ("Yeah, cheers, thanks a lot."). The songs are also pretty bad and feel out of place, except for the last one (in the Escher "Relativity" labyrinth). Fortunately, he's not on-screen for very long, and the puppets and Connelly are able to turn almost every scene into a small work of art.The DVD includes a mini documentary that shows how some of the scenes and creatures were made, but unfortunately leaves many other unexplained. In a movie as complex as Labyrinth, I think a longer and more thorough "making of" would be justified.</fullReview>

After re-watching it ten years later I found that it was still an amazing feat of puppet wizardry with a typically Terry Jonesish screenplay. And being the Henson/Monty Python fiend that I am, I had a very pleasant ninety eight minutes.However I found myself feeling terribly embarrassed for David Bowie (an excuse to wear weird costumes and make up gone horribly wrong). Referring to the trouser department, I was nearly shouting "For God's sake! Put it away! You'll scare the kiddies!" Not to mention the crazy hair and the Cuban heels which all in all made him look disturbingly like one of my ex French teachers called Madame Zaza.Personal issues aside, this film is very good and I would highly recommend it to...anyone whose interested in that sort of thing. It is also a good lesson to younger children about the evils of 80's fashion.Remember. If the hairdresser suggests a mullet: Just Say "NO"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome! A rather obsessed friend of mine told me about this movie, so out of sheer curiosity and boredom i actually rented it. I was not disappointed. The classic cheap 80's style sets were amazing, and I laughed at nearly every single joke, intentional and UNintentional. Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) was excellent, acting and everything, although if I was in her place I would have been way more frightened, especially considering the villain's (David Bowie) choice of clothes. I mean, from the first time he comes on screen, my mouth just dropped. My mom, who was watching the movie with me, actually choked, and the expression on her face just said something along the lines of: "DAVID BOWIE?!? In a kid's movie?!?!" She is right. Go rent this movie, you absolutely have to, if only to see your friends' reactions. Awesome movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty mediocre.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Jim Henson's rather overrated movies he made,possibly because it was a "Teen-idol" movie. No, I'm not badmouthing "Labyrinth",I just think it's not his greatest nor worst Fantasy movie.Personally, I do NOT like the main character,Sarah. Personally,I think Sarah is quite immature,almost as immature as Cloud Strife from "FF7".She thinks the world involves around her and she STILL plays with her "dollies",despite her "growing up". Luckily, she learns her lesson after the goblins and their king capture Toby and plan to transform him. David Bowie is a great singer and actor, but he cannot play villains though. After seeing how interesting and distorted the Skeksis were in "The Dark Crystal",I was deeply disappointed. He's more like Tim Curry when it comes to villains.The good parts are some of the monster and goblin designs. My favorite characters are the Fireys and that Junk Lady,and the glass orb scenes are cool. But improvements on the main "heroine" and antagonist would have been better.But Jim then moved on to do the be-witching "The Storyteller" and "Greek Mythology" before his demise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bowie is game, but the rest is ponderous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Bowie contributes some catchy tunes, and he's definitely game for his role as The Goblin King, a creepy figure with a glam rocker's hair and unexplained motivations. Apart from Bowie's scenes, however, the film lacks energy. There is hardly any atmospheric music, little dialogue other than the repetitive and expository kind, and the characters move painstakingly slowly on what appear to be flimsy sets. Labyrinth follows the template of "The Wizard of Oz" and contains some visual homages to that film, but the titular maze never attains the sense of place that Oz has. Jennifer Connolly's Muppet co-stars do not pop like Dorothy's companions or like Henson's more charismatic creations. "Labyrinth" has some of the ineffable appeal that cult movies acquire when they strive to be great and distinctive but instead turn out flawed and distinctive, but its script and production are just too hollow to mark it as a noble or notable failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At its core, Labyrinth is a story of a child entering adulthood. The story begins with Sarah Williams, played by Jennifer Connelly finds herself being forced to take care of her young brother, Toby, for the night while her parents have a date night. While in her care, Sarah grows irritated with her little brother and inadvertently conjures a goblin king, Jareth (played by David Bowie) into her realm where the goblin king takes Toby away and sets a challenge before young Sarah; navigate the labyrinth in 13 hours, or Toby will become a goblin for eternity. So sets the adventure that unfolds over the course of the film; Sarah's quest to save her brother from his horrible fate that she unintentionally created for him.Labyrinth is an interesting film. But, what else should be expected when you have a film conjured up by the combination of Jim Henson--best known for The Muppets--and George Lucas of Star Wars fame (or infamy depending on how one looks at it). The world itself is full of intensely interesting creatures and landscapes that show a flair for creativity and originality. This should be expected in this type of film. Logic is not meant to be followed and the rules can always be changing. That, in itself, is the advantage this film has; because the film is in an imaginary realm, it is not held to any set standard of logic. Instead, we are left with a world where one's imagination can run wild and be challenged.Character design and the world itself are fully developed from the mind of Jim Henson. Combining special and practical effects, we find only two real-world people interacting with creative an entire world of Muppet-style creatures, carrying the style that Jim Henson pioneered into this film in a much larger, grander scale. Elsewhere, the film boasts distinctive set pieces that are extremely different from one another, but still effectively tied together through a dark, demented core. The characters will traverse such varied locales as the Bog of Eternal Stench, a dark, twisted recreation of Sarah's bedroom, and a masquerade ball that is a demented, hallucinogenic trip are a very good idea of the set design seen in the film. Again, these set pieces really push the creative envelope as you can tell the creative team were unhindered when it came to being creative and thinking "outside of the box" during filming, again taking advantage of the lack of required logic in the film's design.Though the ending won't be spoiled during this review, it should be expected that the film wraps up with a happy ending for the family and children that the film is intended for. However, it's important to note that the film ends on a solid note that ties the overall theme together from that of its opening. As the film ends, we find Sarah sitting and reminiscing about her adventure, before finally realizing that, through the experience of rescuing Toby and returning to her realm, she has passed from being a child into a young adult.That it did poorly at the box-office (making only $12,729,917 back of its $25 million dollar budget) is not indicative of the film itself, nor should it be judged as such. Instead, the film should be enjoyed for what it is; a lighthearted romp through a creative, fun world that has a solid, entertaining story from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Labyrinth is not a bad movie, but it is nothing spectacular either. To me, it is a good movie, nothing more, nothing less.The visuals were good, the Labyrinth looked believable and the puppets looked very detailed and life like. The soundtrack was good too, thought they did break out into songs quite a bit.The only problem I had with this movie was the story and some of the characters. At least in the Dark Crystal, you could feel sympathy for what Jen and Kira had to go though. And the Skeksis were actually evil and meanacing, and not moronic. But I had a hard time feeling bad for Sarah. She is a snotty, crybaby little ***** and deserved what was coming to her. The goblins were not even scary or menacing at all. They came off as a bunch of circus clowns. And don't get me started with the Goblin King. Though I liked his character, IMO, he looked more bizarre than sexy.Labyrinth is a good movie, but not as splendid as a lot of people make it out to be.Well, at least IMO, Labyrinth is more entertaining than the Harry Potter series (Then again, I think washing dishes is a lot more entertaining than the Harry Potter series).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem LABYRINTH had was the timing in which it opened. People just weren't into fantasy as much back then. I guarantee if this film had been released this or last year, it would've been a big hit. Films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings did so well, that people would have been open to accept other fantasy films like LABYRINTH. LABYRINTH has loveable and very creative characters, good acting (Jennifer Connelly has now won an oscar for A Beautiful Mind BTW), very original looks to it, and is just plain filled with imagination and fun. Kudos to George Lucas and Jim Henson productions for this aspect of the film. LABYRINTH is worth every cent of the price, and I highly recommend it to you if you liked the other fantasy movies out this past year. 3.5/5 stars. JOHN ULMER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the high rating this movie has (7.3), I expected something much better. So many comments around here say how good this movie is, but to be sincere I didn't enjoy it.The story wasn't much involving, the characters not very likable, the puppets ugly and annoying, the soundtrack was okay but nothing exceptional and not adequate for a fantasy motion picture, the lines were weak (although I did like some lines, such as «You have no power over me» and «So you think my labyrinth is piece of cake?») and the humor wasn't funny at all.The movie has some enjoyable special effects and sometimes a few nice visuals, but that's not enough. The soundtrack is entirely performed by David Bowie. I don't really like David Bowie's music (never did). There is only one song of him that I really like: "Let's Dance" - but that great song isn't in this movie.About the characters, I didn't like very much Jareth the King of Goblins, but I did like him as a barn owl, however. I also liked the two sheepdogs, the worm and Toby. Sarah was okay, but not all that captivating. Plus, Sarah was obnoxious at the beginning, especially towards her infant brother.I hated all the Goblins, including Hoggle, Ludo and Sir Didymus. As for Sir Didymus, he was so irritating in the first minutes he enters in scene that I almost couldn't take it. I strongly disliked the battles either.The labyrinth was quite complex, but well made. The castle was nice and the strange special effects on the stairs at the end were well done, even if a little childish for me. I also liked some of the landscapes and the special effects on the clocks by the character Jareth.The movie was directed by Jim Henson, a great puppeteer well known for his imaginative work in "Sesame Street" and "The Muppet Show".The cast was okay in their roles, but nobody was really remarkable. Still, the best was probably David Bowie with is British accent, despite that ridiculous long hair, more eccentric and exaggerated than Limahl's.This movie seems to be a mix of "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Wizard of Oz". Some minor clues also seem to have been inspired on "The Neverending Story", but without the success of that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I've read every comment here, and no one can argue that this film has quite a following with folks who saw it as children. I wonder about that. I generally like most every type of film, and `the Muppet Movie' is one my all-time favorites. But I will mar this film's perfect record by posting a polite dissent.This film is Alice meets Sendak meets Dorothy meets Python, meets Glam -- and it has none of the charm and depth of any of the originals. The acting is poor in my estimation, the story a mischmasch. (Carroll joke intended) Some puppet characters were fun, but not the main ones.What really hurts is that with all the cleverness of Henson, it couldn't have been too hard to find someone who could plumb the depths of, say Alice to support his need for a vision. Froud is a lightweight, Terry Jones is the least talented Pythonista. It seems they got these secondraters together and just brainstormed.The failure of this film and `Dark Crystal,' was rather universal and threw Henson into a chronic depression that eventually killed him. I can see `Dark Crystal' being remade with new voices, a real score and a voiceover with a fuller story. Perhaps a frame, ala `Princess Bride.' But this film just has nothing leveragable in my mind. Sorry.</fullReview>

For the goblins, they didn't look like ones, they looked more like messed up garden gnomes. I certainly wouldn't like those in my garden! For the puppets, they needed to have that Sesame Street look because they creeped me out a bit especially the buck that rides the dog! He looked very raggedy and pretty much used up!Now the background, I found it not picturesque. Some say it looks beautiful but I say it looks like bad weather is coming it's way. The sky really looked as if it was gonna rain! Seriously they should've thought of this before they showed the movie of audiences in 1985. I certainly wouldn't show this film to any kids.

		<shortDescription>When Everything Is Arbitrary, the Story is Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while I'll read a critic's review of a movie that perfectly articulates something I was thinking but wasn't as adept at putting into words. I was reading Roger Ebert's original review of "Labyrinth," Jim Henson's cult classic fantasy film that starred a very young Jennifer Connelly and a very bewigged David Bowie. He didn't like it much, and his reasons for not liking it were exactly mine. The film takes place in an Alice in Wonderland world where anything can happen, anything does, and everything is arbitrary. The problem when trying to craft a compelling narrative set in such a world is that when everything is arbitrary, then nothing much matters. As a viewer, you pretty much stop caring what's going on, because there's no fluidity of story, no central arc to keep you engaged. "Labyrinth" plays out as one episodic set piece after another. You're never quite sure how each one is going to resolve itself, but you know it is going to resolve itself and usually in some random way that feels more like lazy than clever storytelling. Jennifer Connelly is quite terrible, actually, not displaying any of the acting ability she would later, while David Bowie is kind of fun as a goblin king who looks like Tina Turner from Thunderdome and is given a couple of musical numbers to perform so as not to waste his musical talents.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Labyrinth: Fine Children's Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The final film from legendary puppeteer and director Jim Henson, Labyrinth contains some key examples of the maestro's considerable ability.Unable to take his incessant crying anymore, teenage babysitter Sarah wishes for her baby brother to be carried far away by goblins, as in a book she has read. When Goblin King Jareth informs her that her wish has been granted, she is given thirteen hours to find her way through his extensive labyrinth in order to rescue her brother. Meeting many strange, weird, and wonderful characters along the way, she struggles to reach the centre of the maze.Opening with an exterior scene in which our heroine attempts to comprehensively quote a scene from a book, Labyrinth swiftly introduces us to her love of the fantastical. Soon after, she is home and being chastised for her lateness, putting her in a foul mood. This is not conducive to her appreciation of her baby brother, who cries relentlessly when she takes a teddy bear from him which he has somehow managed to get from her room. This early scene introduces us to one of the film's most enduring and detractive faults: the fact that the protagonist is largely unlikeable. Her impatience with the baby serves to show her as an inconsiderate, selfish, and immature young brat. Little is done to endear us to her, even throughout the rest of the film. She seems to learn little from her experience; a slight moment of humanity in the final scene not nearly enough to make up for the less amiable aspects of her personality. The problem of Sarah aside, the film's plot itself is sufficiently engaging. The fantasy world of the Labyrinth is amusing, entertaining, and very well realised. Henson's characters are each in their own ways funny, intriguing, and likable. One complaint, however, is regarding Jareth. It's always bothered me to have the Goblin King as a six foot tall human, especially in the way that this is never referred to or apparently noticed by anyone. This is, however, rather a minor concern. Bowie leads the musical numbers well, bringing much to the entertainment factor of this fine children's film.Though its central character lacks the moral development and evolution which might lend gravitas to the film's effect, Labyrinth is a perfectly entertaining film. Certainly more for the enjoyment of children, it doesn't quite do a huge amount for adults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as magical as many think it is; too much nostalgia, maybe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hear everybody saying that the film looks very good in terms of the sets and animatronic characters and that David Bowie is incredible as the Goblin King. Those are really the only compliments I hear about it usually, and I don't think that would make Labyrinth an excellent film. Why do I not care for this film like so many others who love fantasy or were children from the 1980s? Well, I have a few reasons. I agree with anyone who would say that the story is flawed. For instance, I don't understand why the Goblin King loves Sarah (Connelly doesn't do a bad job in the film, either) and honestly, musical numbers like the dance with all of those Goblins slowed the story for me. I don't really like it when musical numbers slow down the story and the movie. It was a major problem I had watching just the first forty minutes of Chicago (2002). The sequences in that movie were too visual and too long. But back to Labyrinth. I also find the film to be too noisy, and when I film gets too noisy, I get really bored, Attack of the Clones being a major example. I did not find many of the jokes funny either, especially the ones about the Bog of Eternal Stench. I would not be shocked if I realized many filmmakers making children's films today got "inspiration" from that bit of the film for all of the fart jokes used in them today. Also, it is very clear that Jim Henson (nothing against him by the way) intended this film for much younger audiences than the ones that would have seen The Dark Crystal, where they saw a very sophisticated and unsettling, yet a very great fantasy film that adolescents like myself would not have any problem viewing out of fear that it would be too immature for them. Being a more sophisticated person when it comes to critiquing films than most teens of my age, I have no problem saying that Labyrinth is not memorable, timeless, or lovable as its fans would say. And if those fans say I'm a heartless pessimistic idiot, then I would not care. That's what I say about the film, and that is that. Although I do like a couple of the animatronic characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth's appropriation of fairy-tale storytelling seems unsettling when the films true meaning is established. It's a celluloid Trojan horse that purports to tell the tale of young girl who looses her baby brother to an evil 'Goblin king' who imprisons said child at the centre of a enchanted labyrinth, giving her a mere 13 hours to find him or loose him. Thats the plot but not alas, the story. This is movie about the insidious, sexually deviant desire of an older man to covet a teenage girl and the lengths to which he's prepared to go to confuse her to achieve his aims, utilising no less than drugs, potions and hypnosis. When Sarah looses her baby brother she has in effect, lost the innocence he symbolises. We can infer that Jareth (David Bowie) has already corrupted her at this stage - the sexual attraction between them is obvious, though he is skillful in the way he intimidates her and subordinates her to achieve his goals. When he first reveals himself to the would-be princess, he is clad in revealing tights and engages in ball play before unleashing a 'snake' on the inawed 15 year old. Henson's film could stop there but goes further as Sarah looses herself within Bowie's intricate web of confusion, bumping into a series of unpleasant leering males on the way, the dirty old man, the bestially-biased fox and the hairy muscle bound simpleton - all too happy to tag along but undoubtedly following Jareth's lead, the fairytale version of an internet commune. There's more - the songs with talk of 'love injections' and putting that babies spell on me not to mention "magic dancing". The date rape sequence in which Bowie attempts to close the deal with a toxic peach and the climatic attempt at psychological manipulation in which Sarah's riposte that 'you have no power over me' represents the ultimate rejection of his attempt at sexual domination. In the lead Jennifer Connelly is wanton and virginal, the perfect foil for Bowie's inappropriate overtures. It is suggested that the absence of her real mother has made her more vulnerable to would-be predators, and the movie's resolution in which Sarah is surrounded by fantasy characters as the owl (Bowie) leers at her outside before beating off into the night, tells us that the gap between innocence and desire is sometimes just a pane of glass...or a complex series of hedge rows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Labyrinth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Muppets creator and Kermit the Frog actor Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and written by Terry Jones, I remember seeing maybe once or twice when I was much younger, but I knew if I was going to get a better opinion I would have to see it again in my older age. Basically fifteen year old Sarah (A Beautiful Mind's Jennifer Connelly) is rehearsing lines for a play she is appearing in, called Labyrinth, and she continues doing this when she gets home, and she is put in charge of looking after her baby half-brother Toby (Toby Froud). She notices her treasured teddy bear Lancelot has been taken, obviously Toby has the toy, and he is crying so much that she is becoming increasingly angry, to the point when she is following the storyline in Labyrinth, whereby the girl wishes the Goblin King will take him away. She hears that he has stopped crying, and she is shocked to see he has disappeared, she has inadvertently summoned the real King of Goblins, Jareth (David Bowie, also writing the music and songs), and he is giving her a seemingly impossible task to get her brother back. Sarah must travel through the long labyrinth maze of the fantasy world he inhabits, and she has only thirteen hours, otherwise Toby will stay with him, as a goblin, forever. The walls and pathways of the maze change frequently, and the puzzles and tests along the way are just as hard to work out, and the only assistance she has seems to be from grouchy goblin dwarf Hoggle (voiced by Brian Henson), gentle beast Ludo (Ron Mueck), and fox-like knight Sir Didymus (puppeteered by Dave Goelz, voiced by David Shaughnessy). While she is travelling through the maze, Jareth is having fun antagonising her, playing with the child, and trying to trick her into forgetting about her brother all together to give her whatever she wants from her dreams. Eventually, even after two hours are taken away, she makes it to the end of the Labyrinth, and even though Jareth offers to be her slave, give her everything and make all her dreams come true, she remembers the key line at the end of the story, saying the words "You have no power over me!" In the end Jareth is forced to turn into an owl and fly away, baby Toby is returned home, and Sarah wishes that her new friends Hoggle, Ludo and Sir Didymus, as well as many other friendly creatures, would stay with her. Also starring Shelley Thompson as Stepmother, Christopher Malcolm as Father, Natalie Finland as Fairy, puppeteer Frank Oz and the voice of Michael Hordern as The Wiseman, puppeteers Steve Whitmore and Kevin Clash and the voice of Percy Edwards as Ambrosius, Kenny Baker as Goblin Corps and Warwick Davis as Goblin Corps. Bowie gives a reasonably nasty and certainly musical performance as the villain, although you will be giggling at how camp he is and his Tina Turner style hair, and young Connelly does alright as the girl going on the long journey, obviously the puppet character made by the Muppet creators are all cute, cuddly, ugly and disgusting, it is very cheesy and might not be to grown up tastes, but children will be enthralled by this fun fantasy adventure. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All seems rather stupid now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was obviously magical for me when I was a kid, but watching it again as an adult, the storyline seems remarkably absurd. I also wondered if perhaps this was all supposed to be a dream based on Jennifer Connelly's imagination? She obviously knows the story of the Goblin King very well, so perhaps she falls asleep and dreams the whole adventure? That would be the only non-preposterous explanation.Another thing to note about this film are the puppets and costumes. In many ways, these look a lot more realistic than anything modern CGI can offer. They never suffer from the problem of looking not there in the scene that plagues CG characters, and their texture, being actual existing things with real light reflecting on them, always looks realistic. The amount of facial animation on someone like Hoggle, for example, is actually just right for a humanoid character. CG characters tend to "over animate" their facial expressions. The puppet (which isn't really the right word for a person in an elaborate costume, but you know what I mean) work in this is really extraordinary, all credit to Jim Henson and his team on this.Jennifer Connelly is a picture of beauty in this film. It's really a shame people have to age. Not that she looks horrible now, but it's just not the same as the innocent, youthful and round face she has in this film. David Bowie, well, his acting is pretty bad and so is his music. A relic of the 80s best forgotten I think.A magical film at its time, but the story just seems silly now. Still a lot better than that tripe called the Harry Potter movies.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an unfortunate failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd sorta love to rave about this movie, being a big fan of fantasy and faerie-tales as well as having grown up on the films and TV shows of producer Lucas, director Jim Henson and writer Terry Jones (who most people know from "Monty Python" and who directed or co-directed all 3 of their films). But the first thing that stops me from doing so is the fact that I saw this as a child of perhaps 11 or 12, when the film should have been very effective, and I detested it at that time. I still remember that night because my folks didn't go out all that often, but they got this movie for us and hired a babysitter who happened to be a brunette! Anyway, seeing it now I realize there's a lot of good reasons why so many people love this movie. However, there are still enough problems with the movie from my own personal perspective that I think I can understand why this is more of a cult film than a hit film.First of all, it's far too much of a "chick flick." The style in general is very gentle, even in the scary and violent parts. Compare the goblins to the villains in Henson's "Dark Crystal" or the stormtroopers in "Star Wars." These goblins are too cute and goofy to present even the semblance of danger that the film needs them to. Then you have the whole faux romance between Jennifer Connelly's character and the Goblin King (David Bowie). The masquerade scene is pretty good cinema, but any boy from the age of 5 to 105 is going to want to tear his hair out.Speaking of Bowie, I still remember when I first saw the movie how much I hated his music and how badly it damaged the film for me as fantasy. I know they were probably going for something like "The Wizard of Oz," but David Bowie is no Harold Arlen, and the overproduced technology of the song instantly dates it and removes the essential timeless element of the fantasy. If you think I'm simply engaging in wishful nostalgic sophistry, consider the fact that the producers of "Wizard" were wise enough to remove a silly song called "The Jitterbug" from the film despite having spent over $100,000 filming the scene for 3 weeks because they felt it was a bad idea to associate their fantasy movie with a 1940s dance fad that would damage its staying power. Their wisdom ensured that the film would continue to enchant audiences forever, while the short-sighted decisions of Lucas and Henson created a film that seemed dated the instant it was released, irreparably tainted by second-rate 1980s club music.Aside from the musical aspects Bowie is OK, though I never feel that he's either sexy or scary. But my girlfriend thinks he's sexy, so what do I know? Jennifer Connelly on the other hand saves the film in my opinion. It's an amazing performance given her age and the fact that she's playing opposite puppets. It's great how in the early scenes she seems uncomfortable and out of her element but seems to come into her own while in the fantasy world. She did it so flawlessly that I think some viewers (judging from the comments here) mistook it for tentative acting. I thought she really knew already how to use her eyes, always maintaining asymmetry for the sake of dynamics. Hiring Connelly was the smartest thing the producers did, and of course now that she's very well-respected it looks even smarter. She was very good a few years later in a film that Dario Argento did, but I didn't realize just how young she was when she was showing so much skill.The puppets ? the big huge one was fantastic, love him ? a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Snuffaluffagus. The little dog was also marvelous. Along with the talking doorknobs he reminds me the most of characters in other Terry Jones movies and sketches. The fiery dudes who take their heads off were fun too. But the main puppet was a disaster ? the face was far too humanoid and I didn't care for his voice either. Honestly I know this sounds harsh but it would have been a better film if they had just hired Billy Barty. The film relies on this character very heavily and the animatronic head on a little person just didn't work for me although the effort itself and the ambition is admirable. I noticed that Henson family members worked on this puppet and I think more scrutiny should have been applied in the concept phase.Sadly, the failure of this film along with "Dark Crystal" and "Fraggle Rock" permanently scarred Jim Henson's mystique and hastened the end of the golden age of muppets. Henson himself even more sadly never go the chance to redeem his reputation as he probably could have done. I always loved the muppets and I really wanted to love this movie too ? both when it came out and now ? but the awful 80s Bowie music and various other elements just don't mesh together for me. This movie is interesting to watch because of Jones' writing and Connelly's acting, but the execution is off. You get the feeling that some really good concepts are just not being done in the way that would make them work, there's a disconnect between the script and the direction and I suspect that Jones' script might have been too raunchy and earthy for Henson's tastes. I kept wishing that the film had turned out better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first decided to watch the Labyrinth, I expected it to be this light fantasy-musical. It disappointed at all levels.For one, it is supposed to be a musical yet it only contains around three horrible songs that add no meaning or artistic touch to the course of events.As well, the course of events is pathetic and shallow. However, amidst a sea of nonsense, you find yourself lost at some points; you go like "what on Earth is happening right now?!" Not to mention the bad graphics, even for a 1980s movie. The creatures actually look like puppets and the setting material actually look like cardboard and Styrofoam.The only thing that refrained me from giving this an even lower rating is Jennifer Connelly. Her acting was decent and she looked stunning.All in all, this movie is definitely not worth your time, except if you feel like laughing at how terrible a movie can actually be. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacklustre fairytale that could have been better considering the people involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that I was never a big fan of kid's movies even when I was kid and as an adult, I'm especially not a big fan of them of them now. This of course begs the question of why did I watch this movie? Anyway, what we basically have here is a children's fantasy about a mythical goblin world, directed by Muppets creator Jim Henson and starring controversial rocker David Bowie as the 'Goblin King' as well as a young Jennifer Connelly (who was probably given the role because of her excellent turn in the Dario Argento masterpiece 'Phenomena' a year earlier) as the young heroine named Sarah. The plot begins when the young Sarah gets sick of her baby brother's crying so does what any aggravated sister would do - and wishes him off to the Goblin Kingdom. The Goblin King gets hold of her brother and keeps him in his castle, which happens to be right at the centre of said Goblin Kingdom. Naturally she decides to try and get her brother back and the rest of the film follows her in typical fairytale fashion as she makes her way through the various pitfalls.This film apparently didn't do very well upon its release and I'm not really surprised. Not least because the two leads were not well known (David Bowie not well known for acting) but also because the movie just doesn't work. Labyrinth has a lot to play with from the plot but it all feels very dingy and like the producers didn't want to stump up the money to have the film made properly. Fantasy worlds really should be colourful in kid's films, and if they're not then the plot should be dark enough to justify the tone, but what we end up with is a typically 'happy' kid's movie with plenty of singing and dancing etc in an environment that doesn't suit it. David Bowie tries to create a big of menace with his character but ends up looking silly more often, and while the heroine does face some tribulations in her efforts to get her brother back; I never really felt like she was in any danger and that it wasn't all going to turn out OK in the end. To her credit, Jennifer Connelly is the best thing about the movie and puts in a suitable performance in the lead role. Most of the characters are puppets and they all look a bit crap and I'm sure that the puppeteers could have managed something a bit more impressive. Overall, this is a rather lacklustre fantasy with not much to recommend it for; but it is better than the crappy 'Legend' at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good for its audience: small children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a fairytale, starting from a rather unrealistic premise that a big sister wants her baby brother be taken away while she is reversing for a play and, voil?!, the kid is taken away. She then goes through a magic world reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland to find the child before , oh no, it turns into a goblin.The Goblin King is David Bowie, who can't help borrow class to everything he does. He sings a little, dances a little, he is mischievous and funny at the same time. Without him, this movie would have been really boring, even for a child.There isn't much else to be said about this. It is a movie produced to be consumed, with music hip in the year the film was made, puppet animation reminding of the Muppets and all characters acting like they are on drugs. But hey, it's a fairytale! It even has a few fairies in the beginning. If you are a parent and you want to teach your children about compassion and love of their siblings, let them watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh. Lame movie. Muppets are insuferable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just start by saying that I'm a Bowie fan but did not grow up with this movie, and have no nostalgia bias.I like Bowie, but the rest of this movie was nigh-insufferable. Were Muppets some kind of fad/fetish back in the 80s? Cause I haven't seen an 80s kids film that didn't have them.David Bowie kind of struts his thing as a glam rocker for his scenes (of which there are too few. He's easily the most interesting character in the damn movie) He's in an awful wig and wails out some interesting non-sequiter songs, but it never really feels like there's a match of wits going on with witless Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), who just really wasn't much of an actress back then. Right after the first few scenes where she overacts and shouts I went "Oh s***. What have I done?" There are some interesting concepts (The stairway thing at the end. Some bits of magic.) but it's lost next to the screaming awful muppets. Does anyone find them cute or funny? It's the same damn problem I had with "Gremlins". The cartoon violence is lame. Most of the movie was lame and I just had to fast forward through the flamingos.For everyone that didn't find the majority of Muppets Christmas Carol (minus Patrick Stewart) insufferable. And for die hard David Bowie fans. Everyone else, stay away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the main reason why I decided to watch that particular movie were its high IMDb ratings, and now I'm really disappointed. The plot is predictable, the protagonist doesn't develop in any way, and doesn't suffer even a token internal conflict, her sidekicks are rather bland, and the movie even lacks the humor normally found in this kind of works. Acting and special effects are adequate, the music is annoying at some moments, but generally passable, and a couple of times the things are really cute. However, that doesn't save the movie. If you want a decent Family/Fantasy/Adventure-style stuff, just check what DreamWorks or even Disney are making lately. It's usually much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Weird, frequently embarrassing mess from Jim Henson and some very strange bedfellows. Henson's previous fantasy film, `The Dark Crystal,' was arguably the best one of the genre yet made at the time of its release, and this one brings in Terry Jones as writer and George Lucas as executive producer. At the time, this congregation of talent must have been very exciting, but man, what a movie they came up with.The Henson touches are unmistakable--the design is staggeringly beautiful, the goblin mazeworld appealing and believable, and the dark philosophical edges thought-provoking and frightening. The style at first suggests the Terry Gilliam of `Time Bandits,' but I was reminded even more of the fantasy/horror Europes we've seen in Dario Argento's `Suspiria' (at times the score even sounded, appropriately enough, like Goblin) and Neil Jordan's `The Company of Wolves.'Unfortunately, the movie is never sure whether it's for very small children, slightly bigger children, teenagers, or grownups, and for every one good idea there are at least five dopey, witless gags. `The Dark Crystal' had the courage to tackle this difficult genre with a Tolkien-like poker face, but Jones's screenplay is a grating, simpering bore--consistently silly without ever being funny. Henson apparently didn't approve of the script, and the animosity between director and screenwriter makes for a nightmare of shifting tones. We keep waiting for `Labyrinth' to get funny, but it never does. Or we keep waiting for it to drop the schtick (Sarah's existential encounter with the Junk Lady, e.g., provides a glimpse of what the whole film might have been like), but it never does. I have no idea how much involvement Lucas had (he's clearly in `Howard the Duck' and `Willow' mode here), but, sadly, Henson has to take the blame--after all, it was the notorious perfectionist himself who made the final call (in theory, anyway). And by the time we reach the chaotic, incomprehensible battle in the goblin city, you'll wonder how anyone involved could have greenlighted this rubbish in the first place.As for the acting, Jennifer Connelly has rarely been worse (and that's saying a mouthful); she pouts and shouts her way through her role as if she were a Muppet herself. Bowie's certainly an exciting choice for Jareth, but he's another victim of the tonal seasickness, and his non-sequitur songs haven't dated well. (And for decency's sake, couldn't they have given him some proper trousers?) Hoggle is well-conceived, but Ludo is right out of `Sesame Street' and the faux-Elizabethan twit Sir Didymus is one of the most excruciating puppet characters of all time. The Muppet extras are at their best when they're being surreal (the `Helping Hands' section comes to mind), but mostly they're just loud and violent and irritating. It's like an episode of `The Muppet Show' minus the irony and satirical wit.Experienced in the right mindset, `Labyrinth' can make for some hilarious fun, of course. It's got the same ratio of bad-to-good ideas, and the same insane puppet freakiness, as its infamous contemporary `Troll.' It's got one horrible performance by a teen actress who went on to become a big star, and another by a noted wack-job rock star in a punk hairdo and an obscene outfit (and with plenty of awful songs). But `Labyrinth' enjoys a cult following of serious fans that transcends camp, and someday I'd love to have somebody explain to me why. 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did I bother watching this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mainly, because of David Bowie and his music. Well, the problem is, that while Bowie is great as usual, he and his songs have nothing to do with this picture. It's just as if this film had a different soundtrack, and then George Lucas said:"Hell, this won't sell. Let's add Bowie's music, this will make his fans happy." Well, it didn't. I quit on the 47th minute, knowing there is more than half left. What a waste of Henson's animation studio talents. What a waste of Bowie. Oh, yes, I forgot! Jennifer Connelly... not worth mentioning. 4/10</fullReview>

Maybe I didn't love it after all.I do believe if you watched this film when you were wee you would like it. It's all good family fun. Girl has to babysit her pest of a little brother... she's into magical fairy tales etc... she rattles off some old saying and the Goblin King (Bowie... which is just too mental!) comes and takes him away to his magical castle in the middle of a maze.I would recommend this if you've got kids etc.... but not one for an adult to sit and watch, you'll just start pulling at all the plot holes and the whole thing will unravel.Poor 4/10 for me..... sorry :-) Dave</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the chance of walking randomly through a labyrinth and hitting upon a plot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Bowie is the Goblin King. No, really. He is. That's what I like about these goblins. They're broad-minded. They don't have the ridiculous restrictions of human monarchies, which tend to insist that the royal family be of the same species as its subjects. The goblins don't even insist that their ruler have the same ontological status, since they choose a celebrity who exists in the real world to rule over fictional goblins.Something is deeply wrong with this movie. Here's the story: Sarah, forced to baby-sit, remarks out loud that she wishes the Goblin King would take the child away. So he does. Moreover he lets Sarah know that she must rescue the child by midnight or not at all. (How's that for an arbitrary plot device?) So she sets off through fantasyland, collects more sidekicks than you could shake a stick at, confronts the Goblin King, et cetera. According to the screenwriter, after she steps into fantasyland (that is, after filming began), they sort of made up events as they went along. Surprise, surprise.There are a lot of great muppets along the way (conceptual drawings were by Brian Froud, who also did "The Dark Crystal"), but the strain of pretending that the film's going anywhere begins to show. But the true failure of invention is saved for the very end. Just in the nick of time, Sarah makes it through the Labyrinth to see the Goblin King in the flesh - and it's David Bowie. It's as if he's tonight's special guest star on "The Muppets".Sorry. They needed a story. They needed it even to make the art direction look good - which seemed to be their primary aim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE most dated movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don't get the praise for this movie. While the STORY itself is intriguing it's more than made up for by the worst performance of Jennifer Connelly's career, the horrible soundtrack, David Bowie, and the special effects. Fairy tales need to be told in a timeless classical way, not the incredibly dated, late 80s movie we have going on here. I only had to watch a few minutes of it to know it was made between 86-89 because the special effects were just so fake. The story is timeless; the movie itself is not.It's okay to appreciate a movie's writing or characters, but to ignore Jennifer Connelly's terrible, wooden performance is unacceptable. The soundtrack is not good, period. Even all the muppet singing scenes fall terribly flat. They're not funny, or amusing, or story progressing, and sometimes(the scene with the men tossing their heads around) actually hurts ones ears to listen to. It's understandable to have nostalgia about this movie, or to like the writing(story, NOT dialog, yuck.) or some of the characters(Hoggle) but to say it's a "good movie" is preposterous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never watch a film like this on drugs. I did and I've never fully recovered from the experience. For a start there's a fox riding a dog which leads your mind spiralling out of control as you repeat to yourself over and over, "But a fox IS a dog, a fox IS a dog ? and why can't they BOTH speak? One of them speaks, so they BOTH should be able to speak BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH DOGS." Then there's the little man-thing in a hat who you think is Danny De Vito or Dudley Moore or somebody, but then it hits you it's not a man at all, but a puppet. But then you realise it's not entirely a puppet, but a sort of puppet/man hybrid with the body of a man and the head of a puppet which makes you wonder whether it IS Dudley Moore after all. So you fast forward the tape to see if it is Dudley Moore, but then you can't find his name on the credits and by the time you've rewound, all you can think is, "Hang on, this isn't Arthur ? what the hell's going on?" Suddenly David Bowie appears looking like Tina Turner from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and you keep wondering why a kid's film has turned into an advert for Bowie's giant penis; but before you can answer this Billy Crystal's turned up (I think), and Bowie's walking on the ceiling talking to a baby who's attached to the bloody wall.I will never watch this monstrous, kaleidoscopic horror show of a movie ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Labyrinth is one of those rare movies that manages to get everything wrong. The writing is horrid; the environments (which should, given that this is a fantasy film, be colorful and interesting) are filled with boring brown colors. The music in this quazi-musical is so bad, that is nearly comical. Even David Bowie fans will cringe in disgust during some of his numbers. Furthermore, the story makes very little sense; I suspect even toddlers would be able to find plot holes. Finally, the acting stands out as the worst aspect of the film. During the film's title sequence, when Jennifer Connelly's name appeared, I thought that perhaps she would be able to carry the movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. I know the material she had to work with was god-awful, but her pathetic over-acting made David Bowie look like Tom Hanks.I know this is a children's film and that many adults, remembering the wonderful impression the movie left them with when they were kids, consider watching this movie for nostalgic purposes. I have only one word for these people: don't. Don't ruin your childhood memory of this movie, because the only way you'll enjoy Labyrinth today is under a mind-altering substance. (And even then you still might not like it.) 1/10</fullReview>
