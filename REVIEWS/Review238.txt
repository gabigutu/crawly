		<shortDescription>Extremely Valuable and Gripping Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I moved to Hollywood in 1989. My first experience with Scientology rank-and-file was seeing crowds of Sea Org teenagers milling about Hollywood Boulevard in their fake naval uniforms. I was like, what is this? The Navy docked in port? Uh, no, the port's 25 miles away. Halloween is two weeks away, so what is the costume party all about? Scientology had a lot more members then, so there were dozens of these people wandering around, trying to look important and accomplished. All of them probably under 20 years old. They all looked like children playing dress up. I just smirked and shook my head. It was a combination of hatred and sadness that I felt for these poor children. Many times later on, passing the by the Scientology "Testing Center," I got hit up on the sidewalk for a free "personality test," or maybe it was a "stress test" by that point, I can't remember. I took one look at the zombie-like girl with the plastered smile, and just laughed. I wanted to tell her, I see right through your lousy sales technique. That smile is not real. You're miserable. You're trying to sell books and register new members and are failing miserably. I wish I could have helped her. I wish I could have told her, you know, it's okay to be grumpy. It's okay not to smile 100&amp; of the time. We're all humans and we have emotions. That's just how it is. I can see somebody being grumpy especially doing the job that you're doing. You think Scientology works somehow? You're trying to audit away your emotions? That means you're attempting to audit away your humanity.Years later, I started running into several books laying bare the psychosis of L. Ron Hubbard and his army (sorry, navy) of hypnotized, brainwashed robots. Then I started to get mad. Mad that this organized fraud mafia masquerading as a religion existed and there was apparently no way anyone could prosecute them for their crimes. Then, when the internet became a thing, the word began to spread far and wide about the ongoing criminal activities of Scientology. Human trafficking, kidnapping, slave labor, espionage, wholesale fraud, negligent homicide.With Going Clear, the true facts about Scientology are going to be revealed to the public at large. Many people watch HBO. The scales are going to fall from their eyes. So many people in the public probably don't think much about Scientology, and if they do, they think of it as that wacky alien worshipping, e-meter using religion that Tom Cruise belongs to. This film will change that perception. There are a lot of shocking facts here, and Oscar winning documentary film director Alex Gibney delivers them in a stunning presentation. The film just flew by. I was on the edge of my seat for a lot of it, and I knew most of the story.Just to add, as a long time Scientology watcher (I have never been a member, but living in the proximity of their facilities for years I can't help but see them around from time to time), very little of this was new information to me. But the way that Gibney presents things using the language of film is powerful and engrossing. For people not versed in the subject, this is a fantastic primer on the madness that is Scientology. The approach of having people tell their personal stories, mixed in with archival footage, really humanizes the film.Gibney has a lot of ground to cover. He takes a look at the life story of L. Ron Hubbard, a lot of his lies and crimes, the founding and rise of the Church of Scientology, Hubbard's death and the dictatorship since that time of one David Miscavige. The film also explicitly calls out the two highest profile Scientologists, John Travolta and Tom Cruise, and accuses them of culpability in the large range of abuses that the Church perpetrates on their low level staff, who get paid 60 cents an hour.There are just so many bizarre tales, wacky stories, unbelievable occurrences, that a two hour movie is not enough. (Would you like to hear about the time that Scientology tried to take over the government of Morocco?) But it is a stunning introduction that touches on a majority of the important points. The life of L. Ron Hubbard alone could be great material for a lengthy TV series lasting several seasons about the long strange life of a sociopath, at least as watchable as Breaking Bad if not more so, except the stories would all be true events that actually happened.If you are one of those people that dismiss Scientology as just a bunch of harmless idiots, I urge you to watch this film and get the real story of what a dangerous, power mad organization Scientology really is. You won't regret spending the two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's about time the truth of what goes on in Scientology behind closed doors is revealed in a mass media format. This documentary has opened up the flood gates, so all of the world can hear first- hand from ex-members what this cult is REALLY all about. Believe everything you hear and see. The abuse is completely accurate. Sea Org members (staff) are slaves and at the whim of their sadistic masters...anything goes. I know this first-hand; I was one of their slaves. This documentary is a must see!This movie lays out and proves through engaging interviews with disaffected members that Scientology is like any powerful organized "religion." It's run by a few "untouchables" who hold the reins to all the power. Those few who are not held accountable for their actions, believe the human code of ethics does not apply to them. Their reasoning is the end justifies the means. To keep control, dehumanizing tactics are necessary to control the rank and file. The film plays an important role in documenting the eyewitness testimony of the many inhumane abuses that occur in this organization. Cloaked in secrecy and hidden from the light of scrutiny, the executives of this cult do as they please. The physical, mental, and emotional abuse is like a POW camp. I just finished reading the book "Unbroken" and the stories I heard in this documentary remind me of what happened to Louis Zamperini when he was under the control of "The Bird." My hope is that this film opens up a dialogue for a call to action to help those who have been at the mercy of the "few."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was involved with Scientology from 1978-1990 and encountered some of the human rights abuses that Alex Gibney exposed in his documentary. The Sea Org people, who sign Billion Year contracts, bore the brunt of the mistreatment and are well represented in this film. Most former members will know of details that were not included in the show, but the topics that became the focus received a more complete treatment as a result.The humanity of these survivors shown through in each interview and should evoke empathy in anyone willing to accept the truth in the story. I never felt that someone was embellishing or seeking attention; in fact, quite the opposite.A huge thank you to HBO for having the guts to air this and not back down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A peek behind the scenes of a dangerous cult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've all passed the well intentioned folks in the street asking if we want to take a free stress test, or a personality test. That can't be a bad thing right? In this crazy world we all want to be able manage our stress levels, or work on our character flaws in order to succeed in life. In case you didn't know the test is the first doorway into the cult religion of Scientology. Going clear gives us an insight into the founding, and the dark practices that go on behind the scenes of Scientology. Where L Ron Hubbard, was a selfish failure of a man possibly with delusions of grandeur who founded an obscure and weird religion, Going Clear reveals that the man who succeeded him after his death is a power mad tyrant by the name of David Miscavige. Using Lawrence Wright's book as a basis for the research, Alex Gibney has crafted a very engaging documentary, utilizing talking head interviews with people who have been through the wringer of Scientology cut together with archive footage from multiple sources exposing the very core of Scientology. Many of the interviewees were people that had reached the highest ranks within the organization, some of them talking very candidly about the abusive practices that they were involved with on both ends; the giving and receiving. With all this going on we also see how of millions of dollars gets funneled to the privileged few at the top and how the church of Scientology can skirt the tax laws to keep all of its ill gotten gains for itself.Of course no documentary about Scientology would be complete without commenting on it's two celebrity superstars, John Travolta and Tom Cruise. Whereas you may pity Travolta who seems to be somewhat trapped, Cruise has become quite the poster boy for the religion. Going Clear raises some important questions as to whether or not Tom Cruise is aware of the inner workings of Scientology and how much he knows about the abuses towards the rank and file of the organization.What is most frightening though is the lengths Scientology will go to to protect its image. Hubbard wrote that the church should go on the offensive against it's critics and not be defensive, and you will see in Going Clear some of the low bottom feeding tactics Scientology uses to keep the followers in line and how it seeks to control defectors from the religion. Gibney reserves his most scathing criticism for Miscavige, the man currently at the top of the religion, and no punches are pulled showing him to be controlling, abusive and manipulative. I won't spoil the scene for anyone who hasn't seen the documentary, but the psychological musical chairs game he plays with his some of his leadership gives us a brief look into his twisted mind.The only thing I wish that this documentary showed was some rebuttal and defense from Scientology members, however the credits tell us that many of the top people within Scientology, Miscavige and Cruise included were invited to be interviewed, but all declined. to be on record. This is unfortunate because it would have been interesting to see what high ranking members would say in their defense of all the allegations that Going Clear makes against them.Going clear is an important documentary in that it shows us the dangers of being sucked into a cult. Lessons from this could be applied to any personality cult religion. If you know people that are in Scientology. Maybe they have 'Disconnected' from you then this film will at least show you why your friend or family member is acting this way. Anything that helps us to understand and warn us against an unhealthy life choice is a good thing and Going Clear does just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Documentary on the "church" of Scientology and its teachings. The first half of this is all about L. Ron Hubbard the founder of Scientology. It goes into detail about his life and beliefs and how he formed and developed the "church". The second half documents how the "church" changed and grew and used mind control and drew people into its beliefs...and wouldn't let them go. It gets into detail about their two star recruits--John Travolta and Tom Cruise. Travolta gets off pretty easy but Cruise comes off as a maniac. It also has interviews with former "church" members and their tales and revelations are nothing short of horrific.Maddening and scary documentary that shows exactly what is going on with Scientology. People can say this is a pack of lies and dismiss it...but why is this so-called "church" not suing them for libel? Also the director and writer of this are former church members so they know what they're talking about. For many years I remember walking around Boston and I was approached by a handsome young man or a pretty young woman and asked if I wanted to take a "personality test". I always politely said no and went on my way. That was how Scientology used to recruit people. They always approached young men and women, got them to go to their offices (Boston had--and still has--a chapter) and started to indoctrinate them. The most disturbing thing about this is there is extensive footage of Scientology conventions that look and sound like Nazi rallies! Everyone should see this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating summation of what's wrong with this "Church"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always wondered about Scientology, and its unique approach to "spirituality." I remember clearly the Dianetics commercials of the 80s with the Volcano, and almost picked up the book once or twice out of curiosity, but never did. Oddly, it was my own experience with a cult - Jehovah's Witnesses - and my research on the internet when I left that organization that lead me to the Operation Clambake (xenu.net) website years and years ago. The revelations in this movie are not new, but they are finally out from under the cloak of anonymous postings by scared individuals. It took celebrities and defecting top officials, who weren't cowed by the church's relentless "fair game" attacks to bring all of this out in the open. That's allowing the little guys to tell their story with less and less risk. Because now that the world is watching, the church's bullying and harassing is backfiring. Watch this documentary, then read Scientology's "reactions" (which are mostly "liar liar pants on fire" and "oh he's a big stinky head, I have a picture of him holding a BEER from years ago - that's right a BEER!"), then come back and watch this movie again. And you'll never fall for a "personality test" pitch at your local mall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Done Documentary...no wonder the "Church" would be against it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this program. Who better to describe the inner workings of the "church" than former members? You can say that they're all disgruntled, and have a beef with Scientology, and rightly so. They had the presence of mind to realize what a sham it is. One estimate of the required coursework necessary to achieve "clear" cost in excess of $300,000. A true church is proud of it's doctrine, and doesn't charge members to learn about it. That fact alone separates Scientology from the mainstream religions. So the church should expect that some of the people they've scammed will eventually have a problem with it, and expose it for what it is....a business. Great job, HBO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an excellent documentary, interviewing people that have been down through the void and scheme of scientology, so it carries a lot of weight.I found it really amusing and thorough, especially the way things about the religion are explained.It provides 2 hours of great amusement, 2 hours that will consume you totally. We are all interested in learning more about the "mistery" that surrounds this cult movement,and how it has obtained so many followers, and even more the colossal fortune. Watch it, it is worth the time spent....You'll learn a thing or two about how easily a person can be manipulated...Even the smartest one of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important documentary on the anatomy of paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of documentaries about this having accumulated since the 60s, but the phenomenon is that each new documentary reveals new more shocking facts about the business and its mentality than the previous ones, apparently because the material is still accumulating. There is very much important data from earlier documentaries missing here, many key persons are left out of the picture, which nevertheless is completed by the new ones appearing, corroborating all previous testimonies. It's a vitally important documentary, most of all because in the world society we are living in today so many, if not the majority of people, are not aware that it is an age of brainwash, and they still haven't learned to protect themselves against it. What you marvel at in this documentary, which many of the participants honestly do, is that they keep swallowing the racket for years before they can bring themselves to accept that they have been swindled, in most cases of their lives, which they don't realize until their lives are lost or completely devastated. In an effort to concentrate on the good things in Scientology I wrote an article some years back where I posed the open question - what went wrong? Apparently everything went wrong from the beginning, the founder having no self-criticism and no objective distance to what he was doing, but simply himself first of all falling a victim to the delusions of his own science fiction fantasies. Of course, there must be something good in Scientology, there must be a corn of truth in it somewhere, but whatever once was good and even of some worthwhile philosophical common sense and rational wisdom was flooded by the bolting derailing vicious circle of greed fueled by unrestricted paranoia, the constant validation of which seems to be the very substance and force of the organization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Scientology before, but been awaiting this documentary for all the publicity it generated. And I wasn't disappointed. It unfolds rather slowly, but reveals details and time line of Scientology in way that makes sense for someone like me who knows little about it. I just wished I had read up about Scientology beliefs before watching, as I didn't quite understand the whole aliens reference, and sci-fi beliefs they have as part of Scientology. I wondered if this was really part of their beliefs or the documentary was exaggerating it. Turns out it's all factual! The whole of 2 hours I was just going, 'wtf?!!', and the intensity only escalates as the time line and events unfold. It was occasionally borderline cheesy, especially when the interviewee emotions seemed a bit forced. But overall, it's well written and the interviewees do a great job of narrating their experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting documentary, that should be a must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this phenomenal documentary, I sigh in relief at what I almost catapulted myself into years ago. I, like many others, was drawn to the word of L. Ron Hubbard as a young woman. What he said in his books resonated with me at a time when I felt lost in the world. Watching the documentary and what people went and are still going through makes me compare the similarities between Scientology with the failed Jamestown incident. Comparing the two in the way they seem to brainwash people into "drinking the Kool-Aid" makes me wonder that we, as humans, can be so weak minded to give-up all the things we have, for hundreds of years, tried to overcome. This documentary tells first-hand accounts of horrors that many of us now can only just shake our heads at. Most of the people in this documentary were high ranking members of Scientology and it makes me wonder, what about those who do not have the money to attain stardom or OT XV? They do tell of the situations people who go against this supposed church and again I wonder, are there members of Scientology that were once former CIA agents, extensively trained in non-bloodied torture?I can only hope that many people see "Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief" and realize that there are still "institutions" out there that can be so bold as to claim to be a church, while harassing and trying to defame former members. Scientology claims to want peace, but they are creating wars secretly, and we better wake up and see them for what they are sooner, rather than later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary is an extraordinary one, and has been attacked by Scientology for the simple reason that it exposes many of the destructive and sociopathic policies it mandates because they are Hubbard's orders, now etched on apocalypse-proof stainless steel plates.The only defense the 'church' can field is bold-faced denial and (as per Hubbard's unchangeable orders) relentless attacks on any who speak against it. It may come as little surprise that the 'church' actually provides specialized training and drills to help its spokesmen deliver blatant lies more believably.The moral justification for telling these lies is built-in to Scientology and separates it from every other 'religion' except for (predictably) Satanism, namely the fact that there is no overriding moral code forbidding murder, bearing false witness and the like.Hubbard wrote materials expressly for the public intended to give the appearance of morality and decency, but ultimately, whatever profits the 'church' is Good and whatever 'impedes' it is Evil and no holds are barred where either is concerned. The result is the nightmare that is Scientology.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HBO Documentaries are coming out of the gate swinging in 2015 and this one is no different. Doing a documentary on Scientology by just letting people who were a part of this, talk and present clippings and facts and even make clarifications of claims, for the viewer to draw their own conclusions -- well, this documentary hits it out of the ballpark. And I can personally attest that there are "two" different Scientologists. I had two different experiences with Scientology, three years apart.The first scared me half to death, when the church was on Hollywood Blvd. One of their people came up to me as I was checking out the stars on Hollywood Blvd. and asked me to take a "Personality Test". I thought it must've been a touristy thing and so I did. I thought knowing this would also be good for jobs (little did I know it was NOT that kind of personality test!) I scored very high and this blonde haired guy came out and said I "needed" to be a member. He was in my face telling me I had to pay $300 immediately. I said I didn't have that on my, that I had to go get on the bus to go to the bank and get it. I was so scared of the place and him I just wanted to get out. He said he'd get on the bus with me, go to the bank with me and stay with me till I got the $300. He said he had to because as soon as I would pay it, my life would be so much better within the Church and it would help me let 'everything go' and reach the highest level. I convinced him that I had several stops and I would be back. He finally let me out, watched me get on the bus on Hollywood Blvd. I NEVER went back, I was shaking on the bus - I really thought I was going to get violated and end up on the 6 o'clock news. I was so scared of those folks.The second time was VERY different. It was sorta a trick. A friend invited me to the "Celebrity Center" in "Hollywood Hills" for a theatrical play. I thought what the heck. When I got there, it was the Church of Scientology! I was ready to run until I met so many celebrities and musicians that evening who seemed...sane. A million times different than the guy on Hollywood Blvd. I actually told them about that. They apologized. They gave me a free book, Dianetics, asked me to read it and if I was interested, come back and they'd talk to me further- and was sure I'd be an asset (not member) of the church. I never came back, never read or kept the book, but I couldn't believe how different this was.One person, two different introductions, two 'different' Scientologies in Hollywood. My thoughts of the Church of Scientology was duel. This is what these folks believed and obviously many are treated differently than others. The documentary really goes deeper into this than even I thought I was was certain about. Never did I get that "church" feeling about the place, or "religion" and the documentary shows me, and the viewers, why. It's "money" for the top, drones for the bottom, brainwash as much and as deep for those with a lot to give to...them. Lot's of figurative "Kool-Aid" drinkers, and some who were so devoted that if offered, they'd blindly follow. Which makes Scientology more cult-like than anything else. And yes, this documentary answers many of questions about that too.Whatever one thinks, this is a compelling documentary for those who know, those who don't, and those who are still trying to figure out what this is. After this documentary, you'll know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearness may be a step towards insanity, not away from it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Gibney's Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is such a fantastic documentary because not only does it root itself in facts in an attempt to summarize the Church of Scientology, its founder L. Ron Hubbard, its rise to the mainstream, and its many controversies, but it also strips down its content to its most basic ideas of man and humanity. Gibney examines man's desire for purpose in the world, and a compelling need to feel significant in the grand scheme of the universe, whilst juxtaposing the ideas of cults and cultic imprisonment and their pursuit for those lost souls who are searching for meaning. Gibney handles all of these elements extraordinarily well, and gives us the rare documentary where we emerge with an immense amount of new information and have a takeaway theme to attach to it all.Going Clear is divided into three specific acts: the first concerns high-profile celebrities who were once a member of the Church of Scientology before leaving, such as Spanky Taylor, Paul Haggis (director of 2004's Crash), and Jason Beghe, the second concerns L. Ron Hubbard's life and how the publication of his bestselling book Dianetics led to the creation of Scientology, and the third act shows the church's notorious allegations for abuse, harassment, and misconduct, most of which perpetuated by its current Chairman David Miscavige.This structure, and Gibney's liberal two hour runtime, allow for the church to be explored not only in a sense that adheres to and respects chronology, but allows for surmounting tension to build from a pacing standpoint. By the time the hour mark rolled around, I was completely immersed in this story, going from knowing relatively nothing about the church, remaining blissfully ignorant, to becoming hungry for more information. A great deal of this lies on Gibney's structure and depth of research, all of which churns up confirmation through news articles, fact checks, and testimonies from primary sources, but another portion is thanks to his presentation, which is reliant on suspense and gradual tension in a way that makes the documentary interesting rather than manipulative.The interviews with former church members also do an exceptional job at detailing the church's different levels of involvement in Scientology, as well as their methods, demystifying what we've heard in the past and cutting through lingo to give us digestible information. For example, we learn that Scientology is rooted in condemnation of war, insanity, and criminality, imagining a world where everyone is a like-minded, mentally capable individual that can't be compelled to carry out such senseless violence. There are people known as auditors, who help people allegedly detect the mass of their own thoughts (something science has yet to prove) and have them discharge their emotions to make them in a complex state of human realization. Auditors use devices known as "E-meters" to help achieve such grandiose ideas, working with a machine that's part lie detector in the way a small needle glides through a scale of numbers, again, allegedly detecting brain activity and thought mass.The more Gibney paints Scientology, and the more ex-church executives, members, and officials discuss it, it all seems as if Scientology is unproven "pseudo-science" that operates with cult-like devotion in the way it sucks people, particularly the lost and the wayward, in young, works to make them see that they have a purpose, and fighting to keep them loyal to the church at every cost if they dare try and leave. Other interesting elements of the film come in the detailing of Hubbard's life, as we hear from accounts of his wife that he was emotionally abusive towards her, as well as money-hungry, essentially creating a religion to gain an income and not be burdened by governmental tactics. These documented pieces of fact are enough to turn any potential Scientologist away from the church and never look back.But why, Gibney asks, do celebrities like John Travolta and Tom Cruise, as well as hundreds of thousands of other individuals willingly flock to read Hubbard's teachings and hear Miscavige's fiery sermons if all these ideas circumvent into unsubstantiated assertions and the religion's creator has enough dirt on him to be labeled a phony? Again, it all comes back to the idea of man seeking a purpose in his life, which Gibney bravely articulates. We hear people like Beghe, Taylor, and Haggis talk about how all they wanted when they were young was a sense of life that the world had yet to provide them, and took pride in Scientology's teachings of such complex, human ideas that were foreign to them. It wasn't until they witnessed numerous acts of abuse and cruel manipulation for themselves that they made the decision to leave the church, many of them still being harassed by Miscavige's watchdogs to this very day.The final main idea of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief I have yet to present is the one proposed from its title. The concept of "going clear" in Scientology refers to the alleged erasing of one's conscious, which, in a Freudian context, where Scientology seems to get a lot of its ideas, means erasing all traumatic events, suppressed memories, and crippling thoughts from one's head. This state of "clearness" allows for a person to function unburdened by past experiences and look forward positively in a new way unheard of prior to being introduced to concepts of Scientology. If this was the weirdest idea spoken about in Going Clear, it would still be a documentary well worth seeing, but the fact that it digs well beyond the surface and explores the subject with an unforeseen level of depth makes it a truly fantastic piece of documentary filmmaking from one of the finest living documentarians today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listening to many of these folks seems almost like listening to POWs talking about their life during internment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago, the folks making the film "The Master" hinted that it would be an exposé on Scientology. Unfortunately, by the time the film was ready for the theaters, it was a washed out mess that seemed to have nothing to do with Scientology in the least and I have no idea what the actual goal of the film actually was. Rumors were that the filmmakers buckled to the usual litigious reaction from this 'church'. Fortunately, the folks who made "Going Clear" were never so timid. Their documentary is tough, fair and fascinating and doesn't pull its punches.The documentary is exquisitely crafted and presents its case in the destructiveness of Scientology. While I am sure members of this organization will refuse to watch it and denounce it, the film appears fair and could have made many more accusations (such as a few suspicious deaths never mentioned in the film). It also consisted mostly of disaffected ex-members discussing the organization's shortcomings. Some of these were just your average members but many were also among the highest ranking members. There also are LOTS of these folks, so it's not just one or two angry folks but quite a few people in the know discussing a 'church' which uses many unsavory and illegal tactics. What they are and how destructive the organization is you should see for yourself. My job is just discussing the quality of the film itself. And, in this sense, the documentary is exceptionally well made--professional, well presented and utterly convincing. This is THE exposé to see on this disturbing group and its leaders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was all True from my Personal Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say it was very emotional to watch and that everyone's testimonies of their experiences in the Org rang completely true. My son was whisked away in the middle of the night on his 18th birthday with promises of money, fame and a career and what ensued for him was more horrific than anything they mentioned in the documentary. It took a year for my son after "escaping" to even talk about what happened and he is still recovering and in therapy 4 years later. I tried in vane to get him out including working with a cult expert, the church cut off all contact with us and I could not even talk to him or contact him. FYI, my son has a genius IQ and he was living with his Dad (my ex) at the time,who became a devout member of the church after our divorce and complicit in the "brain washing" of my son. I am hoping this wonderful and truthful documentary will help others escape and/or never get involved with the Church of Scientology. My son tells me it ruined his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The work speaks for itself. The individuals interviewed portray the deep level of discourse wrought by the Scientology tyranny. With moments of horrific reality, the tone of the documentary is one that will likely make you question your sense of moral duty to prevent such modern day enslavement from even being possible, and likely cause you to rage in compassion and sympathy. Shame, while clearly evident in the candor of the interviewees, hones in the true condemnation forced upon them, their children, and their humanity. Watch it, open your eyes to the gravity of the situation, and absorb the truly empowering sense that people can rise to the occasion and fight for what's right, regardless of the likelihood of reprisal.Side note: You may need this link after you watch it.https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/revoke- scientologys-tax-exempt-status</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Pied Pipers Of Deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing I am quite clear on is that Scientology ain't no religion. In their teachings I see no heart, no soul, no humanity, no softness. All I see is technique. Gurus are rewarded with power and money.The movement was founded by a science fiction writer named L. Ron Hubbard, who enshrined his 1950s self-help fad, called "Dianetics", into a self-proclaimed religion that he renamed "Scientology". Fast-forward sixty years and Hubbard's "religion" has morphed into a billion-dollar business headed by an allegedly manipulative, controlling madman, surrounded by star celebrities and a hoard of brainwashed, but wealthy, individuals who should know better.The purpose of this pretentious clique seems to be to turn every member into a cash dispensing zombie, incapable of critical thought, and existing to service the financial and cheer-leading demands of its arrogant, elitist leaders, pied pipers of deception and delusion. One of the scariest segments shows a huge audience of followers giving a thunderous, standing ovation to their leader as he spouts out his victory over the IRS.The only difference between these followers and those of Jim Jones' Peoples Temple is that these people are not destitute or uneducated. But they still have willingly forfeited their independence, some too weak ever to escape the group's dogmatic belief system.I felt a bit sorry for John Travolta as presented here. He comes across as a person who has been blackmailed into silence by the "church", to preserve his public image. He can't leave or speak out. Tom Cruise is much scarier. He comes across as pompous, certain, and invincible. His obvious power to influence and control is frightening.Technical quality of this documentary, comprised largely of contemporary interviews and archival footage, is very good, though I could have wished for screen information, like names and places, to be in bigger letters. For example, I had to squint to see the names of people being interviewed. Music is appropriately low-key.One thing this program tacitly pounds away at is the gullibility of insecure people who will believe almost anything pushed by a charismatic messenger. "Going Clear" offers an enlightening exposure of an organization that seems to meet all the criteria of a cult. I just hope the endgame here is not another tragedy comparable to that of Jim Jones and the Peoples' Temple. Heaven only knows about private Scientology tragedies that may lie hidden from public view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gutwrenching Truth That Was Bound To Come Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Dianetics many years ago. I was intrigued by the Basic Auditing, which is something you can do with anyone and does offer a process for draining the emotion from remembered experiences. I found that simple process very powerful. I took a basic ethics course and as mentioned in the documentary I felt some relief from learning simple tools and being taught simple things like always looking up a word that you don't clearly and truly understand the definition of. Those were all very useful things. I can see why people get attracted into Scientology as I myself was. But from there I tried paid auditing and found it completely not useful and it felt like the person doing the auditing wanted it to be something else... it was weird. They still owe me money lol. I tried to take another course to use my unused credit that they would not refund to me but they wanted more money. I got a used book somewhere that was a higher level book I think and it was so bazaar I was taken aback and did not go any further though I did try to figure out if anyone understood anything beyond programmed ideas or they had any other useful tools that I could use my 'credit' for. They just stopped responding to me which was probably a good thing. For a church with so much money, you would think they could pay you back for services not rendered :) I am glad that these people came forward. I think this is a powerful documentary and I hope that it will prevent the cult from growing any further. In my view it is a great shame that tools that are useful to people should be tied to such a freakish institution. And this demonstrates that any doctrine that requires that you disconnect from people who don't agree with your beliefs is definitely hiding something and is threatened by truth.</fullReview>

We were basically kicked out for asking simple things like, "why are there triangles on all of the doors and promotional materials?" They refused to answer. Since then, I've always thought they were weird. But WOW they are beyond words. They lock people up for threatening to give away their secrets, but what will they do once the masses see this film?? This documentary makes me wish for an end of the cult of scientology. I refuse to capitalize the name because it is not a religion. It's all made up by one guy who was obviously insane.

		<shortDescription>Scientologists will be shocked also at these revelations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scientologists are not allowed into the Sea Organization management bases and the locations are kept secret from them. The Sea Organization is it's own (communist) culture. They frown on the customers (Scientologists) as "dilettantes" . They also surprisingly, feel they themselves do not need the Scientology they sell. They have a "no case on post" policy where they are expected to not have the problems Scientology is peddled to resolve.The one huge outness though in the documentary, from my viewpoint, was within minutes of the movie starting, Lawrence Wright translates Dianetics and the beliefs as a person having two sides of a brain. One reactive and one analytical. I realized there he had never even read the Dianetics book. There are no such theories as that. I was kind of disappointed about that because I realized if there were any Scientologists out there watching, they might discount everything else in the movie. And this, you know for me was the elephant in the room.Woman narrating that was supposed to be Hubbard's ex wife talking gossip. But she never spoke out or up while she was alive. Made me discount that too. That devalued the film a bit. Fortunately, the testimony given by Mike Rinder, Marty Rathbun,Silvia, and Tom Devoght brought the film back into focus with something real and believable with their testimony.I was disappointed that Karen De La Carriere was not in the film, especially towards the end when I realized there is more vital information about the Church of Scientology on her you tube site (Surviving Scientology) than this documentary produced by HBO.At the end of the doc Larry Wright says what he really wants is for John Travolta to leave the church. Not sure why he is that emotionally invested with Travolta, seriously. That was a little creepy. The few celebrities in the Scientology crowd, added to the Sea Organization (The leader's private crew) amount to less than 1% of the Scientology population. It seems to me the leader is the one that ought to leave the Church, with a police escort.The good news is, they really captured the church leader David Miscavige at his finest self-promoting, gloating, narcissistic, dastardly, lying manipulative self. They translated that beautifully. This documentary is a miracle to have come into existence when you consider the wall of secrecy surrounding that place, as it is against their religion to disclose information to the "outside" world and means the Scientologists will be expelled if they do. This is what the film makers were up against. This is written in their codes, the code of silence! It is also against their religion to co operate with the demands of civil law or to rat out another Scientologist.This is directly from their ethics codes book. These are "suppressive acts" which are grounds for expulsion: "Suppressive Acts include public disavowal of Scientology or Scientologists in good standing with Scientology Organizations; Public statements against Scientology or Scientologists. Testifying hostilely before state or public inquiries into Scientology. Reporting or threatening to report Scientology or Scientologists to civil authorities. Bringing civil suit against any Scientology organization or Scientologist including the nonpayment of bills or failure to refund . Delivering up the person of a Scientologist without defense or protest to the demands of civil or criminal law.The above"religious codes" enable the self appointed "leader" or, as he refers to himself, "The Pope", to engage and carry out all criminal acts with the full support of his members. I do think this is valuable information that should have and could have been in the film. Considering these codes, the film makers pulled off a miracle producing what they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always thought Scientology was a pretty wacky religion. Yet, I never saw it as a cult. What made interested in this movie was a south park episode. It talk about how scientology was just a global scam and they were called a "religion" because they wanted to avoid taxes. What Scientology is based off a book called Dianetics. A man named L. Ron Hubbard wrote it. It became a NY time's bestseller. This book claims, "It is most accurately described as what the soul is doing to the body through the mind." Also, if you pay a small fee, you can take a reading. This will you if you are depressed or not. If you are, with another fee, you can take a body reading. They use a machine called an E-meter. They ask you very personal question telling you to "confess your sins". People paid money and "claimed" they felt better. By doing this, you are saided to be "cleared". As you progress through the movie, Scientology slowly took the formation as a scam. They were able to call themselves a religion so they could avoid paying taxes. They created many levels of "cleared". People do many things to become cleared. They would spend a lot of money for these sessions. They even devoted themselves to L. Ron Hubbard and the church. People working there got paid .40 cent an hour. Also, they allowed themselves to go through harsh body treatments to be "cleared" at a higher level. When people got into high levels of "clear" they were able to access these documents. Basically said earth was a prison of soul. Every human have these imprison souls that created fear and depression. Then, people realized how much a cult this thing really is. People started to leave and exposing what happened to them. The media caught on and Scientology people are leaving quickly. I feel sorry for the people who followed Scientology. They are not bad people. I think for them, they just felt so good to tell the auditor all their wrongdoing. They want to be forgiven. Also, when people see other people getting better, they want the same thing. They believe in that so much that they believe whatever the auditor says to them. The people who accepted the interview told all the horrible things that they did and was done to them, I respected. Even though they scammed other people, they accepted that they were tricked and they tricked other. The also feel bad and admit they were idiots, I respect them for not blaming it on something else and they try to help other to realizing the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amazing and thorough documentary that puts a human face on both the leaders and victims of the Scientology movement. After a detailed biography of founder L. Ron Hubbard, we meet several former members and learn of their experiences inside the church as well as their efforts to leave. This is a compelling and disturbing portrait of an organization that is desperate to retain their privileged tax-exempt status while building an obscenely large reserve of cash and real estate. The frank and sometimes self-effacing comments of former members shed an unflattering light on the efforts of the Scientology church to reign in members who question the motives of leader David Miscavige. Fear, blackmail, lawsuits, physical abuse and harassment of family members are all weapons in their efforts to keep the membership in line. The most damning evidence comes from Scientology's own memos, writings and training manuals.The videos of Scientology members Tom Cruise and John Travolta shilling for the organization are nothing short of startling. Cruise comes off especially condescending and arrogant.My only complaint about this film is that no one from Scientology responded to requests to appear and defend their organization. While not surprising, it would have been interesting to hear something other than the terse denials issued through their lawyers.Also, a personal note to the filmmakers: The titles and written descriptions in this film are far too small for an average sized television. I found myself having to sit right next to the screen to read them.</fullReview>

During the entire movie I was shocked to hear and see how the formation of a so called "religion" is comparable in so many ways to the movements also found in fascism. The way in which a cult can become so powerful and misleading is scary and frightening and should be questioned in all ways possible. Knowing that this is of course a commentary and therefore opinionated, I never the less find the information given appalling and through the diversity of evidence also a believable fact that the scientology is a cult and should be revealed for its true nature.

		<fullReview>An in-depth look at the inner-workings of the Church of Scientology.Before entering this documentary, I knew only the most basic things about Scientology. Some of the more questionable aspects I had seen on "South Park", and they are largely confirmed here by far more reputable sources.Scientology is an interesting doctrine because it purports to be a religion (though no one knows why), but also mixes in pop culture (Travolta and Cruise) and covers a nice period of 20th Century history (and now 21st Century). Other religions have been around long enough to build tradition, but Scientology is still remarkably new -- we are witnessing its infancy.Here we get to the bottom of it, warts and all. Probably more warts than anything else. How can this be tax exempt? How can some of these people not be in prison? My goodness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I've been familiar with Scientology for many years, I had no idea of the depravity they incorporate every day in the name of their religion, until I saw 'Going Clear' on HBO.Mr. Gibney &amp; Mr. Wright have done a public service with their work and are to be commended for being willing to present the truth about an organization that is well known for attacking, in legal and illegal ways, anyone who criticizes them. HBO is also to be commended for airing 'Going Clear'.A very telling example of how Scientology operates is their unprecedented demand to every media critic they were aware of reviewing 'Going Clear', to publish a statement from the church regarding its position on the film. Fortunately, to the best of my knowledge no reviewer complied with the church's demand.In the best case scenario, the film will result in governments around the world repealing the religious tax exempt status Scientology currently holds. And, celebrity endorsers like Cruise &amp; Travolta will realize the damage they have done and disassociate themselves from Scientology. 'Going Clear' is an excellent film that exposes Scientology for what it truly is. A must see.</fullReview>

I know that most documentaries to some extent does this, and it is impossible to be objective. Still, the eerie music, the zooming in on Hubbard's face, some of the reconstructions - all of this makes me feel that I'm being told what to feel.

		<fullReview>Growing up in New York, I walked by the people selling Dianetics in various subway stations offering free tests all my life. Then later a center was built in New York and that really got me wondering just who these people are and what their goal is.Now that I have seen this excellent documentary, I get it, and it is really quite terrifying to know just how much power they have amassed. Just within the first 30 minutes you will understand how a man like L. Ron Hubbard who started out writing sci-fi, went from that, to being a functional paranoid schizophrenic within a very short time. His goal, to write a book, make some money from his lies, and then try to get his non sensical book called Dianetics get some followers so he could classify it as a religion and in the process hope to dodge Taxes legally.Sadly gullible people who were lost ate it up more then he ever imagined and this terrifying cult was born and has been chugging along ever since.The documentary lays bare all of the terrifying aspects of this cult, and what I was most curious about, just how they heck they managed to get classified as a religion by the IRS. The coercion they used will astound you at how they got around the IRS and essentially brought them to their knees after L. Ron Hubbard spent years hiding from them because his so called organization had racked up a 1 billion dollar tax penalty.there is little doubt by the time you are done watching this, that no one stays because they want to, they stay because Scientology has the goods on all their members through extensive notes and files. Dare to leave and they will expose you and make your life a living hell. Anyone who has had the courage to walk away should really be applauded, because the tactics they use are appalling, dehumanizing and straight out of a mafia text book. The fact that the FBI and the CIA, with the IRS have not completely destroyed this organization from the top down is baffling. These are organizations that have taken down organized crime, governments, and other numerous activities including actively monitoring us as citizens, and yet these frauds are allowed to chug along and continue their criminal activities. This is a must see documentary that will make you angry, confused, and appalled at the level of gall it takes from Scientology to believe its a religion. Truly amazing, and well worth watching!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Insightful Look into the Power of Belief and those who Wield It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alex Gibney's 2015 documentary on the Church of Scientology provides an accurate and unforgiving depiction of the organization's heinous acts of exploitation and cruelty. The film goes beyond simple news stories and speculations, and instead examines the organization through the lens of its founder's history and the anecdotes of former members. It then combines these stories with hard evidence from government and media investigations, and in doing so it paints a critical and horrifying picture of the misused power behind the Church.On a superficial level, the documentary appears to simply be revealing the crimes of a religious leadership, yet the film also embodies a deeper conversation of the control belief can have over humans. As the title suggests, Scientology has found a way to take the power of belief and fashion it into a prison, with which they can trap their unsuspecting members. One of the former practitioners' more common reflections is that they couldn't fathom why they continued to wholeheartedly support the Church despite the myriad of human rights abuses and exploitative practices among them. Arguably the most chilling moment in film is the commentary on what members of the Church have dubbed "the Hole". This facility is used by the organization to punish executives who cross David Miscavage (the Chairman of the Church of Scientology), employing an array of tactics ranging from physical abuse to musical chair games with an added component of psychological torture, all while repeatedly berating the detainees for their inadequacy. Perhaps the single most thought-provoking moment of the film was when one of the interviewees declares that even if the FBI had stormed into the Hole whilst the detainees were mopping up the bathroom floor with their tongues (an task which captives of the Hole were often forced to execute), no one would have taken the chance to leave. This demonstrates how the "prison of belief" erected by the Church of Scientology has been used to force its own members into voluntary agony, not to mention the far more common instances of members being cheated out of their money and separated from their children.Though Alex Gibney rightly holds back no punches in his critique of Scientology, one can't help but wonder if there is a broader conversation to be had on what constitutes as a religion and the role that governments should play in protecting people from their own faiths. The Church of Scientology has eluded charges for its criminal actions largely due to its recognition as an official religion by the IRS. Not only does this exempt the Church from taxes (despite the fact that the organization doesn't fill many of the non-profit criteria of religious institutions), but it also allows the Church to protect itself from criminal charges under the broad protections of the First Amendment. Since the Church of Scientology is recognized as a religion by an official government body, they have been able to use the First Amendment in numerous court cases and trials. Many have called for the government to relinquish its recognition of the Church of Scientology and subject the organization to the proceedings it deserves. Although this would certainly hasten the end of a terrible institution, it also would've been interesting if the documentary commented on what exactly constitutes as a religion and whether the government has the right to punish a religious institution for selfish wielding the faith as a weapon. Some comparisons with other traditional religious would have also been interesting, with an analysis of how other creeds differ and resemble the Church of Scientology and its exploits. Alas, there is only so much that can be covered in a two hour documentary, so perhaps this is a topic better left for another film.</fullReview>

Ron Hubbard. Celebrity members such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise are also featured extensively.It's interesting that so many get sucked into this nonsense, but what many reviewers are failing to note, is this religion is no different than any other. It gives misguided people a false sense of direction. It only sounds insane because it's a fairly new religion. If Christianity, Judaism or Islam were suddenly invented today, they would seem every bit as insane and cult-like.In the end, it's a must watch for people, but it would be nice if people kept in mind that all religion is garbage and are simply money-making avenues by charlatans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's crystal clear: it's time to dig deeper into what Scientology is. This HBO documentary was pretty good insight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people might have heard about Scientology, but I really doubt, many of them, truly knows what it is. Based on Lawrence Wright's novel, with the same name, Director Alex Gibney's Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, gives its audience, an inside glimpse, within the super-secret powerful religious organization. Without spoiling too much, the film chronicles most of the history of Scientology, starting with its founder and leader, pulp fiction writer, L. Ron Hubbard and his interest in the occult. It then moves and shows, how L. Ron Hubbard created Dianetics, a set of ideas and practices regarding the metaphysical relationship between the mind and body. After that, it shows how Dianetics turn into a religion sect, while getting hounded by the IRS for tax evasion. It wasn't until 1993, that Scientology out-best the IRS in legal-battles, and re-won their tax-exempt standard. Lastly, the film exposes the modern history of the Church, with its massive abuses of power, blackmail, violence and extreme greed. It's pretty clear, that the documentary presented, really did its research, and provide a lot of damning evidence of examples of corruption, within the religious sect. They made sure, that everything was correct, because the Church of Scientology is notoriously litigious. Very rigorous, face-checking, here. Most of these information is coming from, high ranking ex-members, such as Marty Rathbun &amp; Mike Rinder &amp; Tom De Vocht. Due to that reason, it's really hard, to proof that these extreme corruptions didn't happen for any Scientology defenders. As of this writing, for the first time, in their history, The Church of Scientology isn't fighting hard, against its attackers. There hasn't been massive 'fair game' attacks, so far, besides, calling the documentary, one-sided misrepresented, untrue witch hunt that didn't show anything good about the religion. Yes, probably somewhere out there, actor Tom Cruise is probably jumping onto his couch in anger, because what this controversial HBO documentary by Alex Gibney is saying about Scientology, but for the most part, key members have mostly stay quiet. It's pretty clear, by now, that Scientology might not be the bridge to total freedom. One thing, I didn't like, about the documentary, is how much information, they didn't use or mention. Some good examples are the deaths of Lisa McPherson, Noah Lottick &amp; Elli Perkins. It's seem a bit odd, for the documentary, not to mention, Scientology modern day-leader David Miscavige's wife being missing for the last several years, now. I would have, thought they would add that in. There is no mention, about the group's negative views of gays &amp; lesbians or the controversial belief held by Scientologists, that the practice of psychiatry is destructive and abusive and must be abolished. I'm surprise that they didn't ask, ex-member, Kate Bornstein about those questions. While, the movie does focus, a little bit on the celebrity side of the religious sect, mostly talking actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta. I'm astonish, by the lack of detail, about Tom Cruise's relationship with the religion, since he's pretty much, their poster boy. There was no mention of his marriage to Katie Holmes. There is no mention of why and how he join. Barely anything on the guy. I'm surprise, the documentary didn't mention any of the other current key celebrity members like Kristen Alley, Nancy Cartwright, Jenna Elfman and others. I'm also, pretty shock that the movie didn't get, many big name, ex-members to interview. It would be nice to see Leah Remini, Neil Gaiman, and Lisa Marie Presley talk about their time, there. There were also a few others speakers that I would love to hear, but most of all, I wish, they mention, author William S. Burroughs's time with the group. The movie makes good use with the talking heads that they got for the film. I love the use of archive footage, current main stream music and dramatic reconstructions. The best, re-dramatic sequence had to be the musical chairs scene. It was scary to watch. Another hard to watch, scene was the whole "Nazi symbolism" in Scientology's 1993 "The War is Over" rally in Los Angeles. It was very pseudo-fascist and very surreal. The religion is even, scarier that it has paramilitary unit call the Sea Org, and they look like SS uniforms. I like that, Going Clear merely uses Scientology as a lens by which it examines the depths of human psychology. Although modern life seems to pose an infinitely complex array of problems, people always join organization as a way to deal with these problems. They want to either desire to be control of their own life and be controlled by others. This documentary is a good example of that Orwellism like mentality. Despite, all this fear, I found nothing in this documentary, to be too shocking. After all, you find extremists in all historical records or cultural references of any religion. While, I'm not suggest that Scientology is evil, but I do believe the religion of Scientology is deeply flawed. It just need some reform, like every other religious organization, out there. After all, all religions started out as a cult. Some of them, start out, historical, very greedy and corrupted. While, the film can be a pretty depressing sit. The idea that Scientology can no longer has the ability to instill fear in defectors as it once did is good news. It's seem like change is indeed, happening, within its ranks. So, maybe one day, Scientology wouldn't seem so strange or alien-like. It would be, a lot cheaper, and friendlier. Who knows, it might be as common as the Abrahamic religions, one day! I can't hate the religion, just because it's strange. After all, people do have the right to believe in what-ever, nonsense, they want to. So, overall: Check the movie out. It's pretty interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am as I'm sure many others are, intrigued and also bewildered by what I hear about Scientology and for many years since the so called religion has made its way into the pop culture of everyday life have found myself keen to understand more about what on earth gets good old John Travolta, Tom Cruise and many other high profile figures so gosh darn excited about "clear" minds and dominant overlords. Thankfully prolific documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney is on the case with Going Clear.Working in partnership with HBO (when don't they produce the goods?) Gibney has crafted an incredibly well put together and insightful documentary that pulls no punches in it's often scathing look into the mind of Sci-Fi staple L. Ron Hubbard and his creation of Scientology and later on the dealings of his understudy David Miscavige. Gibney has gone to great lengths to uncover video footage, documentation and a raft of ex-members into his film and what's presented before the viewer is a wealth of easy to understand snap shots of the wealthy movement that for people like me acts as a shocking examination of an incredibly off the rails organisation of tyrants and manipulators.There seems to be still much mystery that surrounds the dealings of Scientology and Gibney understandably can't get to the bottom of every back room deal and shady operation, yet there's enough in Going Clear to make it abundantly obvious that there is much wrong with an organisation that fears not to ruin peoples life both financially and spiritually and is in fact based around the mind of a man with a highly questionable mental state. The most incredible titbits of information that stems forth from Gibney's investigation all occur from the varied ex-communicated members of the church and their brutally honest memories of their time in the fold of the organisation is revelatory in more ways than one. The accounts these people make about the moment of realization that they've been duped is often gut punching stuff.To the point and perfectly constructed, Going Clear is the quintessential expose of Scientology and a must watch for anyone with even a passing interest in the organisations dealings or for fans of quality documentaries in general. For anyone that may have no bad words to say about Scientology, this will come as an almighty wake up call.4 overlords out of 5</fullReview>

While the subject fascinates the masses of non-members, this two-hour HBO documentary based on Lawrence Wright's 2013 book GOING CLEAR: SCIENTOLOGY, Hollywood AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF doesn't really offer an overwhelming amount of new insight that the media hasn't already covered or that its critics haven't already satirized.

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finished this movie with more disappointment than revelation. Maybe it's because I live in the UK - where several other programmes about Scientology have aired throughout the years. But this film didn't really tell me anything new. Some of the Hubbard stuff at the beginning was interesting, (struck me as a sociopath) but it never really seemed to get to the nub of the issue. And at the end of the day, despite perhaps the intentions of it's leader, Scientology sure does seem to behave like most other religions in the world. I mean the Catholic church introduced confession as means of collecting more money. What in the world is different between that and Scientology fleecing it's participants for audits and larger levels? Yes, it does have that niggling problem with what exactly it's about - but if your stated goal is making individuals better, one at a time, through what is basically a psychoanalyses process, that must suffice. And that's the part that no one seems to point out - that essentially this is a religion at this point. A deeply screwed up, hypocritical, often abusive, religion - just like the rest of them. The other bit that was missing is asking the various interviewees just what it was that they either WERE getting or thought they were getting out of it. Because these people were in it for decades - they obvious did think they were getting something out of it. AND - a truly unbiased mind would have to ask if perhaps they actually DID get something out of it. Despite some pretty horrific stories of manipulation and abuse at the Gold Camp, these people are not crying wrecks of humanity. Quite the opposite - they seem like quite centered and clear individuals. Rathbun actually left and set up an independent auditing service (which is why the church hounded him so harshly and for so long) and yet the film actually left that bit out. Rathbun still believes in the efficacy of the auditing process. So it wasn't unbiased enough for me and nor did it delve deeply enough into the motivations of people involved. I would have liked to see a section on what we know of brain-washing and how it compares to the auditing and general Scientology processes. I would have liked to have seen more background on Miscavige - another raving sociopathic loon. Perhaps it's too difficult to get this information still - but at this point it feels necessary in understanding what's going on with this organisation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Miscavige has spent lots of money to make this movie look biased, but the word "biased" makes no sense. You have a handful of former top-level scientologists, right-hand people to Miscavige, all saying the same things. People who spent their lives in a religion are not going to be "biased" against that religion. And what does it say about scientology that these highly-trained, highly-audited "clears" would all try to destroy the religion that made them such capable, high-functioning people? You can't ignore logic, folks. These people were high-ranking officials of the church. Even the church isn't trying to deny that fact. Why would they all be crazy enough to rebel? Did they all want to take Miscavige's place? I had a quick brush with scientology years ago. I saw an ad from the church, looking for people to translate some of their written course materials. I applied. The guy running the local scientology office offered me a money-back guarantee on a $50 course that he said would teach me how to learn things faster. I took the course and saw how they used social pressure to get "students" to praise scientology. We all had to talk about how much we'd learned that day. No one wanted to refuse to do the cheerleading we were asked to do by the super-enthusiastic instructor. It's amazing how a cunning and ruthless person like Miscavige can build such wealth with so little education. Scientology's power is a testament to raw greed and ruthlessness. I watch "Going Clear" twice. It's an eye-opener.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For anyone who has read Lawrence Wright's book of the same name from which Going Clear is based, or whoever has seen the South Park episode Trapped in the Closet, the subject of Scientology and the insane 'beliefs' of its dwindling members will have no doubt inspired many a conversation, as well as a state of utter dumbfounderment. Alex Gibney's thoroughly-researched and extremely enlightening documentary doesn't add a great deal of new information that couldn't previously be found with a few keywords in Google, but it does condense a detailed undressing of its subject into a thrilling 2 hours, and puts this dangerous cult on a huge stage for the whole world to see.Gibney seems the perfect film-maker to pull this story apart and try to examine how one book by a prolific science fiction author and his subsequent God complex managed to draw in so many to create one of the most powerful 'religions' in America. As the talking-heads tell us (spoken by the likes of former Scientologists Paul Haggis, Mike Rinder, Jason Beghe and Marty Rathbun), they were lured into the promise of complete emotional detox, achieved by undergoing a series of 'auditing' sessions, in which the subject confesses his or her sins while an E-meter monitors their emotions. To progress along the various stages of the path to total clarity a payment is required, until they've paid enough to read the truth - that an intergalactic dictator named Xenu brought his people to Earth, dropped them into volcanoes and nuked them, and the spirits of these aliens pass into our bodies which cause spiritual and emotional harm.As Paul Haggis delicately puts it as he describes reading this for the first time - "What the f**k!?". That anyone would believe this complete nonsense dreamt up by a writer of pulp fiction (never mind paying for the privilege) is an obvious topic of fascination for Wright and Gibney. To help us understand, we are given a mini- biography of church founder L. Ron Hubbard. Eerily familiar to anyone who saw Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance in The Master (2012), Hubbard was a charismatic, magnetic story-teller, but also an increasingly unhinged maniac, prone to violence and psychological manipulation, who became addicted to his new position as a prophet. Scientology was an abusive cult even at this point in time (slave labour and humiliating punishments were not uncommon), but when Scientology lost its founder, the ambitious and paranoid David Miscavige took over.This is when the church became extremely dangerous, garnering power enough to take on the IRS for tax-exempt status and win, and throw most of its high-ranking members into a set of double-wide trailers known as 'The Hole' where they have fake confessions beaten out of them and are kept sometimes for years under constant observation. It's a gob-smacking story of threats, violence and manipulation that will leave many with fists clenched, and Gibney certainly knows how to tell a detailed story at an exhilarating pace. He even manages to squeeze some sympathy out of Hubbard and the followers of Scientology, portraying the former as a man clearly degenerating into a state of complete madness as the years went by. The refusal to participate by the likes of Miscavige, Tom Cruise and John Travolta speaks volumes about this institution and its increasing paranoia, so it's about time they put on a pedestal for the entire world to see. Reports suggesting that membership numbers have dwindled to 50,000 (it was previously in the millions) means that the film at least ends on a positive note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretty-much a must-see for an insight into what Scientology really is: a small-scale latter day form of American fascism; deeply anti-democratic, militaristic, coercive and filled with endless pseudo-bureaucratic jargon designed to make its acolytes do two things: obey without question and make money for the organization. Scientology's bread and butter, its "substance" if you will, its the organizations grasp of propaganda, which it projects at all costs, from wooing wealthy celebrities to publishing misleading facts about its success in its substantial body of literature and associated pamphlets.Scientology is a fairly small organization of about 30,000 adherents, and filmmaker Alex Gibney focuses a critical eye mostly on its top operators and the reality of its business aims. Starting in the 1960s (an era fertile with cults and new spiritual movements), Scientology made its mark by charging considerably for progressive therapy with the use of an "E-Meter", a science fiction prop that does nothing, but puts the analysand in a position of confession, or rather, surveillance. People paying for Scientology are told that psychiatrists are evil, but the actual "working" of Scientology is purely symbolic; because it doesn't work and its copyright holders strongly believe in tax exemption, they eventually fought with the IRS for years to be defined as a religious group.Throughout the doco, people formerly associated with the "church" explain how Scientology is coercive and invasive, despite its marketing as a "new religion" that celebrities apparently embrace. The church is showed to use unethical business methods, conceal the mistreatment of children and use physical violence against members within a highly structured organization that mostly exists to make money for its current leader David Miscavige, a clean cut but somewhat threatening man with a working class New Jersey accent and an expensive suit.So what is Scientology? Its basically a series of study groups and workshop courses based around the writing of late science fiction author L Ron Hubbard. That said, he's not a great poet or philosopher, and worse still, he seems to have included directives for vengeful behavior toward the movements detractors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been following the cult of Scientology for years and have read countless articles and books (including the titular one) on the subject, so I was pretty excited to see what HBO would do with a straightforward film treatment. Although the film itself is well-done, well-researched and insightful, there is so much left out and what is included is often glossed over (likely due to running time issues) so the impact is rather diluted. I think that, given how much conflicting information there is on the subject and how strongly the two opposing camps feel, there is enough here for a miniseries. As it is however, the film itself is solid and informative for those who don't know much about Scientology and how it operates, and could be used as a springboard to discover more and in that sense, it succeeds tremendously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly it is a very well made documentary. "Well made" in the sense that it is not just some quick rundown of all the things wrong about scientology, but in the way of going in depth into those specific stories and those specific people who went "to hell and back" figuratively speaking. It does not just tie those people together into one single story but often picks off where one person's story left off. That kind of in-depth coverage is important in my opinion.But exactly due to doing just that I give it minus 2 stars from an otherwise perfect score: it deals with several people, most of whom are in one way or another related to showbiz and Hollywood. Sure they have suffered, but not as much as Sea Org. Not as much as those who were completely crushed by years of slave labor. It does get into that put just in part - instead it focuses too much (IMHO) on Sci's poster boys and Miscavige's odd temper tantrums and having him slap around staff. In my opinion slave labor, all those people exposed to asbestos while tearing down the Sea Org's fleet, all those working class families who fell into that pit of exploitation should have gotten much more coverage than the showbiz crowd simply because there are more of them and they suffered the worst. But as I said they get coverage too - but not on equal terms. Also I expected to see much more coverage of the Sci' infiltration of the FBI and several European institutions... which was not mentioned, like at all. Now THAT is a dangerous part of this "church" that perhaps deserves its own movie.All in all a great expose that should have aired dozens of years ago to prevent people from falling for that phony "religion" and their slave labor camps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read the book on which this documentary is based, and still I couldn't help but cry a couple of times as I watched this documentary on scientology, which contains some of the nastiest stuff I've seen. There's a classic English documentary made during the early 1980s where some top defectors of scientology appear and tell of the continuous abuse, the lies, the money, L. Ron Hubbard's life and apparent narcissism, but some of the big stuff that has happened since appear in this documentary, which is just as good, if not better.You'll get the full scientology treatment: how Hubbard made it up, how scientologists are fooled, horrendously manipulated to give up all of their friends, family and money, how the IRS was bullied into giving scientology a tax exempt-status - which means that US citizens actually pay some of their tax to subsidise scientology - Tom Cruise, John Travolta, how David Miscavige has carried the torch following the death of Hubbard, and how defecting members are hounded and treated by scientologists, by order from the very top.All in all, this is a very keen eye on the organisation that is actually dropping in terms of number of members, but still owns so much real estate and land that they make millions off it. This is a good eye-opener on the real dangers of scientology.</fullReview>

Now I'm not a religious person by any means, but it seems that with this particular religion, too much power/control is in the hands of one particular man. And that tax exempt status the so-called "religion" was after seemed to be the biggest reason founder Hubbard desperately wanted the cult to become classified as a religion in the first place-??

		<shortDescription>A documentary about what is hidden to us about Scientology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going Clear, directed by Alex Gibney, is a documentary about Scientology, revealing what is unknown to most of us. Xenu, the dictator of the "Galactic Confederacy" 75 million years ago brought people to Earth, as a prison, stacked them in volcanoes, then killed them with hydrogen bombs. Scientology's scriptures show that thetas (immortal spirits) of these aliens are within us, humans, causing spiritual harm. This is the foundation of Scientology, that most people find it crazy that people would believe in this so called "religion". Throughout this documentary, Alex Gibney uses factual evidence and personal memories from ex-scientologist to discover what makes Scientology so different from any other religion. This documentary starts off with the fundamentals and history of Scientology. It was founded by an American author L Ron Hubbard with the release of Dianetics. This was an explanation to auditing, where a counselor would get rid of your negative emotions associated with a traumatizing experience, by reliving that experience. His main teaching was that Scientology teaches us that we are immortal beings who have forgotten their true selves. Scientology drag you in, with the first test free, but start requesting money for the sessions. The more you do, the more money it will cost you. They use an e-meter, which calculates the level of thetas throughout your body, and the whole point of these sessions are to try and get rid of your thetans. The higher you progress, the more information is given to you about the secrets of Scientology, such as the secrets of Xenu. Sooner or later, people realize what Scientology really does to you. Only a few have, and have been able to escape it but there are many consequences for those actions. There is a disconnection policy, where if you know anyone who is skeptical or doubtful about this religion, you are obligated to disconnect from them. For the ex-scientologist, it has caused their whole family turning their backs on them. Most of the ones who realized what Scientology was really about, and who were able to escape have lost all their family because of this. Scientology manipulates is followers, to drown their bank accounts. They use this type of addiction mixed with consequences, policies and blackmailing to access your money. For members of the Sea Org., a branch of Scientology, they have been manipulated to give up everything they have to be apart of Scientology, and torture them and use physical abuse for their own benefit. When I started to learn about this 'religion', I thought it was a joke but as I started to read more about I realized how legitimate it was. It was only after I watched this documentary that I discovered the truth about Scientology. They didn't just tell us the information and the statistics but showed using ex-scientologist and live footage. It made you connect personally with the documentary and the life-style of people who still believe in such absurdity. Throughout this documentary, Alex Gibney exposed the truth of Scientology and the schemes that they have been pulling on everyone. It is a fantastic documentary that does not just regurgitate the information given to them, but puts it in context to connect empathically with the viewer. It also reveals the true essence of Scientology and how they came about to be so successful. No matter what you believe in, I strongly suggest this documentary. Alex Gibney has managed to direct a documentary that is not only factual, but connects with the viewer on a deeper level. The use of emotional connections and interviews with ex-scientologist really helped demonstrate the casualties that this organization is creating, on an emotional or physical level. I would rate this 10/10 without a single doubt. This is one of the most interesting and thought provoking documentary you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scientology is a controversial, albeit not overly well-known topic in today's society. Many people ask if it really is a religion, and different answers appear. However, one thing is for sure?it confuses people. However, this confusing nature makes it, in a way, appealing. This is because people are interested. They want answers to their questions. This is what Scientology preys on.Going Clear, a documentary by Alex Gibney, is not meant to be an exposé. Instead, it is meant to give insight on what Scientology is about in order to quench the aforementioned confusion. The movie begins with many voices describing their experiences with Scientology. The sheer amount of voices is overwhelming, and in my opinion, really gives background to how many people were into Scientology. Throughout the course of the movie, many people give their insight on the topics of Scientology, and their relationship to the self-proclaimed religion is also mentioned so that the viewer can connect to them. The documentary starts off by talking about L. Ron Hubbard, giving background context to his life. The details of his life were shocking to say the least. With an abusive relationship with his wife, as well as constant threatening, emotional manipulation, and lies, his background is destructive and honestly scary.Wanting income, he created a religion, or what some people consider to be a cult. He called this religion Scientology. In this religion, people believe that people are "asleep" and they need to "go clear" by awakening themselves. To awaken, they go through auditing sessions, which are meant to help clear their traumatic experiences so that nothing is left in their unconscious. However, the sessions cost increasingly much, and slowly force oneself to reveal secrets so that they can be "relieved" of them. However, as they keep on paying more and more to Scientology and go deeper and deeper inside the ranks, they learn more and more about "Lord Xenu" and some of the more sketchy parts of Scientology. However, they can not leave the religion due to the secrets they revealed during the auditing sessions. If they do leave Scientology, they are threatened with these secrets for fear of them being released. The movie encapsulates the mental trauma people have gone through because of Scientology in an unbiased and concise manner. Both horrifying and genius, this documentary has surpassed by expectations. By providing insight to Scientology in a manner that can only be described as mind-blowing, this documentary allowed me to see inside Scientology and left me awestruck. In conclusion, I would rate this film a strong 9/10. With very little room left for improvement and almost no cons, I would recommend this documentary to anyone wanting to learn more about Scientology.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My summary is on the 2nd paragraph below.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the common people hear the word "Scientology," probably the first thing that comes to their mind is their stories. The fact that people in this "religion" believe in a galactic conquerer named Xenu just baffles people to make them believe how weird Scientology sounds. But in the documentary Going Clear, the movie emphasises more than the just the stories of Xenu, rather they focus on the uncanny traits that make Scientology...Different. Going Clear first begins with talking about the history and background of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. But the movie also explains how the main basis of Scientology revolves around Hubbard and his book Dianetics. The movie talks about one of the things that make people attracted Scientology, which are the personality tests. The first test is free, but as progress deeper and deeper into Scientology, they begin to come at a cost to be "audited." "tests". Auditors use a machine, called an e-meter, to track your thetan levels to see whether you're depressed or not. The movie explains that you cannot be cured immediately, but rather you have to go through many sessions of auditing to be cured from your depression, as expressed from the meters. The longer you stay with Scientology, paying them for your sessions, you progress in ranks through the Scientology community. The higher you are, you begin to learn some of the secrets Scientology has to offer. Secrets like the story of Lord Xenu and his galactic confederacy. At that point, people begin to become more and more skeptical about Scientology. The documentary explains how the church of Scientology blackmails/intimidates people to stay a part of the religion because of the secrets they told the church from the auditing sessions. It also talks about the disconnection policy, and how the church denies it exists, but the movie interviews some ex-scientologists, talking to them about this policy. It was a very emotional scene as one of their interviewers said that she hasn't seen her daughter in a very long time because of this policy.Going Clear, as of now, is probably one of my favorite documentaries. The reason is this is because they mainly "showed" the information rather than just telling it to us. By "showing" us what point they were trying to prove, helped me understand the concept a lot better. Many other documentaries just regurgitate countless amounts of facts and statistics, which really doesn't do much. Going Clear show their information which really helps the audience "feel" and understand deeply about what's going on. I also feel like the style they showed their information was very effective as well. Going Clear used a lot of information and evidence from live interviewers, and in certain emotional scenes the use of the ex-scientologists really helped explain their concept they're trying to put out. It really makes the audience think and ponder during and after the movie about the information about Scientology they tell you. I would definitely recommend this movie to literally anyone. Even if you're interested in Scientology, the movie pulls your attention in with dramatic/emotional scenes and mind blowing facts. Mr. Alex Gibney, your documentary is outstanding, I strongly believes it deserves a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scientology as Metaphysics rooted in Pseudo-Veidic Narrative.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hubbard's mouth is an awful lot like Hermann Goering's. There is a sinister dimension to the man and as for his wartime narrative as a naval character who failed to sink enemy ships &amp; subs - all very suspicious indeed. Not to mention the Sea Org trips about the Mediterranean in search of buried treasures from previous lives. Enters the notion of Hubbard as Goering's karmic extension whose job it is to make recompense attracting fascist-lite types who wish to see the world rid of certain other types - criminals, the insane, war-mongers. The curious symmetry between Scientology and NAZI motifs. The objective to 'Clear', people of their emotional baggage and the NAZI saying 'To be German is to be clear'. The problem is once he has cleared all these people they continue to obsess over him despite his descent from grace towards what we must assume was ultimately suicide. (The 'historical', Goering also had addiction issues). What if Hubbard considered he had completed the job of paying off Goering's karmic debt and simply jumped ship leaving David Miscavige - of Justice - in charge of a sort of poisoned chalice? The fact that the final prize, after going through all those levels, was a photocopied hand written set of notes of Hubbard's worst unpublished sci-fi seems to me to suggest that Hubbard's aim was to deconstruct his Church from the top down post his own demise. But how could those who 'sunk', so much into it get the idea of deconstruction as a sort of exit strategy, particularly actors like Cruise and Travolta? Scientology appears to have become a sort of closet, as in Old Mother Hubbard's 'Cupboard'. What a brilliant plot for the 'Old Man', to pull off if such was his intent. Bravo! - I say. But surely it's time to redefine the mission guys unless of course you happen to be after the assets, which at $2B ain't chomp change. But what of the Karmic implications of a smash and grab on the coffers? Team up with the Krishna Consciousness Movement for the purpose of advancing a transition to vegetarianism via a global Govinda's franchise fit to take on McDonalds - why don't you? Or what about Sea Org responding to the crisis in the Mediterranean by setting up a civil relief navy? Don't just let the entire edifice come tumbling down for no good reason. Lessons in clarity are expensive you know. Ask any recovered alcoholic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reinforced what I already knew about Scientology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film just this evening. Having read a lot about Scientology in the past, &amp; also seen quite a few interviews with their leaders &amp; followers, I already had a reasonable knowledge about Scientology, &amp; this film mostly just reinforced what I already knew.What I have always found strange about "The Church of Scientology" is that it calls itself a religion, &amp; many of its buildings can be seen in the film, having Christian-style crosses atop them - yet I've rarely heard any Scientologist even mention the word "God" or "Jesus Christ". It is perfectly true what one of the interviewees says in the film - that if you were to ask any mainstream Christian what their basic beliefs were, they could probably state all the basics in a couple of minutes - yet it would be difficult for most Scientologists to do the same thing, because the real basis of their beliefs does not get revealed until one reaches the very highest levels of Scientology. It has always therefore seemed to me that Scientology is more like a "philosophy" or "life-style" than an actual religion which believes in God, or a god. However, Scientology has obviously been successful in convincing the US government that it IS a religion, because the US government has now granted it tax exempt status as a religion.While Scientology does practice "disconnection" - the "shunning" of those who leave the "religion" (even family members) - it would not be the first religion to do so. Jehovah's Witnesses also practice shunning (they call it "disfellowshipping"), the Latter Day Saints (Mormons) also practice it, &amp; even the Amish &amp; similar Christian denominations also practice shunning of those "full/baptised members" who leave the religion.Many years ago when I was a university student back in the 1980's, I can recall encountering Scientology people on the streets of the city where I attended university. However, I did not really understand who they were, back then. Of course, they were offering people their free "personality test" &amp; one of the last questions they asked me, after I agreed to do the test, was something like, what was the most important thing for me in life. I think I recall saying something like living a good &amp; enjoyable life &amp; being happy. Of course they then said to me "we can help you with that" &amp; asked me to come to their office where they could give me more information. However, I got the impression that no matter what answer I had given them, they would have told me they could help me with it. I went to their office, where I spoke to another person &amp; completed another questionnaire &amp; was then offered the chance to purchase the "Dianetics" book. I politely declined their offer &amp; went on my way. However while there, I happened to notice another person in their office (who had taken the "personality test" like myself) who was from the same university college as myself. But he was "giving them heaps" &amp; telling them what a load of rubbish all their "Dianetics" was! I must say, I do find it hard to understand why so many celebrities in particular seem to "fall" for Scientology, which is like a form of psychology in a way, but whose methods have in no way been scientifically proved. However, Scientology does seem to treat celebrities very differently to the way it treats its "regular" members.All in all, I thought this was a good film, &amp; most people who do not currently know much about Scientology will probably find it very interesting &amp; revealing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stands well enough on its own, but also a great companion piece to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOING CLEAR: SCIENTOLOGY AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF is directed by Alex Gibney and is based on the book by Lawrence Wright. While it doesn't really replace the book in any meaningful sense, it was a great companion piece that filled in a lot of gaps that a book was never going to fill anyway. Among these significant additions were archival footage of Scientology gatherings and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as interviews with many of the key people who provided anecdotes for the book. I suppose the edge that the film has is in being able to actually go behind the scenes with a look at how Scientology operates. Even still, the book goes into far more detail than the film had time to do. As for its documentary qualities, I thought it was well put-together, as is to be expected from veteran documentarian Alex Gibney. The interviews were sufficiently interesting, alternating between talking heads and archival footage. A couple of the crazier moments were courtesy of Tom Cruise, shown in one clip fervently saluting a portrait of Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The film even manages to tug at your heartstrings as the discussion moved to the Scientology policy of disconnection, and one former member recounts her daughter saying that she would have to disconnect from her. And of course there were all the tales of abuse at "The Hole" perpetrated against the Sea Org, the Scientology clergy. All together, it paints a very dark picture of a religion that uses fear and intimidation to keep its members in line while, at the same time, catering to its celebrity members' whims. I would have liked a little more general discussion about religion and how belief is used to control people, something that is touched upon a little bit towards the end, but for what it's worth this film does a great job exposing Scientology for the fraudulent scheme it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Going Clear" manages to reveal disturbing things about Scientology and gives a glimpse of the snake oil salesman persona of Hubbard. When I watched it, a part of me wondered "how could people be so gullible or in need of fellowship that they would succumb to this regimented, oppressive program of mind control?" But, who am I to stand in judgment? Many sincere, interesting people seek freedom when they enter. Soon enough, they find they're required to climb a convoluted road towards enlightenment. In the meanwhile, they have to pay through the nose for the myriad of coursework.The film shows that even the power-players faced harsh consequences for what was deemed as disobedience. The footage of the large upscale Scientology galas reveal a cult-like fervor. It becomes clear that if you're a big celebrity willing to share your experience, the organization exploits you like there's no tomorrow. I had read several books on the subject prior to seeing the movie. I recommend Lawrence Wright's book. Another one which is extremely well-researched is by Janet Reitman. The film contains a few moments (visuals and music) which bordered on gimmicky eerie entertainment value. Seeing as this is a documentary, it just wasn't necessary. Several of the interviewees came across as self-consumed and less convincing. If the filmmakers would have interviewed a few current members, it would have provided more balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understanding Scientology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I knew the basics about Scientology, I've never really had an understanding of it. Every account of its origins and operations are clouded with such bias that it's difficult to wade through the facts and myths. Granted, they're still shrouded in secrecy, with controversies we'll never know the complete truth for, and Alex Gibney's Going Clear reportedly doesn't cover any new ground but instead reveal prove-able testimonies through the perspective of ex- Scientologists complete with artistic license. With this documentary I felt I finally understood the allure of Scientology. Much with other religions, its ideologies aren't supposed to be taken literally, but I can see how their ideas can be therapeutic and encouraging to live a happy life. It's just unfortunate all the things that come with it, especially in the way the religion is such a trap, and ostensibly it's only gotten worse with time. Its victims have my sympathy, and its leaders have my contempt. The grand events thrown during conventions are deeply disturbing, even if it wasn't to celebrate their sickening tax exempt status. The documentary has a compelling juxtapositions with the vibrant presentations such as the corporate videos and the twisted darkness that lay beneath. It is refreshing to know that most Scientologists reject that alien backstory to Earth, but it still feels like they fell afoul of an elaborate pyramid scheme. The insights from ex- members in Hollywood are often the most interesting parts of the documentary, including director Paul Haggis, but the origin scenes of founder L. Ron Hubbard makes the whole thing feel like a joke for a scam that never ends. Paul Thomas Anderson may deny it, but he perfectly captured it with The Master, even with the casting of Philip Seymour Hoffman. The second half of the film spends a lot of time targeting famous Scientologists John Travolta and Tom Cruise and while I completely agree that they should be pressured to give the church up for the sake of others, I empathize with their situation. They're oblivious to the horrors, so completely blind and they've only had doses of the best of the church, which any powerful organisation could provide religion or not. Why would they turn their backs on something that's been so good to them? It's a tough moral scenario and one which a relatively small if powerful documentary won't persuade their stance. It's an expertly crafted documentary, as always expected from Alex Gibney, who last impressed me with The Armstrong Lie. He may be greedy with taking all the best topics but he does the best job. Can't wait for his Steve Jobs film coming out later this year. For now, this is the first great film of the year.8/10</fullReview>

That just makes my blood boil.It is also sad to see so many people sucked in and then forced to stay in against their will.

		<shortDescription>Undeniably engrossing and too shocking to ignore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many can agree that religion stands tall as one of the most controversial topics, and has been since the beginning of time. When engaging in crucial conversations about religious beliefs with your family, friends, or anyone in general; topics like Christianity, Atheism, Buddism, Judaism, or any other religion may be brought up. Then there is the newly found Scientology, a religion found by L. Ron Hubbard, a World War II veteran who journeyed from a lonely military deserter to a highly persuasive leader of this mysterious religion in which many including government officials describe as "corrupt", "strange", or "sinister", too many words to name at the top of my head. Based on the religious practices by the church and the belief system as a whole, it's not too difficult to see why people would conclude to such opinions like these. This jaw-dropping documentary directed by Alex Gibney paints a vivid picture about the works and practices in the Church of Scientology. It begins with a biographical study of L. Ron Hubbard from his tumultuous relationship with his first wife Margaret Grubb, to the finding of the Church of Scientology in the early 1950s, to the rise of followers who worshiped Hubbard as a treatment to mankind, to the morally corrupt practices during the continuation of the church years after his death of a stroke in 1986. The film includes various interviews and news clips by L. Ron Hubbard and the church's chairman David Miscavige as well as some notable celebrities like Paul Haggis, director of the 2005 Oscar winner 'Crash' and actors like John Travolta and Tom Cruise who've risen as some of the most recognized Scientologists in America, and perhaps the world. It is a gripping documentary that shows that sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.This film is more likely than not what I would call somewhat unrealistic if it were made as a suspense thriller. However, this picture is not anything fiction. This is not a documentary dealing with some tragic historical event or a particular individual, it is a documentary dealing with something a deeply corrupt organization that's operating for the past six decades and is still going on today. Diving into crucial aspects such as L. Ron Hubbard's motivations in the foundation, church's abnormal practices by the followers, the various court cases conflicting with the church, and the overall belief system of the Church that sound more like elements of sci-fi flick; this film does not shy away from details or does it try to meander crucial facts, though some may argue that Alex Gibney aims for a bias direction. The further the film ventures through these spine-chilling topics, the more it captures your interest as it progresses, you become hungry for more and more information as the film goes on. Throughout the two hours, you can't help but think about actors like Tom Cruise and become pessimistic about how it could affect his life and possibly his career judging by how the Church of Scientology, according to many, manipulated him into divorcing his lover Nicole Kidman because they saw her as an enemy, though Cruise himself disclaims this. It also makes you wonder about how they played in role in the split between him and his wife Katie Holmes, although the documentary surprisingly never covers this.The Church of Scientology has been involved with crime, espionage, privacy violations and other heinous acts to protect their beliefs, and the law enforcement has tried time and time again to put a stop to their behavior but have struggled due to the interference by the freedom of religion of the first amendment. From then on, the controversial lifestyle of the church has continued and have intruded with other businesses and organizations including the legal system. The more you learn you about this, the more infuriated you feel about the unsettling influence it has on the members of the church, particularly on John Travolta and Tom Cruise who once held Hollywood's most crowd-pleasing image but experience a decline in their reputation for their involvement in the church. Viewers may ask why do they just leave, from the information the film gathers, leaving the church is nowhere near as easy as one might imagine. In fact, it is one of the most dangerous situations a member of the church could make. The church does not accept leavings of the church very well and enact heinous retaliations of those attempt to do so, hence the subtitle "Prison of Belief". According to CEO David Miscavige, a member is either full into the church or not in the church at all.Going Clear: Scientology and The Prison of Belief is a highly engrossing documentary of one of the most controversial organizations in the world. It is a film that is destined to leave viewers swallowing and engage in deep conversations long after the credits roll. This is by far one of the most thought-provoking and important documentaries everyone needs to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Scientology as a documentary subject, you pretty much know what you're in for. Not like there's a lot of love outside of Hollywood for these people. This isn't going to be a love fest. Even still, "Going Clear" goes to some pretty shocking places. Abuses of its members, unscrupulous scare tactics, a hard-on for aggressive litigation; doesn't sound like much when you read that, but it's the frankness of the testimonies from former members that really make it frightening. This is beyond scathing.The movie's kinda silly when it's about L. Ron Hubbard and the iffy beginnings of the cult/religion/what-have-you, but once it gets to Tom Cruise's involvement in the organization, Scientology just becomes a dark and twisted snakepit of paranoia. David Miscavige, the head of the church, is a true-believer of the scariest kind - only, whether that's in the philosophies that Hubbard espoused or the thirst for tyrannical power is anyone's guess. No one wants to be on that guy's bad side.This is some sinister stuff, but also utterly fascinating. Not sure it's something I want to sit through again anytime soon, but it's highly watchable from start to finish.Definitely recommended.7/10Seriously, you have to wonder what kind of dirt they have on these Hollywood stars (Cruise, Travolta) to keep them towing the company line like they do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you wanted to know about Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism. You might go to a church, temple or mosque and speak to a cleric or preacher and ask for more information. They would probably give you some leaflets and pamphlets. If you were interested in converting they would ask you to attend some talks, visit some classes so you will learn more.With Scientology, it will cost you hard cash. Want to know more? We take Visa and Mastercard.Of course Scientologists are more subtle at first. I first encountered them in adverts in computer magazines for Dianetics. Where you unleash the full potential of the brain. They had a picture of Einstein in the ads.First time I saw Scientologists it was in Hollywood Boulevard. They just kind of approach you by handing out leaflets. It is the first step in getting you to do some initial audits and then sucker you into buying their books and courses. They have a big building just up the road.Over the last few years, the organisation has been criticised by ex members, ex sea-org workers who have posted their critique online and on YouTube type video sites. Scientologists so keen to go on the offensive to take down dissenters have problems shutting down people in the internet age.Going Clear was an expose of L Ron Hubbard, the pulp fiction writer who embellished his own status and started a cult and planned to make as much money as he could and keep it.It was also an unveiling of David Miscavige under whose leadership they have amassed billions of dollars in assets and tax exemption status as they are classified as a recognised religion despite the bullying tactics used against the IRS and other government departments.The key revelations are by ex church members some of them who were high up in the church, even involved in high profile smearing of rivals and critics. The dirty tricks brigade of the church is really eye popping. I am surprised the FBI have not branded them as a terrorist organisation.Of course with Paul Haggis, the Oscar winning screenwriter I knew about his public falling out with the church especially as the church is anti gay and Haggis had two gay daughters which seemed to be the source of the friction.Of course their is always the suspicion that these vocal critics have an axe to grind. They are ex members who have fallen out. Some of them lied, bullied and deceived on behalf of the church. One of them publicly denied that the church beat and humiliated people to another documentary crew a few years ago and now admits he lied.The church was given a right to reply but they declined. Membership of Scientologists is apparently falling and dissent is growing and becoming more public.No doubt that this was an interesting and wide ranging documentary, maybe a little too long. I did feel that the focus on Tom Cruise did smack a little like character assassination by using clips to make him look weird. In essence it has the problems of a lot of documentaries where you feel it was slanted to do a hatchet job even thought it was deserved in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels a bit overwhelmed with stuff to expose and, while fascinating for the 'what', loses the characters and the 'why'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early in this documentary the author of the source material (Lawrence Wright) says he came to the subject because he was interested in the people within extreme religious groups, and what drew them into such beliefs. Whether or not Alex Gibny had the same interest is not stated, but his documentary on Scientology doesn't really explore this side of the story but instead is a fairly brutal documentary on the construction of the group, which he then deconstructs through the contributions of some very senior former members.Although it is hard not to feel like the film is missing a bigger, more complex picture by doing this, it is hard to judge it for doing so, because it really does have a treasure trove of madness to pick from. The film is well structured to take us through the roots of the movement's founding, the auditing process that it uses, and then builds into the higher level information on the history of the earth, alien spirits, and other stuff straight out of science fiction (which of course, is precisely where it does come from). This is fascinating in its clarity and structure; I think most people do know that Scientology is built on such madness, but to see it laid out so clearly is engaging and enlightening. The film moves beyond this to show a movement on the offensive at any attack, and to paint a picture of abuse, sacrifice, and ultimately great wealth.John Oliver recently did a strong bit on the nonsense of the legality of religious organizations being tax exempt, and this does rather reinforce it. The testimony of abuses is more specific, and more reliant on individuals, but the film builds to it in such a way that it is very easy to accept and believe. As a piece of filmmaking it is very much documentary 101, with talking heads and archive footage, but it is very well edited together and constructed to build a case. It is compelling viewing, even if it is very much focused on exposing and doesn't do a great deal of exploring of the why's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bold Piece Of Documentary Filmmaking That Does Exactly What It Set Out To Do!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredibly captivating, thoroughly entertaining &amp; downright unnerving documentary that deconstructs the inner-working of the Church of Scientology, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is an in-depth look at its history, its rise from a cult organisation to new religious movement, its belief system, the role of celebrities who are part of it, and its long- standing allegations of psychological abuse &amp; exploitation that occur within the church.Using archive footages &amp; interviews from former Scientologists who describe their very own experiences when they were part of it, the story of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is told in three segments. The first part follows these ex-members as they recount how they came across it. The second gives a brief overview of Scientology and also skims through the life of its founder, L. Ron Hubbard. And the final act brings forth the dark stuff &amp; ruthless measures the church takes to silence any criticism.Written &amp; directed by Alex Gibney, Going Clear is riveting from the first frame to the last and only gets more unsettling as the plot progresses. While it inclines more towards uncovering the disturbing secrets of this new religion that still remains shrouded in mystery, it also says a lot about the absurdity &amp; dangers of blind faith, as evident in every religion, and illustrates how people are manipulated into joining these belief systems that promises a solution to all their problems but soon begins to strangle them with its entrapments.Although what it offers is clearly a one-sided perspective, it looks as if it's got enough data to support its claims against the Church of Scientology. Almost every argument it puts forth feels like a result of endless research &amp; extensive investigation and the various accusations made by its interviewees, comprising mostly of former members of the church, gives those existing rumours an added weight. While it certainly sheds more light on things that usually don't get to see the light of day, much of it can still be applied to every religion in existence.However, what makes Going Clear such an intriguing sit isn't the content it has in store but how all of it is presented to the unsuspecting &amp; curious audience. It's informative, in a way, to people who aren't much familiar with this new religious movement but it's also one damn good entertainment, something only few documentaries ever manage to excel at. The story also addresses the roles famous celebrities like John Travolta &amp; Tom Cruise have played in promoting the religion and the special treatment the church bestows them with in order to keep them around.From a technical standpoint, there isn't really anything to complain about this documentary. It's crafted with a razor-sharp intent, seems to have done all the background check before making its accusations, the re-enactment sequences may seem a bit exaggerated but then, it is as per the ex-members' confessions, more or less. Its three segment narrative gives it a more refined &amp; easy-to-follow structure, Editing is definitely one of its biggest strengths and the interviews with these former Scientologists is wholly engrossing. And much of it is made possible by Gibney's impeccable direction.On an overall scale, Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is a masterly crafted, cleverly assembled &amp; expertly told exposé of one of the most controversial subject matters in the present world. As revelatory as it is enthralling, this picture has the charged intensity of a thriller and considering the Church of Scientology's notoriety for filing lawsuits against its critics, it's truly a bold piece of documentary filmmaking that does exactly what it set out to do plus the blatant criticism it received from the church prior to its release only helped in providing it the publicity it required. A powerful, discomforting &amp; spellbinding work of non- fiction cinema, Going Clear comes strongly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Documentarian Alex Gibney produces a devastating investigative report on Scientology based on Lawrence Wright's book. First he lays out L. Ron Hubbard and his questionable past. It's a recitation of his poor war record, his bad marriage, his sci-fi stories and his propensity for fiction in his own life. The movie puts the creation of the religion down to a tax dodge.For the most of the movie, I find the religion being described as a money grab, soft cult. There is true ugliness in the world and this seems to be more of a middling evil. The story that Sylvia 'Spanky' Taylor tells about her child is heart-wrenching but most of the first 2/3 of the movie is reminiscent of a pyramid scheme. In fact, I thought the movie over-stepped by implying that John Travolta stayed because of the records they keep on the members. The movie has nothing to back up that claim and implying it is almost as bad as the Travolta gay rumors running on the supermarket rags.The last 30 minutes is where the true ugliness is recounted. Scientology leader David Miscavige is essentially a paranoid dictator of a vast monetary kingdom. The imprisonment and torture techniques are fascinating. It's rich material to base another movie on. This is an eye-opening look inside some closed doors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is exactly the kind of thing we need to expose the corruption in cult religions. I've been hearing about the corruption and felony crimes being committed inside the Church of Scientology for over thirty years, and the things seen in this video are no surprise to me at all.The sick twisted destruction of human character, the scaring of its members into submission, the deep-rooted evil coercion tactics and manipulation of people who leave and outside entities, and down right torture of human beings is indicative of the Church of Satan. People who join the Church of Scientology have no idea what they are getting too.With the Church of Scientology's real estate assets approaching multiple Billions of dollars, I have one question... What does that have to do with church? The fact is the Billions in assets is a fortress of protection against anyone EVER bringing the Church of Scientology down. I hope the government removes their tax exempt status, I hope the former members of the Church of Scientology sue them for billions, and I hope this video shoots up to number one and people all over the world see it, and I hope some congressman will have the GUTS to take the necessary steps to shut these people down! Side note to the filmmakers: Great job! Could you please try to do a documentary like this on the Catholic Church? Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Scientology doco is like looking into a mirror at OURSELVES !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary, was fascinating, thought provoking and disturbing - on so many levels (for me). I gave a rating of 10/10 not so much on the subject matter, even though it is presented extremely well - but because of the PROFOUND effect it had on me for many hours after I stopped watching.and this is what I experienced in the aftermath.....Am I a supporter of Scientology ? NO I AM NOT. BUT I found this documentary VERY thought provoking BUT not because it "exposes" Scientology as mind manipulators and control freaks.What this documentary (to me) clearly shows is the HUMAN CONDITION and resulting behaviors associated with ORGANISED ANYTHINGS......ALL Religions,Political beliefs and any form of culture that (as a social being) we MUST belong to......NEED TO.....not only to HAVE TO be part of something, but also to try to have an understanding of the unexplainable.Examining Scientology and the methods they employ, is JUST another look at the "tools" of mind manipulation and the extraordinary effort "institutions" will employ to maintain control of large groups of people......Are THEY any different to US ? ....for example, take Christianity back in the fun days of BURNING HERETICS - no better case than Galileo being labelled Heretic for not "fitting in" - or subjecting non-conformers to the Spanish Inquisition or Muslims attempting to Jihad the entire infidel population - now there is a bit mind manipulation and control happening there, but is it any different than the US Government and their WAR on TERROR and /or their FIGHT FOR FREEDOM or Capitalism promoted as a "freedom" hiding behind a tyranny of greed or Communism or Fascism or Nazism.....No matter if perceived as GOOD or EVIL all "Institutions" in order to flourish - have the need to engage in the murky worlds mind manipulation and control. We see this exposed in this Scientology documentary.......but WE have ALL seen this type of thing before......haven't we.Just forget about the differing individual methods employed by "organised anythings" INCLUDING SCIENTOLOGY and concentrate for a moment on the objectives......and they are are ALL the same.....mind manipulation and control.We are ALL manipulated and controlled by our own belief systems - all of which are reinforced and fed straight back to us in the form of literature, rules, symbolism and punishments......all of which are mirrored back to us in this documentary. But their "books" rules symbolism and punishments may look different to ours - but they have the same effect that you and I experience within OUR own belief system.Personally, I think Scientologists are NUTS...and scary and power hungry nuts....and then I looked around......They really are NO DIFFERENT to anybody else. Brainwashed into believing the unbelievable.....if you think about it.....The stories in the Bible, Torah, Quran are all pretty far fetched (..and on the first day there was......loaves and fishes anybody !!!....oops, where'd he go...he was here 3 days ago) - and as equally unbelievable as the rhetoric of Scientology......It's really not a stretch AT ALL - to look at how ANY Religion thrives from NOTHING in the beginning, then flourishes (through propaganda and control) to captivate millions of people and generational belief systems - no matter how bizarre the original premise may have been and on the matter of questionable methods used to force people to comply - well - Religion as well as Political and other Institutions like Capitalism and Communism ALL have there questionable methods as well as levels of corruption ALSO.This documentary (for me) was just like looking in the mirror when you are having a "fat day" - you don't necessarily like what is looking back at you.It's the price WE ALL PAY for being a social creature - to "fit in" to "conform", the majority MUST be manipulated and controlled.Otherwise we would ALL still be nomads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bait and switch - offer self help but don't reveal Xenu until it's too late</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>from Wikipedia:Xenu also called Xemu, was, according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, the dictator of the "Galactic Confederacy" who 75 million years ago brought billions of his people to Earth (then known as "Teegeeack") in a DC-8-like spacecraft, stacked them around volcanoes, and killed them with hydrogen bombs. Official Scientology scriptures hold that the thetans (immortal spirits) of these aliens adhere to humans, causing spiritual harm.These events are known within Scientology as "Incident II"] and the traumatic memories associated with them as "The Wall of Fire" or "R6 implant". The narrative of Xenu is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in earthly events, collectively described as "space opera" by Hubbard. Hubbard detailed the story in Operating Thetan level III (OT III) in 1967, warning that the "R6 implant" (past trauma) was "calculated to kill (by pneumonia, etc.) anyone who attempts to solve it".Within the Church of Scientology, the Xenu story is part of the church's secret "Advanced Technology", considered a sacred and esoteric teaching, which is normally only revealed to members who have completed a lengthy sequence of courses costing large amounts of money. The church avoids mention of Xenu in public statements and has gone to considerable effort to maintain the story's confidentiality, including legal action on the grounds of copyright and trade secrecy. Officials of the Church of Scientology widely deny or try to hide the Xenu story.] Despite this, much material on Xenu has leaked to the public via court documents, copies of Hubbard's notes, and the Internet. In commentary on the impact of the Xenu text, academic scholars have discussed and analyzed the writings by Hubbard and their place within Scientology within the contexts of science fiction, UFO religions, Gnosticism and creation myth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Whistblowing" SHOULD FOCUS on the OTness of the Org</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to fight the CoS, economically and effectively, "whistleblowing" SHOULD focus on the OTness of the Org and its incapability of forming "aware" , ethical, responsible , efficient, terminals. (and less on the "victim outcome") .. CoS failing to improve "awareness" and "ethical" conduct of dedicated terminals within its own lines.A company that sells OT "awareness and efficiency" , cannot claim to have been "unaware" and inefficient at detecting the degree of the "paranoia" of its top executives ( while promoting them to high key positions during a period of 30+ years.)Too many top executives, ( Garry, Mayo, etc, etc ) not attaining the "product" Results of effective training are also absent in sea org executives in CHARGE at present, who are shown abusing someone at LAX airport!! Where is their efficient , ethics, aethetics, and strategic "training" ? And their TRs ? ?? -----------------It's all about the uneconomic, inefficient, ineffective and unsatisfactory nature of the organization. Highlighting generalized and even specific examples of bad treatment, or worse, should be accompanied by specific statements regarding the uneconomic, inefficient, ineffective and unsatisfactory manner in which incident occurred and how The COS has always muddled along. The COS failure to achieve competence in all and every area of COS operations, including the incompetent training of virtually all Scientologists and especially Sea Org members should be described in a calm and considerate manner. The Organization lacks the confront needed to handle bad publicity, so it just insists that Scientologists do not communicate with the media. The communication course is supposed to facilitate total confront and total communication, but forbidding communication is not the answer to attacks. If in doubt, communicate. It's one of the most important Scientology principles. It is also a universal principle.All of the participants in the film, undoubtedly went nominally up the grades and were superficially qualified to hold high positions. The failure of the Scientology Organization to identify and re-train incompetent Scientologists and Sea Org staff who then leave the organization has been the universal experience of all Scientologists. It should therefore be communicated to the media on a regular basis. It is the almost total incompetence of The COS that needs to be highlighted, not just the outcomes. Outcomes have already happened and no benefit will come from moaning about them. Benefit can only come from appropriate corrective action, monitored and reported on by non Scientology auditors who operate in accordance with the International Model for Quality Assurance, Control and Management. This is an International Standard (The ISO 9000 Series of standards covering Health, Environment, Safety and Quality). the CoS doesn't do anything l because the organization has not caused itself enough pain. Like many Clears, the Organization arrogantly assumes that it is perfect when everyone in it and even out of it can see that it is failing. Failure is the most valuable experience that The COS still needs to consciously experience. Only then will The Organization get a more OT organization like the Chartered Quality Institute to provide The COS with accreditation and regular re-certification. Inside every Org, next to the bust of Ron Hubbard should be an up to date certificate from an independent and competent company. The entire purpose of Scientology, Quality Assurance, Life Mastery, Philosophy, Religion and all other honorable founded organizations is to enable human beings to be Loving, Freedom, Beauty and Ethical to self and others. There is a point at which a person achieves it for them self, which is the most effective definition of Clear. OT is when the person becomes capable and certain that they are sustaining it both self and others. There are thousands of people, both Scientologists and others, who have approximately achieved the level of Clear. HOWEVER, I have yet to discover anyone who has observably attained Total OT.The COS is a catastrophe that still needs to disintegrate until it wakes up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Documentary if you're new to anything about Scientology.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the hype behind Going Clear, I was excited to see it. Probably the worst thing to do for this Documentary is to go in with to much anticipation.There was a lot of useful information throughout the film, as well as some interesting tid bits regarding celebrities and the difference in the experience between lower level members and the super famous. Overall however, the documentary lacked any eye opening new information. For anyone who has researched the topic at all, most of what is discussed is easily accessible information.If you're someone who is very into the topic it may be a waste of time, but if you're fresh and have yet to understand the basics, seeing this film might allow you a jumping off point, to delve a little deeper. Happy Viewing!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and poorly constructed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to turn this documentary off not too far into it, but kept watching as little tidbits of information made their way to the surface. Unfortunately, again, I found myself wanting to turn it off, but instead just let it play in the background while I did some work on my research paper.This documentary is boring. All you need to do is youtube this same subject on anti-scientology, and you will find MUCH better information and much more entertaining documentary films on the subject matter.Don't waste your money. They really had a chance to gather all of the information available on the subject out there and put something excellent together. Unfortunately, it seems they spent more time and money on getting good songs for the doc rather than composing a documentary film that not only informs, but entertains as well.Boring. Bland. Bleh.Again. Don't waste your money. Youtube it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not give all sides of the story, seemed biased.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film I did not see any solid information on what's going on with Scientology right now, today. Everyone in this film seemed to have been a member years ago. Where were the interviews with current Scientologists? Also, everyone Gibney showed seemed to have an ax to grind -- ex-wives, former executives, people who ran away from Scientology, etc. If you are doing a documentary on the Republican party you would probably talk with some current Republicans, not just folks who moved on to the Democratic party or turned Independent. For solid documentary work I look for example to someone such as Ken Burns and his body of work. I have many friends who are Scientologists and I do not see in them or their lives what this film purports to show. I am open minded enough to look closely at anything before I make a decision about it, whether that be a documentary film, a religion or a political party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less of a Documentary; More of a Hit-Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the outset, let me say: I am not a Scientologist. This film suffers from a wide variety of errors, ranging from those of omission, editorial prejudice, and a surprising unfamiliarity with Scientology doctrine.The interviewees make incredible claims about their time in Scientology. One of the primary female participants essentially echos Nancy Many's narrative in her "My Billion Year Contract" memoirs. Further, the interviewees feigning shock concerning the Church's stance on homosexuality seem immensely suspect--some of the earliest books on Scientology explicitly lay out their understanding of it being unnatural-- how are you going to be involved in a religion for decades, and give tens of thousands of dollars, and still fail to read any of the religious texts, or seek out their doctrinal opinion on divisive social issues?The film is obviously well produced; but painfully lacking in value. Watch this if you consider Maury as high-brow entertainment.</fullReview>
